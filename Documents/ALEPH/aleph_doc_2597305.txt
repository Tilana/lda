Forward Looking Statements This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. All statements other than
statements of historical facts included in and incorporated by reference into this report are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the
United States ("U.S.") Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates and similar expressions or
variations of such words are intended to identify forward-looking statements herein. These statements relate to, among other things: the closing of the transaction described
herein, the anticipated benefits to us of the acquisition, including in terms of drilling location, rates of return, production and reserves, estimated future production (including the
components of such production), sales, expenses, cash flows, liquidity and balance sheet attributes; estimated crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) reserves;
anticipated capital projects, expenditures and opportunities; expected capital budget allocations; acreage or percentage of acreage that is held by production (“HBP”); future
exploration, drilling and development activities, the number of drilling rigs we expect to run, number of locations and lateral lengths; and our future strategies, plans and
objectives. The above statements are not the exclusive means of identifying forward-looking statements herein. Although forward-looking statements made in this presentation
reflect PDC’s good faith judgment, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known to PDC. The acquisition may not close in the timeframe we expect or
at all and, if completed, may not have the benefits to us that we currently expect. The Company uses the term “outlook”, “pro forma” or similar terms or expressions, to indicate its
current thoughts on possible outcomes relating to its business or the industry in periods beyond the current fiscal year. Forward-looking statements, including those regarding the
company’s outlook for future years, are subject to greater levels of risk and uncertainty as they address matters further into the future. PDC urges you to carefully review and
consider the cautionary statements and disclosures, specifically those under Item 1A, Risk Factors, made in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 and PDC’s other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (”SEC”), which are incorporated by this reference as though fully set forth herein,
for further information on risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company cautions you
not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. PDC undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in
order to reflect any event or circumstance occurring after the date of this presentation or currently unknown facts or conditions or the occurrence of unanticipated events. All
forward looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Rate of return estimates do not reflect lease acquisition costs or corporate general and
administrative expenses. 2P and other non-proved estimates of potentially recoverable hydrocarbons and EURs may not correspond to estimates of reserves as defined under
SEC rules. Resource estimates and estimates of non-proved reserves include potentially recoverable quantities that are subject to substantially greater risk than proved reserves.
