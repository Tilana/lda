News Release 
Results for the year ended 30 June 2016
BHP Billiton Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Mackenzie, said: “The last 12 months have been
challenging for both BHP Billiton and the resources industry. Nevertheless, our results
demonstrate the resilience of our portfolio and the diverse ways in which we can create value for
shareholders despite low commodity prices. Unit cash costs across the Group declined 16 per
cent and with increased capital efficiency, supported free cash flow generation of US$3.4 billion
despite weaker commodity prices. Next year, we expect another US$1.8 billion of productivity
gains as our new Operating Model helps sustain momentum, delivering more than US$7 billion
of free cash flow based on current spot prices and a forecast reduction in net debt. 
“The strength of our cash flow generation and balance sheet is reflected in the final dividend of
14 US cents per share, which comprises the minimum implied by our payout ratio and a top up
from excess cash in line with the capital allocation framework. We continue to pursue capital-
efficient latent capacity opportunities which will support volume growth of up to four per cent next
year, excluding our Onshore US assets where we continue to defer activity to maximise value. In
addition, we have progressed high-return growth projects, with investment decisions on the Mad
Dog 2 and Spence Growth Option projects expected by the end of next calendar year. 
“Over the past five years we have actively reshaped our portfolio, and we are confident we have
the right mix of commodities, assets and opportunities to create substantial value over time.
While commodity prices are expected to remain low and volatile in the short to medium term, we
are confident in the long-term outlook for our commodities, particularly oil and copper.” In relation
to Samarco, he added: “All of us at BHP Billiton remain deeply saddened by the Samarco
tragedy. The Company is fully committed to the Framework Agreement and its programs to
remediate and compensate for the impacts of the Samarco dam failure. Good progress is being
made on community resettlement, community health and environment restoration.”
We remain committed to supporting Samarco with the recovery of the communities and
environment 
Responding to the tragedy following the failure of the Fundão tailings dam at Samarco on 5
November 2015 remains a priority for BHP Billiton. Sadly, authorities have confirmed 19
fatalities, of which five were members of the community and 14 were people who were working
on the dams at the time of the dam failure. 
On 2 March 2016, Samarco Mineração S.A (Samarco), Vale S.A (Vale) and BHP Billiton Brasil
LTDA (BHP Billiton Brasil) entered into an agreement with the Federal Government of Brazil, the
States of Espirito Santo and Minas Gerais and certain other public authorities (Brazilian
Authorities) (Framework Agreement). Further details are provided in note 7 Significant events on
pages 39 to 46.
Samarco and its shareholders continue to believe that the Framework Agreement provides the
appropriate long-term framework to remediate and compensate for the impacts of the Samarco
dam failure. As set out by the Framework Agreement, a private autonomous foundation has been
created to implement the socioeconomic and environmental programs in the Agreement.
Samarco has initiated 90 per cent of the 41 programs prescribed by the Framework Agreement,
with good progress being made on most programs including community resettlement, education,
community health and compensation. 
Approximately two-thirds of the houses and buildings in the Mariana and Barra Longa region,
outside of the communities to be resettled, have been completely rebuilt or restored. Samarco
has been active in addressing the environmental impact of the dam failure. Samarco is building a
series of dykes downstream of Fundão to capture sediment and reduce turbidity. A compensation
program has been developed under the Framework Agreement to ensure affected people receive
fair and reasonable compensation. Preliminary compensation has already been paid to those
most severely impacted.

BHP Billiton Results for the year ended 30 June 2016 
Samarco has confirmed it is unlikely to have in place the necessary approvals to restart its
operations in this calendar year. While technical studies carried out to date indicate operations
can restart safely, this will only occur when stabilisation work has been completed to a
satisfactory standard and all regulatory approvals are granted and accepted by the relevant
authorities and communities. 
BHP Billiton Brasil, Vale and Samarco have jointly commissioned an external investigation into
the cause of the dam failure. Our understanding is that the findings from the investigation will be
available in the next few weeks. BHP Billiton has committed to publicly releasing those findings,
and to sharing the results with other resources companies.
The health and safety of our people and the communities in which we operate always come first 
In the 2016 financial year there were no fatalities at our operated sites and there was a significant
decrease in high potential incidents. While this is encouraging, we continue to strive to make our
workplace safer. We are replicating successful in-field leadership programs across our assets,
which delivers a structured and improved approach to in-field verification of critical controls and
safety engagement. The Group reported a Total Recordable Injury Frequency of 4.3 per million
hours worked. 
Robust free cash flow in a period characterised by weaker commodity prices 
BHP Billiton delivered Underlying EBITDA of US$12.3 billion and an Underlying EBITDA margin
of 41 per cent in the 2016 financial year, despite significantly weaker prices across all our major
commodities which had a negative impact of US$10.7 billion. 
The Group achieved US$437 million of productivity gains, or US$2.0 billion excluding the impact
of grade decline at Escondida. Further improvements continue to be realised across the portfolio
and we remain on track to deliver US$2.2 billion of gains, or US$3.8 billion excluding the impact
of grade decline at Escondida, over the two years to the end of the 2017 financial year. 
During the period, Conventional petroleum, Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO), and Queensland
Coal unit cash costs declined by 30 per cent, 19 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.
Escondida unit costs increased by 11 per cent but excluding the impact of grade decline, unit
costs decreased by 22 per cent. Historical cash costs and guidance for the 2017 financial year
are summarised in the following table: 
FY17(i) FY16 FY15 FY17e vs FY16 vs 
guidance FY16 FY15 
Conventional petroleum unit cost (US$ per barrel of oil equivalent) 10 9 12 17% (30%) 
Escondida unit cost (US$ per pound) 1.00 1.12 1.01 (11%) 11% 
Western Australia Iron Ore unit cost (US$ per tonne) 14 15 19 (7%) (19%) 
Queensland Coal unit cost (US$ per tonne) 52 55 65 (6%) (15%) 
(i) 2017 financial year guidance is based on exchange rates of AUD/USD 0.71 and USD/CLP
698. 
The Group reported Underlying attributable profit of US$1.2 billion, while the Attributable loss of
US$6.4 billion includes US$7.7 billion of exceptional items (after tax) related to: an impairment
charge of US$4.9 billion against the carrying value of the Onshore US assets; US$2.2 billion for
the financial impacts of the Samarco dam failure on the Group’s income statement; and US$570
million for global taxation matters. 
The Group continued to focus on capital productivity and exercise flexibility in its investment
program in response to market conditions, which led to a 40 per cent decline in capital and
exploration expenditure to US$7.7 billion (cash basis). Combined with the reduction in operating
costs and a targeted reduction of working capital, the Group delivered free cash flow of US$3.4
billion. Capital and exploration expenditure of US$5.4 billion (cash basis) is planned for the 2017
financial year, before rising to US$6.2 billion (cash basis) in the 2018 financial year. 
We maintained our strong balance sheet, finishing the period with net debt broadly unchanged at
US$26.1 billion (31 December 2015: US$25.9 billion; 30 June 2015: US$24.4 billion). The
gearing ratio(2) ended the period at 
30.3 per cent (31 December 2015: 29.7 per cent; 30 June 2015: 25.7 per cent). We expect net
debt to decline in the 2017 financial year from current levels.

News Release 
Disciplined application of the capital allocation framework to maximise shareholder value 
Strict adherence to our capital allocation framework balances value creation, cash returns to
shareholders and balance sheet strength in a transparent and consistent manner.
First, capital expenditure has been appropriately prioritised to maintain safe and stable
operations.
Second, our balance sheet strength has been maintained with both cash flow and gearing
metrics within our target ranges, liquidity of US$16 billion and a long-dated debt maturity profile.
Third, the dividend policy provides a minimum 50 per cent payout of Underlying attributable profit
at every reporting period, assuming our operations have sufficient capital allocated to maintain
integrity and the balance sheet is strong. In accordance with this, the minimum dividend payment
for the period is 8 US cents per share. 
Fourth, reflecting robust free cash flow during the period, the Board has determined to pay an
additional amount of 
6 US cents per share, taking the final dividend to 14 US cents per share. The Board considers
cash returns in excess of the minimum implied by the dividend payout ratio at every reporting
period. We have also continued to invest in growth and the remaining excess free cash flow of
US$1.3 billion has been directed to further strengthen the balance sheet during the second half
of the 2016 financial year. 
The Group’s productivity focus and consistent investment in latent capacity opportunities will
support volume growth in the 2017 financial year of five per cent in copper, up to four per cent in
iron ore, and three per cent in metallurgical coal. We expect growth in total copper equivalent
production of up to four per cent for the 2017 financial year(7), excluding our Onshore US assets
where we have chosen to defer development activity for value given the current low commodity
price environment. 
Strongly positioned to grow shareholder value 
While we remain confident in the outlook for our commodities, our capital allocation framework
and strong balance sheet provide us with the flexibility and financial strength to pursue a diverse
range of opportunities to create shareholder value even without a significant recovery in prices. 
We continue to make considerable improvements to productivity. The new Operating Model is
already accelerating the replication of best practices across the organisation and will support the
expected delivery of a further US$1.8 billion of productivity gains and increasing free cash flow in
the 2017 financial year. 
Capital-efficient latent capacity options could add more than 10 per cent to current production(7).
The Group has made significant progress with these options including: approval of the
Escondida Los Colorados Extension copper project in June 2016; commissioning of the Spence
Recovery Optimisation project which commenced in June 2016, additional capacity at WAIO’s
Jimblebar mining hub to be completed during the December 2016 quarter; and the development
of the Southern Mine Area at Olympic Dam which will continue into the 2017 financial year. We
will also maximise the value of our high-quality Onshore US assets in a disciplined manner as
prices recover. Our growth projects have continued to progress as planned. Board approval will
be sought in relation to Mad Dog 2 and the Spence Growth Option before the end of the 2017
calendar year. The Brownfield Expansion (BFX) project at Olympic Dam, which is part of the
staged expansion approach to approximately 280 ktpa, is now at concept study phase and we
continue to receive encouraging results from the heap leach trials which will enable growth
beyond this to 450 ktpa of copper. 
We are accelerating our counter-cyclical exploration program and plan to invest approximately
US$800 million in exploration in the 2017 financial year. In Petroleum, exploration drilling has
commenced in Trinidad and Tobago and in the Gulf of Mexico following positive results at
Shenzi North during the 2016 financial year. 
Finally, we expect technology will unlock resources and lower the Group’s cost base, with a
broad range of opportunities identified at a number of our major assets that should create
substantial value over time.

BHP Billiton Results for the year ended 30 June 2016 
Outlook 
Economic outlook 
Global growth over the remainder of the 2016 calendar year is expected to remain modest and
subject to downside risks, including the uncertain economic consequences of ‘Brexit’. World
trade is still expanding more slowly than global GDP growth, principally reflecting weak business
investment and soft demand for consumer durables. Global growth is forecast to remain between
3 and 3.5 per cent in the 2017 calendar year, while global trade should accelerate modestly. 
The rate of growth in the Chinese economy appears to have stabilised and we expect that
Government policy will remain supportive, in line with the authorities’ GDP growth target of
between 6.5 and 7 per cent for the 2016 calendar year. Over the medium term, China is expected
to grow more slowly. The Government’s reform program will improve productivity but this will only
partially offset the impact of an expected decline in the workforce and the maturation of the
economy’s structure. Reform will proceed in a cautious but sustained manner as the authorities
seek to improve the efficiency of capital allocation, reduce excess capacity in sectors such as
coal and steel while boosting the role of consumer demand and maintaining support for
employment.
Commodities outlook 
Crude oil prices fell at the start of the 2016 calendar year on growing OPEC supply, rising
inventories and resilient United States production. The market has since begun to rebalance due
to declining production in the United States, unplanned supply outages elsewhere and strong
non-OECD demand growth. While the market will continue to rebalance in the short term,
economic uncertainty and high inventory levels are likely to keep prices volatile but range bound.
The long-term outlook remains healthy, underpinned by rising demand from the petrochemical
industry, a growing transport sector in developing countries and natural field decline. 
The domestic gas price in the United States weakened following strong production and subdued
heating demand due to a mild winter. This resulted in record inventory levels. In the short term,
seasonal demand for cooling offers some price support, but high inventories are likely to prevent
significant price appreciation. Longer term, natural field decline and increasing demand
underpinned by the environmental, operational and economic advantages of gas in power
generation and other applications will support higher prices.
Copper prices continue to be affected by growing supply on the back of improving levels of
productivity and slightly weaker rates of demand growth. In the short to medium term, new and
expanded production should keep the market well supplied, notwithstanding announced cuts to
higher-cost production. Longer term, the copper outlook remains positive as demand is supported
by China’s shift towards consumption in addition to the scope for substantial growth in other
emerging markets. A deficit is expected to emerge as grade decline and limited high-quality
development opportunities constrain the industry’s ability to cheaply meet growing demand. 
Global steel production has been weak in the first half of the 2016 calendar year compared to the
prior year as most regions saw a contraction in output, with the exception of India. Chinese steel
production increased in the June 2016 quarter aided by improving construction demand,
however this is expected to soften over the rest of the calendar year. Longer term, Chinese crude
steel production is expected to peak between 935 Mt and 985 Mt in the middle of next decade.
Global scrap availability will also increase over time and substitute pig iron as a steel making
input. 
The iron ore price has trended higher since the conclusion of the Lunar New Year holidays,
driven by a rebound in the Chinese construction sector, region specific output restrictions and the
moderation of seaborne supply growth. The appetite of mills to build iron ore inventories will
remain low in the near term due to the availability of port stocks. In the short to medium term, the
cost curve should continue to flatten as new seaborne supply ramps up. In the future, the
marginal producer’s cost structure should determine the long-term price. 
5
News Release 
The recent rise in metallurgical coal prices has been driven by seasonal demand, China’s
domestic coal capacity controls and temporary supply disruptions in Queensland. Near term,
prices are expected to trend lower as new projects come online in Australia and Mozambique
and more than offset the withdrawal of uneconomic high-cost seaborne supply. The longer-term
outlook remains robust as the supply of premium hard coking coals is projected to become
scarce and demand is driven by steel production growth in emerging markets, particularly India.

Depreciation, amortisation and impairments 
Depreciation, amortisation and impairments declined by US$1.1 billion during the 2016 financial
year to US$8.9 billion. This reflects a decline in non-exceptional item impairment charges of
US$618 million in the current year. In addition, depreciation and amortisation charges decreased
by US$497 million primarily due to a reduction in the depreciable asset base at Onshore US
resulting from the exceptional item impairment charges previously recorded. 
Net finance costs 
Net finance costs increased by US$410 million to US$1.0 billion. This reflected higher
benchmark interest rates and the issue of multi-currency hybrid notes during the 2016 financial
year, and a gain on the early redemption of the Petrohawk Energy Corporation Senior Notes in
the prior period.

BHP Billiton Results for the year ended 30 June 2016 
Taxation expense 
The Group’s adjusted effective tax rate(2), which excludes the influence of exchange rate
movements and exceptional items, was 35.8 per cent (2015: 31.8 per cent). The increase in the
2016 financial year primarily reflects the relative higher proportion of profit from Australian
petroleum assets (which are subject to a higher rate of tax due to the Petroleum Resource Rent
Tax) in the Group’s overall profit compared to the prior year. The adjusted effective tax rate is
expected to be in the range of approximately 35 to 40 per cent for the 2017 financial year.

(ii) Other includes: inflation; fuel and energy; asset sales; other items. Other items includes
Onshore US rig termination charges of US$76 million (2015: US$123 million). 
Total petroleum production for the 2016 financial year decreased by six per cent to 240 MMboe. 
Conventional production increased by one per cent to 131 MMboe as new production wells at
Atlantis, Mad Dog and Pyrenees and higher gas demand at Bass Strait, offset natural field
decline across the portfolio and the divestment of our gas business in Pakistan. 
Onshore US production declined by 13 per cent to 109 MMboe largely as a result of the decision
to defer development activity in the Black Hawk and Hawkville. 
Total petroleum production for the 2017 financial year is expected to decrease to between 200
and 210 MMboe. 
Conventional volumes to decrease to between 123 and 127 MMboe due to the divestment of our
gas business in Pakistan, a planned 35 day maintenance shutdown at Atlantis in the September
2016 quarter, deferral of infill drilling in the Gulf of Mexico for value and natural field decline. 
Onshore US volumes to decline to between 77 and 83 MMboe as a result of lower capital
expenditure and development activity as we continue to balance near-term cash flow
performance and long-term value maximisation. 
The decrease in total petroleum controllable cash costs reflects: a US$365 million reduction in
total operating costs; a US$208 million reduction in exploration expense primarily attributable to
the completion of the Trinidad and Tobago seismic program and higher capitalisation rate of
other exploration spend; and a US$104 million decrease in business development. Conventional
unit costs(4) decreased by 30 per cent to US$8.53 per barrel as a result of lower lifting, labour
and maintenance expenses, but is expected to increase to approximately US$10 per barrel in the
2017 financial year as a result of lower volumes and planned maintenance at Atlantis. 
Petroleum capital expenditure for the 2016 financial year declined by 50 per cent to US$2.5
billion. This included US$1.2 billion of Onshore US drilling and development expenditure, of
which US$380 million related to a reduction in capital creditors. Our Onshore US operated rig
count has been reduced to four however completion activity in the Black Hawk resumed late in
the June 2016 quarter. 
Increased shale drilling and completions efficiency during the period was reflected in a
significant improvement in drill time and completion techniques in the Black Hawk and Permian.
Drilling times improved by 19 per cent to 15 days per well in the Black Hawk and by 22 per cent
to 26 days per well in the Permian.

BHP Billiton Results for the year ended 30 June 2016 
Petroleum capital expenditure of approximately US$1.4 billion is planned in the 2017 financial
year. This includes conventional capital expenditure of US$0.8 billion which is focused on life
extension projects at Bass Strait and North West Shelf. Onshore US capital expenditure is
expected to be approximately US$0.6 billion with development activity tailored to market
conditions.

financial year). 
Petroleum exploration expenditure for the 2016 financial year was US$590 million, of which
US$273 million was expensed. Activity for the period was largely focused on our core areas in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean and the Northern Beagle sub-basin off the coast of
Western Australia, where we acquired additional acreage, seismic data and increased drilling
activity. Our exploration activity has increased in the Gulf of Mexico following the positive
exploration well results at Shenzi North. The Group is also encouraged by early indications from
the deepwater Le Clerc well in Trinidad and Tobago which encountered gas in multiple zones.
While the focus is on a commercial oil discovery, these results support further appraisal of the
basin. We are pursuing high-quality oil plays in our three priority basins and a US$700 million
exploration program is planned for the 2017 financial year as we accelerate testing of our future
growth opportunities.

Total copper production for the 2016 financial year decreased by eight per cent to 1,580 kt. 
Escondida production decreased by 20 per cent to 979 kt despite a 28 per cent decline in grades.
Pampa Norte production increased by one per cent to 251 kt. 
Olympic Dam production increased by 63 per cent to 203 kt reflecting improved smelter and mill
utilisation following the Svedala mill outage in the prior period and higher grades. 
Antamina production increased by 36 per cent to 146 kt due to higher grades and mill throughput.
Total copper production for the 2017 financial year is expected to increase by five per cent to
1.66 Mt. 
Escondida production to increase by nine per cent to 1,070 kt enabled by the commissioning of
the Escondida Water Supply (EWS) project and the ramp-up of the Los Colorados Extension
(LCE) project, with volumes weighted to the second half of the 2017 financial year. 
Pampa Norte production to increase with the commissioning of the Spence Recovery
Optimisation project which is expected to ramp-up during the September 2016 quarter and
achieve an annualised production rate of approximately 200kt from the December 2016 quarter. 
Olympic Dam production to remain broadly unchanged from the 2016 financial year. 
Antamina production to decrease by 11 per cent to 130 kt as the planned mining sequence
moves through lower copper grades and zones of high zinc content. Zinc production is expected
to increase from 55 kt to approximately 90 kt in the 2017 financial year. 
We will continue to unlock latent capacity across our copper assets. Following the approval of
the US$180 million (100 per cent basis) LCE project, first production is expected in the second
half of the 2017 financial year adding incremental capacity of approximately 200 ktpa in the 2018
financial year. In the medium term, the Spence Growth Option has the potential to extend mining
operations by more than 50 years and increase copper capacity by approximately 200 ktpa. Final
Board review is expected in the second half of the 2017 calendar year.

BHP Billiton Results for the year ended 30 June 2016 
Unit cash costs at our operated copper assets increased by nine per cent to US$1.20 per pound
during the 2016 financial year due to anticipated grade decline at Escondida. This was six per
cent lower than prior guidance of US$1.27 per pound and was underpinned by a significant
reduction in absolute costs. In addition, Olympic Dam unit cash costs declined by 29 per cent to
US$1.38 per pound as a result of productivity-led cost improvements and a further reduction in
labour and contractor costs. In the 2017 financial year unit cash costs at our operated copper
assets are expected to decline by 12 per cent to US$1.05(4) per pound. 
Escondida’s Underlying EBITDA declined by US$2.3 billion in the 2016 financial year and
reflected lower realised prices and grade-related volume decline. This was partially offset by a
US$369 million (US$269 million post tax) increase in estimated recoverable copper contained in
the sulphide leach pad following the successful completion of the Escondida Bioleach Pad
Extension project and productivity initiatives. 
Escondida’s unit cash costs increased by 11 per cent to US$1.12 per pound. This was seven per
cent lower than guidance due to a significant reduction in absolute costs and productivity
initiatives. On a grade-adjusted basis, unit costs declined by 22 per cent to US$0.79 per pound.
In the 2017 financial year, Escondida unit costs are expected to decline by 11 per cent to
US$1.00 per pound(4) largely reflecting higher concentrate throughput as a result of EWS
commissioning and ongoing productivity improvements.

Total iron ore production for the 2016 financial year decreased by two per cent to 227 Mt. 
Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) production increased by two per cent to a record 257 Mt (100
per cent basis), as the Jimblebar mining hub operated at full capacity and utilisation at the
Newman ore handing plant improved. 
Samarco production was 11 Mt (100 per cent basis). Mining and processing operations remain
suspended following the dam failure. Sales from the final shipment of pellets were settled in the
June 2016 quarter. 
Total iron ore production for the 2017 financial year is expected to increase to between 228 and
237 Mt, excluding production from Samarco. WAIO production is forecast to increase to between
265 and 275 Mt (100 per cent basis) with volumes weighted to the last three quarters of the
financial year.
The 24 month rail renewal and maintenance program, which will support the integrated supply
chain’s long-term reliability, is progressing on schedule. Along with our focus on productivity and
the ramp-up of additional capacity at the Jimblebar mining hub, this should deliver an increase in
system capacity to 290 Mtpa in the 2019 financial year. The installation of the new primary
crusher and additional conveying capacity at Jimblebar is expected to be completed in the
December 2016 quarter, with all associated spend included within WAIO’s long-term average
annual sustaining capital expenditure of approximately US$4 per tonne.
WAIO unit cash costs declined by 19 per cent to US$15 per tonne, underpinned by reductions in
labour and contractor costs, increased equipment productivity, lower diesel prices and
consumption and a stronger US dollar. In the 2017 financial year, unit costs are expected to
decline a further seven per cent to US$14 per tonne(4).

Metallurgical coal production increased by one per cent to 43 Mt and energy coal production
decreased by 16 per cent to 34 Mt in the 2016 financial year. 
Record metallurgical coal production at five Queensland Coal mines and first production from the
Haju mine in Indonesia, offset the cessation of production at Crinum and a convergence event at
the Broadmeadow mine. 
Energy coal production declined following the divestment of the San Juan Mine, operational
rescheduling at New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) and unfavourable weather at NSWEC
and Cerrejón. 
Metallurgical coal production of 44 Mt and energy coal production of 30 Mt(8) is expected for the
2017 financial year. 
Higher wash-plant and truck utilisation at Queensland Coal will offset the planned divestment of
IndoMet Coal. On 7 June 2016, BHP Billiton entered into an agreement to sell its 75 per cent
interest in IndoMet Coal. 
Productivity improvements at NSWEC will partially offset the divestment of our New Mexico Coal
assets, with the divestment of Navajo Coal completed on 29 July 2016. BHP Billiton will continue
to manage Navajo Coal in accordance with the Mine Management Agreement until 31 December
2016. Excluding New Mexico Coal, energy coal volumes are expected to increase approximately
10 per cent. 
Queensland Coal unit cash costs declined by 15 per cent to US$55 per tonne, supported by
increased equipment and wash-plant utilisation, lower labour and contractor costs, lower diesel
prices and a stronger US dollar. In the 2017 financial year, unit costs are expected to decline
further to US$52 per tonne(4) reflecting continued productivity improvements. NSWEC unit costs
decreased by two per cent to US$41 per tonne despite lower volumes and are expected to
decline a further seven per cent to US$38 per tonne(4) in the 2017 financial year.

BHP Billiton Results for the year ended 30 June 2016 
Group and unallocated items 
Underlying EBITDA expense decreased by US$273 million to US$171 million in the 2016
financial year. The decrease reflected a US$170 million reduction in corporate overheads, lower
operating costs at Nickel West, and a prior period self-insurance claim related to the mill outage
at Olympic Dam of US$238 million. This was partially offset by weaker average realised prices
received by Nickel West.
Corporate overheads have now declined approximately 40 per cent since the 2012 financial
year. 
Resources and reserves assessment 
BHP Billiton is confirming revised resources and reserves estimates for Samarco following the
dam failure and will provide updated information in due course.

The following footnotes apply to this Results Announcement: 
(1) Underlying attributable profit, Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA are used to reflect the
underlying performance of BHP Billiton. We believe that these non-IFRS measures provide
useful information, but should not be considered as an indication of, or as an alternative to,
Attributable (loss)/profit as an indicator of actual operating performance or as an alternative to
cash flow as a measure of liquidity. In past periods we have reported Underlying EBIT as a key
non-IFRS measure of operating results. We believe focusing on Underlying EBITDA more
closely reflects the operating cash generative capacity and hence the underlying performance of
our business. Underlying EBITDA is the key measure that management uses internally to assess
the performance of our segments and make decisions on the allocation of resources and is more
relevant to capital intensive industries with long-life assets. 
• Underlying attributable profit is Attributable (loss)/profit excluding discontinued operations and
any exceptional items and non-controlling interest in exceptional items. 
• Underlying EBIT is earnings before net finance costs, taxation, discontinued operations and
any exceptional items. Underlying EBIT is reported before net finance costs and taxation
benefit/(expense) of US$184 million (2015: US$418 million) related to equity accounted
investments and excludes exceptional items of US$1,227 million (2015: US$ nil) related to share
of loss from equity accounted investments. 
• Underlying EBITDA is Underlying EBIT before depreciation, amortisation and impairments of
US$8,871 million for the 2016 financial year (2015: US$9,986 million). Underlying EBITDA is
reported before net finance costs and taxation benefit/(expense), depreciation, amortisation and
impairments related to equity accounted investments of US$476 million (2015: US$786 million)
and excludes exceptional items of US$1,227 million (2015: US$ nil) related to share of loss from
equity accounted investments. 
(2) Further non-IFRS measures are defined as follows and comparatives exclude discontinued
operations unless otherwise stated: 
• Adjusted effective tax rate – comprises Total taxation benefit/(expense) excluding exceptional
items and exchange rate movements included in taxation benefit/(expense) divided by
(Loss)/profit before taxation and exceptional items. 
• Net operating assets – represents operating assets net of operating liabilities including the
carrying value of equity accounted investments and predominantly excludes cash balances,
loans to associates, interest bearing liabilities and deferred tax balances. The carrying value of
investments accounted for using the equity accounted method represents the balance of the
Group’s investment in equity accounted investments, with no adjustment for any cash balances,
interest bearing liabilities and deferred tax balances of the equity accounted investment. 
• Underlying basic earnings per share – represents underlying attributable profit per basic share. 
• Underlying EBITDA margin – comprises Underlying EBITDA excluding third party product
EBITDA, divided by revenue excluding third party product revenue. 
Other financial measures are defined as follows: 
• Free cash flow – comprises net operating cash flows less net investing cash flows. 
• Gearing ratio – represents the ratio of net debt to net debt plus net assets. 
• Net debt – comprises Interest bearing liabilities less Cash and cash equivalents for the total
operations within the Group at the reporting date. 
(3) Represents productivity-led volume efficiencies, operating cash cost efficiencies and
exploration and business development savings. Productivity-led volume efficiencies refer to
volume increases, excluding volume increases from major capital projects, multiplied by the prior
period Underlying EBITDA margin. Operating cash cost efficiencies refer to the reduction in
costs, excluding the impact of volume, price-linked costs, exchange rates, inflation, fuel and
energy, non-cash costs, one-off items, asset sales, ceased and sold operations and other items.
Exploration and business development savings refers to the reduction in total exploration and
business development costs including capitalised exploration. 
(4) Conventional petroleum unit cash costs exclude inventory movements, freight, and third party
and exploration expense; WAIO, Queensland Coal and NSWEC unit cash costs exclude freight
and royalties; Escondida unit cash costs exclude freight and treatment and refining charges and
are net of by-product credits. 2017 financial year unit cost guidance is based on exchange rates
of AUD/USD 0.71 and USD/CLP 698. Escondida grade-adjusted unit cost is shown on a grade-
equivalent basis relative to the 2015 financial year, as grades declined by 28 per cent in the 2016
financial year. Other forward-looking guidance is based on internal exchange rate assumptions. 
(5) “Cash basis” capital and exploration expenditure represents purchases of property, plant and
equipment plus exploration expenditure from the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement. “BHP
Billiton share” capital and exploration expenditure represents the “cash basis”, plus BHP
Billiton’s share of equity accounted investments, less capitalised deferred stripping and non-
controlling interests. 
(6) The 30 June 2015 information in this report has been presented on a continuing operations
basis to exclude the contribution from assets that were demerged with South32, unless otherwise
noted. The prior period’s contribution of the South32 assets to the Group’s results are disclosed
as discontinued operations within the Group’s financial statements. 
(7) Copper equivalent production growth based on 2016 financial year average realised prices. 
(8) Energy Coal guidance excludes production from the Navajo Coal mine.

BHP Billiton Results for the year ended 30 June 2016 
Forward-looking statements 
This release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding: trends in
commodity prices and currency exchange rates; demand for commodities; plans, strategies and
objectives of management; closure or divestment of certain operations or facilities (including
associated costs); anticipated production or construction commencement dates; capital costs and
scheduling; operating costs and shortages of materials and skilled employees; anticipated
productive lives of projects, mines and facilities; provisions and contingent liabilities; tax and
regulatory developments.
Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as ‘intend’, ‘aim’,
‘project’, ‘anticipate’, ‘estimate’, ‘plan’, ‘believe’, ‘expect’, ‘may’, ‘should’, ‘will’, ‘continue’,
‘annualised’ or similar words. These statements discuss future expectations concerning the
results of operations or financial condition, or provide other forward-looking statements.
These forward-looking statements are not guarantees or predictions of future performance, and
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our
control, and which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the
statements contained in this release. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on
forward-looking statements.
For example, our future revenues from our operations, projects or mines described in this release
will be based, in part, upon the market price of the minerals, metals or petroleum produced, which
may vary significantly from current levels. These variations, if materially adverse, may affect the
timing or the feasibility of the development of a particular project, the expansion of certain
facilities or mines, or the continuation of existing operations. 
Other factors that may affect the actual construction or production commencement dates, costs or
production output and anticipated lives of operations, mines or facilities include our ability to
profitably produce and transport the minerals, petroleum and/or metals extracted to applicable
markets; the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the market prices of the minerals,
petroleum or metals we produce; activities of government authorities in some of the countries
where we are exploring or developing these projects, facilities or mines, including increases in
taxes, changes in environmental and other regulations and political uncertainty; labour unrest;
and other factors identified in the risk factors discussed in BHP Billiton’s filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) (including in Annual Reports on Form 20-F)
which are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. 
Except as required by applicable regulations or by law, the Group does not undertake any
obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of
new information or future events. 
Past performance cannot be relied on as a guide to future performance. 
Non-IFRS financial information

including Adjusted effective tax rate, Free cash flow, Gearing ratio, Net debt, Net operating
assets, Underlying attributable profit, Underlying basic (loss)/earnings per share, Underlying
EBIT margin and Underlying EBITDA margin. These measures are used internally by
management to assess the performance of our business, make decisions on the allocation of our
resources and assess operational management. Non-IFRS and other financial measures have
not been subject to audit or review and should not be considered as an indication of or
alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial performance or liquidity. 
No offer of securities 
Nothing in this release should be construed as either an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to
buy or sell BHP Billiton securities in any jurisdiction, or be treated or relied upon as a
recommendation or advice by BHP Billiton.

Notes to the Financial Information 34
The financial information included in this document for the year ended 30 June 2016 is unaudited
and has been derived from the draft financial report of the BHP Billiton Group for the year ended
30 June 2016. The financial information does not constitute the Group’s full statutory accounts for
the year ended 30 June 2016, which will be approved by the Board, reported on by the auditors,
and subsequently filed with the UK Registrar of Companies and the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission. 
The financial information set out on pages 27 to 46 for the year ended 30 June 2016 has been
prepared on the basis of accounting policies and methods of computation consistent with those
applied in the 30 June 2015 financial statements contained within the Annual Report of the BHP
Billiton Group.
The comparative figures for the financial years ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 are not
the statutory accounts of the BHP Billiton Group for those financial years. Those accounts have
been reported on by the company’s auditor and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The
reports of the auditor were (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which
the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying the reports and (iii) did not
contain a statement under Section 498(2) or (3) of the UK Companies Act 2006. All amounts are
expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated. The BHP Billiton Group’s presentation
currency and the functional currency of the majority of its operations is US dollars as this is the
principal currency of the economic environment in which it operates. Amounts in this financial
information have, unless otherwise indicated, been rounded to the nearest million dollars.

(a) BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda has adjusted its investment in Samarco to US$ nil (resulting from
US$(655) million share of loss from Samarco and US$(525) million impairment), recognised a
provision of US$(1,200) million for potential obligations under the Framework Agreement and
together with other BHP Billiton entities incurred US$(70) million of direct costs in relation to the
Samarco dam failure. US$(572) million of the US$(1,200) million provision represents an
additional share of loss from Samarco with the remaining US$(628) million recognised as
provision expense. Refer to note 7 Significant events for further information. 
Impairment of Onshore US assets 
The Group recognised an impairment charge of US$4.9 billion (after tax benefit) against the
carrying value of its Onshore US assets in the year ended 30 June 2016. The impairment reflects
changes to price assumptions, discount rates and development plans. This follows significant
volatility and much weaker prices experienced in the oil and gas industry which have more than
offset our substantial productivity improvements.

- Total (120.0) 35.8 259.1
(a) The calculation of the number of ordinary shares used in the computation of basic earnings
per share is the aggregate of the weighted average number of ordinary shares of BHP Billiton
Limited and BHP Billiton Plc outstanding during the period after deduction of the number of
shares held by the Billiton Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust and the BHP Billiton
Employee Equity Trust. 
(b) The conversion of options and share rights would decrease the loss per share for the year
ended 30 June 2016 and therefore its impact has been excluded from the diluted earnings per
share calculation (2015: 160,116 antidilutive shares; 2014: 183,181 antidilutive shares). 
For the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the effect of 15 million of dilutive
securities has been taken into account for the year ended 30 June 2015 and 17 million shares for
the year ended 30 June 2014. The Group’s only potential dilutive ordinary shares are share
awards granted under employee share ownership plans. 
(c) Each American Depositary Share represents twice the earnings for BHP Billiton ordinary
shares.

Depositary Share (ADS) represents two ordinary shares of BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton
Plc. Dividends determined on each ADS represent twice the dividend determined on BHP
Billiton ordinary shares.
Dividends are determined after period-end in the announcement of the results for the period.
Interim dividends are determined in February and paid in March. Final dividends are determined
in August and paid in September. Dividends determined are not recorded as a liability at the end
of the period to which they relate. Subsequent to year-end, on 16 August 2016 BHP Billiton
determined a final dividend of 14.0 US cents per share (US$746 million), which will be paid on
20 September 2016 (30 June 2015: final dividend of 62.0 US cents per share - US$3,301 million,

7. Significant events – Samarco dam failure 
On 5 November 2015, the Samarco Mineração S.A (Samarco) iron ore operation in Minas
Gerais, Brazil, experienced a tailings dam failure that resulted in a release of mine tailings,
flooding the community of Bento Rodrigues and impacting other communities downstream (the
Samarco dam failure). Refer to pages 2 and 3 for further details. Samarco is jointly owned by
BHP Billiton Brasil Limitada (BHP Billiton Brasil) and Vale S.A (Vale). BHP Billiton Brasil’s 50
per cent interest is accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture investment. BHP Billiton
Brasil does not separately recognise its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of Samarco,
but instead records the investment as one line on the balance sheet. Each period, BHP Billiton
Brasil recognises its 50 per cent share of Samarco’s profit or loss and adjusts the carrying value
of the investment in Samarco accordingly. Such adjustment continues until the investment
carrying value is reduced to US$ nil, with any additional share of Samarco losses only
recognised to the extent that BHP Billiton Brasil has an obligation to fund the losses, or when
future investment funding is provided. After applying equity accounting, any remaining carrying
value of the investment is tested for impairment.
Any charges relating to the Samarco dam failure incurred directly by BHP Billiton Brasil or other
BHP Billiton entities are recognised 100 per cent in the Group’s results. 
The financial impacts of the Samarco dam failure on the Group’s income statement, balance
sheet and cash flow statement for the year ended 30 June 2016 are shown in the table below
and have been treated as an exceptional item. The table below does not include BHP Billiton
Brasil’s share of the results of Samarco prior to the Samarco dam failure, which is disclosed in

41). US$(572) million of the US$(1,200) million provision represents an additional share of loss
from Samarco with the remaining US$(628) million recognised as provision expense.

Investment - 
At the end of the financial year - 
(a) BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda has adjusted its investment in Samarco to US$ nil (resulting from
US$(655) million share of loss from Samarco and US$(525) million impairment) and recognised
a provision of US$(1,200) million for potential obligations under the Agreement (defined on page
41). US$(572) million of the US$(1,200) million provision represents an additional share of loss
from Samarco with the remaining US$(628) million recognised as provision expense. 
(b) As the investment carrying value has been adjusted to US$ nil, additional share of Samarco
losses (US$572 million) and Samarco dam failure provision expense (US$628 million) are
included in the provision for Samarco dam failure. This reflects BHP Billiton Brasil’s US$1,200
million potential legal funding obligation to the Foundation as a result of the Agreement. 
(c) Samarco currently does not have profits available for distribution and is legally prevented from
paying previously declared and unpaid dividends. 
At the half year ended 31 December 2015, the Group assessed the recoverability of its
investment in light of uncertainties surrounding the nature and timing of ongoing future
operations. As a result, an impairment charge of US$525 million was recognised, reducing the
investment balance to US$ nil.
As described below, the Group has recognised a provision of US$1.2 billion at 30 June 2016 in
respect of BHP Billiton Brasil’s potential obligation under the Agreement (defined on page 41).
This reflects the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the nature and timing of a potential restart of
Samarco’s operations. In doing so, the Group has recognised BHP Billiton Brasil’s share of all
losses recognised by Samarco to 30 June 2016.

Dam failure provisions and contingencies 
As at 30 June 2016, BHP Billiton Brasil has identified provisions and contingent liabilities arising
as a consequence of the Samarco dam failure as follows: 
Environment and socio-economic remediation 
Framework Agreement 
On 2 March 2016, BHP Billiton Brasil, together with Samarco and Vale, entered into a
Framework Agreement (Agreement) with the Federal Attorney General of Brazil, the States of
Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais and certain other public authorities to establish a Foundation
that will develop and execute environmental and socio-economic programs to remediate and
provide compensation for damage caused by the Samarco dam failure. On 5 May 2016, the
Agreement was ratified by the Federal Court of Appeal suspending the public civil claim
disclosed below. 
The Federal Prosecutor’s Office appealed the ratification of the Agreement and on 30 June 2016,
the Superior Court of Justice in Brazil issued an interim order (Interim Order) suspending the
5 May 2016 ratification of the Agreement. Samarco, Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil have appealed
the Interim Order before the Superior Court of Justice. 
The term of the Agreement is 15 years, renewable for periods of one year successively until all
obligations under the Agreement have been performed. Under the Agreement, Samarco is
responsible for funding the Foundation with calendar year contributions as follows: 
· R$2 billion (approximately US$620 million) in 2016, less the amount of funds already spent on,
or allocated to, remediation and compensation activity; 
· R$1.2 billion (approximately US$370 million) in 2017; 
· R$1.2 billion (approximately US$370 million) in 2018; and 
· R$500 million (approximately US$155 million) for a special project to be spent on sewage
treatment and landfill works from 2016 to 2018.
Annual contributions for each of the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 will be in the range of R$800
million (approximately US$250 million) and R$1.6 billion (approximately US$500 million),
depending on the remediation and compensation projects which are to be undertaken in the
particular year. Annual contributions may be reviewed under the Agreement. To the extent that
Samarco does not meet its funding obligations under the Agreement, each of Vale and BHP
Billiton Brasil has potential funding obligations under the Agreement in proportion to its 50 per
cent shareholding in Samarco. 
41
Financial Information 7. Significant events – Samarco dam failure (continued) Mining and
processing operations remain suspended following the dam failure. Samarco is currently
progressing plans to resume operations, however significant uncertainties surrounding the nature
and timing of ongoing future operations remain. In light of these uncertainties and based on
currently available information, BHP Billiton Brasil has recognised a provision of US$1.2 billion
before tax and after discounting at 30 June 2016, in respect of its potential obligations under the
Agreement. The measurement of the provision requires the use of estimates and assumptions
and may be affected by, amongst other factors, potential changes in scope of work required
under the Agreement including further technical analysis, costs incurred in respect of programs
delivered, resolution of uncertainty in respect of operational restart, updates to discount and
foreign exchange rates, resolution of existing and potential legal claims and the status of the
Agreement. As a result, future actual expenditures may differ from the amounts currently provided
and changes to key assumptions and estimates could result in a material impact to the amount of
the provision in future reporting periods. On 28 July 2016, BHP Billiton Brasil approved US$134
million to support the Foundation, in the event that Samarco does not meet its funding obligations
under the Agreement. Any support to the Foundation provided by BHP Billiton Brasil will be
offset against the provision for the Samarco dam failure recognised at 30 June 2016. Legal The
following matters are disclosed as contingent liabilities: BHP Billiton Brasil is among the
companies named as defendants in a number of legal proceedings initiated by individuals, non-
governmental organisations (NGOs), corporations and governmental entities in Brazilian federal
and state courts following the Samarco dam failure. The other defendants include Vale and
Samarco. The lawsuits include claims for compensation, environmental rehabilitation and
violations of Brazilian environmental and other laws, among other matters. The lawsuits seek
various remedies, including rehabilitation costs, compensation to injured individuals and families
of the deceased, recovery of personal and property losses, moral damages and injunctive relief.
These legal proceedings include civil public actions filed by state prosecutors in Minas Gerais
(claiming damages of approximately R$7.5 billion, US$2.3 billion), public defenders in Minas
Gerais (claiming damages of approximately R$10 billion, US$3.1 billion) and state prosecutors in
Espírito Santo (claiming damages of approximately R$2 billion, US$620 million). Given the
preliminary status of all these proceedings, and the duplicative nature of the damages sought in
these proceedings and the R$20 billion (US$6.2 billion) and R$155 billion (US$48 billion) claims
noted below, it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable
estimate of potential future exposures for BHP Billiton Brasil. In addition, government inquiries
and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have been commenced by numerous
agencies of the Brazilian government and are ongoing. Public civil claim Among the claims
brought against BHP Billiton Brasil, is a public civil claim commenced by the Federal
Government of Brazil, States of Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais and other public authorities on
30 November 2015, seeking the establishment of a fund of up to R$20 billion (approximately
US$6.2 billion) in aggregate for clean-up costs and damages. On 2 March 2016, BHP Billiton
Brasil, together with Samarco and Vale, entered into the Agreement. Ratification of the
Agreement by the Federal Court of Appeal on 5 May 2016 suspended this public civil claim.
However, it was reinstated on 30 June 2016 upon issue of the Interim Order by the Superior
Court of Justice in Brazil. As noted above, BHP Billiton Brasil has recognised a provision as of
30 June 2016 of US$1.2 billion after tax and discounting in respect of its potential obligations
under the Agreement. While an appeal has been commenced against the Interim Order, given
the status of the appeal it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or a
reliable estimate of potential future exposures for BHP Billiton Brasil in relation to the R$20
billion (approximately US$6.2 billion) claim. 42
BHP Billiton Results for the year ended 30 June 2016 7. Significant events – Samarco dam
failure (continued) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim BHP Billiton Brasil is among the
defendants named in a claim brought by the Federal Public Prosecution Office on 3 May 2016,
seeking R$155 billion (approximately US$48 billion) for reparation, compensation and moral
damages in relation to the Samarco dam failure. Given the preliminary status of these
proceedings, it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable
estimate of potential future exposures for BHP Billiton Brasil. Class action complaint In February
2016, a putative class action complaint (Complaint) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of American Depository Receipts of BHP
Billiton Ltd and Plc between 25 September 2014 and 30 November 2015 against BHP Billiton
Ltd and Plc and certain of its current and former executive officers and directors. The Complaint
asserts claims under U.S. federal securities laws and indicates that the plaintiff will seek
certification to proceed as a class action. The amount of damages sought by the plaintiff on
behalf of the putative class is unspecified. Given the preliminary status of this matter, it is not
possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential
future exposures to BHP Billiton. Other claims Additional lawsuits and government investigations
relating to the Samarco dam failure may be brought against BHP Billiton Brasil and possibly
other BHP Billiton entities in Brazil or other jurisdictions. BHP Billiton’s potential liabilities, if any,
resulting from other pending and future claims, lawsuits and enforcement actions relating to the
Samarco dam failure, together with the potential cost of implementing remedies sought in the
various proceedings, cannot be reliably estimated at this time and therefore a provision has not
been recognised and nor has any contingent liability been quantified for such matters. Ultimately,
all the legal matters disclosed as contingent liabilities could have a material adverse impact on
BHP Billiton’s business, competitive position, cash flows, prospects, liquidity and shareholder
returns. BHP Billiton Insurance BHP Billiton has third party liability insurance for claims related to
the Samarco dam failure made directly against BHP Billiton Brasil or other BHP Billiton entities.
Such claims may be externally insured up to US$360 million (when adjusted for BHP Billiton
Brasil’s interest in Samarco). External insurers have been advised of the Samarco dam failure
although no formal claim has currently been made under the policy. At 30 June 2016 an
insurance receivable has not been recognised for any potential recoveries under insurance
arrangements. Commitments Under the terms of the Samarco joint venture agreement, BHP
Billiton Brasil does not have an existing obligation to fund Samarco. On 28 July 2016, BHP
Billiton Brasil made available a short-term facility to Samarco of up to US$116 million to carry out
remediation and stabilisation work and support Samarco’s operations. Funds will be released to
Samarco only as required and subject to the achievement of key milestones. Any additional
requests for funding or future investment provided would be subject to a future decision,
accounted for at that time. 43
Financial Information 7. Significant events – Samarco dam failure (continued) The following
section includes disclosure required by IFRS of Samarco Mineração SA’s provisions,
contingencies and other matters arising from the dam failure. Samarco Dam failure related
provisions and contingencies As at 30 June 2016 Samarco has identified provisions and
contingent liabilities arising as a consequence of the Samarco dam failure as follows:
Environment and socio-economic remediation Framework Agreement On 2 March 2016,
Samarco, together with Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil, entered into a Framework Agreement
(Agreement) with the Federal Attorney General of Brazil, the States of Espírito Santo and Minas
Gerais and certain other public authorities to establish a Foundation that will develop and
execute environmental and socio-economic programs to remediate and provide compensation
for damage caused by the Samarco dam failure. On 5 May 2016, the Agreement was ratified by
the Federal Court of Appeal suspending the public civil claim disclosed below. The Federal
Prosecutor’s Office appealed the ratification of the Agreement and on 30 June 2016, the Superior
Court of Justice in Brazil issued an interim order (Interim Order) suspending the 5 May 2016
ratification of the Agreement. Samarco, Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil have appealed the Interim
Order before the Superior Court of Justice. The term of the Agreement is 15 years, renewable for
periods of one year successively until all obligations under the Agreement have been performed.
Under the Agreement, Samarco is responsible for funding the Foundation with calendar year
contributions as follows: · R$2 billion (approximately US$620 million) in 2016, less the amount of
funds already spent on, or allocated to, remediation and compensation activity; R$1.2 billion
(approximately US$370 million) in 2017; R$1.2 billion (approximately US$370 million) in 2018;
and R$500 million (approximately US$155 million) for a special project to be spent on sewage
treatment and landfill works from 2016 to 2018. Annual contributions for each of the years 2019,
2020 and 2021 will be in the range of R$800 million (approximately US$250 million) and R$1.6
billion (approximately US$500 million), depending on the remediation and compensation
projects which are to be undertaken in the particular year. Annual contributions may be reviewed
under the Agreement. As at 30 June 2016, Samarco has a provision of US$2.4 billion before tax
and after discounting, in relation to its obligations under the Agreement based on currently
available information. The measurement of the provision requires the use of estimates and
assumptions and may be affected by, amongst other factors, potential changes in scope of work
required under the Agreement including further technical analysis, costs incurred in respect of
programs delivered, resolution of uncertainty in respect of operational restart, updates to discount
and foreign exchange rates, resolution of existing and potential legal claims and the status of the
Agreement. As a result, future actual expenditures may differ from the amounts currently provided
and changes to key assumptions and estimates could result in a material impact to the amount of
the provision in future reporting periods. 44
BHP Billiton Results for the year ended 30 June 2016 7. Significant events – Samarco dam
failure (continued) Other As at 30 June 2016, Samarco has recognised provisions of US$172
million, in addition to its obligations under the Agreement, based on currently available
information. The magnitude, scope and timing of these additional costs are subject to a high
degree of uncertainty and Samarco has indicated that it anticipates that it will incur future costs
beyond those provided. These uncertainties are likely to continue for a significant period and
changes to key assumptions could result in a material change to the amount of the provision in
future reporting periods. Any such unrecognised obligations are therefore contingent liabilities
and, at present, it is not practicable to estimate their magnitude or possible timing of payment.
Accordingly, it is also not possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate
of total potential future exposures at this time. Legal Samarco has been named as defendant in a
number of legal proceedings initiated by individuals, NGOs, corporations and governmental
entities in Brazilian federal and state courts following the Samarco dam failure. These lawsuits
include claims for compensation, environmental rehabilitation and violations of Brazilian
environmental and other laws, among other matters. The lawsuits seek various remedies,
including rehabilitation costs, compensation to injured individuals and families of the deceased,
recovery of personal and property losses, moral damages and injunctive relief. These legal
proceedings include civil public actions filed by state prosecutors in Minas Gerais (claiming
damages of approximately R$7.5 billion, US$2.3 billion), public defenders in Minas Gerais
(claiming damages of approximately R$10 billion, US$3.1 billion), and state prosecutors in
Espírito Santo (claiming damages of approximately R$2 billion, US$620 million). Given the
preliminary status of all these proceedings, and the duplicative nature of the damages sought in
these proceedings and the R$20 billion (US$6.2 billion) and R$155 billion (US$48 billion) claims
noted below, it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable
estimate of potential future exposures for Samarco. In addition, government investigations of the
Samarco dam failure by numerous agencies of the Brazilian government have commenced and
are ongoing. Public civil claim Among the claims brought against Samarco, is a public civil claim
commenced by the Federal Government of Brazil, States of Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais and
other public authorities on 30 November 2015, seeking the establishment of a fund of up to R$20
billion (approximately US$6.2 billion) in aggregate for clean-up costs and damages. On 2 March
2016, Samarco, together with Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil, entered into the Agreement.
Ratification of the Agreement by the Federal Court of Appeal on 5 May 2016 suspended this
public civil claim. However, it was reinstated on 30 June 2016 upon issue of the Interim Order by
the Superior Court of Justice in Brazil. As noted above, Samarco has recognised a provision as
of 30 June 2016 of US$2.4 billion before tax and discounting in respect of its potential obligations
under the Agreement. While an appeal has been commenced against the Interim Order, given
the status of the appeal it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or a
reliable estimate of potential future exposures for Samarco in relation to the R$20 billion
(approximately US$6.2 billion) claim. Federal Public Prosecution Office claim Samarco is among
the defendants named in a claim brought by the Federal Public Prosecution Office on 3 May
2016, seeking R$155 billion (approximately US$48 billion) for reparation, compensation and
moral damages in relation to the Samarco dam failure. Given the preliminary status of these
proceedings, it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable
estimate of potential future exposures for Samarco. Other claims Other pending lawsuits and
investigations are at the early stages of proceedings. Until further facts are developed; court
rulings clarify the issues in dispute, liability and damages; trial activity nears, or other actions
such as possible settlements occur, it is not possible to arrive at a range of outcomes or a reliable
estimate of Samarco’s obligations arising from these matters and therefore Samarco has not
recognised a provision or quantified a contingent liability. 45
Financial Information 7. Significant events – Samarco dam failure (continued) Additional claims
may be brought against Samarco. A provision has not been made by Samarco for claims yet to
be filed. Given the significant uncertainties surrounding possible outcomes it is not possible for
Samarco to arrive at a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of the liability for any unfiled
claims. Samarco Insurance Samarco has standalone insurance policies in place with Brazilian
and global insurers. Samarco has notified insurers including those covering property, project and
liability risks. Insurers have appointed loss adjusters or claims representatives to investigate and
assist with the claims process. The respective adjustment processes for these policies continues.
An insurance receivable has not been recognised by Samarco for any recoveries under
insurance arrangements at 30 June 2016. Samarco non-dam failure related contingent liabilities
The following non-dam failure related contingent liabilities pre-date and are unrelated to the
Samarco dam failure. Samarco is currently contesting both of these matters in the Brazilian
courts. Given the status of the proceedings, the timing of resolution and potential economic
outflow are uncertain. BHP Billiton entities have no legal obligation related to these matters.
Brazilian Social Contribution Levy Samarco has received tax assessments for the alleged non-
payment of Brazilian Social Contribution Levy for the calendar years 2008 to 2014 totalling
approximately R$3.9 billion (approximately US$1.2 billion). Brazilian corporate income tax rate
Samarco has received tax assessments for alleged incorrect calculation of Corporate Income
Tax (IRPJ) in respect of the 2000 to 2002 and 2007 to 2014 income years totalling approximately
R$3.3 billion (approximately US$1.0 billion). 8. Subsequent events As announced on 11 August
2016, the Group has agreed with the New South Wales Government to cease progression of the
Caroona Coal Project and will receive A$220 million (approximately US$170 million) due to
cancellation of the related exploration licence. Other than the matters outlined above or
elsewhere in this financial information, no matters or circumstances have arisen since the end of
the financial year that have significantly affected, or may significantly affect, the operations,
results of operations or state of affairs of the Group in subsequent accounting periods. 46
