Voir Dire Ruling

1.      
The State seeks to adduce into evidence the record of the caution interviews of the three accused on 11.5.2013 and 12.5.2013. The three accused object to the admissibility of this document on the grounds that this statement was obtained involuntarily through assaults, physical pressure, intimidation and threats by the police.

2.      
The test of admissibility of all confessional statements made to the Police officers, is whether those were made freely and not as a result of threats, assaults or inducements made to the accused by person or persons in authority. Further, oppression or unfairness also leads to the exclusion of the confession. Finally, where the rights of the suspects under Section 27 of the previous Constitution have been breached, this will lead to the exclusion of the confessions obtained thereby unless the prosecution can show that the suspect was not thereby prejudiced.

3.      
The preamble of the Judges Rules states as follows:

"That it is a fundamental condition of the admissibility in evidence against any person, equally of any oral answer given by that person to a question put by a police officer and of any statement made by that person, that it shall have been voluntary, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage, exercised or held out by a person in authority, or by oppression."

4.      
The Privy Council, In the case of Wong Kam-ming v The Queen (1980) A.C. 247, P.C., observed that:

"[t]he basic control over the admissibility of statements are found in the evidential rule that an admission must be voluntary i.e. not obtained through violence, fear or prejudice, oppression, threats and promises or other improper inducements. See decision of Lord Sumner in Ibrahim v R (1914-15) AER 874 at 877. It is to the evidence that the court must turn for an answer to the voluntariness of the confessions."

5.      
The Fiji Court of Appeal in case of the Ganga Ram and Shiu Charan v R (FCA Crim. App. 46/1983) outlined the two-part test for the exclusion of confessions at page 8: 

"It will be remembered that there are two matters each of which requires consideration in this area.

First, it must be established affirmatively by the crown beyond reasonable doubt that  the statements were voluntary in the sense that they were not procured by improper  practices such as use of force, threats or prejudice or inducement by offer of some advantage-what has been picturesquely described as 'flatter of hope or the tyranny of fear.' Ibrahim v R (1914) A.C. 559; DPP v Pin Lin (1976 ) A.C. 574.

Secondly, even if such voluntariness is established, there is also need to consider whether the more general ground of unfairness exists in the way in which the police behaved, perhaps by breach of the Judges Rules falling short of over bearing the will, by trickery or by unfair treatment. Regina v Sanag (1980) A.C. 402, 436CE). This is a matter of overriding discretion and one cannot specifically categorize the matters which might be taken into account."

6.      
It is for me to decide whether interviews were conducted freely and not as a result of threats, assaults or inducements made to each accused by a person or persons in authority. Secondly if I find that there has been oppression or unfairness, then I can in my discretion exclude the interview. Finally, if his rights under the Constitution or common law have been breached, then that will lead to exclusion of the confession obtained thereby, unless the prosecution can show that the suspect was not thereby prejudiced. These rights include such rights as having a legal representative of his choice and having access to family, next-of-kin or religious counselor.

7.      
The burden of proving voluntariness, fairness, lack of oppression, compliance with common law rights, where applicable, and if there is noncompliance, lack of prejudice to the accused rests at all times with the prosecution. They must prove these matters beyond reasonable doubt. In this ruling I have reminded myself of that. Further I am reminded that I have to consider evidence in respect of each accused separately. 

8.      
The defence objected to the admissibility of the caution interviews on the following grounds:

a)      
That the statements were obtained in circumstances that were unfair to the accuseds;

b)      
The accuseds were systematically softened during the interview in that they were kept in custody in circumstances which was degrading and inhumane;

c)      
That the statements were obtained in circumstances that were oppressive;

d)      
That the statements were obtained in breach of Rule 2 and 4 of the Judges' Rules; and

e)      
That the statements were obtained in breach of the accuseds' right to counsel before their arrest, before their caution interview and whilst in custody.

f)      
That the accuseds were threatened and assaulted by Police Officers whilst in Police custody and as a result of the said assaults they made a confessional statement.

g)      
The accuseds were constantly threatened of further punishment if they didn't co-operate with them by admitting the offence.

31.     
After the close of the prosecution case, I found a case to answer from each accused in the trial within a trial and explained each accused his rights.

32.     
All three accused gave evidence.

33.     
First accused stated that he was arrested from Naisoso on 11.5.2013 after 2.00 p.m. by three police officers. He did not agree to go with them. He was forcibly put into a twin cab and brought to Namaka station. His hand was handcuffed to a handle on the top. On the way he was punched many times by DC Josua and verbally abused by DC Semi. At Namaka police station Indo Fijian police officer punched him from the back and he fell on the floor. Another Indo Fijian officer came and rubbed chilies on his face. They were asking questions and continued punching. After that, interview commenced. 

34.     
Three officers interviewed him. During the interview Josua and another assaulted him. He signed the interview through force and threat. He met his family members in Court on Monday. He did not complaint to them or the Magistrate. He was not taken to a hospital. He did not ask anyone to take him to a hospital. He has no idea of what was written on the interview papers. He was only forced to sign. 

35.     
Under cross examination by the state, he stated that he does not know Semi. He only came to know him after the interview. He was punched on stomach, back and chest by four police officers. He was treated like a punching bag that day. During the interview, he was not talking. Only police officers were threatening him to sign. They keep on assaulting him throughout the interview. He was still in pain and could not walk properly when he went to the Magistrates Court. 

36.     
Second accused stated that he was arrested from his house in Naboutini village, Sabeto and taken to Sabeto police station by four police officers. He was punched inside the Sabeto police station and taken to Namaka police station. There an Indo Fijian officer assaulted him on his knees and shoulders using a piece of timber. Further chilies were brought and forcibly put to his mouth and he was told to eat. After that they were forced to sign the interviews. They were not allowed visits till they signed the interview papers. None of the answers in the interview was given by him. 

37.     
Under cross examination he stated that he was assaulted on the way to Namaka from Sabeto. He was punched from shoulder to knee. At Namaka he was hit in front of the knee with a piece of wood 3 - 4 times. He could not stand or walk properly. He was pulled from back to the interview room. The Inspector was assaulting him during the interview. He did not reply to any of the questions. He did not complaint to visitors or the Magistrate. He was bit limping when he came to the Magistrates Court. 

38.     
The 3rd accused stated that he was arrested on 11.5.2013 by four police officers at his house. He was taken to Sabeto police station. On the way he was punched on stomach and face, when he remained silent to their questions. Then he was taken to Namaka police station. His left eye was paining at that time. At Namaka police station Indo Fijian officer pulled his leg. He brought a piece of timber and assaulted him on his shoulders, knees and the ankle. Then he went and brought chilies. He cut those to pieces and gave them to eat. He told them to open their mouths and forcibly put those inside. This was done twice. Josua threaten to break his ribs if he does not admit the allegations. He was very scared. Then Indo Fijian officer made them to lie of the floor and stood on top of their bodies. Then they were just told to sign. He had no idea what he was signing. This was done on the first day and on the second day. He did not complaint to Magistrate.

39.     
 He had received one punch on left eye at Sabeto police station. That was the only injury visible.

40.     
Under cross examination he denied that the injury in the left eye was from a Rugby match. He said that he did not answer any question put to him by the police. He admitted that he did not make a complaint to the Magistrate, pastor or to the visitors who came to visit him. He was in pain in the left eye and on knees when his parents visited him. 

41.     
I have carefully considered the available evidence in respect of the caution interviews on 11.5.2013 of the three accused.

42.     
It was alleged by the defence that it is not proper to conduct all three interviews at the same time and at the same place. The three interviews were conducted at the crime office of the Namaka police station at almost same time. According to evidence, there were only five officers serving at the crime branch of the Namaka police station at that time. Two officers were called from outside to conduct these three interviews. The interviews were conducted at the same building and at different places. The three accused needed to be produced before a Magistrate within 48 hours of the arrest. Considering the available resources and circumstances, I am of the view that procedure adopted by the police is correct and fair to the accused. 

43.     
There are 92 questions and answers in the caution interview of the 1st accused. In the 2nd accused caution interview, there are 76 questions and answers. There are 100 questions and answers in 3rd accused's caution interview. The position of each accused was that they never answered any question put to them, although they were heavily assaulted and oppressed before and during the interview. I am of the view that this position taken up by each accused is highly improbable. Only visible injury was the red eye on the 3rd accused. Police officers have noted that injury in the station diary at 1521 hours on 11.5.2013 when he was brought to the Namaka police station.

44.     
None of the accused made any complaint to the Magistrate, pastor or relations. The position taken up by the 1st accused in cross examination of witnesses on the first day of this inquiry was different from the position taken up on the 2nd and 3rd days. The new position is in line with the position taken up by the 2nd and 3rd accused. 

45.     
The position taken up by all three accused in their voir-dire grounds is that accused were threatened and assaulted by police officers whilst in police custody and as a result of the said assaults they made a confessional statement. For all these reasons, I am unable to accept the defence version when I apply the tests of consistency, probability and belatedness. 

46.     
Having heard the evidence by prosecution and the defence, I accept the evidence of the police officers that caution interview statements of the three accused were recorded fairly, without any intimidation or fabrication. I have considered the demeanor of all the witnesses who testified before me. I have considered evidence in respect of each caution interview separately.

47.     
Accordingly, I have come to the view that in regard to any allegation of assault by the police, the state had satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that it did not happen. I am satisfied that each interview was voluntary, that was obtained in fair circumstances, that those were in no way oppressed or beaten out of each accused in contravention of their rights either under the Judges' Rules or of the Constitution which was not in operation.

48.     
The caution interviews of the three accused on 11.5.2103, being voluntary made and not created out of oppression is therefore admissible in evidence.
