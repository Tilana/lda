SEVENTH COUNT

Statement of Offence

DRIVING A MOTOR VEHICLE IN CONTRAVENTION OF THIRD PARTY POLICY RISK: Contrary to Section 4(1)(2) of the Motor Vehicle (Third Party Policy) Act 177.

Particulars of Offence

MAIKELI BALEINAGAGA TIKOMAIVALEVEIVESU, on the 24th day of November, 2001, at Suva in the Central Division drove a motor vehicle along Makita Street when there was not in force in relation to the use of the said motor vehicle by the said MAIKELI BALEINAGAGA TIKOMAIVALEVEIVESU of a policy of insurance in respect to the third party policy risk as complied under the provision of this Act.

The charges were laid on the 31st of December 2001, and the case called on the same day. He pleaded guilty on the 18th of January. The facts were read. They were that the complainant who is a New Zealander and working in Fiji as an accountant at Mobil Oil, found his house broken into on the 18th of November 2001. The items in the charge were found missing. On the 24th of November 2001, the same complainant found his car missing from the garage. He also found that his house had been broken into again and the items listed in count 4 missing. The police found the car abandoned at the Mobile Service Station in Tamavua. The Applicant was located. He admitted all the offences and was charged. He was an escapee from Nasinu Prison.

These facts were admitted, as were 7 previous convictions from 2000. At the hearing of this application, State counsel told me that the list has since been augmented by no less than 26 previous convictions in 2002. However these convictions had not been entered when this case was being dealt with in the Suva Magistrates Court and I disregard them for the purposes of this application.

The learned Magistrate sentenced the Applicant on the 18th of January 2002 as follows:

Count 1 
-       
2 years imprisonment;
Count 2 
-       
2 years imprisonment;
Count 3 
-       
1 years imprisonment
(Consecutive)
Count 4 
-       
2 years imprisonment;
Count 5 
-       
3 months imprisonment;
Count 6 
-       
Discharged;
Count 7 
-       
Discharged and disqualified 
from holding a driving
licence for 2 years.

The sentences on Counts 4 and 5 were to be served concurrently to the total sentence on Counts 1, 2 and 3. In effect, the total term to be served is 5 years imprisonment.

The Applicant now attempts to appeal against this sentence. His grounds are not clear, but his main complaint appears to be that the Prisons Department has miscalculated the total term to be served. At the hearing of this application he said that he also wanted to appeal against the sentence as it was harsh and excessive.

He is 1 year and 5 months out of time. He offered no explanation for the delay in the filing of the appeal. On a perusal of the court record I can find no possible ground of appeal. The sentence of 5 years in total for what was in effect a burglary on two occasions in the same victims house, was not harsh or excessive. The Applicant was not entitled to the leniency which might have been shown to a first offender.

There is no good cause shown to justify the enlargement of time and I refuse the application. However I have noticed an error in the Applicants record of previous convictions. It states that the convictions were as follows:

Count 1 
-       
2 years imprisonment;
Count 2 
-       
2 years imprisonment;
Count 3 
-       
2 years imprisonment;
Count 4 
-       
2 years imprisonment;
Count 5 
-       
3 months imprisonment
convicted and discharged u/s
44.

There is no mention of counts 6 and 7, nor is the order that the sentences on Counts 4 and 5 be served concurrently to the sentences on Counts 1, 2 and 3 recorded. The record of conviction is inaccurate and must be amended. It should read as follows:

Count 1 (Burglary) - 2 years imprisonment;

Count 2 (Larceny in dwelling house of a property to a value amounting to not less than ten dollars) - 2 years imprisonment;

Count 3 (Burglary) - 1 years imprisonment;

(to be served consecutively)

Count 4 (Larceny in dwelling house of a property to a value amounting to not less than ten dollars) - 2 years imprisonment;

Count 5 (Unlawful use of motor vehicle) - 3 months imprisonment;
(to be served concurrently with each other and with Counts 1  3)

Count 6 (Driving a motor vehicle without a driving licence) - Absolute Discharge;

Count 7 (Driving a motor vehicle in contravention of third party policy risk) - Discharged and disqualified from driving for 2 years.

It is possible that the prison records are similarly inaccurate and must be amended. The Applicant is to serve a total of 5 years imprisonment, from the 18th of January 2002, to be served concurrently to any other term being served on that day.
