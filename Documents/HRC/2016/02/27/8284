<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 6/17 adopted on 28 September 2007, and entitled &#8220;Establishment of 
funds for the universal periodic review mechanism of the Human Rights Council&#8221; the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council requested &#8220;the Secretary-General to establish a new financial 
mechanism called the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance to be 
administered jointly with the universal periodic review Voluntary Trust Fund [&#8230;] in order 
</p>
<p>to provide, in conjunction with multilateral funding mechanisms, a source of financial and 
technical assistance to help countries implement recommendations emanating from the 
universal periodic review in consultation with, and with the consent of, the country 
concerned&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>2. The Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance (VFFTA) has since 
been established and States have commenced making contributions to this Fund. As of 23 
November 2011, seven States have either contributed or pledged to contribute to the 
VFFTA. These contributions are annexed hereto.  
</p>
<p>3. In its resolution 16/22 adopted on 25 March 2011, and entitled &#8220;Enhancement of 
international cooperation in the field of human rights&#8221;, the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) &#8220;to seek the views of States and relevant stakeholders on the contribution of the 
Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance, in particular with regard to its 
sustainability and accessibility, to the implementation of recommendations accepted by 
States as part of their universal periodic review that require financial support, and also 
requests the Office to provide the Council with a compilation of those views at its 
nineteenth session.&#8221;   
</p>
<p>4. Pursuant to the aforementioned request, OHCHR prepared a questionnaire which 
was made available via an online survey on 5 October 2011, and which is annexed hereto. 
An invitation was extended to States and relevant Stakeholders1 to participate in this 
survey, which closed on 4 November 2011. Ten States and 11 stakeholders participated in 
the survey.2 A compilation and summary of the responses appear below.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Compilation of responses from States and stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. On how the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance 
</b></p>
<p><b>could contribute to the implementation of accepted recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>5. Colombia stated that a lack of financial and technical resources to implement 
recommendations hindered the identification and delineation of accomplishment strategies, 
goals and progress indicators. The VFFTA could support States in these endeavours, which 
are needed for the continuous and organized follow-up of progress on the implementation 
of the recommendations. The VFFTA could also be useful in supporting the dissemination 
of the recommendations and promoting awareness at all levels, as well as supporting States 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Stakeholders include &#8220;NGOs, national human rights institutions, human rights defenders, academic 
</p>
<p>institutions and research institutes, regional organizations, as well as civil society representatives&#8221; 
(See &#8220;Universal Periodic Review: information and guidelines for relevant stakeholders&#8217; written 
submissions&#8221;; http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/UPR/TechnicalGuideEN.pdf)  
</p>
<p> 2 The questionnaires for Algeria and Tunisia, as well as seven Stakeholders were incomplete.  </p>


<p>in the design, establishment and implementation of specialized information systems for the 
follow-up of recommendations and voluntary pledges.3 
</p>
<p>6.  Denmark stated that the VFFTA should aim to establish and strengthen 
coordination mechanisms, to devise road maps for the follow-up of recommendations and 
to implement key recommendations. It further stated that it was important for all parties to 
actively support the UPR mechanism and that this support should include financial 
contributions to the VFFTA.  
</p>
<p>7. Guyana stated that the follow-up to commitments made by States during their 
respective reviews were fundamental and essential to the UPR process. The main challenge 
was to ensure that the norms and standards of the international human rights systems are 
translated into action. To that end, the implementation of international human rights 
obligations cannot depend on political will alone. In many instances, obligations will not be 
fulfilled, or fulfilled in a timely manner, because of the paucity or lack of necessary 
mechanisms, poor communication and dissemination, complex political situations, lack of 
capacity and resources at the institutional level, or difficulties of implementation due to 
competing and immediate demands on limited resources. In this regard, the VFFTA 
provided a critical and missing component in the implementation of States&#8217; commitments, 
especially with regard to developing countries. 
</p>
<p>8. Guyana further stated that any system developed to implement the VFFTA will have 
to be efficient, realistic and directly linked to the provision of financial and technical 
cooperation or human rights advisory services, as requested by States. The VFFTA should 
assist States to access technical and financial resources to facilitate overcoming some of 
their capacity constraints. The VFFTA should specifically target the least developed 
countries, newly emerging or restored democracies, countries where there has been a 
regression in human rights as well as small and vulnerable States, which face particular 
challenges in attaining the realization of human rights. In addition, the VFFTA can assist in 
enabling the States to develop road maps and practical mechanisms to ensure a reliable 
follow-up and implementation process. Technical cooperation programmes can facilitate in 
the exchange of best practices between States and allow for more country-specific and 
country-driven goals achievable within a reasonable time frame, depending on the level of 
development constraints of a State, while at the same time recognizing the imperative of 
national capacity-building.  
</p>
<p>9. Guyana added that the VFFTA can contribute to and be integrated into the United 
Nations Common Country programming cycles, including the United Nations Development 
Assistance Framework (UNDAF). Therefore, the VFFTA could positively contribute to the 
implementation of commitments made by States, especially small developing countries.  
</p>
<p>10. Japan stated that reviews from the second cycle onwards should focus, inter alia, on 
the implementation of the preceding outcome. In order to support the follow-up to accepted 
recommendations, Japan reiterated its previous proposal that beginning with the second 
cycle of the UPR: (a) each State should make its own best efforts to follow up on its 
recommendations and where these efforts are inhibited by a lack of resources and/or know-
how, relevant United Nations agencies including OHCHR are encouraged to provide 
assistance; (b) each State should group its accepted recommendations into those 
recommendations that it can implement on its own (first group) and those recommendations 
for whose implementation international assistance is required (second group), and provide 
this information to the Secretariat for circulation. In relation to the second group of 
recommendations, the State should call on bilateral donors and relevant United Nations 
</p>
<p>  
 3 Colombia conveyed its responses to the survey in a note verbale, dated 16 November 2011. </p>


<p>agencies, including OHCHR, for assistance. Those States that made recommendations that 
fall into the second group should seriously consider extending assistance for their 
implementation; (c) each State should submit to the Secretariat, no later than two years after 
the adoption of its UPR outcome, a concise follow-up report (mid-term report) on the state 
of implementation of its accepted recommendations, which should be disseminated to all 
States; (d) OHCHR should be requested to create a list of the projects which require further 
international assistance based on the information submitted by States in their mid-term 
follow-up reports; and (e) the VFFTA should be enhanced to support the UPR follow-up.  
</p>
<p>11. Mauritius stated that contribution to the implementation of accepted 
recommendations could be made by (a) establishing national focal points that will serve as 
formally recognized bodies for human rights issues; (b) setting up strategic partnerships 
with educational institutions, NGOs and CBOs, ministries, the private sector, the media and 
journalists; (c) strengthening national capabilities through training; (d) conducting periodic 
in-the-field evaluation and monitoring; and (e) establishing networks that may be regional 
or topic-related.  
</p>
<p>12. Sweden stated that it was a good idea to assist States with the implementation of 
recommendations. The VFFTA should continue to report on UPR outcomes, exchange 
information regarding experiences and best practices, and to integrate UPR outcomes into 
United Nations country programmes. The VFFTA should not exclude those 
recommendations that have not been accepted by States, provided such recommendations 
were in line with international human rights standards. The Human Rights Council should 
also review the internal and external efficiency and operationality of the VFFTA.  
</p>
<p>13. Uganda stated that the VFFTA should be used for capacity-building of State 
institutions and for the sensitization of civil society and other stakeholders towards 
appreciation and respect for human rights. It should also be used to facilitate regular review 
meetings. 
</p>
<p>14. CIVICUS stated that access to the VFFTA for States should be contingent on their 
engagement with a broad cross-section of civil society with regard to their development of 
human rights policies. This engagement will also enable civil society organizations to 
monitor and assess States&#8217; implementation of recommendations. Funding from the VFFTA 
should also be directly available to civil society organizations for these purposes. 
</p>
<p>15. International-Lawyers.org stated that the VFFTA should be used to provide 
resources for advice, training, sharing of best practices, and for visits of officials to other 
countries. 
</p>
<p>16. UNITED for Intercultural Action (Prague Office) and Defenders of the Rights of the 
Child (Czech section) stated that States should establish and finance a programme to 
support the engagement of civil society organizations in improving awareness of the UPR 
and the implementation of the recommendations.  
</p>
<p>17. UPR-info stated that the VFFTA should be used by OHCHR to monitor the 
implementation of recommendations in order to provide the Human Rights Council with an 
objective assessment of the progress made by States during their review in the second 
cycle.  
</p>
<p><b> B. On the sustainability of and accessibility to the Voluntary Fund for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Financial and Technical Assistance 
</b></p>
<p>18. Colombia stated that one of the ways to guarantee sustainability of the VFFTA is 
through the collaboration of all States and the strengthening of their cooperation in the field 
of human rights. This could be done through agreements between States to support the </p>


<p>implementation of some recommendations and voluntary pledges, taking into account the 
most outstanding priorities of the country. There should also be constructive dialogue on 
the follow-up to the recommendations, as well as external collaboration coupled with 
internal efforts to strengthen measures in order to improve the human rights situation in the 
State concerned.  
</p>
<p>19. Guyana stated that in order to ensure the sustainability of the VFFTA, the idea of 
private donations from non-traditional donors should be explored. Broadening the donor-
base is a necessity and OHCHR should seek to enhance dialogue with representatives from 
non-traditional donor countries. Also, pledges made to the VFFTA must be available in a 
predictable and timely manner to assist OHCHR and the beneficiaries to effectively and 
efficiently plan and implement the programmed activities.  
</p>
<p>20. Guyana further stated that OHCHR has become heavily dependent on voluntary 
contributions to the VFFTA for core and mandated activities that ideally should remain 
within the regular budget. Funds from the VFFTA can be reallocated to other areas by 
OHCHR at any given time and this could have a negative effect on the sustainability of the 
VFFTA as a source to assist States in the implementation of accepted recommendations. 
Therefore, the VFFTA should be specifically earmarked to assist States in the 
implementation process.  
</p>
<p>21. Guyana also stated that OHCHR should ensure that funds from the VFFTA are 
easily accessible to States requesting assistance and that such requests should be executed 
in a timely manner. In this regard, a lengthy needs assessment should be avoided and 
priority should be given to States that are most challenged in implementing their 
commitments.  
</p>
<p>22. Japan stated that the VFFTA should be administered on the basis of the list of 
projects where international assistance is required. As Administrator of the VFFTA, 
OHCHR should make the &#8220;necessity&#8221; of the VFFTA well-known and regularly make 
periodic appeals for contributions to this Fund, in order to replenish the resources therein. 
On these occasions, OHCHR should also provide an adequate explanation of the status of 
the allocation and disbursement of the VFFTA in order to ensure the transparency of the 
Fund&#8217;s activities. 
</p>
<p>23. Mauritius stated that the sustainability of the VFFTA could be ensured by: 
(a) forming strategic partnerships with the private sector, the media and others; (b) signing 
memoranda of understanding with commitments for actions, activities and further detailed 
training, and which may include revenue raising measures or similar commitments; 
(c) sponsorships; (d) strengthening NGO participation and networking accessibility, subject 
to the approval of National Focal Points;4 and (e) establishing frameworks for funding 
intervention.  
</p>
<p>24. Sweden stated that the opportunity of assisting States in following up on UPR 
outcomes would be greater if OHCHR had a presence in these States. It suggested that 
States, when requesting assistance from the VFFTA, should provide a preliminary action 
plan on how recommendations would be implemented and that this should include the time 
frame for such implementation.  
</p>
<p>25. Timor-Leste stated that the allocation of money from the VFFTA should be made in 
accordance with the needs of the State in question and based on specific requests for 
support for specific programmes. Access to the VFFTA should not be limited to, and its use 
should not be determined solely by, contributing States. OHCHR should play the role of 
</p>
<p>  
 4  See para. 11 above.  </p>


<p>&#8220;facilitator&#8221; of VFFTA but it should refrain from any attempt at identifying areas where 
</p>
<p>requesting States should prioritize the allocation of funds. 
</p>
<p>26. Uganda stated that developed countries and donors should be invited to contribute to 
the VFFTA. States that are poor or emerging democracies, or democracies in transition 
should be able to access the VFFTA provided that they are committed to improving their 
human rights records.  
</p>
<p>27. CIVICUS stated that the sustainability of the VFFTA will depend on its 
effectiveness in advancing human rights within the States that receive financial and 
technical support from the Fund. An essential factor for ensuring the effectiveness and 
sustainability of the VFFTA would be the engagement of civil society organizations in both 
the formulation of States&#8217; coordination mechanisms and road maps for implementing 
recommendations as well as the monitoring and assessment of their effectiveness in 
ensuring respect and protection for human rights. 
</p>
<p>28. International-Lawyers.org stated that the ability of States to contribute to the 
VFFTA and the possibility of making contributions &#8220;in kind&#8221; should be considered.  
</p>
<p>29. UNITED for Intercultural Action (Prague Office) and Defenders of the Rights of the 
Child (Czech section) stated that it was necessary to assist not only least developed 
countries but countries in transformation, on the condition that a portion of the funds from 
the VFFTA is allocated for civil society organizations. </p>

<p><b>Assistance to the Implementation of UPR Recommendations (HRC 
</b></p>
<p><b>resolution 16/22 of 25 March 2011) 
</b></p>
<p>The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) was created through the UN General Assembly on 
15 March 2006 by resolution 60/251, which established the Human Rights Council (HRC) 
itself.  
</p>
<p>The UPR is a cooperative process which by 2011, will have reviewed the human rights 
records of all United Nations Members of States. As part of the second UPR cycle, all 
countries are scheduled to be reviewed again between 2012-2016, following the same order 
of review. 
</p>
<p>With a view to provide a source of financial and technical assistance to help countries 
implement recommendations emanating from the UPR, in 2007, the HRC established a new 
financial mechanism called the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance 
(resolution 16/17). 
</p>
<p>On 25 March 2011, the HRC adopted resolution 16/22 on the enhancement of international 
cooperation of the human rights and requested the Office  of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human rights &#8220; to seek the views of the States and relevant stakeholders 
on the contribution of the Voluntary fund for Financial and Technical Assistance, in 
particular with regards to its sustainability and accessibility, to the implementation of 
recommendations accepted by States as part of their universal periodic review  that require 
review financial support, and also requests the Office to provide the Council with a 
compilation of those views at its nineteenth session. 
</p>
<p>This questionnaire has been prepared by OHCHR in response to the request of the HRC to 
seek the views of States and relevant Stakeholders on the contribution of the Fund to the 
implementation of UPR recommendations. A compilation of the responses received by 04 
November 2011 will be submitted to the HRC in March 2012.
