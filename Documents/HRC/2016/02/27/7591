underlines the importance of developing and applying national assessment systems which 
are in compliance with international human right norms, so that education meets the 
essential objectives assigned to it in human rights conventions. He considers that such a 
human rights-based, holistic approach is essential for fostering the humanistic mission of 
education rather than its mere instrumental role, using a narrow scope of assessments linked 
to mathematical literacy and language skills only. The report also places emphasis on skills 
development as an integral part of basic education and on the need for innovative 
assessment modalities of technical and vocational education and training, particularly in 
developing countries, in response to the rising aspirations of youth, while not losing sight of

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 17/3. 
It centres on the assessment of the educational attainments of students and the 
implementation of the right to education. It underlines the importance of developing and 
applying assessments of those educational attainments in line with human right norms so 
that education meets the essential objectives assigned to it in international human rights 
conventions. Such a human rights-based, holistic approach is essential for fostering the 
humanistic mission of education, rather than its mere instrumental role, using a narrow 
scope of assessments linked to mathematical literacy and language skills only. The report 
also places an emphasis on skills development as an integral part of basic education and on 
the need for innovative assessment modalities of technical and vocational education and 
training, particularly in developing countries, in response to the rising aspirations of youth, 
while not losing sight of the human rights perspective.  
</p>
<p>2. The present report builds upon previous reports by the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to education concerning quality education and normative action (A/HRC/20/21) and 
on technical and vocational education and training from the perspective of a right to 
education (A/67/310). Its focus is on national assessment at the level of basic education, 
with reference to regional or international assessment systems. The report seeks to 
elaborate on assessments of the educational attainment of students, rather than on that of 
schools or teachers per se, even though they are connected. It is confined to the field of 
basic education,1 since the realization of the right to a basic education of quality for all is 
the priority concern of the international community and likely to remain central to the post-
2015 development agenda<i>.</i>  
</p>
<p>3. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur undertook a mission to 
Seychelles. He also reported to the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly 
(A/68/294). That report highlighted recent developments in the post-2015 development 
agenda and analysed educational goals and implementation strategies, with a focus on 
action at the national level. The Special Rapporteur stressed the importance of placing the 
right to education at the centre of discussions on the post-2015 development agenda and 
offered a set of recommendations on how to operationalize a rights-based approach to the 
education-based development goals. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Recent activities undertaken by the Special Rapporteur 
</b>4. Since last reporting, the Special Rapporteur has continued to participate in activities, 
related to advocacy for the right to education and raising its profile at national, regional and 
international levels. He has remained actively engaged in maintaining a dialogue with 
States, international bodies, the intellectual community and civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p>5. In April 2013, the Special Rapporteur participated in the twelfth session of the 
Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, in Geneva, and made a

programmes at International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) level 2 (lower secondary 
education) to provide individuals with skills relevant to employment. See UNESCO Institute for 
Statistics, International Standard Classification of Education, ISCED 2011 (Montreal, 2012), para.

participated in a working group entitled &#8220;Mainstreaming human rights: a human rights 
based approach to the Post-2015 Development Agenda.&#8221; He was also a speaker at an expert 
meeting on &#8220;Promoting a rights-based approach to financial regulation and economic 
recovery&#8221;, held in Vienna on 1 July.  
</p>
<p>9. On 15 and 16 July, the Special Rapporteur attended an event entitled &#8220;Educational

</p>
<p><b> III. Towards a holistic, human rights-based approach to the 
assessment of the educational attainments of students 
</b></p>
<p>23. Fulfilment of State obligations for the right to education is dependent upon how the 
education provided meets the essential objectives of the right to education, as shown by the 
educational attainments of students. This calls for national assessments of education to be 
driven by a human rights-based approach, where the full range of obligations arising from 
the right to education remains centre stage. The Special Rapporteur would like to 
emphasize the need and importance of a holistic approach which is broader than the narrow </p>


<p>approach of performance evaluation only of mathematical literacy and language skills, and 
which broadens the assessment of the educational attainments of students to include all 
obligations relating to the right to education under international human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Human rights standards in education 
</b></p>
<p>24. States have the primary responsibility for ensuring that their national education 
systems meet the objectives assigned to education in international human rights treaties. 
Beginning with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, schools must provide 
education which is respectful of human rights values, democratic citizenship and cultural 
diversity. According to the principles contained in article 29 (1) of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, the education of the child shall be directed to &#8220;the development of 
respect for the child&#8217;s parents, his or her own cultural identity, language and values, for the 
national values of the country in which the child is living, the country from which he or she 
may originate, and for civilizations different from his or her own.&#8221; The education to which 
every child has a right is one which is &#8220;designed to provide the child with life skills, to 
strengthen the child&#8217;s capacity to enjoy the full range of human rights and to promote a 
culture which is infused by appropriate human rights values.&#8221;2 Yet, as the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child has stated, national and international programmes and policies on 
education that really count the elements embodied in article 29 (1) seem all too often to be 
either largely missing or present only as a cosmetic afterthought.3  
</p>
<p>25. In this respect, it is important to recall that the UNESCO constitution assigns to 
education the mission of promoting the &#8220;ideals of humanity&#8221; and fostering the &#8220;intellectual 
and moral solidarity&#8221; of humankind. Both UNESCO and the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund (UNICEF) have the institutional mission of preparing children for the responsibility 
of the future and these ideals should constitute the bedrock of national curricula. Moreover, 
education should be designed and provided in such a way that it &#8220;promotes and reinforces 
the range of specific ethical values&#8221; enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child.4 The need for &#8220;new ethics for our common humanity&#8221;5 has been voiced in 
propositions for planning for the post-2015 development agenda. This should find a 
prominent place in reflections on modernizing the curriculum for assessing the educational 
attainments of students accordingly, as an integral part of the humanistic mission of 
education.  
</p>
<p>26. The primary objective of national assessment systems is to appraise the educational 
attainments of students through the entire national education system. This should be driven 
by a human rights-based approach and the humanistic mission of education, rather than by 
its mere instrumental role, and by preserving and fostering the noble cause of education. 
The values and principles propounded by the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights 
Education and Training6 &#8220;as a means to give full effect to the right to education 
worldwide&#8221;7 must be publicized in order to make them an integral part of the educational

<p>attainments of students. &#8220;Universally recognized human rights values and democratic 
principles should be embedded in any education system.&#8221;8  
</p>
<p><b> B. Learning to live together 
</b></p>
<p>27. A ground-breaking report presented to UNESCO in 1996, known as the Delors 
Report, outlined four pillars of education: learning to know, learning to do, learning to live 
together and learning to be.9 Those objectives provide a useful framework for the purpose 
of modernizing national curricula and the corresponding mechanisms for assessing the 
educational attainments of students.  
</p>
<p>28. Assessing the peacebuilding role of education is also important, especially in 
conflict situations and in the phase of post-conflict reconciliation. &#8220;Education in the twenty-
first century needs above all to teach children what is arguably the single most vital skill for 
a flourishing multi-cultural society - the skill of living peacefully with other people &#8230; No 
country can hope to establish lasting foundations for peace unless it finds ways of building 
mutual trust between its citizens - and the place to start is in the classroom.&#8221;10 An important 
consideration in assessing the educational attainments of students is whether their 
behaviour patterns reflect their understanding of, and commitment to, learning to live 
together.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Fostering the positive values of cultural diversity 
</b></p>
<p>29. Education is invaluable for the preservation of the cultural heritage of humankind.11 
Inculcating in students a commitment to preserving and enriching multicultural and 
multilingual diversity and promoting a better understanding and appreciation of the 
richness of cultural diversity deserves an important place in any education system.12 
National curricula should aim to prepare students for the defence of cultural diversity as an 
ethical imperative, inseparable from respect for human dignity, as expressed in the 
UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity  of 2001.13 The main lines of the 
action plan for the implementation of the Declaration clearly provide for promoting through 
education an awareness of the positive value of cultural diversity and improving to this end 
both curriculum design and teacher education. The education provided, as well as the 
assessments of students, should show the importance attached to the preservation and 
promotion of cultural diversity and pluralism as an essential part of human-centred 
development. The assessment of students should demonstrate their understanding of 
common values shared by all humankind, with respect for people from different 
civilizations, cultures and religions.

<p>for the Rapprochement of Cultures by the General Assembly in resolution 67/104. 
 
</p>
<p>12
 For example, in Indonesia<b>,</b> the Law on the National Education System (2003) aims to inculcate in 
</p>
<p>young minds a respect for human rights, cultural pluralism and learning to live together and promote 
morals, character building and unity in diversity (<i>Bhinneka Tunggal Eka</i>) in the spirit of brotherhood 
and solidarity.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>13
 Article 5 of the Declaration stipulates that &#8220;all persons are entitled to quality education and training 
</p>
<p>that fully respect their cultural identity&#8221;. </p>


<p><b> IV. Assessment mechanisms in basic education 
</b></p>
<p>30. Student-based assessment of educational attainments has a direct correlation with 
the curriculum-based assessment of educational attainments. States have an obligation to 
fulfil the right to basic education, based on minimum standards, provided by qualified 
teachers and effectively managed through a system of implementation and assessment.14  
</p>
<p>31. National assessment systems must be inclusive, and cover all students within a 
national population. &#8220;Student-based&#8221; mechanisms evaluate the progress of each student 
against school standards, which reflect the local and national curriculum requirements. 
These systems must apply to all students in a country without exception, to ensure that they 
are all assessed and supported to ensure their progressive improvement, particularly those 
from vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Educational attainments in the progression from primary to secondary 
level  
</b></p>
<p>32. The Education for All goals of universal primary education for all has created 
pressure on Governments simply to push students forward, regardless of their educational 
achievements. Emerging policies and regulations in several countries are minimizing or 
even doing away with quality control by way of exams in the transition from primary to 
secondary education. That is a regressive measure, which is detrimental to the quality of the 
education provided. It is an issue of critical importance in national quality assessment and 
deserves rethinking. As the Special Rapporteur stated in his earlier report, it is &#8220;crucial to 
monitor and assess students&#8217; educational achievements on a regular basis, with a rigorous 
performance evaluation prior to passing from primary to secondary education. Automatic 
promotion to the next grade irrespective of students&#8217; learning achievements can perpetuate, 
even aggravate, the poor quality of education&#8221; (A/HRC/20/21, para. 75). It is important to 
ensure through national assessment whether the education system is furnishing all students 
with the necessary knowledge and competencies in a sustained manner. 
</p>
<p>33. States are under an international legal obligation to ensure that each child completes 
a basic education of good quality, as assessed by a national assessment mechanism. This 
normally requires successful attendance and completion of a formal education programme, 
which awards a recognized qualification.15 Merely attending school does not lead to the 
completion of basic education - all students should be required to have a recognized 
qualification of successful completion of basic education (ISCED level 1), or a specific 
level of achievement, for entering some or all junior secondary level education (ISCED 
level 2) programmes in a specific country.16  
34. For example, in Senegal, given the requirement for 10 years of compulsory 
education under the Education Law of 2004, the awarding of the certificate for completion 
of elementary education<b> </b>(<i>certificat de fin d'&#233;tudes &#233;l&#233;mentaires</i>) has no bearing on 
progression to the sixth year of schooling, which is through a competitive test for intake, 
depending on the availability of places for secondary education. Similarly, in Gabon<b>, 
</b>the <i>certificat d&#8217;etudes primaires</i> plays no role in the progression from primary to secondary 
education. In Mali, the requirement of completion of the primary school certificate 
(<i>certificat de fin d&#8217;&#233;tudes du premier cycle de l&#8217;enseignement fondamental</i>) was lifted in 
2010, introducing from the seventh grade a trimestral progression of tests until the 
completion of basic education. In India, pursuant to the Act on the Right of Children to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>

<p>Free and Compulsory Education 2009, the annual examination system at the end of each 
year of schooling has been abolished and no student can be held back from progressing 
during the entire duration of the eight years of elementary education. The comprehensive 
and continuous evaluation mandated by the Act is still being devised.17  
</p>
<p>35. A positive example on how to address this can be found in Spain. A new Education 
Law has made it mandatory to assess educational attainment by a general examination at 
the end of (i) primary school, (ii) secondary compulsory education and (iii) the 
baccalaureate. According to article 21 of the Law, students finishing primary school are 
required to undergo a test to examine their knowledge and the skills and competences 
acquired.  
</p>
<p>36. Another example is furnished by France, where national programmes of education 
fixed by the State are mandatory for both public and private schools. Students are evaluated 
twice a year during the elementary education cycle to assess whether a pedagogic 
programme with a common base has been implemented and to mobilize additional support 
for students in need. Those evaluations help to identify any follow-up needed for student 
learning in accordance with a common curricular base.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional and international assessment mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>37. An analysis of prevalent international and regional assessment systems shows their 
narrow scope and that they generally do not adequately incorporate a human rights-based 
approach. The Programme for International Student Assessment of the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is a well-known triennial survey, testing 
the performance of 15 year-old students in reading and mathematical and scientific literacy, 
benchmarking a country&#8217;s performance against that of other participating countries. The 
objective of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study is an even 
narrower method for assessing skills in mathematics. Similarly, the Progress in 
International Reading Literacy Study is limited to literacy assessment. The Latin American 
Laboratory for Assessment of the Quality of Education, a network of national education 
quality assessment directors, produces studies that reflect the state of quality education and 
also contributes to the development of education assessment capacities in the region. 
However, the third regional comparative and explanatory study, conducted in 2013 on the 
learning achievement in the region, is narrowly aimed at assessing learning performance in 
the third and sixth grades in mathematics, reading and writing, including natural sciences 
for the sixth grade. 
</p>
<p>38. Some international evaluation systems do go beyond mere performance evaluation 
in mathematical literacy and language skills. The Programme d&#8217;analyse des syst&#232;mes 
&#233;ducatifs des pays de la Conf&#233;rence des Ministres de l&#8217;Education des &#201;tats et 
gouvernements de la Francophonie conducts a comparative evaluation of the international 
assessment of students and has a broader conceptual approach. This comprises a wide range 
of quality parameters agreed upon by public authorities. Similarly, the national reports 
resulting from the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for the Measurement of 
Education Quality also relate to the monitoring and evaluation of conditions of schooling 
and the quality of education, as described in national Consortium reports. States should 
make a greater effort to look to these examples when developing national evaluation 
mechanisms.

<p><b> C. Repercussions of international assessment mechanisms in developing 
nations 
</b></p>
<p>39. In creating their national assessment mechanisms, many developing countries 
emulate the OECD approach, even though their development requirements vary from those 
of developed countries. Several countries have been developing national assessment 
systems following international and regional assessments, which focus primarily on 
assessing mathematical literacy and language skills, sometimes described as learning 
outcomes, and thereby exclude all else which is learned18. They are often based on a 
random survey methodology, with a ranking of countries, and do not adequately depict  the 
education profile of a country in full measure. The privileging of learning outcomes in the 
discussion about education quality leads to a narrow conception of quality, neglecting the 
process of teaching and learning and the essential inputs for assuring quality and it 
separates quality from equity.19 
</p>
<p>40. Most international and regional assessments generally evaluate the basic knowledge 
and skill levels acquired by students in three curricular areas: language, mathematics and 
sciences. They are &#8220;summative assessments, mainly for stakeholders external to the 
school,&#8221;20 which are ill-equipped to support the developmental needs of students from 
diverse backgrounds effectively and may serve to undermine reforms meant to enhance the 
inclusive nature of basic education. Moreover, they have little direct impact on a child&#8217;s 
progress in the educational system or in life, as demonstrated by a UNESCO International 
Bureau of Education study: &#8220;By virtue of their particular accounts of learning, especially 
among younger students, standardized assessments may contribute to undermining the 
quality of teacher-student interactions and distorting curricular reforms. The IBE believes 
that the balance of assessments should emphasize to a greater extent teacher-designed, 
classroom-based formative assessments aimed at improving teaching and learning 
processes.&#8221; 21  
</p>
<p>41. International assessment mechanisms, with their lopsided focus on learning 
outcomes, neglect a human rights-based approach.22 Such a narrowly construed approach is 
being considered even in the context of discussions on education in the post-2015 
development agenda. The Education for All global monitoring report for 2013&#8211;14 states 
that &#8220;it is vital for a global post-2015 goal to be set which will monitor whether, by 2030, 
all children and youth, regardless of their circumstances, acquire foundation skills in 
reading, writing and mathematics.&#8221;23  
</p>
<p>42. Another notable limitation of international assessment systems is the scant attention 
paid to the role of education in promoting sustainable development - even when this area is

<p>receiving priority consideration in the international community. Similarly, certain key 
concepts, such as learning to live together and respect for the richness of cultural diversity 
as the common heritage of humankind, have received little consideration, whereas they 
should be central to assessing the national educational attainments of students. Indeed, 
there is a lack of reference and attention to the normative provisions contained in the 
resolutions adopted by the General Assembly. A glaring instance of this is the scant 
reference in education assessment mechanisms to the notions and concepts embodied in the 
outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development entitled 
&#8220;The future we want&#8221;.24  
</p>
<p>43. Reading, writing and mathematics are not a complete indication of all learning 
achievements, and even less of what has been learned by a child. The trend of placing too 
much emphasis on learning achievements is to the detriment of the humanistic mission of 
education and must be reversed. The prevalent international assessments of the 
performance of students are premised upon a rather instrumental role of education, driven 
by the concept of development in mere economic terms. They do not reflect universally 
recognized values of human rights. There is a lopsided focus on learning outcomes, with an 
&#8220;input-output&#8221; model, as if there is an analogy between schools and factories25 and as if 
what matters is the material value of education in the narrow sense of economic 
development devoid of any humanistic values.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Developing national assessment systems: current evolutions 
</b></p>
<p>44. Many countries have adopted<b> </b>assessment systems which are national and which 
broaden the scope of the educational assessment of students. They demonstrate how 
assessment systems can be developed to evaluate educational attainments, going beyond a 
narrow approach limited to mathematical literacy and language skills. 
</p>
<p>45. For example, in Brazil<b>,</b> recognition is given to the nationwide assessment of student 
performance, along with the Development Plan for Education (July 2011). The basic 
education assessment system is based on the national examination system, with a single 
quality indicator: the basic education development index, expressed on a 0&#8211;10 scale. The 
achievement and performance of students are assessed at 4th/5th grade (basic education), 
8th/9th grade (final year of compulsory education) and 11th/12th grade (final year of 
secondary education) in both public and private schools. The assessment focuses on 
creative activities and education and on the development of the skills and abilities required 
for the full exercise of citizenship. 
</p>
<p>46. In South Africa, a 10-level framework with descriptors on learning achievements for 
each level has been developed according to the provisions of the National Qualifications 
Framework Act No. 67 of 2008 by the South African Qualifications Authority in order to 
support the design and implementation of qualifications within the national qualifications 
framework and facilitate evaluation criteria for comparability. In Bulgaria, based on the 
State educational requirements, educational evaluation is carried out during the cycle of 
primary and secondary school education, including vocational training and professional 
education, through regular school tests and examinations, with a qualitative and 
quantitative index applied to grades having. 
</p>
<p>47. The concept of the quality of education in China centres around the holistic 
development of morals, intellect, physical strength and aesthetic aptitude, and increasing 
attention is being paid to nurturing practical abilities and creativity, as outlined in the 2001

<p>comprehensive curriculum reform guidelines. Established in 2007, the National Centre for 
Basic Education Quality Assessment plays a leading role in developing and supporting the 
conduct of education assessments in China. It is in the process of setting up a national 
education quality assessment system to consider those broader criteria. 
</p>
<p>48. In<b> </b>Qatar<b>, </b>annual student evaluations from the 4th to the 12th grade have been 
conducted since 2003 by the Supreme Education Council. A graded system was introduced 
in 2011 in the annual test, with a minimum pass requirement of 30 per cent of total marks. 
The Supreme Education Council has started to put more focus on this by providing training 
courses for teachers and displaying model tests on its site, thus providing school principals 
and teachers with plans and strategies for the quality of teaching to match the level of the 
national tests. Moreover, the results of the national tests are taken into consideration for 
evaluating and improving school performance.  
</p>
<p>49. Education is evaluated locally, regionally and nationally in Finland. The activities of 
education providers are guided by objectives laid down in legislation and in the national 
core curricula and qualification requirements. The system relies on the proficiency of 
teachers and other personnel. National evaluations are done annually, with arts and crafts 
evaluated alongside academic subjects, aiming to follow at the national level how well the 
objectives of the national core curricula and qualification requirements are being met 
locally.  
</p>
<p>50. In Kenya,<b> </b>under Article 64 (1) of the Basic Education Act of 2013 the Education 
Standards and Quality Assurance Council was established to ensure standards and to 
maintain quality by monitoring the conduct of assessments and examinations in institutions 
of basic education. The Act lays down a national qualifications framework (article 68 (1)) 
which will be developed in collaboration with the relevant stakeholders to set standards and 
benchmarks for qualifications and competencies, and provides for the recognition of the 
attainment of competencies, including skills, knowledge, attitudes and values. Article 74 of 
the Act provides for a Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development, whose mandate is to 
include curriculum development for basic education. 
</p>
<p>51. As part of fundamental reforms of the education system, undertaken since the 
beginning of 2013 in Mexico and premised on education as a fundamental right, articles 3 
and 73 of the constitution were amended, strengthening the National Institute for the 
Evaluation of Education. With full autonomy as a constitutional body, it has a mandate to 
evaluate the quality of teaching professionally, with both teachers and government 
authorities sharing that responsibility. On 13 August 2013, the Law on the National 
Institute for the Evaluation of Education as well as the General Law on Professional 
Teaching Service were amended to improve them as performance assessment instruments 
for achieving free, equitable, quality public education as a legal responsibility, as well as an 
ethical obligation of the Government. 
</p>
<p>52. In a drive towards improving standards and quality, in 2013, Seychelles<b> </b>developed a 
national assessment framework to foster the holistic development of children to enable 
them to acquire the knowledge, skills, competences and attitudes necessary in today&#8217;s 
world. With an emphasis on &#8220;acceptable professional standards&#8221; of quality, the framework 
provides that &#8220;Assessments shall be conducted in accordance with regulations at the end of 
each key stage of primary and secondary schooling to evaluate the performance of students 
in relation to the targets of the national curriculum.&#8221;26 
</p>
<p>53. In order to improve the teaching and learning provided by the national education 
system, the evaluation of student performance in Ecuador aims, through the application of 
various assessment instruments, to evaluate the attitudes and skills of the student, i.e. an

<p>assessment of the knowledge, skills and values developed as a result of the educational 
process and their application in everyday life. The evaluation of education enables the 
Government to track the quality of education and to identify strategies to make 
improvements. 
</p>
<p>54. In Namibia, competencies, and core skills and key learning areas were identified in 
relation to the Namibia Vision 2030 as a national curriculum for basic education for the 
continual assessment of progress and achievements in the 5th and 8th grades, using 
nationally standardized assessments and national examinations. &#8220;Both school-based 
assessments and end-of-year examinations assess the knowledge, skills and understandings 
specified in the subject syllabuses.&#8221;27  
</p><p>55. In all such national measures, greater focus on a human-rights based approach, as 
already mentioned, is important, keeping in view the right to education in its full 
expression. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Assessing technical and vocational education and training 
</b></p>
<p>56. As described by the Special Rapporteur in his previous report (A/67/310), technical 
and vocational education and training (TVET) is an integral part of the right to basic 
education at the secondary level. Educational institutions must be supported to develop 
quality innovative programmes, including technical and vocational training and lifelong 
learning, geared to bridging skills gaps in order to advance sustainable development 
objectives.28 In fact, skills development through TVET has emerged as a leading concern in 
improving the quality of education in an increasingly globalized economy. Such training 
has profound implications in the twenty-first century for radically different knowledge-
based economies and societies.29 This is all the more important in view of the need to better 
promote the skills required by the emerging &#8220;green economy&#8221;, requiring novel means to 
assess competencies and skills in &#8220;green technology&#8221;. </p>
<p>57. However, development programmes for technical and vocational education and 
training and skills have not been adequately addressed in the most common international or 
regional assessments. National assessment mechanisms for those programmes must better 
evaluate how well they empower students to acquire the necessary competencies for the 
development requirements of their country, while still meeting the broader human rights-
based objectives. Existing normative frameworks for TVET provide the basis for 
developing national assessments to appraise the acquisition of those competencies and 
skills by students. The UNESCO Revised Recommendation concerning Technical and 
Vocational Education (2001) stipulates that member States should aim to apply relevant 
and appropriate internationally recommended standards and norms relating to systems of 
assessment or evaluation; occupational qualifications and certification; and equipment and 
technical standards. The Recommendation also underlines the importance of the exchange 
of good practices and methods. Similarly, International Labour Organization (ILO) 
Recommendation No. 195 (2004) concerning Human Resources Development: Education, 
Training and Lifelong Learning stipulates that measures should be adopted, in consultation 
with social partners and using a national qualifications framework, to promote the 
development, implementation and financing of a transparent mechanism for the assessment, 
certification and recognition of skills, including prior learning and previous experience,

<p>irrespective of the countries where they were acquired and whether acquired formally or 
informally. Moreover, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights requires 
States in their reporting to indicate the measures taken to increase the availability of TVET 
programmes and whether they enable students to acquire knowledge and skills which 
contribute to their personal development, self-reliance and employability 
(HRI/GEN/2/Rev.6, section II, para. 60). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Towards a new and unique approach 
</b></p>
<p>58. National assessment mechanisms for TVET programmes require a new and unique assessment mechanism to reflect how they differ from traditional academic programmes. 
TVET programmes involve private-public partnerships under the overall responsibility of 
Governments and institutionalized collaboration between TVET institutions and 
enterprises. A dual system of vocational training where students in vocational streams also 
undergo practical learning and training in enterprises is well organized in some developed 
countries and is a useful example for the developing world to draw upon for devising 
innovative policies and approaches.  
</p>
<p>59. Governments, enterprises and TVET institutions must thus be collectively involved 
in defining the vocational trades and in developing assessment mechanisms of the 
attainments of students as part of a tripartite system. This is indispensable for ensuring that 
TVET graduates are responsive to ever-changing national and private sector employment 
requirements, with the State also ensuring that TVET programmes and the assessments of 
them are supplemented by a broader human rights-based education.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Qualification frameworks for skills and competencies, including 
recognition of skills in the informal sector 
</b></p>
<p>60. In an endeavour to transform technical and vocational education and training, novel 
approaches are emerging to assess TVET programmes. For example, countries in Latin 
America have adopted a competency-based approach, such as the Occupational 
Competency Standardization and Certification Council in Mexico and the National Service 
of Learning (Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje) in Colombia. Similarly, the National 
Programme for the integration between professional and basic education for young people 
and adults (PROEJA), established in 2006 in Brazil, is aimed at providing technical and 
vocational education and training at the basic and secondary education levels, as well as 
providing continuing technical education for young adults. 
</p>
<p>61. The emerging concept of technical and vocational skills development in Africa calls 
for novel mechanisms in the form of national qualification frameworks. In South Africa, 
the national qualifications framework provides a mechanism for awarding qualifications 
based on the attainment of specified learning skills prescribed by industry. It allows for the 
accumulation of credits and for the recognition of prior learning. Similarly, the Mauritius 
Education and Human Resource Strategy Plan 2008&#8211;2020 recognizes the need for creative 
learning &#8211; the acquisition of skills and competencies that unlock the human potential &#8211; as a 
paramount necessity since education is one of the cardinal drivers of economic growth, 
including a quality assurance system. Accordingly, a qualifications authority in the TVET 
sector has been established.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur considers that it is important for each country to develop a 
national framework of certification, recognizing and validating various modes of the 
acquisition of skills in a coherent and unified system. The recognition of prior learning, as 
expressed in ILO Recommendation No. 195, can help to bridge the divide between formal 
and informal technical and vocational skills development systems by providing 
mechanisms and opportunities for the recognition and validation of experiential learning. It </p>


<p>is also necessary to ensure that the assessment mechanisms for TVET are founded on 
competence-based training, not only on theory-based certification.30  
</p>
<p>63. Quality standards can set minimum skill requirements for graduate apprentices, with 
monitoring mechanisms to ensure they meet those standards. It is also necessary to improve 
the linkages between informal apprenticeships and formal education and training, in 
particular regarding the role of skills development in national policies and laws.31  
</p>
<p>64. In developing national qualification frameworks and assessing competencies, it is 
crucial to ensure that they are not limited to technical competencies in TVET, but also 
include critical thinking and are not devoid of a human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p>65. Finally, national assessment systems for TVET can be used as leverage in valorizing 
social perceptions of TVET and their status, since they do not enjoy the esteem that would 
be commensurate with their importance for development. Instituting national awards in 
conjunction with an assessment of performance in TVET is an important step in that 
direction. The practice of rewarding TVET students in China is a good example.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Human rights-based assessment modalities and some areas of 
special concern 
</b></p>
<p>66. It is up to States to adopt national assessment mechanisms which ensure that their 
education systems are in conformity with human rights law, including but not limited to 
those relating to the right to education. 
</p>
<p>67. National assessment systems should evaluate how human rights values and 
knowledge have been acquired by students. Performance tests should be devised to assess 
the extent to which students have incorporated those values into their understanding, 
commitment and day-to-day behaviour patterns. This constitutes a response to rising levels 
of violence in many schools, a phenomenon which deserves consideration in assessing 
school-based evaluations.  
</p>
<p><b> A. The key role of teachers 
</b></p>
<p>68. It is the teacher who conveys the national curricula to students and assesses their 
performance. Teachers should be able to develop in children a love of learning. They 
should be able to kindle in children and adults the capacity for critical thinking, as well as 
nurturing in them ethical and moral values. Four pillars of education - learning to know, 
learning to do, learning to live together and learning to be &#8211; propounded by the Delors 
Report - are central to the teaching-learning process.  
</p>
<p>69. The quality of teaching and learning at the basic education level is an important 
factor in national assessment. Teachers<b> </b>are also key to linking assessments to improved 
learning. Moreover, they play a valuable role in accomplishing the humanistic mission of 
education. 
</p>
<p>70. The UNESCO Recommendation Concerning the Status of Teachers, adopted by the 
Special Intergovernmental Conference on the Status of Teachers in 1966, lays down a 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>30
 For instance, the traditional diplomas for vocational education in India, as awarded in the industrial 
</p>
<p>training institutes, have in recent times been challenged for their lack of direct correlation to the 
contemporary needs of industry and the economy.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>31
 See, for instance, ILO, &#8220;Upgrading informal apprenticeship: a resource guide for Africa&#8221; (Geneva, 
</p>
<p>2012), p.82, available from http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---
ifp_skills/documents/publication/wcms_171393.pdf. </p>


<p>comprehensive normative framework on the teaching profession. It also recognizes the 
essential role of teachers in educational advancement. It applies to all teachers in both 
private and public schools and provides guidance on a diverse range of matters, including 
the roles and responsibilities of teachers. 
</p>
<p>71. Teacher training programmes must emphasize not just pedagogical skills, but also 
the assessments of students. Innovative programmes for revamping teacher education and 
development are necessary to devise novel modalities of teacher training in tandem with 
reforms in education. In France, for example, teacher evaluation, including a questionnaire, 
is also part of the student learning process. In-service training for teachers is a permanent 
requirement, not only to improve their qualifications or to keep them up to date with the 
latest teaching practices, but also to ensure their assessment skills are kept up to date. The 
need for &#8220;standard[s] frameworks, which could be applied nationally and regionally&#8221;32 has 
been underlined. 
</p>
<p>72. A student-centred system of education and evaluation would include a detailed 
assessment record of each student&#8217;s progress through the curriculum. While not all students 
progress at the same rate, a personalized assessment allows teachers, teaching assistants or 
even student mentors in a higher grade to provide support so that each student completes 
each module in the curriculum without suffering from the social stigma associated with 
being held back. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Periodically updating the curricula 
</b></p>
<p>73. Universally recognized human rights values and democratic principles should be 
embedded in any education system, and incorporated into national curricula for basic 
education. It is important for public authorities to review their national curriculum 
periodically in order to respond to emerging requirements. It is also necessary to ensure that 
textbooks in all schools &#8211; private or public &#8211; and the contents of the curricula are in 
conformity with the values and objectives of education laid down in international human 
rights conventions and expounded by the work of the human rights treaty bodies. Moreover, curricula and the contents of education must keep pace with global concerns 
with new ethics for our common humanity.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Aptitude testing 
</b></p>
<p>74. The aptitude of students should be given serious consideration in assessing their 
attainments. The evaluation of the abilities and aptitudes of children in consultation with 
parents and teachers can be useful in enabling them to realize their potential, leading to 
better attainments. In Lithuania, for example, evaluation in primary and basic education is 
driven by the concept of the assessment of pupils&#8217; achievement and progress, encouraging 
positive personal features and creativity and improving personal achievements. The main 
idea is assessment for learning, not assessment of learning. 
</p>
<p>75. In this context, the State of Gujarat in India is exemplary in taking steps towards 
abolishing the conventional &#8220;character&#8221; certificate, systematically delivered to all students 
at the end of primary or secondary education, and replacing it with an &#8220;aptitude&#8221; certificate, 
which shows the aptitude of students as appraised by teachers, parents and students 
themselves, allowing them to pursue secondary or higher education. This has the inherent 
advantage of motivating students to pursue studies based on their aptitude.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>

 See Mauritius communiqu&#233;, 18th Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers, available from 
</p>
<p>http://secretariat.thecommonwealth.org/document/249627/18ccemcommunique.htm. </p>


<p>76. Aptitude tests and counselling are even more important for skills development. 
National assessment mechanisms should be coupled with &#8220;career guidance systems to assist 
learners in choosing appropriate pathways, including by the provision of up&#8208;to&#8208;date labour 
market information and self-assessment tools to identify aptitudes and interests and 
promote the acquisition of career management skills.&#8221;33 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Private providers of education  
</b></p>
<p>77. Exploding demand for education has led to an exponential growth in the number of 
education providers. A comprehensive and sound regulatory framework for controlling 
private schools and ensuring their conformity with norms and standards is required. To 
preserve the public interest in education, effective sanctions in cases of abusive practices by 
private providers are necessary. Each State must organize a system of prior authorization, 
successive monitoring and verification, in order to ensure that private schools respect the 
content and objectives of education, thus enabling the State, in turn, to respect its 
international commitments in that regard. In those States where basic education is also 
provided by private schools, the State should ensure that such schools fully respect the 
objectives and content of education.  
</p><p>78. In this context, it is important to note that, whereas parents and guardians are at 
liberty to choose private schools for their children, pursuant to article 13 (3)  and (4) of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, education in such schools 
must conform to the educational objectives set out in article 13 (1) of the Covenant and 
&#8220;such minimum educational standards as may be laid down or approved by the State&#8221;. 
Those minimum standards may relate to issues such as admission, curricula and the 
recognition of certificates. In their turn, those standards must be consistent with the 
educational objectives set out in article 13 (1).34  
</p>
<p><b> IX. Conclusions  
</b>79. <b>Commitments made by the international community to the realization of the 
right to basic education are well known. A major constraint emanates from the non-
fulfilment by States of their obligations. Whether States have fulfilled their obligations 
for the right to education is dependent not just upon how many years of schooling 
children have attended, but also upon whether what they have learned has 
empowered them in their lives. That is shown by assessing the educational 
achievements of students against a national curriculum which is consistent with the 
objectives of the right to education. Comprehensive national assessment mechanisms 
must be recognized as valuable tools for students, schools as well as for States. Those 
assessments ensure that the achievements of each student are tracked and, where 
necessary, improved. Nationally, they enable States to adjust their curriculum, 
teacher training and education systems more broadly to ensure that the right to 
education is achieved in the fullest sense.

<p>80. <b>Prevalent international assessments of the performance of students reflect an 
instrumental role for education, driven by the concept of educational development in 
mere economic terms, with excessive emphasis placed on learning outcomes in

<p><b>mathematical literacy and language skills. The Special Rapporteur considers that 
such a narrow approach is detrimental to the humanistic mission of education and 
undermines the essential objectives assigned to education in international human 
rights conventions. International assessments also affect national assessment systems, 
thus perpetuating such a narrow approach. A paradigm shift is necessary to make 
assessment systems more broadly based so that they embody in full measure the 
essential objectives of the right to education, in accordance with human rights law, 
and are premised upon a human rights-based holistic approach. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>In that spirit, the national assessment systems of the educational attainments of 
students in basic education need to be revamped and developed so as to demonstrate 
that every child completes at least a primary education of good quality, in line with 
the core obligation of States, and is given access to good quality secondary education, 
with technical and vocational education and training (TVET) as an integral 
component. Assessment mechanisms for TVET-led skills development deserve greater 
consideration in evaluating how TVET programmes empower their beneficiaries to 
acquire the necessary competencies and skills which respond to a the development 
requirements of a country, while also recognizing the importance of a human rights 
perspective.  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Teachers are vital to the implementation of the national curricula and in 
conducting assessments of the educational attainments of students. Teacher training 
programmes need to be reinforced to enhance not just the pedagogical capacities of 
teachers, but also their ability to assess the educational attainments of students.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>It is also important to initiate a public debate on the educational attainments of 
students and to foster education systems which embody the spirit of human values and 
human dignity. Education must not lead students merely to be immersed in 
materialistic values and pursuits in life, devoid of the values of human rights and of 
solidarity and mutual understanding and respect for each other&#8217;s culture. It must also 
prepare children for the responsibilities of freedom in keeping with the institutional 
mandates of UNESCO and UNICEF. The intellectual community, civil society 
organizations and particularly parliamentarians, as lawmakers and public figures, 
can make a significant contribution in this respect. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The work of the human rights treaty bodies and the United Nations agencies 
can be valuable in raising the importance of national assessments of the educational 
attainments of students that encompass a human rights-based approach to education.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to state that the realization of the right to 
basic education of quality for all, including skills development, deserves a central 
place in the post-2015 development agenda<i>.</i> From that perspective, national 
assessments of the educational attainments of students would need to evolve with a 
future-oriented perspective, in order to meet the key challenges of achieving such 
universal goals for education as may be agreed to in future development agendas. 
Education systems, including national assessments, will need to be kept abreast of 
such developments, bearing in mind the resolve of the international community in 
reaffirming its commitments to the right to education and to &#8220;full access to quality 
education at all levels&#8221; as an &#8220;essential condition for achieving sustainable 
development&#8221;.</b>35<b>

<p><b> X. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Recommendations to States 
</b>86. <b>Regarding the adoption of a human rights-based framework, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that:  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States move towards a more holistic approach in assessing student 
attainments which goes beyond reading, writing and arithmetic and which 
incorporates essential human rights objectives. The four pillars of the Delors Report 
&#8211; learning to know, learning to do, learning to be and learning to live together &#8211; 
should become an integral part of any assessment of the educational attainments of 
students. Moreover, national assessment mechanisms must be in compliance with a 
country&#8217;s international human rights obligations;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States ensure that national assessments of the educational attainments of 
students are founded on a human-rights based approach, where the right to 
education remains at centre stage.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Regarding the development of a holistic approach to the assessment of the 
educational attainments of students, the Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States recognize the need and the importance of a holistic approach, with 
the full range of obligations arising from the right to education, in assessing the 
educational attainments of students. Such assessments should centre around the core 
objectives of education, as established by international human rights conventions;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Public authorities and school administrators ensure that the assessment of 
the educational attainments of students includes their understanding of universal 
human rights values and respect for people from different civilizations, cultures and 
religions. Student performance tests should demonstrate the extent to which students 
have incorporated human rights values in their understanding, commitments and 
day-to-day behaviour patterns.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Regarding</b> <b>periodic reviews of national curricula, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that:</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Governments periodically review their national curriculum to ensure that 
its contents are updated and in conformity with the values and objectives of education 
laid down in international human rights conventions and as expounded by the United 
Nations treaty bodies and relevant agencies.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Regarding equity-based approaches to assessments of the entire student 
population, the Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>National assessments appraise the educational attainments of the entire 
student population in a country, assessing all students uniformly. An equity-based 
approach should be an essential prerequisite, so that all those students who are found 
to be underperforming are given the necessary support needed for them to meet the 
educational requirements. Student assessments must address with great concern the 
situation of underperforming students, particularly those who are disadvantaged on 
account of marginalization. Early targeted teaching support to them is most effective 
and should be prioritized over later interventions. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>In relation to assessing progression from primary to secondary education, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States comply fully with their core obligation of providing free, compulsory 
primary education of good quality to every child, boys and girls alike. Completion of 
good quality primary education should be a predominant concern in the national </b></p>


<p><b>assessment of basic education, with no automatic progression from primary to 
secondary education. This can only be verified through assessments prior to 
progression to secondary education, with &#8220;recognized qualification&#8221; at the end of 
primary education cycle. Public authorities should ensure the maintenance of quality 
standards throughout the cycle of basic education in a sustained manner. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Regarding the development of novel assessment mechanisms for skills 
development, the Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>While recognizing the importance of national assessment mechanisms for 
TVET programmes, Governments should develop new and unique assessment 
mechanisms within a framework of institutionalized collaboration with industry for 
assessing competencies and skills in terms of technical qualifications that are relevant 
to a country&#8217;s development priorities. TVET programmes, particularly in early 
secondary levels, must be made complementary to the standard education curriculum 
and not as a separate stream. The aptitude of students should be central to those new 
assessment systems, offering them the possibility of pathways to higher education. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>In relation to refining assessment mechanisms, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that : 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Public authorities ensure that the basic education which is provided is of 
good quality, as proven by an appropriate national assessment mechanism, conducted 
annually or on a semester system. While school examination and tests constitute 
necessary mechanisms for assessing the educational attainments of students, 
Governments should devise innovative modalities, appropriate to the capacities of the 
State, to evaluate the knowledge and understanding of students of all the subjects 
taught, including human rights values. </b></p>
<p>93. <b>Regarding the development of the capacity of the teaching profession for the 
holistic assessment of basic education, the Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recognizing that teachers play a key role in the implementation of the 
national curricula and in conducting assessments of the educational attainments of 
students, Governments should ensure that teachers are provided with the additional 
training and support to better understand and implement a human rights-based 
curriculum in an accessible fashion for their students. Novel modalities of teacher 
training in tandem with reforms in education should be devised to foster quality 
education and learning.  </b></p>
<p>94. <b>In relation to strengthening national assessment mechanisms with 
parliamentarians, the Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Given their leadership role, parliamentarians should take up the cause of 
education, leading the processes aimed at giving effect to the right to education and 
strengthening national assessment mechanisms to that effect. They can thus 
contribute to promoting the educational attainments of students.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>In relation to encouraging and supporting civil society organizations and 
NGOs, the Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Governments encourage NGOs and civil society organizations in their 
valuable role in raising the level of the public debate on key issues and in defending a 
holistic approach to student assessments. As such, the public authorities should 
maintain a constructive dialogue with NGOs and civil society organizations. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>In regard to the promotion of studies on national assessments, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>As research and studies on national assessments are scant as compared to 
those on international or regional assessment systems, reflections and studies on </b></p>


<p><b>national assessments of the educational attainments of students in education faculties 
and among professional bodies should be promoted, so as to make existing national 
assessment mechanisms and country-level experience better known. That would also 
benefit policymaking authorities in improving assessment mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>States continue to champion the cause of quality education in the 
formulation of the post-2015 development agenda. Enhancing educational 
attainments for the benefit of both the individual and society should be a central 
concern in any future agenda, with a reinforced commitment by the international 
community in appreciation of the pivotal role of the right to education for human 
development. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Engaging Governments more responsively through the work of the 
human rights treaty bodies and the United Nations agencies 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to make the following recommendations to 
United Nations and intergovernmental bodies: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Within the scope of their respective mandates, when considering the right 
to education in their dialogue with States, the human rights treaty bodies should 
accord importance to ensuring that the educational attainments of students are 
assessed from a broader, human-rights-based approach;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Within their respective institutional missions, UNESCO and UNICEF 
should accord the foremost importance to a human rights-based approach to  
national student assessments in order to prepare children for the &#8220;responsibilities of 
freedom&#8221;. They should accordingly encourage and support Governments in their 
endeavours to that effect, providing the necessary technical assistance and advisory 
services;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Similarly, ILO and the United Nations Industrial Development 
Organization have special roles and responsibilities in the area of skills development, 
and should reinforce their activities in technical assistance for assessment of new 
areas of technical knowledge and competencies, while improving linkages between 
informal apprenticeship and formal vocational education and training. Recognition of 
the qualifications of students who have undertaken technical and vocational 
education and training should include graduate apprentices in rural economies and 
the informal sector; </b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The United Nations agencies should take a coordinated interest in assisting 
in the development of educational assessment systems that meet international human 
rights standards and which are also conducive to skills development as part of quality 
imperatives.  
</b></p>
