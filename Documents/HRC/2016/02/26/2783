<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In the present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 18/11, 
the Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound 
management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes gives his findings and makes 
recommendations on the basis of his visits to the Marshall Islands and the United States of 
America, during which he aimed to assess the impact on human rights of the nuclear testing 
programme conducted in the Marshall Islands by the United States from 1946 to 1958, 
focusing also on the efforts made by both Governments to mitigate its adverse effects.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur explores the adverse impact on human rights of the testing 
programme, in particular those resulting from hazardous substances and wastes. He 
discusses efforts to mitigate or eliminate these adverse effects, and concludes the report 
with his recommendations thereon.

the agreement on the implementation of section 177 offers full and final settlement of 
claims arising from the nuclear testing programme, while others contend that the overriding 
intent of Congress was to contemplate such action only if compensation has been just and 
adequate; otherwise, there would have been no need for the changed circumstances 
provision. Even though resolving the legislative tension of the provisions contained in the 
Compact falls outside the scope of the present report, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes

<p> III. Impact on the enjoyment of human rights ...............................................................  19&#8211;<footnote name="3">4. The Marshallese have found it difficult to maintain their distinct cultural identity and 
the traditional bond to their lands. One of the challenges to assessing the loss of land use 
has been the differing concept of what constitutes land. The United States of America 
proposed to calculate land loss on the basis of commercial rent values. The Marshallese, as 
indigenous peoples, have a culturally distinctive relationship to land. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, which the United States has endorsed. Specifically, article 26 of the Declaration 
underlines the right of indigenous peoples to the lands, territories and resources that they 
have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired. In this regard, States 
have an obligation to give legal recognition and protection to these lands, territories and 
resources, with due respect for the customs, traditions and land tenure systems of the 
indigenous peoples concerned. The Special Rapporteur encourages both States to use the 
Declaration as a basis for further discussions on unresolved land issues.

Enewetak, Rongelap and Utrok Atolls, has created nomads who are disconnected from their 
lands and their cultural and indigenous way of life; for example, the Marshallese engaged in 
migratory practices to gather different types of cultural goods (ranging from fish, fruits and 
medicines to materials for housing) from the islands and atolls. Today, they are unable to 
perform these migratory practices and harvest their cultural goods because, in some cases, 
the islands and atolls have been contaminated by nuclear fallout. In addition, it should be 
considered that, in their matriarchal society, land is passed from mother to child; 
displacement from their lands has denied Marshallese women the right to exercise their 
cultural and other rights and their role as custodians of land in society.

<p>  B. Displacement ..................................................................................................  32&#8211;<footnote name="3">2. The Special Rapporteur heard the accounts of women survivors of the shame that 
they had experienced during the relocation process, when they were subjected to 
examinations with Geiger counters while naked and hosed down with liquid in the presence 
of their male relatives, as well as enduring on-site analysis of their pubic hair by American 
male personnel. In this context, many women, in particular those from Rongelap Atoll, 
were stigmatized, which affected their prospects for marriage and motherhood. In order to 
prevent such incidents from recurring, In the interests of non-recurrence the Special 
Rapporteur urges all States to adhere to the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement,17 
which identify the rights and guarantees relevant to the protection of persons from forced 
displacement and their protection and assistance during displacement, as well as during 
return or resettlement and reintegration. Guiding Principle 8, which declares that 
displacement should not be carried out in a manner that violates the rights to life, dignity, 
liberty and security of those affected, is particularly relevant.

the United States Congress, in which it stated, inter alia, that certain information, including 
subsequent declassified Department of Energy and Department of Defense documents, had 
not been available at the time of the negotiations on the Compact; the information 
apparently showed that the extent of radioactive fallout had been underestimated, and that 
advances in science and knowledge of radiogenic effects had provided more accurate 
assessments of the full impact of nuclear testing on people and the environment since the 
agreement came into force in 1986. The United States administration also presented its 
evaluation of the petition to Congress, asserting that the petition did not meet the set criteria 
for changed circumstances and hence there was no legal basis for considering additional 
funds. To date, Congress has not acted on the petition.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of environmentally 
sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes conducted a visit to 
the Marshall Islands from 27 to 30 March 2012, and to the United States of America from 
24 to 27 April 2012. Both visits were carried out at the invitation of the respective 
Governments. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank both Governments for their 
cooperation during the visits. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur conducted the two visits as part of his efforts to examine, in 
a spirit of cooperation and dialogue (a) the effects of the nuclear testing programme of the 
United States in the Marshall Islands between 1946 and 1958, when it was under United 
Nations trusteeship, on the enjoyment of human rights; (b) the efforts made by both 
Governments to eliminate or mitigate the negative effects of the testing on the Marshallese 
population, and the sound management of hazardous substances and wastes associated with 
nuclear testing; and (c) the lessons learned and additional measures necessary to ensure the 
full realization of the victims&#8217; right to an effective remedy. The findings of both visits are 
therefore presented in one comprehensive report.  
</p>
<p>3. During his four-day visit to the Marshall Islands, the Special Rapporteur met with 
the President, Christopher J. Loeak; members of the <i>Nitijela</i> (parliament); the Minister-in-
Assistance to the President; the Chief Secretary; the Assistant Attorney General; the 
Adviser on Nuclear Issues; representatives of the Environmental Protection Authority, the 
Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Resources and Development, and the Council of <i>Iroij</i> 
(elders); and the mayors and people of Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap and Utrok Atolls. The 
Special Rapporteur also had the opportunity to visit Ejit Island, to where the inhabitants of 
Bikini relocated, as well as certain places in Majuro where the former inhabitants of 
Enewetak and Utrok now reside. The Special Rapporteur also met with the Ambassador of 
the United States to the Marshall Islands, representatives of the United States Department 
of Energy, and members of academia and civil society. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for coordinating his 
visit to the Marshall Islands. He expresses his appreciation to the United Nations Joint 
Presence in Majuro and the Pacific Regional Office of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights for their support during the visit. In addition, the 
Special Rapporteur expresses his sincere gratitude to civil society representatives who took 
the time to meet with him during his visit to the Marshall Islands. The Special Rapporteur 
was particularly honoured to receive the personal testimony of several of the survivors of 
the testing period, as well as accounts of descendants of those since deceased.  
</p>
<p>5. During his four-day visit to the United States of America, the Special Rapporteur 
met with representatives of the Department of State, the Department of Energy, the 
Department of Defense, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the 
National Cancer Institute, as well as with academics and members of civil society 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Department of State for coordinating his visit and 
for its cooperation and flexibility in arranging the schedule. He also thanks the civil society 
representatives who took the time to meet with him during his visit. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur sent a questionnaire to the Government of the Marshall 
Islands and to that of the United States of America on 21 March 2012 to complement the 
information gathered during the course of his visits. He received their responses on 26 
March and 24 April 2012, respectively. 
</p>
<p>8. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that many issues concerning nuclear 
testing in the Marshall Islands must be resolved, he emphasizes that the purpose of the 
present report is neither to apportion blame to either State nor to attempt to make a legal </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 
</b></p>
<p>pronouncement on the nuclear testing programmes. Much has already been written in this 
vein and the Special Rapporteur wishes rather to stimulate constructive and forward-
looking dialogue between the parties in the spirit of understanding, respect and 
reconciliation, for the benefit of the Marshallese people.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur is cognizant of the effects of the nuclear testing programme 
on the health of United States war veterans who were not necessarily aware of the 
consequences of their own exposure to hazardous substances and wastes. He also realizes 
that people in territories where other countries conducted similar nuclear testing 
programmes, for example in Algeria, French Polynesia and Kazakhstan, were affected.1 
Such concerns, however, lay outside the scope of the present report, also owing to practical 
limitations. The report presents nonetheless an opportunity to provide good practices in the 
area of addressing the human rights impact of nuclear testing programmes generally and, in 
particular, to other States involved in such programmes and the populations whose rights 
may be affected.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Nuclear testing programme in the Marshall Islands 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Marshall Islands comprised 29 low-lying coral atolls and five islands, totalling 
70 square miles of land scattered over 750,000 square miles of ocean. After centuries of 
successive colonial rule by Spain, Germany and Japan, the Marshall Islands was designated 
a Trust Territory pursuant to Security Council resolution 21 (1947), and the United States 
of America was designated as the Administering Authority. The Security Council 
designated the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, which comprised the present-day 
Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Northern Mariana Islands and 
Palau as a strategic area, and placed it under the United Nations international trusteeship 
system. Under the terms of resolution 21 (1947), the United States was charged with 
fostering the development of political institutions, promoting economic, social and 
educational advancement, and moving the Trust Territory towards self-governance. 
Importantly, as the Security Council designated the Marshall Islands a &#8220;strategic area&#8221;, it 
granted to the United States, as the Administering Authority, permission to militarize the 
territory. Notably, the Administering Authority was entrusted &#8220;to protect the land, 
resources, and health of Micronesia&#8217;s inhabitants&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>11. In article 16 of resolution 21 (1947), the Security Council, having approved the 
terms of trusteeship on 2 April 1947, provided that the Trusteeship Agreement would enter 
into force when approved by the Government of the United States of America after the 
completion of a due constitutional process. On 18 July 1947, the Congress of the United 
States enacted a joint resolution accepting the Trusteeship Agreement, which was approved 
by the President the same day.  
</p>
<p>12. On 1 July 1946,before the Trusteeship Agreement came into force, the United States 
of America moved the 167 inhabitants of Bikini Atoll to the smaller Rongerik Atoll in order 
to commence nuclear tests, known as &#8220;Operation Crossroads&#8221;. After enduring periods of 
near starvation and malnutrition due to limited food supplies on Rongerik Atoll, in 1948 
they were relocated to Kwajalein Atoll, where they were housed in tents along the military 
airstrip. Soon after, they were moved again to Kili, a small island with no lagoon, no

 1  According to the report of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic 
</p>
<p>Radiation for 2000, the total number of atmospheric tests carried out by all countries as at 1998 was 
541, with a yield of 440 megatons and a fission yield of 189 megatons. Depending on the altitude of 
the explosion, radioactive residues dispersed into the environment locally, regionally and globally, 
and caused the largest collective radiation doses to humans from man-made sources. As at 1998, the 
total number of all underground tests by all countries was 1,<footnote name="8">A routine diagnostic chest X-ray is equivalent to about 0.05 mSv, while a comprehensive X-ray 
examination may lead to a dose as high as 10 mSv. 
</footnote>67, with an estimated yield of 90 
megatons.  </p>

<p>protective reef and no fishing grounds. Eventually, 139 Bikinians returned to Bikini Atoll in 
1972, but were again moved to Kili Island and Ejit Island of Majuro Atoll owing to the 
radiation exceeding permissible levels on Bikini Atoll. The people of Bikini Atoll also 
decided not to return their homes. Indeed, in 1998, the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) recommended that the Atoll not be permanently resettled under the present 
radiological conditions or until certain specified remediation action had been taken.<footnote name="2">009 annual report, p. 108. Available from 
http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/pcp/annualreports/pcp08-09rpt/PCP_Report_08-09_508.pdf. 
</footnote> The 
inhabitants of Rongelap Atoll also were evacuated in 1946, returned in 1957 and, 
ultimately, moved voluntarily from Rongelap in 1985. 
</p>
<p>13. Enewetak Atoll later became another testing site, and 145 people were moved to 
Ujelang Atoll. The detonation of the world&#8217;s first hydrogen bomb vaporized one of the 
islands of Enewetak. The testing continued; on 1 March 1954, the Castle Bravo test3 
resulted in a blast 1,000 times the explosive power of the bombing of Hiroshima on Bikini 
Atoll, making it the most powerful known detonation made by the United States. The 
nuclear weapon&#8217;s high explosive yield created a fallout cloud that covered Rongelap Atoll 
(100 miles from the blast site) and Utrok Atoll (320 miles from the blast site).  
</p>
<p>14. Two months later, on 6 May 1954, the Marshallese people filed a petition with the 
United Nations Trusteeship Council regarding the nuclear testing, which received a hearing 
on 20 August 1954 (see chapter IV).<footnote name="4">1. The agreement for the implementation of section 177 of the Compact was enacted 
to, inter alia, &#8220;create and maintain, in perpetuity, means to address past, present, and future 
consequences of the Nuclear Testing Programme, including the resolution of resultant 
claims.&#8221; The provision on changed circumstances under article IX of the agreement 
provides that additional funding may be requested from the United States Congress for loss 
or damage arising from the nuclear testing programme if such loss or damage is 
&#8220;discovered after the effective date&#8221; of the agreement and the &#8220;injury could not reasonably 
have been identified as of the effective date of the agreement&#8221; and failure to provide for the 
injuries would render the agreement &#8220;manifestly inadequate&#8221;. Under article X, the Marshall 
Islands agreed to an espousal provision, which terminated any legal proceedings against the 
United States or its agents related to the nuclear weapons testing programme, and was 
intended to provide a full settlement of all claims, past, present and future. The tension 
between these provisions has hindered progress and created anxiety for the Marshallese on 
what the assistance envisaged by the Compact is supposed to entail, and for how long. 
</footnote> In the petition, the Marshallese people were &#8220;not only 
fearful of the danger to their persons from these deadly weapons&#8221;, but &#8220;also concerned for 
the increasing number of people removed from their land&#8221;, and requested that &#8220;all 
experiments with lethal weapons in this area be immediately ceased.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>15. The United States of America continued its nuclear testing programme until 1958, 
conducting a total of 67 detonations throughout the territory of the Marshall Islands, mostly 
in Bikini (23) and Enewetak (43)5 Atolls, and accounting for 32 per cent of all atmospheric 
tests conducted by the United States. The Marshallese people were told that the tests were 
necessary for the eventual well-being of all people in the world.6 
</p>
<p>16. The trusteeship of the United States of America was terminated pursuant to Security 
Council resolution 683 (1990), after the Council determined that the conclusion of a 
Compact of Free Association between the United States and the Marshall Islands fully 
satisfied the terms of the trusteeship agreement. Under the terms of the Compact, the 
Marshall Islands was established as a sovereign State in free association with the United 
States. The Compact granted the United States certain competencies, including full 
authority and responsibility for the security and defence of the Marshall Islands, including 
military operating rights and the use of certain areas. It also afforded the Marshall Islands 
certain privileges, for example on immigration and taxation, and provided for economic 
assistance, including eligibility for certain federal programmes.  
</p>
<p>17. According to information received from the United States of America, the Compact 
represents a continuation of the rights and obligations of the United States as elaborated in 
the Trusteeship Agreement, and provides a framework to achieve three main goals: (1) to 
secure self-government for the Marshall Islands; (2) to assist the Marshall Islands in its 
efforts towards attaining economic development and self-sufficiency; and (3) to ensure 
certain national security rights for all parties. The Compact was approved by the people of

<p>the Marshall Islands in a plebiscite held in 1983, and legislation on the Compact was passed 
by the United States Congress and signed into law by the President in 1986.  
</p>
<p>18. Under section 177 (a) of the Compact, the Government of the United States of 
America &#8220;accepts the responsibility for compensation owing to citizens of the Marshall 
Islands, for loss or damage to property and person of the citizens of the Marshall Islands, 
resulting from the nuclear testing program which the Government of the United States 
conducted in the Northern Marshall Islands between June 30, 1946, and August 18, 1958.&#8221; 
Section 177 (b) requires, inter alia, the creation of a separate agreement for the just and 
adequate settlement of all claims and outlining provisions for medical surveillance, 
treatment programmes, radiological monitoring, and additional programmes and activities. 
Section 177 (c) of the Compact further provided for direct economic assistance to the 
Marshall Islands, including the establishment of a $150 million fund for claims arising from 
the nuclear testing as well the provision of projects, programmes and technical assistance 
(see also chapter IV below).  
</p>
<p><b> III. Impact on the enjoyment of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>19. The nuclear testing resulted in both immediate and continuing effects on the human 
rights of the Marshallese. According to information received by the Special Rapporteur, 
radiation from the testing resulted in fatalities and in acute and long-term health 
complications. The effects of radiation have been exacerbated by near-irreversible 
environmental contamination, leading to the loss of livelihoods and lands. Moreover, many 
people continue to experience indefinite displacement. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>20. Radiation doses are not frequently encountered in everyday life, although people 
may be exposed to natural &#8220;background&#8221; radiation7 from the air, land, sea, foodstuffs and 
the human body itself, as well as from various beneficial practices, such as radiological 
medicine (for example, X-ray imaging or cancer radiotherapy).8 For the purposes of 
establishing international radiation protection standards, it is assumed that any increase in a 
dose of radiation, however minute, will result in a proportionate increase in the risk of 
cancer.9 
</p>
<p>21. Human beings are exposed to radiation from the release of radioactive elements or 
radionuclides, generally through (a) rain washing hazardous radioactive materials out of the 
air in the form of acid rain; (b) direct external exposure to a nuclear explosion cloud; (c) 
direct external exposure to hazardous radioactive materials in the ground; (d) internal 
exposure from eating, drinking, or inhaling hazardous radioactive materials in food, water 
or air; or (e) internal and/or external exposure from contact with contaminated water. 
According to testimony from the survivors, in the immediate aftermath of the nuclear 
testing, white ash fell from the sky, and shortly thereafter people began to experience skin 
burns, hair loss, finger discolouration, nausea and other symptoms of acute radiation 
poisoning. They also provided testimony of observing and experiencing ailments that they 
had never experienced before, including cancers and growth retardation in children.  
</p>
<p>  
 7 According to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, the global 
</p>
<p>average radiation dose from natural background sources is 2.<footnote name="4">0. Under section 177 of the Compact of Free Association, the United States of America 
agreed to provide $150 million for the Nuclear Claims Fund and established the Nuclear 
Claims Tribunal, with jurisdiction to render final judgements on all claims related to the 
nuclear testing programme past, present and future of the Government, citizens and 
nationals of the Marshall Islands. The Fund was projected to return at least $18 million per 
year, leaving the capital untouched; the Fund could thus continue to meet all claims in 
perpetuity. The United States and the Marshall Islands agreed to an amended version of the 
Compact, referred to as &#8220;Compact II&#8221; (or the Amended Compact) in 2003, which entered 
into force in 2004. Compact II primarily envisaged the gradual phasing out of economic 
assistance in order to reduce reliance on the United States and move towards self-
sufficiency by increasing contributions to a trust fund. The major concern is that the fund 
set up under the original Compact was intended to cover not only personal injury claims but 
also property damages and remediation, which in some areas would require, at a minimum, 
the full amount initially injected into the fund. The Special Rapporteur received information 
that the United States continues to replenish the superfunds to provide compensation for 
irradiated property claims emanating from United States-dependent territories in the Pacific 
that suffered less damage than the Marshall Islands. He regrets that the Nuclear Claims 
Fund does not receive the same type of replenishment. Currently, the Nuclear Claims Fund 
contains less than $50,000, and award claims have been suspended.

<p>22. In response to the questionnaire (see paragraph 7 above), the United States 
Department of Energy stated that the development of thyroid disease, including thyroid 
cancer in the Marshall Islands, had been linked to the intake of radioactive iodine primarily 
as a consequence of ingesting hazardous fallout debris particles deposited on food surfaces, 
eating utensils, the hands and the face, and of drinking contaminated water.  
</p>
<p>23. In 2004, the National Cancer Institute of the United States conducted an expert 
assessment of the expected number of cancers among the Marshallese, and concluded in its 
report thereon that as much as 9 per cent of all cases of cancers expected to develop among 
those residents alive between 1948 and 1970 might be attributable to exposure to the 
radiation caused by nuclear tests.10 Specifically, according to the report, an estimated 530 
&#8220;excess&#8221; cancers (namely those beyond the expected projections in a population) would be 
expected in the people living in the Marshall Islands during the testing period and, owing to 
the latency period of cancer, half of the malignancies had yet to be detected. A review 
report subsequently issued in 2010 significantly reduced the excess number of cancer cases 
to 170, lowering the percentage from 9 to 1.6 per cent. Owing to the current limitations of 
medical programmes, the assistance actually available to persons developing an excess 
cancer is unclear (see chapter IV below).

<p>24. In the light of the lack of scientific consensus and the limited available data, the 
Special Rapporteur was unable to address fully the effects on the health of the first, second 
and subsequent descendants of the survivors of the nuclear tests. He observes that scientific 
contention focuses on whether low-level radiation can be linked to cancer; whether the 
effects of radiation are specific to the individual (given that certain people may have a 
predisposition to cancer without any radiation exposure from nuclear testing), or conversely 
whether certain people are particularly susceptible to radiation; and whether such radiation 
causes genetic and intergenerational harm (see Section IV below).  
</p>
<p>25. Both Governments provided the Special Rapporteur with an analysis by their 
respective experts, who reached differing conclusions on the safety of the islands for human 
habitation. In addition to the general consensus that Bikini11 and Enewetak12 Atolls are 
contaminated, assessments were conducted in other areas of the Marshall Islands; for 
example, between 1990 and 1994, the Marshall Islands Nationwide Radiological Study 
took in situ gamma spectrometry measurements and collected and analysed solid, plant and 
other food item samples from every inhabited island and many of the larger uninhabited 
islands. Unfortunately, despite the comprehensive nature of the Study, issues were raised 
about its credibility and accuracy, leading the national parliament to adopt a resolution in 
which it did not accept the Study&#8217;s findings.  
</p>
<p>26. Survivors of the tests provided compelling testimony about their psychological 
trauma from witnessing the explosions and their effect. Psychological stress and anxiety are 
recognized as a legitimate and serious health concern in populations where nuclear testing 
has been conducted. The Special Rapporteur understands that, although these health

<p>concerns are of a different nature to cancer, the fear of radiation itself is no less real.13 
Consequently, the fear of some present-day inhabitants of the Marshall Islands of the 
radiation that they believe still contaminates their lands and affects their health should not 
be underestimated.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur also received information suggesting that the full effects of 
radiation on the right to health of Marshallese women may have been, and continues to be, 
underestimated. For example, the practice of women bathing in contaminated water may 
have been overlooked as a possible means of exposure, and cultural differences may also 
have resulted in an inadequate accounting of adverse reproductive outcomes.14 Studies 
show that pregnant women are particularly susceptible to thyroid cancer, with resultant 
negative effects on the health of the women and their infants.15  
</p>
<p>28. The right to health is an inclusive right that extends to the underlying determinants 
of health, such as access to an adequate supply of safe food and to safe and potable water. 
The Marshallese diet consists primarily of seafood, supplemented by pandanus fruit, 
coconut and other fruits. The fallout from the nuclear testing contaminated local food 
supplies, leading to illnesses and, ultimately, the stigmatization of these foods.16 The United 
States of America informed people not to eat local foods and provided imported canned 
foods. Many people, however, continued to eat local foods for a variety of reasons (such as 
cultural customs and a lack of understanding of the adverse health effects), and succumbed 
to illnesses. Furthermore, given that the Marshallese derive much of their fresh water 
supply from coconuts, their access to safe drinking water was highly compromised during 
the testing period.  
</p>
<p>29. Some information indicates that, because of cultural differences and language 
barriers, Marshallese dietary customs were either unknown or ignored during the testing 
period. For example, the difference in dietary and other eating habits of men, women and 
children may have led to higher exposure of some members of the population, especially 
women. Women eat different parts of the fish to those eaten by men, especially bones and 
organ meat, in which certain radioactive isotopes tend to accumulate. The differences in the 
retention of radionuclides by coconut and land crabs were not recognized by the medical 
profession in the United States. Apparently, women were more exposed to radiation levels 
in coconut and other foods owing to their role in processing foods and weaving fiber to 
make sitting and sleeping mats, and handling materials used in housing construction, water 
collection, hygiene and food preparation, as well as in handicrafts.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur heard compelling testimony by women on their experience 
of returning from Rongelap Atoll, including on the alarmingly high rates of stillbirths, 
miscarriages, congenital birth defects and reproductive problems (such as changes in 
menstrual cycles and the subsequent inability to conceive, even in those who previously 
had no such difficulties). Some gave birth to babies that ultimately died from foetal 
disorders, and they still endured the shame and trauma they experienced as a result. The 
extent to which radionuclides were actually present in the breast milk of women exposed to 
the testing is unclear, making it also difficult to assess the risks to individuals who were

motherhood as a result of their exposure to radiation.  
</p>
<p>31. Several years after exposure, a high incidence of thyroid cancer was reported, as 
well as an unusually high prevalence of stunted growth among Marshallese children. The 
incidence of such cases was also supported by the number of claims before the Nuclear 
Claims Tribunal. Similar effects have been recorded in children in other irradiated 
environments,13 with a greater incidence of thyroid cancer due to the intake of iodine-131, 
particularly through drinking milk contaminated with iodine, an element that accumulates 
in the thyroid, thereby inhibiting growth and the child&#8217;s cognitive abilities, which could 
lead to mental disability.

<p>35. New thinking on the issue of redress includes concepts that encourage the 
consultation of groups, including indigenous groups, on what they deem fit or what they 
consider to be adequate redress, because the notion of monetary compensation is not 
appropriate in some contexts. In this connection, article 28 of the Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples affirms the right of indigenous peoples to redress, which may 
include restitution or, when this is not possible, just, fair and equitable compensation, for 
the lands, territories and resources that the indigenous peoples have traditionally owned or 
otherwise occupied or used, and that have been confiscated, taken, occupied, used or 
damaged without their free, prior and informed consent.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Efforts to mitigate the impact of nuclear testing on the 
enjoyment of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>36. Various positive measures have been taken by the Government of the Marshall 
Islands and by that of the United States of America, to varying degrees of success, to 
address the issues of the right to an effective remedy; to health facilities, goods and 
services; and to environmental rehabilitation for the Marshallese people.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to an effective remedy 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Marshallese people filed a petition with the United Nations Trusteeship Council 
on 6 May 1954 (see paragraph 14 above). When the tests continued, the Marshallese filed 
another petition on 9 March 1956, in which they reiterated their previous concerns over the 
nuclear testing.  
</p>
<p>38. In response to the second petition, a representative of the United States of America 
answered that &#8220;nothing would please the United States more than to be able to comply with 
the wishes of the Marshallese people that the nuclear tests be discontinued in their islands, 
but this is not yet possible&#8221;; that &#8220;as long as there is a threat of...aggression, elementary 
prudence requires the United States to continue its tests&#8221;; and that &#8220;further tests are 
absolutely necessary for the eventual well-being of all the people of this world&#8221;, reassuring 
that &#8220;all possible precautionary measures [would] be undertaken before such weapons are 
exploded.&#8221;18 The Trusteeship Council voted to reaffirm its resolution 1082 (XIV) on the 
previous petition (T/PET/10/28) and to sanction the continuation of the tests, and 
recommended precautionary measures, settlement of all just claims of the former 
inhabitants of Bikini and Enewetak Atolls for loss of land, and that adequate provision be 
made for any losses arising as a result of the new series of tests.  
</p>
<p>39. After nearly 35 years without the possibility to return home, the people of Bikini 
Atoll filed a suit, <i>Juda v. United States of America,</i> under the Tucker Act, which vested 
jurisdiction to the United States Court of Federal Claims to hear the matter. The case was 
suspended temporarily in 1983 in the light of the negotiations on the Compact of Free 
Association (see paragraph 16 above) and, once it resumed, the court denied a motion to 
dismiss by the Government of the United States of America owing to lack of jurisdiction. 
Upon the entry into force of the Compact in 1986, however, an amended motion to dismiss 
the case was granted. Several suits filed thereafter were also dismissed on the grounds that 
the courts now lacked the jurisdiction owing to the existence of section 177 of the 1985 
Compact, which governed the settlement of claims. As such, Marshallese citizens no longer 
had access to United States courts on any other potential and future claims.

<p>the right to an effective remedy as established in international human rights law,<footnote name="2">7 WHO, World Health Statistics 2011, table 6. Available from 
 
 www.who.int/whosis/whostat/EN_WHS2011_Full.pdf.  </footnote>0 and calls 
on both States to fulfil this right. The Special Rapporteur is also of the view that 
interpretations of statutes should advance the course of justice. 
</p>
<p>44. Article 2.3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires that 
individuals have accessible and effective remedies to vindicate their rights. The Special 
Rapporteur recalls general comment No. 31 of the Human Rights Committee, in which the 
Committee pointed out that such remedies should be appropriately adapted so as to take 
into account the special vulnerability of certain categories of persons. The Committee also 
stressed the importance of establishing appropriate judicial and administrative mechanisms 
for addressing claims of rights violations.<footnote name="2">5 See Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, final report. Available from 
 
 www.hss.doe.gov/healthsafety/ohre/roadmap/achre/report.html.  
 26 Ibid., recommendation 1.  </footnote>1Article 2.3 moreover requires reparations to be 
provided to individuals whose rights have been violated.22  
</p>
<p>45. The right to an effective remedy also requires that any person claiming a remedy 
have his or her right thereto determined by competent authorities (judicial, administrative, 
legislative or otherwise provided for by the legal system), and that the competent authority 
enforce such remedies when granted. The Special Rapporteur considers that, in order to 
give effect to the right to an effective remedy, competent authorities should not only be 
empowered to make binding decisions but should also have sufficient resources to effect 
the awards they make. Noting that the Nuclear Claims Tribunal was grossly underfunded, 
the President&#8217;s Cancer Panel has called for increased funding, stating that &#8220;the U.S. 
Government should honor and make payments according to the judgment of the Marshall 
Islands Tribunal.&#8221;23  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the initiative taken by the Human Rights Council 
to address the issue of reparations by establishing, in its resolution 18/7, the mandate of 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-
recurrence, and concurs with its emphasis on the importance of a comprehensive approach 
incorporating the full range of judicial and non-judicial measures, including, among others, 
individual prosecutions, reparations, truth-seeking, institutional reform, or an appropriately 
conceived combination thereof, in order to, inter alia, ensure accountability, serve justice, 
provide remedies to victims, promote healing and reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>47. An opportunity exists to consider the issue within the international community. In 
his report on the effects of atomic radiation in the Marshall Islands, the Secretary-General 
indicates that the Organization stood ready to respond to any future instruction from 
Member States, adding that the General Assembly might wish to consider whether 
additional international efforts were appropriate for consolidating all the relevant available 
information on the effects of atomic radiation in the Marshall Islands into a final report of 
scientific findings on this regrettable episode in human history. If the Assembly wished to 
pursue that course, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic 
Radiation would be the appropriate international body to entrust with that responsibility.24

<p>4.1 to treat the people of the Marshall Islands. During the Project, many of the effects of 
radiation on human beings were documented, which contributed to global knowledge of 
this phenomenon. Serious concerns frequently raised by the Marshallese during the visit of 
the Special Rapporteur included that the Castle Bravo test (see paragraph 13 above) was a 
deliberate attempt to assess the effects of nuclear weapons on humans. With regard to 
human testing, the Special Rapporteur received information from survivors of the nuclear 
tests alleging that they were conducted without their prior and informed consent, in 
violation of article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and that 
the treatment received form the United States authorities had been degrading and culturally 
insensitive.  
</p>
<p>49. The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments was appointed in 1994 
by President Clinton to investigate any unethical human experiments undertaken by 
personnel and/or agents of the United States of America and to make recommendations to 
ensure non-recurrence, if necessary. The Advisory Committee concluded that, with regard 
to the Marshall Islands, there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate intentional human 
testing on the Marshallese, except for two examples with minimal low-risk exposure. For 
the most part, however, consent for medical tests to monitor human health appears to have 
been neither sought nor obtained.25  
</p>
<p>50. The Advisory Committee also highlighted the fact that there was evidence that 
demonstrated a lack of consideration for cultural appropriateness, and cautioned on the 
inherent conflicts posed by combining research with patient care, which could perhaps have 
been reduced by a clearer separation of the two activities and clearer disclosure to the 
subjects. The Advisory Committee recommended that, in such instances, the United States 
Government should deliver  
</p>
<p>a personal, individualized apology and provide financial compensation to the 
subjects (or their next of kin) of human radiation experiments in which efforts were 
made by the U.S. Government to keep information secret from these individuals or 
their families, or from the public, for the purpose of avoiding embarrassment or 
potential legal liability, or both, and where this secrecy has had the effect of denying 
individuals the opportunity to pursue potential grievances.26  
</p>
<p>It also noted that &#8220;one of the greatest harm from past experiments and intentional releases 
may be the legacy of distrust they created.&#8221; Denial by the Government of the United States 
of access by Marshallese patients to medical files, and denial of access of Marshallese 
authorities to previously classified, then declassified, but unreadable scientific 
documentation, were cited as major concerns and a hindrance to open dialogue between the 
two parties. The Special Rapporteur raised the issue of access to information to United 
States authorities during his visit. 
</p>
<p>51. The Marshall Islands has a national care agency for its population (approximately 
55,000 people) run by the Ministry of Health. Medical care is delivered mainly by an 
expatriate work force at primary and secondary care facilities on Ebeye Island (45 beds), 
Kwajalein Atoll (34 beds) and Majuro Atoll (90 beds), while smaller clinics on the remote 
outer islands provide limited primary care and pharmaceutical capabilities. The work force 
does not include any American doctors or nurses. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/21/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 
</b></p>
<p>52. According to the World Health Statistics for 2011, the health infrastructure in the 
Marshall Islands comprises 27 beds per every 10,000 persons,27 a ratio comparable with 
that of global trends. In accordance with the best practices of integrated and coordinated 
approaches to reducing cancer morbidity and mortality through prevention, early detection, 
treatment, rehabilitation and palliation, the Marshall Islands developed a national 
comprehensive cancer control programme that focuses on primary and secondary 
prevention and medical care, and includes a cancer registry. Implementation of the 
programme has, however, been hampered by capacity constraints and insufficient 
resources, including lack of skilled personnel, transportation and pharmaceuticals. Diabetes 
is the single largest cause of death among Marshallese citizens, followed by cancer. A diet 
consisting primarily of canned and highly processed foods has been identified as a 
contributing factor to the high incidence of diabetes.  
</p>
<p>53. Efforts made by the Government of the United States of America deserve 
commendation, as some $600 million has been spent in various technical programmes. The 
amount also includes the contribution to the compensation proceeds under the Nuclear 
Claims Fund under the agreement on the implementation of section 177. Through the 
Department of Energy, the Government runs a medical programme that currently involves 
annual comprehensive medical screening and treating 138 patients (people who were living 
in Rongelap and Utrok Atolls at the time of the Castle Bravo test). Thirty one of the 
patients reside in the United States, the largest number in Hawaii. They may see a 
community doctor or be referred to regional or community hospitals for advanced diagnosis 
and care. Patients in the programme have a median age of 65; the youngest patient is 55 
years of age; 60 per cent are women. The patients in the Marshall Islands live on 10 atolls; 
annual medical care and follow-up treatment are provided in close proximity to them. 
Patients with medical conditions that are potentially radiation-related findings and that 
cannot be diagnosed or handled in the Marshall Islands are referred to Hawaii. All related 
expenses for board and medical services are borne by the programme. The Department of 
Energy also operates the Whole-Body Counting Program, which carries out routine dose 
estimates on people who wish to assess their level of exposure to radionuclides.  
</p>
<p>54. The United States Department of the Interior also funds the 177 Health Care 
Program, which was established to meet the comprehensive health-care needs of people 
from Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap and Utrok Atolls. People enrolled in the health 
programme of the Department of Energy are also entitled to coverage under the Program 
for conditions not covered by the former; the latter does not, however, treat cancer patients. 
According to information received by the Special Rapporteur, patients of the two 
programmes are generally satisfied with the quality of the services provided. There are 
concerns, however, regarding the scope of the programmes, which are limited to people 
who were residing in the islands at the time of the testing, thereby excluding their 
descendants.  
</p>
<p>55. The Marshallese are convinced that there is sufficient evidence &#8211; based on their own 
observations of changes to their reproductive functions &#8211; of intergenerational harm caused 
by radiation fallout. Their descendants are nonetheless still denied the benefits envisaged by 
Compact for the treatment of radiation effects. According to a recent report on the 
biological effects of ionizing radiation by the National Academy of Sciences, &#8220;although 
adverse health effects in children of exposed parents (attributable to radiation-induced 
mutations) have not been found, there are extensive data on radiation-induced transmissible 
mutations in mice and other organisms. Thus, there is no reason to believe that humans 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/21/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>would be immune to this sort of harm.&#8221;28 While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges these 
variations, he is nevertheless concerned that the right to health may be compromised. 
Regardless of the scientific debate on the link between exposure to low levels of radiation 
and cancer, he believes that a precautionary approach that emphasizes the likelihood of risk 
over conclusive proof may prove more prudent and protective of rights. 
</p>
<p>56. The position of the Government of the United States of America is that only the 
northern atolls were significantly affected; consequently, people from the southern atolls 
are not covered by any of the special programmes. They have therefore not been able to 
receive treatment, although they point out that other people similar to them, as 
&#8220;downwinders&#8221; from radiation fallout in the United States, receive compensation (on a 
presumptive basis) through the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, even though they 
live even further downwind than those in the Marshall Islands. Cancer patients from the 
southern atolls are instead treated in a hospital run by the Government of the Marshall 
Islands that does not, however, offer dedicated oncology service.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that scientific uncertainty may have the effect 
of shifting the burden of providing those affected by the nuclear fallout with health services 
from the United States of America to the Marshall Islands. 26 In this regard, he is 
encouraged by the commitment made by the United States authorities to greater and 
meaningful discussions with the Marshallese on how the health dimensions may be 
addressed.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Environmental rehabilitation and monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>58. According to the United States Department of Energy, efforts to rehabilitate 
contaminated land in an environmentally sound and sustainable manner include a combined 
remedial strategy involving limited soil removal around housing and village areas, and 
treatment of agricultural areas with potassium, which has been recommended to atoll 
communities as a practical and effective solution to reduce levels of external and internal 
exposure. Moreover, treatment with potassium has been shown to be effective in reducing 
the uptake of cesium-137 in food crops for an extended period of time, and there is a 
proposed dose criterion for the treatment of contaminated sites in the Marshall Islands. The 
Department of Energy is implementing these methods to remediate contaminated land 
under the environmental monitoring programme for Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap and Utrok 
Atolls.  
</p>
<p>59. Progress has been made in efforts to resettle the people of Rongelap Atoll under a 
memorandum of understanding signed by the people of Rongelap, the Marshall Islands and 
the United States of America. According to information received, however, there is still 
resistance in Rongelap among some people to the idea of resettlement. The Rongelapese 
raised the concern that restricting people&#8217;s movements in an island is artificial (only about 
one third of the main island has been remediated and people claim to have received 
instructions from the United States authorities not to venture into the other parts of the 
island), and that the island should be remediated fully so people are not exposed to potential 
harm. People have also been warned not to consume food from the non-remediated areas of 
the island. The Department of Energy has conducted sampling of commonly consumed 
food; a report thereon is due early in 2013. Furthermore, a garden project has been launched 
to promote dietary change. Similarly, the Marshall Islands has an agricultural programme 
geared towards local food production. In 2008, the programme was partnered with civil

<p>society organizations in the Youth Food Initiative, the aim of which was to encourage the 
creation of backyard gardens in Majuro.  
</p>
<p>60. As mentioned above, IAEA recommended that Bikini Atoll not be resettled under 
the current radiological conditions, and stressed that remedial action would be necessary. It 
furthermore noted that there was a need to assess the radiological conditions of Enewetak. 
The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the radioactive dump site on Runit 
Island. He received information indicating that the structural integrity of the nuclear waste 
container is substandard, and that the hazardous radioactive materials contained could seep 
and leach into the marine and terrestrial environment. He therefore calls on both the 
Governments to ensure that the impact of these hazardous substances and wastes on 
people&#8217;s health and the environment is mitigated.  
</p>
<p>61. In addition to a lack of land, the Government of the Marshall Islands has identified 
the three-tier land tenure system as one of the challenges to resettlement programmes. The 
return, resettlement and reintegration of displaced people should be intensified by a multi-
sectoral comprehensive plan of action based on national consultations. Nevertheless, where 
return is not possible, other durable solutions should be explored.  
</p>
<p>62. As stated above, the Special Rapporteur was not able to address fully many of the 
issues concerning the Marshallese experience. Despite some divergence on significant 
matters by the parties, the Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the willingness he observed 
in both parties to improve the quality of life of the Marshallese people. He believes that the 
nuclear testing and the experiments have left a legacy of distrust in the hearts and minds of 
the Marshallese. The deep fissure in the relationship between the two Governments presents 
significant challenges; nonetheless the opportunity for reconciliation and progress, for the 
benefit of all Marshallese, is there to be taken. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government and relevant State 
actors of the Marshall Islands:

<p><b>entire territory and, in this regard, request relevant United Nations agencies to

<p><b>(a) Continue to provide the Marshall Islands with assistance (financial, 
</b></p>
<p><b>technical and otherwise) in order assist it to develop its health infrastructure and 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity further and to reduce the need for off-island referrals, including through the 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishment of fellowship and technical training programmes; a nationwide medical

<p><b>A/HRC/21/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Strengthen transparency and accountability mechanisms to ensure that

</b></p>
<p><b>experience with nuclear contamination, particularly the documentation prepared by
