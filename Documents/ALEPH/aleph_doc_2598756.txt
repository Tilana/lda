permit  (including  related  timing  and  milestones)  and  becoming  a  gold  producer  are  also  forward-looking  statements.    All 
forward-looking statements, including those not specifically identified herein, are made subject to cautionary language at the 
end of this document.  Readers are advised to refer to the cautionary language included at the end of this MD&A when reading 
any forward-looking statements. 
The  MD&A  is  prepared  in  conformity  with  NI  51-102F1  and  has  been  approved  by  the  Company’s  board  of  directors  (the 
“Board of Directors” or the “Board”) prior to its release.
Corporate Information 
The Company was incorporated on December 1, 2008 under the Canada Business Corporations Act and is the product of a 
spin-out transaction between Orezone Resources Inc. and IAMGOLD Corporation (“IAMGOLD”). The Company was initially 
listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) however to reduce operating expense the Company moved the listing of its 
common shares to a Tier 1 listing on the TSX Venture Exchange on December 21, 2015.  The Company’s main operating 
subsidiary, Orezone Inc., is resident in the British Virgin Islands which has a field office through its subsidiary in the city of 
Ouagadougou,  Burkina  Faso,  West  Africa.  The  Company  is  primarily  engaged  in  the  exploration  and  development  of  gold 
properties in Burkina Faso, West Africa.  Management has been operating in West Africa for over 20 years.  The Company’s 
primary objective is to maximize shareholder value by identifying and developing commercially viable gold mining operations.   
Although the Company began trading publicly on February 25, 2009, Management and the Board represent the continuation of 
the successful track record of Orezone Resources Inc. in Burkina Faso, extending back to its inception in 1996.  This includes 
the acquisition, exploration, development, financing, construction and divestiture of the Essakane Gold Project to IAMGOLD, 
the largest operating gold mine in Burkina Faso.  Burkina Faso became the fourth largest African gold producer in 2012 with 
much of this production coming from Essakane.  Burkina Faso has similar geology, but is relatively underexplored, compared 
to the neighbouring countries of Mali and Ghana where more major discoveries have been made and a number of large mines 
have been built.

Burkina  Faso  has  good  infrastructure  relative  to  much  of  West  Africa,  and  has  provided  the  opportunity  to  acquire  both 
relatively large unexplored tracts of land, as well as more advanced stage assets, on reasonable terms.  The Company will 
continue to focus the majority of its efforts in Burkina Faso. 
Q2 2016 Highlights:
•  On  May  18,  2016,  the  Company  announced  that  it  has  received  the  formal  and  final  approval  by  the  Ministry  of 
Environment, Green Economy and Climate Change1 for the Resettlement Action Plan (“RAP”) and the Environmental 
and  Social  Impact  Assessment  (“ESIA”)  with  respect  to  its  ongoing  mining  permit  application  for  its  wholly  owned 
Bomboré Gold Project in Burkina Faso;
•  On May 24, 2016, the Company announced it signed an agreement with Sarama Resources (“Sarama”) for the sale 
and transfer of the Bondi Gold Project in Burkina Faso valued at C$1.44 million that includes 9.6M Sarama shares 
valued at C$0.15 per share; and
•  On  June  13,  2016,  the  Company  announced  that  it  successfully  completed  a  presentation  and  critical  technical 
review  of  its  Bomboré  Gold  Project  with  the  Burkina  Faso  National  Commission  of  Mines  (“NCM”).   The  NCM 
reviewed the project’s feasibility study, including an environmental assessment and impact study, and a relocation 
action plan. The Company has fulfilled all the conditions set by the NCM and was advised that the NCM would issue 
a favourable and binding advice with respect to the Company’s application for a commercial mining permit. This was 
the last step in the permitting process before a final decision would be made by the Council of Ministers and decreed 
by the Government (at a full cabinet session) to grant a mining permit.
Significant developments subsequent to the three month period ended June 30, 2016 included:
•  On  July  19,  2016,  the  Company  announced  that  it  had  completed  the  C$26,450,000  equity  financing.  A  total  of
26,450,000 common shares were issued at a price of $1.00 per share; and
•  On  August  12,  2016,  the  Company  announced  that  the  Council  of  Ministers  of  the  Burkina  Faso  Government 
approved the  mining permit  application submitted by the  Company’s  local subsidiary  Orezone Bomboré SA for  its 
Bomboré Gold Project.  Receipt of the formal mining permit and related mining convention from the Burkina Faso tax 
department are expected in the coming months.
Exploration and Development Activities 
The  Company  has  two  exploration  stage  gold  projects  in  Burkina  Faso,  Bomboré  and  Bondi,  of  which  Bomboré  is  at  an 
advanced stage.  The Bomboré project has been the Company’s main focus since the completion of the Bomboré Feasibility 
Study (“FS”) and on August 11, 2016, the Burkina Faso Government approved the Bomboré mining permit application.  Since 
2011, the Bomboré project has been initially studied as a larger Carbon in Leach (“CIL”) milling operation, and when markets 
became more challenging, the Company adjusted the engineering design to build a mine in stages.  Phase 1 focuses on the 
surface oxide resource that can be processed without grinding or cement agglomeration using a combined Heap Leach (“HL”) 
and CIL circuit that results in half of the initial capital required for a much larger standard CIL facility in the 2012/13 designs.  
From January 2014 to April 2015, the Company completed all test work and designs to complete the FS that focused only on 
Phase 1 which would produce approximately 135,000 oz/yr for a minimum of eight years at an All In Sustaining Costs (“AISC”) 
of less than $700/oz.  At any time in the future, subject to a positive feasibility study, Phase 2 could be initiated to expand the 
CIL circuit to include, amongst other things, more crushing, grinding and leach residence time and power to process the large 
sulphide resource that has been defined below the oxide cap. 
The following table discloses the mineral resources on the Company’s projects using the standards prescribed by CIM and 
disclosed in accordance with NI 43-101:

With all studies and the permitting process largely complete, the Company had reduced its planned spend, as at the end of 
2015, to approximately $4.0M1 in 2016 compared to $6.9M in 2015.  With the completion of the July 2016 equity financing of 
C$26.4M, the Company intends to use the net proceeds to advance the Bomboré Project during the remainder of 2016 and 
into  2017.    Activities  will  include  detailed  engineering,  initial  relocation  work,  minor  ongoing  infrastructure  construction,  
repayment of the Sandstorm loan as well as fund other corporate purposes. Management believes that the current working 
capital is sufficient to sustain the Company’s exploration and evaluation, development plans and general and administrative 
expenses on an ongoing basis to the end of 2017. 
The following table summarizes the Company’s exploration and evaluation costs and meters drilled by project for the three and 
six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  All figures are presented in US$, except for meters drilled.

Bomboré Project 
Orezone is developing its wholly owned Bomboré project towards mining operations.  Bomboré is situated 85 km east of the 
capital city, Ouagadougou, and is adjacent to an international highway with access to sufficient water for mining operations, as 
well as a local labour force.  The project benefits from a large oxide resource (average depth 45 m) that sits above a large 
sulphide  resource.    The  average  depth  of  over  430,000  m  of  drilling  to  date  is  120  m  and  the  sulphide  resource  reaches 
depths of 200 m within the CIL optimized pit shells that constrain the resource.  Since 2011, the Company has been examining 
various  scenarios  to  develop  the  project  in  stages  to  reduce  the  initial  capital  requirements.    In  June  2013,  the  Company 
postponed the completion of the oxide material CIL FS and switched its development focus from an 8 Mt/yr Phase I oxide-only 
CIL operation to a 5.5 Mt/yr Phase I oxide-only HL scenario.  The Company completed an updated PEA on the HL scenario 
that  was  released  and  filed  during  Q1  2014.    The  updated  HL  PEA  was  completed  by  G  Mining  Services  Inc.  (“GMS”), 
Kappes,  Cassiday  &  Associates  (“KCA”),  and  Golder  Associates  Inc.  (“Golder”).    Subsequently,  the  Company  has  further 
optimized the planned processing method to employ a combined approach of HL and CIL circuits.  The combined approach 
was positively evaluated as part of the 2015 FS for which the highlights were released on April 28, 2015 and the related NI 43-
101 compliant report was filed on SEDAR on June 10, 2015. All engineering and geotechnical studies for the project were 
completed in Q1 2015 and the results were used to confirm and finalize the FS parameters.  A mining permit application was 
initially  submitted  on  May  25,  2015  with  preliminary  versions  of  the  RAP  and  ESIA;  updated  RAP  and  ESIA  reports  were 
resubmitted to the Ministry of Environment for review and approval in September 2015; and subsequent final versions in April 
2016. A significant impact caused by the project is the resettlement of the population living on the project site (approximately 
600 traditional families and 4,000 artisan gold miners) and the expropriation of a large area of agricultural land (approximately 
700  ha).    The  Company  and  its  consultants  Socrege,  BEGE  and  WSP  worked  with  the  local  population  to  agree  on  all 
resettlement areas for each of the communities potentially impacted by the project.  Subsequent to the submittal of all updated 
and  final  versions  of  the  ESIA  and  RAP,  the  Company  received  all  Environmental  and  Resettlement  approvals  from  the 
Ministry of Environment, Green Economy and Climate Change on May 18, 2016. The mining permit application was approved 
on  August  11,  2016  and  receipt  of  the  formal  mining  permit  and  related  mining  convention  from  the  Burkina  Faso  tax 
department (fiscal and tax policy for the permit) is expected in the coming months. 
The current resource was announced on April 29, 2013, (the “2013 Resource”) was constrained within CIL optimized pit shells 
using a $1,400/oz gold price, that spans 11 km, and remain open at depth and, for the most part, along strike.  The 2013 
resource includes 4.56 Moz Measured & Indicated (“M&I”) (140 Mt @ 1.01 g/t) and 0.72 Moz Inferred (18 Mt @ 1.22 g/t).  This 
includes a near surface oxide and transition resource of 1.96 Moz M&I (67 Mt @ 0.91 g/t) that averages 45 m in depth from 
surface.  The 2013 Resource is based on a total of 404,648 m of drilling (to an average vertical depth of 120 m), including 
259,025  m  of  Reverse  Circulation  (“RC”)  (4,170  holes)  and  145,623  m  of  Diamond  Drilling  (“DD”)  (926  holes).  The  2013 
Resource  was  estimated  using  the  results  of  the  technical  studies  of  the  CIL  scenario  FS  and  relevant  cost  estimates  for 
current mining, processing and G&A of comparable Burkina Faso mines.

During  Q2  2015,  the  Company  also  commenced  a  resource  update  that  will  include  50,000  m  of  additional  drilling  from 
previous programs.  Completion of the updated geological and resource models optimization using all parameters and results 
from the feasibility study and a $1,250/oz gold price, is expected during H2 2016.  The lower gold price and removal of those 
resources located within seasonal drainage areas, that would at least require special permitting before mining, will result in 
fewer total resources but a potentially slightly higher average grade.
2015 Feasibility Study and Infrastructure Work 
On April 28, 2015, the Company released the highlights of its 2015 FS and filed the technical report on Sedar on June 10, 
2015.  The study envisions a shallow open pit mining operation with a processing circuit that combines HL and CIL without any 
grinding to process the soft and mostly free digging oxidized ores.  The eleven-year mine plan, based on a mineral reserve 
using  a  $1,100  gold  price,  is  designed  to  deliver  higher  grade  ore  in  the  early  years  (0.88  g/t  over  the  first  eight  years  of 
production  at a strip ratio  of 1:1).  Lower  grade stockpiles  will be  processed  in the final three  years.  The financial model, 
based on the 2003 mining code, uses revenues based on a $1,250 gold price and yields a robust 24.4% after-tax internal rate 
of return to the Company (based on ownership of 90% Orezone and 10% Burkina Faso) with a net present value to Orezone 
of $196 M at a 5% discount rate.  Project payback is estimated at 2.7 years with all in sustaining costs averaging $678/oz.  
Initial  capital  is  estimated  at  $250M  including  contingencies,  all  working  capital  and  a  $10.5M  credit  for  gold  revenues 
generated during the pre-production period.  Sustaining capital is estimated at $75.2M.  Total reclamation and closure costs 
are estimated at $22.5M, including $8.7M of heap rinsing costs expensed in year 12.  The Study was completed by Kappes, 
Cassiday  and  Associates  of  Reno  (Processing  and  Study  Manager),  Golder  Associates,  Inc.  of  Reno  and  Montreal 
(Geotechnical), RPA Inc. of Toronto (Reserves and Mining), SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. (Resources) and WSP Canada 
Inc. (“WSP”) of Montreal in conjunction with Socrege and BEGE of Burkina Faso (Social & Environmental).
Summary of 2015 FS Base Case Financials:  
The  base  case  assumptions  include  revenues  using  a  gold  price  of  $1,250  and  Q3  2014  prices  for  fuel,  reagents,  labour, 
mining and other current costs from operations in the region between Q4 2014 and April 2015.  The financial highlights are as

Permitting Update 
During H1 2015, the FS site plan was completed and the social impact study and the relocation action plan were presented to 
the local population, negotiations were concluded with all stakeholders’ representatives for the first phase of resettlement and 
the list of goods and families eligible for the negotiated compensation under the RAP was officially validated and closed for all 
three phases of the resettlement.  In July 2015, signed protocols agreeing to relocation in future years were obtained from 
Phase 2 and 3 stakeholders thereby completing the process with all local stakeholders.  The Ministry of Environment oversaw 
site audits and public hearings in November and December 2015.   
During Q1 2016, the Company met with the Comité Technique sur les Evaluations Environnementales1 (“COTEVE”) of the 
Ministry of Environment, Green Economy and Climate Change to review the RAP and ESIA plans that were submitted and 
discuss the issues raised during the public hearings.  The COTEVE was generally satisfied with the plans and documents but 
recommended some changes to the RAP and ESIA.  The Company modified the plans accordingly, and the COTEVE then 
recommended to the Bureau National des Évaluations Environnementales2 (“BUNEE”) to accept the RAP and ESIA plans.  On 
May 18, 2016, the Company received final approvals from the Ministry of Environment, Green Economy and Climate Change.  
On June 13, 2016, the Company completed a presentation and critical technical review of its Bomboré Gold Project with the 
Burkina  Faso  National  Commission  of  Mines  (“NCM”).   The  NCM  reviewed  the  project’s  feasibility  study,  including  an 
environmental assessment and impact study, and a relocation action plan. The Company has fulfilled all the conditions set by 
the  NCM  and  was  advised  that  the  NCM  would  issue  a  favourable  and  binding  advice  with  respect  to  the  Company’s 
application for a commercial mining permit. The mining permit application was approved by the Council of Ministers on August 
11, 2016, and the official Decree and mining convention documents are expected in the coming months. 
2013 Resource  
The  Mineral  Resource  Statement  (Table  4)  was  prepared  by  SRK  Consulting  (Canada)  Inc.  (“SRK”)  from  Toronto.    The 
mineral resources are constrained within conceptual open pit shells prepared by GMS using parameters established by GMS 
in  January  2013  and  taking  into  account  the  FS  results  of  the  metallurgical  and  geotechnical  test  work  based  on  a  CIL 
scenario.  The total resource (oxide and sulphide) spans an area over 11 km long and up to 1 km wide with an estimated 
stripping  ratio  (prior  to  final  mine  design)  of  2:1.  The  majority  of  the  total  resource  occurs  within  the  top  120  m,  where 
approximately  90%  of  the  drilling  was  completed  to  date,  but  pit  shells  can  reach  a  depth  of  200  m.    The  mineralization 
remains open at depth and for the most part along strike. 
The  Company  commenced  working  with  RPA  Inc.  of  Toronto  (Reserves  and  Mining)  in  H2  2015  on  updating  the  2013 
resource  model  to  include  an  additional  50,000  m  of  drill  results.    Further  optimization  of  the  2015  FS  mine  plan  will  be 
warranted before mining commences. The updated resource model is scheduled to be completed in Q3 2016.

Drilling on the Bomboré property, geological modeling and the mineral resource estimates were supervised by Pascal Marquis, 
Geo., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, a Qualified Person, as defined by NI 43-101. The mineral resource estimate was prepared 
by Dorota El-Rassi, P.Eng. and Glen Cole, P.Geo. of SRK; who are Independent Qualified Persons as defined by NI 43-101.  
The optimization parameters and the Whittle pit optimization were established by Louis-Pierre Gignac, P.Eng., CFA of GMS; 
who is an Independent Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101.
Bomboré Regional Exploration Potential 
The Bomboré oxide resources could be further expanded once the Company includes in the resource model the 50,000 m of 
drilling results excluded from the 2013 Resource Statement (Table 4).  Additional expansion potential exists by upgrading the 
current  inferred  resources  and  untested  targets  in  the  southern  portion  of  the  property  with  approximately  12,000  m  of 
additional RC drilling. 
Currently,  the  gaps  in  the  drilling  information  for  the  11 km-long  mineralized  trend  resulted  in  more  than  70  individual  and 
relatively small-sized pits.  If economic mineralization is demonstrated in those gaps by the next phase of drilling, allowing a 
merger of several pits, this would not only increase the mineralized resources, but could marginally reduce the overall stripping 
ratio by eliminating several ramps reducing internal waste. 
At the P17S sulphide prospect located along the main shear zone trend, results from 22 core and 7 RC holes indicates a 
deformed and shallowly dipping granodiorite unit that averages 7.1 m in thickness (true width is approximately 85%) with an 
average uncut grade of 2.71 g/t (using a 0.5 g/t cutoff).  The drilling extends over an area of about 1 hectare with an average 
depth to the mineralized unit of only 28 m; the deepest intersection is 55 m below surface.  Projecting the geology to a depth of 
100 m could double the prospective area.  All assays were performed using a 1kg bottle roll technique (identical to the other 
Bomboré samples) with indicative cyanide soluble recoveries over 95%.  These results are interesting with grades more than 
double the average grade of the Bomboré resource.  Further drilling is expected during Q4 2016 along with initial metallurgical 
test results.
Permit status and expansion 
The original Bomboré I permit (104.5 km2) was renewed in December 2012 for an additional two-year exploration term (expiry 
February 17, 2015).  In late 2014, the Company applied and paid the fee for an additional one-year extension on the Bomboré 
exploration  permit.    The  final  title  document  evidencing  the  exceptional  extension  to  February  17,  2016  was  received  on
Orezone Gold Corporation

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE LOSS 
 
 
January 29, 2015.  The Company applied for a mining permit during Q2 2015, well within the extension period.  On June 1, 
2016 the Company reapplied for the previous surrounding exploration areas and the application is pending,  with approvals 
expected before year end.  
In August 2011, the Company announced it had been granted exploration rights to the Toéyoko permit, an additional 63 km2 of 
prospective ground adjacent to Bomboré.  The initial three-year Toéyoko permit expired in July 2014 and was renewed for a 
second three-year term that will expire in July 2017; it will then be possible to renew the permit for one more three-year term.   
The Government of Burkina Faso requires an annual minimum expenditure of 270,000 CFA (~ US $469) per km2 resulting in a 
minimum of 17,010,000 CFA (~ US $29,529) for Toéyoko.  The Company is able to carry forward expenditures year over year 
throughout the terms of the permits as well as into subsequent renewals, if it so requires, in order to meet these minimums.  
To date, the Company has not had any difficulty in meeting these minimum requirements.
Ownership 
The Company owns a 100% interest in the exploration permits less the standard sliding net smelter returns (“NSR”) royalty of 
between 3% and 5%, depending on the gold price, and 10% carried interest held by the Government of Burkina Faso in the 
event that a mining permit is granted.  On June 26, 2015, the Conseil National de la Transition (National Council of Transition) 
approved  a  new  mining  code  which  was  subsequently  adopted  by  the  parliament  on  July  16,  2015,  and  promulgated  on 
October 29, 2015, however, the government has not yet put into effect the enabling acts of the 2015 mining code.  See note 
below,  “New  Mining  Code”  for  further  details.    Sandstorm  also  holds  a  0.45%  NSR,  however  plans  are  to  repurchase  this 
royalty in its entirety, as per the terms of the agreement, for $3.6M on or before January 27, 2017.
Analysis of expenditures on the Bomboré Project  
Expenses  related  to  exploration  and  development  studies  for  the  three  and  six  month  periods  ended  June  30,  2016  has 
decreased by $270K and $1M respectively over the comparative prior-year period due to the FS activities being essentially 
complete as of the end of Q2 2015, offset slightly by expenses relating to the resource modeling, engineering studies and 
ESIA and RAP in 2016.  General camp, infrastructure and other costs for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 
2016  decreased  by  $214K  and  $313K  respectively  over  the  comparative  prior-year  period  due  to  a  reduction  in  camp 
occupancy related to the increased focus on development studies and a water drilling program in 2015 as well as a reduction 
in community relations expenses year over year.  Exploration surveys costs for the three and six month periods ended June 
30, 2016 has decreased by $33K and $72K respectively over the comparative prior-year period due to a reduction in staff in 
2015 along with a shift in focus of some staff to the Bondi project in 2016.  Drilling and assaying expenditures at Bomboré 
were low and comparable for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 due to the Company’s 
focus on the Bomboré FS.
Bondi Project 
On  May  24,  2016,  the  Company  signed  an  agreement  for  the  sale  and  transfer  of  the  Bondi  project  to  Sarama  for 
consideration consisting of 9.6M Sarama shares valued at C$0.15 per share, plus 3M warrants priced at C$0.195 per share 
with an expiry of two years and 2M warrants priced at C$0.24 per share with an expiry of three years. The transaction also 
includes a US$20/oz royalty on the first 200,000 ounces sold out of production from the Bondi Permit area.  Orezone and 
Sarama anticipate completing all final documentation in the coming weeks and will apply for the transfer of the permit.  As per 
the terms of the binding Heads of Agreement, it is subject to receiving a sale and transfer tax ruling from the Burkina Faso tax 
authorities. 
The  Bondi  gold  project  is  a  shallow  and  structurally  controlled,  4  km  long  shear  zone  hosted  gold  deposit  that  contains 
282,000 oz of Measured and Indicated gold resources at a grade of 2.12 g/t and 150,000 oz of Inferred resources at a grade of 
1.84 g/t.   
In August 2012, formal approval of the renewal of the permit for its final three-year term, with the mandatory 25% reduction in 
the permit area, was received from the Government of Burkina Faso.  In May 2015, the Company applied for an exceptional 
three-year extension for the permit, and on August 13, 2015 it was approved by the Government with receipt of the formal 
documentation on November 5, 2015.

Analysis of expenditures on the Bondi Project 
Expenses related to Drilling and assaying for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 increased by $5K and 
$72K respectively over the comparative prior-year period due to a 521m core drilling program mainly completed in Q1 2016 
and analysis in Q2 2016 as compared to limited analysis expenditures in 2015.  The general camp and infrastructure and other 
costs increased $34K and $49K respectively due to the focus on the drilling program in Q1 2016 and certification of historical 
expenditures in Q2 2016 for the Bondi sale to Sarama.
Burkina Faso Political Situation 
On November 29, 2015, Burkina Faso held a successful election and a former prime minister, Roch Marc Christian Kaboré 
emerged as the winner of the presidential election, the first time the nation has elected a new leader in nearly three decades.  
He was officially sworn in on December 29, 2015 and the new cabinet was appointed on January 13, 2016.
New Mining Code 
The mining legislation of Burkina Faso provides for certain taxes that are specific to mining activities and offers certain tax 
incentives for titleholders at different stages of their projects.  As in many other African jurisdictions, Burkina Faso has revisited 
its 2003 Mining Code in view of increasing its benefits from the sector and has circulated proposed amendments to the Mining 
Code during the last four years.  On June 26, 2015, the Conseil National de la Transition approved a new Mining Code that 
adopted by the parliament on July 16, 2015, and promulgated on October 29, 2015, however, the provisions of the new code 
have not yet been imposed on any mining project or operation.  Items within the new Mining Code include amongst others, the 
introduction of a new tax of 1.0% of the gross revenues to support a Mining Fund for Local Development (which was created 
based  on  the  request  of  the  World  Bank  (“WB”)  as  a  condition  for  future  financial  support  of  the  country  by  the  WB),  the 
removal  of  the  10%  reduction  in  income  tax  rates  for  the  mining  sector,  penalties  for  changes  in  production  levels,  the 
obligation  for  a  mining  company  to  pay  a  dividend  if  an  after-tax  profit  is  made  and  adequate  reserves  have  been 
accumulated, and for feasibility studies to include a plan for the training and the promotion of local mining executives.  The 
Company has been informally advised that the Mining Code in force at the time of submission of the application (2003 Code 
for Bomboré) shall apply to the mining permit upon its approval.  The permit may also be subject to certain changes from the 
2015 Mining Code that would ultimately be applicable to all other operating mines under the terms of the 2003 Mining Code. 
Several  dispositions  of  the  new  2015  Mining  Code  are  incompatible  with  the  Mining  Conventions  signed  by  the  mines  in 
production or with The Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (“OHADA”) Uniform Act that is applicable 
in Burkina Faso. 
Financial Review 
Corporate Cost Savings Measures 
During Q4 2015, the Company undertook several measures to reduce its annual operating costs by approximately $1M.  This 
included a reduction in its head office accounting staff as a result of a voluntary move from the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) 
to a Tier 1 listing on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V).  In addition, with the Bomboré Feasibility Study completed and the 
mining permit application near completion, the Company reduced its technical staff that is no longer required until the project 
proceeds to construction.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE LOSS 
 
 
 
The Company is in the exploration and evaluation phase and does not yet have revenue-generating activities.  Accordingly, 
the Company’s financial performance is largely a function of the level of exploration activities undertaken on the active projects 
and  the  administrative  expenses  required  to  operate  and  carry  out  its  exploration  activities  as  well  as  other  items  such  as 
interest income and foreign exchange gains/losses.  Below is a discussion of the major items that impact net loss for the three 
and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. 
Exploration and evaluation costs in the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $0.5M and $1.3M 
respectively over the comparative prior year periods.  The decreased expenditures are mainly due to:
•
•
reduced exploration and development studies due to the completion of the FS and related activities at the end of Q2 
2015; and 
reduced head count related to lower camp occupation and more focus on technical studies resulting in lower camp 
costs; 
Offset by:
• 
•
an increase in Bondi drilling and assaying costs due to the 521m core drilling program in Q1 2016; and 
an increase in costs related to the certification of the historical expenditures for the Bondi sale to Sarama.
General and administrative costs (“G&A”) include both the Company’s head office expenses and the local office related to the 
Company’s subsidiaries.  Head office G&A encompasses the costs of head office salaries and benefits, director compensation, 
professional fees, investor relations, travel, facilities and IT, as well as all costs associated with maintaining the Company’s 
listing on the TSX-V.  
Total G&A costs in the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $0.2M and $0.3M respectively from 
the comparative prior-year periods due mainly to:
•
•
•
a  decrease  of  $263K  in  salary  and  employee  expenses  as  compared  to  the  prior-year  period  as  a  result  of  the 
implementation of the corporate restructuring with the departure of the CFO, Corporate Controller, Bomboré Project 
Manager and employees in the subsidiaries near the end of 2015; CEO/SVP Exploration voluntary salary decrease in 
2016; and reduction in COO work schedule; offset slightly by a temporary reduction (six months) of certain staff in 
Burkina Faso to 50% time in 2015;
a decrease of $41K in public company costs as compared to the prior-year period as a result of much lower annual 
costs to be listed on the TSX-V as compared to the TSX; and a decrease in Directors’ Fees as compared to the prior-
year period;
a decrease of $30K in investor relations and travel costs as a result of fewer marketing/financing related consulting 
fees as well as lower conference travel related costs as compared to the prior-year period;
Offset by
•
•
an increase in professional fees of $38K as compared to the prior-year period as a result of fees incurred in relation 
to the mining permit application of the Bomboré SA Company; offset slightly by lower audit & legal fees as a result of 
the corporate restructure and decision to move ORE listing to TSX-V; and
an increase in general & office costs of $17K as compared to the prior-year period as a result of printing/equipment 
rental ahead of meeting with the National Commission of Mines for the mining permit.
Other  (loss)  income  is  related  to  a  foreign  exchange  gain  of  $0.25M  over  the  comparable  prior  year  period  offset  by  the 
increase in the Sandstorm royalty costs of $0.15M over the comparable prior year period. 
Income tax costs in the six month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $74.4K from the comparative prior year period 
due to the Burkina tax assessment which was settled in 2015.

The decrease in net loss during Q2 2016 as compared to first quarter in 2016, the quarters in 2015 and Q3 and Q4 2014 is 
partially  due  to  a  continued  reduction  in  exploration  and  development  activities  in  Q2  2016  with  the  majority  of  ongoing 
technical activities being completed by the end of 2015 and additional income tax expense relating to the settlement of the 
Burkina Faso tax reassessment in Q1 2015.  The Company is in the exploration and evaluation phase and does not yet have 
revenue-generating activities and has not generated revenue in any of the prior quarters.
Sandstorm Gold Ltd. Royalty 
On  January  27,  2015,  the  Company  announced  the  completion  of  a  royalty  purchase  agreement  (“Agreement”)  with 
Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (“Sandstorm”) that provided up to $8.0M in financing to advance the Bomboré Project. Sandstorm initially 
purchased the rights to 0.45% net smelter returns (“NSR”) royalty payable by the Company on future revenues from Bomboré 
(the  “Upfront  Royalty”)  for  $3.0M.    The  Company  has  the  option  to  buy  back  100%  of  the  Upfront  Royalty  and  intends  to 
complete the buyback prior to January 27, 2017 for $3.6M. 
The  Agreement  also  grants  Sandstorm  a  right  of  first  refusal  (“ROFR”)  on  all  future  gold  stream  financings  (“Stream”) 
completed by the Company up to three years subsequent to the commencement of commercial production on the Bomboré 
project, and this ROFR will continue after the buyback of the Upfront Loan.
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
The  Company  is  at  the  exploration  stage  and,  as  is  common  with  many  exploration  companies,  raises  funds  in  the  equity 
market to conduct its activities, or through the sale of royalties or related interests.  The Company has no mining operations 
and does not generate revenue from any operating activities. 
The Company had cash of $6.1M at June 30, 2016, a decrease of $0.8M compared to the $6.9M cash position at March 31, 
2016. The Company had a working capital of $6.2M at June 30, 2016. 
As at August 18, 2016, the Company had approximately $25.3M in cash which includes the proceeds of the July 2016 equity 
financing.  The Company currently has no other committed funding or other financing arrangements. 
With all studies and the permitting process largely complete, the Company had reduced its planned spend, as at the end of 
2015, to approximately $4.0M1 in 2016 compared to $6.9M in 2015.  With the completion of the July 2016 equity financing of 
C$26.4M, the Company intends to use the net proceeds to advance the Bomboré Project during the remainder of 2016 and 
into 2017.  Activities will include detailed engineering, initial relocation work, minor infrastructure construction, buyout of the 
Sandstorm royalty loan as well as fund other corporate purposes.  Management believes that the current working capital is 
sufficient to sustain the Company’s exploration and evaluation, development plans and general and administrative expenses 
on an ongoing basis to the end of 2017. 
In order to develop its Bomboré property through construction, the Company must raise additional debt and/or equity capital. If 
funds are not available on terms satisfactory to the Company, some planned activities will be postponed and the Company will 
be  required  to  re-evaluate  its  plans  and  allocate  its  total  resources  in  such  a  manner  as  the  Board  of  Directors  and 
management deem to be in the Company’s best interest.
1 The above planned spend figures assume the following exchange rates – CAD/USD = 0.77, EURO/CFA = 656, EURO/CAD = 0.62.

Use of Proceeds from Financings 
On  July  21,  2015,  the  Company  announced  the  closing  of  a  non-brokered  private  placement  of  $5M  (C$6.5M)  whereby  it 
issued 21,666,666 common shares at a price of C$0.30 per share.  The proceeds are being used to advance the Bomboré 
project  through  the  ongoing  mine  permitting  process,  optimize  the  economics  and  engineering  of  the  recently  completed 
feasibility study and for general corporate purposes.  As of June 30, 2016, the Company has used $3.1M of the proceeds for 
expenditures on its Bomboré project and general corporate purposes. 
On  March  21,  2016,  the  Company  announced  the  arrangement  of  a  non-brokered  private  placement  of  $3.8M  (C$5M) 
whereby it issued 10,000,000 common shares at a price of C$0.50 per share.  The proceeds  will be used to advance the 
Bomboré project through the ongoing mine permitting process, detailed engineering and for general corporate purposes.  The 
private placement closed March 30, 2016.  The proceeds of this financing have not been used as of June 30, 2016. 
On July 19, 2016, the Company completed a C$26,450,000 (US$20,300,375) equity financing that resulted in net proceeds of 
C$25,060,350  (US$19,233,819)  whereby  26,450,000  common  shares  were  issued  at  a  price  of  C$1.00  per  share.    The 
proceeds of this financing have not been used as of June 30, 2016.
Share Capital Information 
 
As at June 30, 2016, the Company had 127,350,364 common shares outstanding (fully diluted – 136,743,264).

Contractual Obligations 
As at June 30, 2016, the Company had contractual obligations for head office rent, professional fees, resource update costs, 
communication services, security services, IT services and equipment and inventory purchases and rentals in the amount of 
$93,171 (as at December 31, 2015 – $147,979).  The schedule of certain payments is dependent upon the contractors’ ability

Proposed Transactions 
The  Company  continually  reviews  potential  merger,  acquisition,  investment  and  other  joint  venture  transactions  that  could 
enhance shareholder value, however, at the current time, there are no reportable proposed transactions.
Risks and Uncertainties 
The Company is in the business of  exploring for minerals and  if successful, ultimately mining them.  The natural resource 
industry  is  by  its  nature,  both  cyclical  and  with  significant  risks  as  listed  below.    Even  though  Management  has  been 
successful  in  the  past  in  developing  economic  deposits,  there  is  no  assurance  that  the  Company’s  projects  will  become 
economically viable.  Once a potentially economic deposit is identified, the Company’s ability to establish a profitable mining 
operation  is  subject  to  a  host  of  variables  including  technical  considerations,  regulatory  and  political  issues  and  economic 
factors (including the need to source the capital required to develop the project).  Many of these are beyond the control of the 
Company.  The most significant risks and uncertainties faced by the Company are (in no specific order):
•  Orezone’s ability to successfully establish mining operations and profitably produce gold; 
•  Potential for the Company to become subject to additional tax liabilities; 
•  Risks  associated  with  obtaining  the  official  mining  Decree,  mining  convention  and  obtaining  renewed  exploration
permits for the Bomboré Gold Project;
•  Changes in, and volatility of, the price of gold; 
•  Operating  in  West  Africa,  including  changes  in  government  related  unrest,  protests  and  vandalism,  government
sanctions and related operational delays due to acts of protest and or terrorism, government instability and war; 
The speculative nature of resource exploration and development projects;
• 
•  Potential  changes  in  applicable  laws,  regulations,  agreements  or  changes  in  their  enforcement  or  regulatory
interpretation;
•  Permitting; 
•  Potential changes to mining and tax laws; 
• 
• 
•  Orezone’s reliance on its Management team; 
•
The accuracy of Orezone’s mineral resource and reserve estimates; 
The fact that Orezone has a history of losses and expects to incur losses for the foreseeable future;
The  availability  of  local  labour,  local  and  outside  contractors  and  equipment  when  required  to  carry  out  our 
exploration and development activities; 
The Company’s ability to finance the development of its mineral projects;
The Government of Burkina Faso’s interests in subsidiaries of Orezone holding mining permits;
• 
•  Uncertainties related to title to the Company’s mineral projects; 
• 
•  Health risks associated with the mining workforce in Burkina Faso; 
•  Environmental risks; 
•  Operational risks and hazards inherent in the mining industry; 
•
The  potential  inability  to  maintain  the  infrastructure  necessary  to  carry  out  mining,  processing,  development  and 
exploration activities;
Impact of evolving anti-corruption laws; 
The potential unavailability of insurance to cover certain risks; 
Increased competition in the mining industry;
•  Operations of the Company are carried out in geographical areas which are subject to various other risk factors; 
• 
• 
• 
•  Currency fluctuations; 
• 
•  Shareholders’ interest in the Company may be diluted in the future; 
Factors that have historically made Orezone’s share price volatile; 
• 
Investors outside of Canada may have difficulty bringing actions and enforcing judgments against the Company, its 
• 
directors, its executive officers and some of the experts named in this MD&A; and
The Company does not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future;
•  Differences in US and Canadian practices for reporting mineral resources.

Standards, Amendments and Interpretations Recently Adopted 
The Company has classified the royalty-based obligation relating to the upfront royalty from Sandstorm Gold Ltd. as a financial 
liability at fair value through profit or loss which is measured at fair value with unrealized gains (losses) recognized in net income 
(loss).
Standards, Amendments and Interpretations not yet Effective 
Revenue recognition
Revenue recognition 
In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("IFRS 15") which supersedes IAS 11 
– Construction  Contracts; IAS 18 – Revenue; IFRIC 13 – Customer Loyalty Programmes; IFRIC 15 – Agreements for 
the  Construction  of  Real  Estate;  IFRIC  18  –  Transfers  of Assets  from  Customers;  and  SIC  31  –  Revenue  –  Barter 
Transactions involving Advertising Services. IFRS 15  establishes a single five-step model framework for determining the 
nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising  from a contract with a customer.  On 22 July, 
2015  the  IASB  confirmed  a  one-year  deferral  of  the  effective  date  of  IFRS  15  to  January  1,  2018.  Early adoption is 
permitted.  The Company is currently  evaluating the impact the final standard is expected to have on its consolidated 
financial statements. 
Annual improvements and narrow scope amendments 
In September 2014, the IASB issued the Annual Improvements 2012-2014 cycle, effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after January  1, 2016.  The IASB also issued a number of narrow scope amendments to the certain IFRSs and IASs 
which are effective for annual periods  beginning on or after January 1, 2016.  These amendments are not expected to 
have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated  financial statements.
Annual improvements and narrow scope amendments
In September 2014, the IASB issued the Annual Improvements 2012-2014 cycle, effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after January  1, 2016.  The IASB also issued a number of narrow scope amendments to the certain IFRSs and IASs 
which are effective for annual periods  beginning on or after January 1, 2016.  These amendments are not expected to 
have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated  financial statements.
Financial Instruments 
Financial  assets  and  liabilities  are  initially  recognized  at  fair  value  when  the  Company  or  its  subsidiaries  become  party  to  the 
contracts that give rise to them.  Subsequent measurement depends on whether the financial instrument is classified as fair value 
through profit and loss (“FVTPL”), available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, loans and receivables or other financial liabilities.  Financial 
instruments classified as: FVTPL are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net income (loss); 
available-for-sale are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income (loss); 
and, held-to-maturity, loans and receivables and other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost.  Transaction costs in 
respect of FVTPL financial instruments are recognized in net income (loss) at the transaction date whereas transaction costs in 
respect of other financial instruments are included in the initial fair value measurement of the financial instrument. 
The  Company  may  also  enter  into  financial  instruments  or  other  contracts  that  contain  embedded  derivatives.    Embedded 
derivatives  (e.g.  a  lease  denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  that  of  either  counterparty  to  the  contract)  are  accounted  for 
separately from the host contract at fair value as derivatives when the risks and characteristics of the embedded derivatives are not 
closely related to those of their host contract, and the host contract is not classified as FVTPL. 
The Company does not currently have derivative instruments. 
The Company has made the following classifications with respect to its financial instruments:
(cid:131)  Cash is classified as FVTPL, which is measured at fair value.
Orezone Gold Corporation
Page 16
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE LOSS
(cid:131)
Trade  and  other  receivables,  excluding  taxes  receivable  balances  that  do  not  meet  the  definition  of  a  financial 
instrument,  and  refundable  deposits  included  in  prepaid  expenses  and  deposits,  are  classified  as  loans  and 
receivables, which are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
(cid:131)  Accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities,  excluding  taxes  payable  balances  that  do  not  meet  the  definition  of  a 
financial  instrument,  are  classified  as  other  financial  liabilities,  which  are  measured  at  amortized  cost,  using  the 
effective interest method. 
The royalty-based obligation relating to the upfront royalty from Sandstorm Gold Ltd. is classified as a financial liability at 
FVTPL which is measured at fair value with unrealized gains (losses) recognized in net income (loss).
(cid:131)
Financial assets, other than those classified as FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting 
period.  A financial asset is considered impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that 
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have been 
impacted.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments 
The  preparation  of  the  Interim  Financial  Statements  requires  Management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  about  the 
future that affect the amounts recorded in the Interim Financial Statements.  These estimates and assumptions are based on 
the Company’s experience and Management’s expectations about future events that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, and they are continually being evaluated based on new facts and experience.  Actual results may differ from 
these estimates and assumptions.  The effect of a change in accounting estimate is recognized prospectively in the year of 
change and future years if the change impacts both years. 
Critical judgments in applying accounting policies 
Going concern risk assessment 
Management considers whether there exists any event(s) or condition(s) that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.  Considerations take into account all available information about the future including the 
availability of debt and equity financing as well as the Company’s working capital balance and future commitments.
Determination of functional currency 
Management  has  made  determinations  with  respect  to  its  functional  currency  in  accordance  with  IAS  21,  “The  Effects  of 
Changes  in  Foreign  Exchange  Rates,”  and  as  such  has  determined  that  the  functional  currency  of  all  of  its  entities  is  the 
Canadian dollar with the exception of its subsidiaries, Orezone Inc. SARL, Orezone Bomboré SA and Niger Resources Inc., 
which have a functional currency of the Communauté Financière Africaine francs. 
Other than temporary impairment of available-for-sale (“AFS”) investment 
Management judgment is applied in evaluating whether an unrealized loss on the Company’s AFS investment recognized in 
other comprehensive income (loss) is other than temporary and should be reclassified to the Statement of Loss.  Management 
performs qualitative and quantitative assessments in order to judge if the reduction in fair value, as compared to its value upon 
initial recognition, is significant or prolonged.
Accounting policy selection for interest in exploration properties including property, plant and equipment 
As disclosed in note 3(i) of the Annual Financial Statements, Management judgment is applied in capitalizing costs related to 
acquired mineral property rights and property, plant and equipment.  Management has determined that expenditures incurred 
during the exploration and evaluation phase will be expensed as incurred until it determines that the technical feasibility and 
commercial viability of a mineral property has been established.
Impairment of non-financial assets 
Management assesses non-financial assets for impairment as disclosed in note 3(l) of the Annual Financial Statements.
Deferred income taxes 
Judgment  is  required  in  order  to  determine  whether  to  recognize  deferred  tax  assets  and/or  liabilities  on  the  statement  of 
financial position.  Management must assess the extent to which it is probable that the Company and its subsidiaries will have 
future taxable profits available against which it can recognize unused tax losses or unused tax credits as well as sufficient loss
Orezone Gold Corporation
Page 17
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE LOSS 
 
 
carryforwards to offset potential tax liabilities.  The amount  and availability of deferred tax assets and liabilities are directly 
influenced by future changes to tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate.
Current income tax liabilities 
The Company and its operating subsidiary tax filings may be reviewed from time to time in accordance with the Income Tax 
Act (Canada) and the Burkina Faso Code respectively.  The Company’s interpretations of underlying tax regulations may differ 
from  those  of  the  respective  tax  department.    Judgment  is  required  in  order  to  determine  the  appropriate  accounting  and 
disclosure  treatment  based  on  the  facts.    To  the  extent  that  a  dispute  arises,  Management  must  determine  whether  it’s 
probable that  a tax liability exists  and  whether the  extent  of the liability  may  be  estimated and accrued in its Statement of 
Financial Position in addition to determining the appropriate level of disclosure regarding the dispute.
Classification of royalty as royalty-based obligation 
Significant judgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting for the Sandstorm royalty arrangement that  was 
entered into.  Based on the specific facts and circumstances, judgment is required to assess whether the arrangement is a 
commodity arrangement, a financial liability or a sale of a mineral interest and a contract to provide services.  Management 
has  determined  that  based  on  the  specific  agreements  reached  with  Sandstorm,  that  the  Company  has  assumed  the 
significant business risks associated with delivering cash and/or gold ounces, and accordingly has classified the royalty as a 
financial liability at fair value through profit and loss.
Fair value of the Sandstorm upfront royalty 
Management has assessed the fair value of the upfront royalty as the value of the royalty plus any buyback premiums based on its 
assumption that the Company will be able to raise the necessary funds in order to repurchase the royalty from Sandstorm prior to 
the expiry of the irrevocable buyback option on January 27, 2018. 
The  Company  will  continue  to  evaluate  on  an  ongoing  basis  whether  circumstances  have  changed  such  that  the  likelihood  of 
repurchasing the royalty changes resulting in the need to reconsider its current accounting policy with respect to the valuation of the 
loan. 
Sources of estimation uncertainty 
Share-based compensation related to stock options and warrants 
Management  assesses  the  fair  value  of  stock  options  and  warrants,  as  disclosed  in  note  3(r)  of  the  Annual  Financial 
Statements,  using  the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model.    This  model  requires  Management  to  make  estimates  and 
assumptions  with  respect  to  inputs  including  the  risk-free  interest  rate,  volatility  and  expected  life  of  the  equity-settled 
instruments.  As well, Management must make assumptions about anticipated forfeitures based on the historical actions of 
plan participants which may not be a true representation of future participant exercise behaviour.
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment 
As disclosed in note 3(k) of the Annual Financial Statements, Management reviews its estimate of the useful life of property, 
plant and equipment annually and accounts for any changes in estimates prospectively.
Forward Looking Statements 
  
Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Position  and  Total  Comprehensive  Loss  for  the  three  and  six  month 
periods  ended  June  30,  2016  may  contain  or  refer  to  certain  forward-looking  statements  relating,  but  not  limited  to,  the 
Company’s expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs.  Forward-looking statements can often be identified by forward-looking 
words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “expect”, “goal”, “plan”, “intend”, “estimate”, “may” and “will” or similar words suggesting 
future outcomes, or other expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, intentions or statements about future events or 
performance.    Forward-looking  information  may  include  reserve  and  resource  estimates  and  the  timing  of  updates  thereof, 
planned expenditures on the Company’s projects, obtaining renewed exploration permits, obtaining the official mining Decree 
and  related  mining  convention,  estimates  of  future  production,  unit  costs  and  capital  costs,  the  ability  to  demonstrate  the 
economic feasibility of the mineral deposits to a level up to and including that of a full feasibility study, the ability to obtain 
adequate financing as needed in the future to fund ongoing exploration or production activities, the timing of commencement 
of operations, and estimates of the amount of time the Company may carry on operations with existing cash resources and 
available funding, and is based on current expectations that involve a number of business risks and uncertainties.  Factors that
Orezone Gold Corporation
Page 18
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE LOSS 
 
 
could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  any  forward-looking  statement  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  failure  to 
establish estimated resources and reserves, the grade and recovery of material which is mined varying from estimates, capital 
and  operating  costs  varying  significantly  from  estimates,  delays  in  obtaining  or  failures  to  obtain  required  governmental, 
environmental  or  other  project  approvals  and  sufficient  financing,  inflation,  changes  in  exchange  rates,  fluctuations  in 
commodity prices, delays in the development of projects the failure of parties to contracts to honor contractual commitments, 
unexpected increases in budgets costs and expenditures, and other factors.  Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, 
uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results.  Potential shareholders 
and prospective investors should be aware that these statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and 
other  factors  that  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  suggested  by  the  forward-looking  statements.  
Shareholders  are  cautioned  not  to  place  undue  reliance  on  forward-looking  information.    By  its  nature,  forward-looking 
information involves numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, that contribute to the

Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors Concerning Resource Estimates 
The resource estimates in the MD&A were prepared in accordance with the standards of the CIM and disclosed in accordance 
with National Instrument (“NI”) 43-101 adopted by the Canadian Securities Administrators.  The disclosure requirements of NI 
43-101 differ significantly from the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).  The 
MD&A uses the terms “measured”, “indicated” and “inferred” resources.  Although these terms are recognized and required in 
Canada, the SEC does not recognize them.  The SEC permits US mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose 
only those mineral deposits that constitute “reserves”.  Under United States standards, mineralization may not be classified as 
a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally extracted at the 
time the determination is made.  United States investors should not assume that all or any portion of a measured or indicated 
resource will ever be converted into “reserves”.  Further, “inferred resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their 
existence  and  whether  they  can  be  mined  economically  or  legally,  and  United  States  investors  should  not  assume  that 
“inferred resources” exist or can be legally or economically mined, or that they will ever be upgraded to a higher category.
