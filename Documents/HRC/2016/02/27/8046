<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fourteenth 
session from 22 October to 5 November 2012. The review of Argentina was held at the 2nd 
meeting, on 22 October 2012. The delegation of Argentina was headed by Juan Mart&#237;n 
Fresneda, Secretary of Human Rights. At its 10th meeting, held on 29 October 2012, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Argentina. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Argentina: Austria, Philippines, Uruguay. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Argentina: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/14/ARG/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/14/ARG/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/14/ARG/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, 
Slovenia, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to 
Argentina through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Secretary of Human Rights of Argentina stressed that the Council had refined 
its procedures to ensure maximum efficiency in the analysis of the human rights situation in 
the world. The Council, through the UPR - as it was also intended in Argentina - sought to 
put the person at the centre, as a subject of rights, and to change the paradigms driven by 
market dictatorship and the absence of the State. 
</p>
<p>6. Argentina had recovered her dignity as a country through a national and popular 
project that transformed the structures of an unequal society, establishing the current 
development process, which included and protected the weak. 
</p>
<p>7. Argentina lived through two recent tragic experiences, which explained the State&#8217;s 
current commitment to promote and protect human rights. On the one hand, a society that 
suffered under a terrorist State that perpetrated crimes against humanity in the 1970s was 
going through a process of memory, truth, justice and reparation. On the other hand, 
Argentina experienced an economic, social and political tragedy that broke out in the crisis 
of 2001 because of a State that was absent for more than a decade, and where the loss of 
labour rights and opportunities for the most vulnerable were considered as variables to 
adjust in order to achieve economic growth. 
</p>
<p>8. Since its first review in 2008, Argentina carried out efforts to consolidate the process 
of justice for crimes against humanity committed in the 1970s. The goal was to reaffirm the </p>


<p>idea that no one was above the law. The pillars of memory, truth and justice were deeply 
rooted in Argentine society. Since 2005, 923 people had been prosecuted, 331 people 
convicted, and there were 17 ongoing trials, with 5 more scheduled. This has allowed 
Argentina to advance a broader human rights agenda that can be summarized as a fight for 
real equality. 
</p>
<p>9. In this context, the democratization of information and communication had been 
essential. A new law on audiovisual media services posits freedom of expression as a social 
right. The State intervenes to regulate and restrict the monopolistic concentration of the 
media while ensuring access to the public sphere and freedom of expression for all social 
sectors. Three years after the enactment of thelaw, 50 universities had a TV signal; there 
were 1,150 municipal radio stations; 130 radio stations for schools; 20 radio licences for 
indigenous peoples; and 50 cable licences for cooperatives. In the same spirit, the Congress 
enacted the repeal of the criminal libel and slander on the grounds of public interest, 
eliminating any possibility of prosecuting those who expressed their views about public 
affairs. 
</p>
<p>10. It would not be possible to advance towards the democratization of rights and real 
equality without active policies implemented by the State. As a result, poverty had been 
sharply reduced from 54 per cent of the population in 2003, to 6.5 per cent for 2012; while 
indigence had diminished from 27 to 2 per cent. 
</p>
<p>11. The Government had promoted the recovery of labour rights and encouraged 
collective bargaining. The State had recognized the historic debt generated by decades of 
neglect towards the most vulnerable sectors of the population. This had been made 
operative through a retirement-mobility procedure. Pensions had been extended to 2.5 
million people, through an unprecedented fiscal effort. 
</p>
<p>12. Regarding human trafficking, the State was coordinating strategies to combat this 
transnational crime.  For instance, since the establishment of the Ministry of Security in 
December 2010, the federal forces rescued 889 victims. 
</p>
<p>13. As regards the protection of the rights of children and adolescents, Argentina had 
also advanced. Law 061 established that children were full subjects of rights. Additionally, 
the Government had adopted other standards such as education funding, prohibition of child 
labour and equal legal age of marriage. 
</p>
<p>14. For the first time, investment in education represents 6.2 per cent of GDP. More than 
1,400 new schools had been built and 2 million computers had been distributed. 
</p>
<p>15. The active policies to promote rights were being complemented by a paradigm shift 
in accessing justice that included other forms of non-judicial justice; 38 Access to Justice 
centres had been established, especially in lower-income areas. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation reported that, after the first-cycle UPR review, the Act on Integral 
Protection Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women was 
adopted and regulated by a presidential decree after an extensive consultation process. This 
legislation addressed the issue of gender-based violence in a comprehensive manner and 
provided a broad response to the problem according to the standards of the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the 
Convention of Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;. Currently the Congress was discussing the incorporation of 
the crime of femicide into the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>17. The delegation mentioned the equal marriage and gender-identity laws as a 
fundamental step towards equality and the extension of the collective rights of those groups 
that had been historically discriminated against on the ground of sexual orientation. The 
Equal Marriage Act allowed marriage between same sex adults and the possibility of </p>


<p>adoption. The Gender Identity Act guaranteed that every citizen could change his/her name, 
photo and sex in his/her identity documents. 
</p>
<p>18. Regarding immigration policy, the regulation of the Immigration Act of 2010 
recognized the principles of family reunification and the contribution of migrants to the 
enrichment and strengthening of the cultural and social fabric of Argentina. 
</p>
<p>19. On the issue of health, there was also progress to report to the Council. Argentina 
had regulated health provision by private actors and had created the Compulsory Medical 
Program, which established mandatory benefits that private operators  could not 
circumvent. Likewise, the new mental health law guaranteed the rights recognized in 
various international instruments and provided a framework for public policy in this area, 
with the patient&#8217;s integration into the community. In the field of bioethics, the &quot;death with 
</p>
<p>dignity&quot; law, adopted in 2012, allowed refusing the artificial extension of life. 
</p>
<p>20. With regard to indigenous peoples, legislation had been adopted, including Act 
26,637, which called for indigenous participation in the drafting of a bill on community 
property, established the Office of Indigenous Rights, and which granted powers to the 
State to order the return of human remains to their communities. With regard to indigenous 
lands, while continuing to expand the application of law 26,160, an emergency Law on the 
Ownership of Land was adopted in December 2011. This legislation establishes that land 
was not a commercial good but a strategic and non-renewable resource which should be 
preserved. Likewise, there was an initiative to incorporate a new title in the chapter of 
property rights of the draft unified Civil and Commercial Code recognizing the indigenous 
community as the sole subject having right to communal indigenous property. 
</p>
<p>21. The delegation acknowledged that, despite many achievements, there were still 
concerns regarding human rights, such as the situation of detainees. The process of aligning 
legislation with international human rights standards was not over. Argentina was working 
on the establishment and implementation of methods and tools that respect the rights of 
persons deprived of liberty, in dialogue with civil society. 
</p>
<p>22. The State hoped to promptly inform the Council about the adoption of the national 
mechanism for the prevention of torture, which had been approved by one chamber of 
Congress. Argentina had promoted that its provinces also establish their own mechanisms 
of prevention. The provinces of Chaco, Rio Negro, Tucuman and Mendoza passed 
legislation creating mechanisms to prevent torture; while bills were under consideration in 
the provinces of La Pampa, Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Neuquen. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>53. The delegation recalled that Argentina used as a reference the United Nations 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the decision of the Inter-
American Commission on Human Rights on principles and good practices for the 
protection of persons deprived of liberty. The State applied to detainees the same policies of 
human rights as to the rest of the population, on the premise that the only freedom that was 
restricted was freedom of movement. The State coordinated between various instances in 
order to improve the quality of life of detainees and had opened prisons to the community. 
The State worked with various civil society organizations in this regard. Also, several 
prisons had been built or were under construction in order to reduce overcrowding. 
Currently, at the federal level, there were more places in prisons than prisoners, which 
allowed a better management and classification of detainees. 
</p>
<p>54. The delegation noted that 70 per cent of those arrested were able to work, 65 per 
cent received education and 90 per cent participated in cultural activities or sports. 
</p>
<p>55. Furthermore, on the basis of the new mental health law and the programme 
&#8220;Prisma&#8221;, prison psychiatric units were closed and persons with mental illnesses were 
</p>
<p>treated fairly by health-care staff. 
</p>
<p>56. Regarding torture, while the establishment of the National Preventive Mechanism  
was still pending, the penitentiary authorities had established, in cooperation with civil 
society organizations, monitory programmes for the prevention of torture in correctional 
facilities. Any civil society organization could conduct an inspection to detention centres 
without previous notice. This was supplemented by courses of prevention and punishment 
of torture for the management of prisons, as recommended by the Inter-American Court of 
Human Rights. Finally, through roundtables with civil society, the penitentiary authorities 
had also drafted protocols to prevent violent situations in units of young adults and on how 
to conduct searches. 
</p>
<p>57. Regarding indigenous peoples, the delegation noted that the 2010 national census of 
population and housing had included indigenous and African self-identification. The results 
reflected around a million people of Indian descent and some 70,000 people of African 
descent. The results allowed the formalization of individual policies for each of these 
groups. 
</p>
<p>58. The delegation stated that the current administration had enacted laws that 
implemented ILO Convention No. 169 on indigenous and tribal peoples in independent 
countries (1989), and mentioned as examples the norm on intercultural bilingual education 
and the demarcation of indigenous land. On this last point, more than three and a half </p>


<p>million hectares had been assessed and 14,000 evictions were prevented. Similarly, within 
the general policy of implementing the right to housing, there were specific programmes for 
indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>59. The delegation pointed out that the draft Civil Code incorporated the right to identity 
and name in indigenous languages and a close follow-up of the births of children belonging 
to indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>60. On children and adolescents in conflict with the law, the delegation recalled that 
article 19 of the regulation of the law, incorporating the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child into Argentine legislation, integrated all international standards in the area, in 
particular the Havana, Beijing, Riyadh and Tokyo Rules. Argentina had also a central 
federal office dealing with children and adolescents in conflict with the law in order to raise 
the standards in all Argentine jurisdictions. 
</p>
<p>61. As for children with disabilities, the national census had reported that 5 per cent of 
children of Argentina suffered some permanent difficulty; 85 per cent of these children 
received education and many of them were part of the regular education system. Besides, 
the universal child allowance was tripled in cases of a child with disabilities and the non-
contributory pensions were also increased in cases of disability. 
</p>
<p>62. Regarding the Ombudsman for Children, the delegation explained that the issue was 
still under legislative debate, but that, in the meantime, the protection and defence of 
children was guaranteed. The delegation also stressed that the issuance of the first national 
identity document was free. 
</p>
<p>63. On sexual and reproductive health, the delegation reiterated that free and universal 
access to contraception was guaranteed in Argentina.  For its part, the technical guide on 
non-punishable abortion prepared by the Ministry of Health had been revised and updated 
in order to explain in which cases a court order to perform an abortion was not necessary.  
More than half of the Argentine provinces used the technical guide or considered it as a 
reference to prepare their own. However, the most prominent development in this area was 
the 2012 decision of the Supreme Court which settled the legal discussion on what was 
considered a non-punishable abortion in Argentina&#8217;s legislation. That ruling had already 
been confirmed and applied in other cases. 
</p>
<p>64. On human trafficking, the delegation reported that there was an office and a 
programme of rescue and assistance for victims of trafficking since 2008 and 2012,  
respectively. 
</p>
<p>65. Regarding violence against women, in addition to the law and regulation of 2010, 
the judiciary established in 2008 an office to ensure prompt access to justice for victims and 
prepare statistical data. 
</p>
<p>66. Oman recognized the attention Argentina paid to implementing recommendations 
and the work done to respect international obligations through cooperation with all 
stakeholders. Oman made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Pakistan noted the new laws and institutional measures in human rights over the past 
four years strengthening human rights infrastructures. It requested more information on 
Law No. 551, which decriminalized libel and slander in public interest cases. Pakistan 
appreciated advancements in promoting social, cultural and economic rights, particularly in 
health and education. Pakistan requested more information on the Prepaid Health-Care Plan 
Act. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Palestine congratulated Argentina on its progress and ongoing commitment in all 
areas of human rights and in combating discrimination against women at national, 
provincial and municipal levels through bolstering normative frameworks, institutional </p>


<p>mechanisms and public equality policies. Palestine however took note of the need to 
strengthen these mechanisms and to establish planning tools for equality. Palestine made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Peru recognized Argentina&#8217;s commitment to promoting and protecting human rights. 
It highlighted the increase in public education and investments to provide safe drinking 
water and sanitation; the adoption of a comprehensive act on preventing, sanctioning and 
eradicating violence against women; and the establishment in 2011 of the Dr. Fernando 
Ulloa assistance centre for victims of human rights violations. Peru made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. Portugal commended Argentina for progress on recommendations and ratification of 
human rights instruments and would appreciate similar commitments to humanitarian law 
instruments. It hoped closing the gap between legislation and reality on human rights of 
women would continue as a priority, recognizing adoption of the Violence against Women 
Act. It encouraged progress on rights of the child to be transposed to the provinces. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
