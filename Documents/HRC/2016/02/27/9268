table of States, under the auspices of the United Nations, to discuss the fundamental question of 
the role of the State as holder of the monopoly of the use of force, with the objective of 
facilitating a critical understanding of the responsibilities of the different actors, including

<p><b>7/25.  Prevention of genocide 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, as well as other 
relevant international instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering </i>that the sixtieth anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, adopted on 9 December 1948 and succeeded by the 
adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the next day, provides an important 
opportunity for the international community to draw the attention of all States to the significance 
of the Convention and to invite them to redouble their efforts for the prevention and punishment 
of the crime of genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that the crime of genocide<b> </b>is recognized in the Convention as an odious 
scourge which has inflicted great losses on humanity and that further international cooperation is 
required to facilitate the timely prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> about the occurrence in recent history of genocide, recognized as such 
by the international community, on the basis of and as defined in the 1948 Convention, and 
bearing in mind that massive, serious and systematic violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law might result in genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking into consideration </i>that States parties to the Convention on the Non-Applicability of 
Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 November 1968 have 
agreed that no statutory limitation shall apply to such crimes, including the crime of genocide, 
irrespective of the date of their commission, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> that impunity for such crimes encourages their occurrence and is a fundamental 
obstacle to the furtherance of cooperation among peoples and the promotion of international 
peace and security, and that fighting impunity for such crimes is an important factor in their 
prevention, </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/L.11/Add.1 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> the significant progress made by the international community in the 
past 60 years, including within the United Nations system, in developing relevant mechanisms 
and practices to prevent and punish the crime of genocide, thereby contributing to the effective 
implementation of the Convention, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 96 (I) of 11 December 1946, in which the 
Assembly declared genocide a crime under international law, and all subsequent resolutions 
within the United Nations system that have contributed to the establishment and development of 
the process of prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide, including Assembly 
resolution 60/1 of 16 September 2005, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging with appreciation</i> that genocide is defined among the most serious crimes 
of concern to the international community as a whole in the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court,<b>1</b> and anticipating that the functioning of the Court with a high number of 
ratifications of the Statute and the functioning of other relevant international criminal tribunals 
will help increase accountability for the crime of genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that the Council is mandated by the General Assembly to address situations of 
violations of human rights, including gross and systematic violations, and to make 
recommendations thereon, and that it should also promote the effective coordination and 
mainstreaming of human rights within the United Nations system, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the important contribution of the United Nations human rights system to 
efforts towards preventing situations in which the crime of genocide could be committed, </p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> its full support for the mandate of the Special Adviser of the 
Secretary-General on the prevention of genocide, who acts, inter alia, as an early warning 
mechanism to prevent potential situations that could result in genocide,

of the Special Adviser,<b>2</b> as well as of the convening of two interactive dialogues with the 
Special Adviser at both the third and current sessions of the Council, </p>
<p> 1.<i> Reaffirms</i> the significance of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of 
the Crime of Genocide as an effective international instrument for the prevention and 
punishment of the crime of genocide; 
</p>
<p> 2.<i> Expresses its appreciation</i> to all States that have ratified or acceded to the 
Convention, and in particular to the States that have done so in the years following the adoption 
of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/62 of 20 April 2005; 
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Calls upon </i>States that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Convention to consider 
doing so as a matter of high priority and, where necessary, to enact national legislation in 
conformity with the provisions of the Convention; 
</p>
<p> 4.<i> Reiterates </i>the responsibility of each individual State to protect its population from 
genocide, which entails the prevention of<b> </b>such a crime, including incitement to it, through 
appropriate and necessary means; 
</p>
<p> 5.<b> </b><i>Stresses</i> the importance of enhanced international cooperation, including through the 
United Nations system and through regional organizations, aimed at fostering the principles 
enshrined in the Convention; </p>
<p> 6.<i> Calls upon</i> all States, in order to deter future occurrences of genocide, to cooperate, 
including through the United Nations system, in strengthening appropriate collaboration among 
existing mechanisms that contribute to early detection and prevention of massive, serious and 
systematic violations of human rights, which if not halted, could lead to genocide;

genocide and works to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to analyse and manage

contained in its resolution 62/238, to retain the mandate of the Special Adviser, to upgrade his 
position to the level of Under-Secretary-General and to strengthen his office; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests</i> all Governments to cooperate fully with the Special Adviser in the 
performance of his work, to furnish all relevant information requested and to react promptly to 
his urgent appeals; </p>
<p> 10. <i>Underlines</i> the important role of the United Nations human rights system, including 
of the Council, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the 
relevant special procedures and treaty bodies in addressing the challenge of collating information 
on massive, serious and systematic violations of human rights, and thereby contributing to a 
better understanding and early warning of complex situations that might lead to genocide; 
</p>
<p> 11.<i> Encourages</i> the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide and the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to further enhance the systematic exchange of

<p>information between their offices and between the Special Adviser and all relevant special 
procedures, including those concerned with the promotion and protection of human rights of 
persons belonging to the national, ethnic, racial or religious groups as outlined in article II of the 
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Emphasizes </i>the importance, when addressing complex situations that might lead to 
genocide as defined in the Convention, of a prompt and comprehensive examination of a set of 
multiple factors, including legal factors, the existence of groups at risk, the massive, serious and </p>

<p> 13. <i>Encourages</i> States to make use of appropriate international and regional forums to 
address the issue of prevention of genocide, including, inter alia, the annual meetings of regional

the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council, particularly Security 
Council resolution 497 (1981), in which the Council decided, inter alia, that the decision of Israel 
to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is null and void
