<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conduct of the visit 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography conducted an official visit to Madagascar from 15 to 26 July 2013. She visited 
the cities of Antananarivo, Toliara, Nosy Be and Toamasina. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Madagascar for 
organizing the meetings with the various authorities and for its cooperation before, during 
and after the visit. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur met with the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign 
Affairs, the Minister of Tourism, the Minister of Youth and Recreation and the Director of 
the Office of the Prime Minister. She met with representatives of the Ministry of Population 
and Social Affairs &#8212; including the Adoption Authority &#8212; the Ministry of Justice, the 
Ministry of Internal Security &#8212; including, the central department of the vice and minors 
protection squad &#8212; the Ministries of Education, Labour, Vocational Training, Health, 
Transport and Mines and the State Secretariat for the Gendarmerie. The Special Rapporteur 
also met with the heads of the regions visited, the heads of district, the regional technical 
services and directorates, and with members of the judicial system, local gendarmerie and 
police, river and maritime traffic officials, and transporters. She met with the child 
protection network officials in all the regions visited. She also met with a representative of 
the National Statistics Institute and with members of parliament. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur met with representatives of the United Nations system in 
Madagascar, in particular, the Resident Coordinator, the representative of the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and his team, and with representatives of the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the International Labour Organization (ILO), 
the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM), the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
(OCHA), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and 
the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). 
</p><p>5. The Special Rapporteur met with members of civil society and the private sector and 
visited reception centres.1 She met with child victims of sexual exploitation and street 
children. She also met with youth associations carrying out prevention activities. She 
visited a counselling and legal advice centre in Toamasina. She also carried out day and 
night visits to places where child sexual exploitation is most visible. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Background 
</b></p>
<p>6. Madagascar is composed of 22 regions which are divided into 119 districts, 
subdivided into communes and <i>fokontany</i>. It has an estimated population of 21.9 million 
and 53.4 per cent of the population is aged under 18.2 The country has a high population

<p>growth rate, with a fertility rate of five children per woman in 2011 according to UNICEF. 
Madagascar is particularly prone to natural disasters: it is the fifth most vulnerable country 
in the world to hurricanes,3 it experiences periods of drought and flooding, which is highly 
detrimental to its development. According to UNICEF, in 2012, some 330,000 persons 
were affected by hurricanes that damaged hundreds of schools and many health-care 
centres.4 
</p>
<p>7. Madagascar is one of the least developed countries in the world in spite of its 
significant economic potential. Recent decades have been marked by ongoing political 
instability and a sharp rise in poverty. According to the World Bank, in 2013, more than 92 
per cent of the Malagasy population lived on less than $2 a day, which is 10 per cent more 
than in 2008.5 The country remains near the bottom of the human development index, 
ranking 151st out of 186 countries.6 The chronic problems arising from inadequate 
governance have considerably weakened the country, which is mired in an unprecedented 
political and socioeconomic crisis. The state of poverty and vulnerability of the population 
is alarming, and Malagasy children are at increased risk of violence, abuse and exploitation 
in all its forms, particularly sexual exploitation. According to UNICEF, approximately 1.5 
million primary school-age children are out of school.7 Child labour is a major problem: 
some 24.7 per cent of children aged between 5 and 17 work in Madagascar8 and almost half 
a million children are reportedly engaged in the worst forms of labour. 
</p>
<p>8. Moreover, in the aftermath of the February 2009 coup d&#8217;&#233;tat and in view of the 
international community&#8217;s non-recognition of the new Transitional Government (<i>Haute 
Autorit&#233; de Transition</i>), many foreign donors and partners decided to suspend their 
programmes, with the exception of emergency assistance to the country. Nevertheless, in 
early 2012, the Secretary-General of the United Nations authorized cooperation with the 
central and regional government ministries. The elections scheduled for July were not held 
until the last quarter of the year. It is very difficult to ensure the sustainability and 
implementation of social programmes and policies in this politically unstable climate. The 
cuts in social expenditure by the Government have also had a serious impact on the 
population. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Situation analysis 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Extent and forms of sale and sexual exploitation of children 
</b></p>
<p>9. While it is impossible to provide specific figures on the true extent of the sale and 
sexual exploitation of children in Madagascar, given the clandestine nature of these 
activities, the lack of centralized, disaggregated data and, in particular, the very low number 
of reported cases, child sexual exploitation in Madagascar is clearly a blight on the country. 
It is visible everywhere and so commonplace that it has become taken for granted.

<p><b>  Child prostitution 
</b></p>
<p>10. Notwithstanding the lack of official data disaggregated by sex, background, age and 
status of the victims and of data on perpetrators arrested and tried, which would help to 
quantify the problem, the stakeholders interviewed unanimously agreed that child 
prostitution in Madagascar has reached alarming levels and has risen sharply in recent 
years, particularly since 2009. It affects the whole country and occurs in the majority of 
urban areas (Antananarivo, Mahajanga, Toamasina, Toliara, Antsiranana), mining areas 
(Ilakaka, Moramanga, Tamatave and so forth) and tourist resorts (Nosy Be, Diego-Suarez, 
Mangily, Mahavelona, &#206;le Sainte Marie, Fort Dauphin and so on). 
11. According to the Antananarivo vice and minors protection squad, 546 of the 1,048 
minors questioned in 2011 were victims of prostitution (471 girls and 55 boys). Out of 
1,061 minors questioned in 2012, there were 566 victims of prostitution (500 girls and 66 
boys).9 
12. The Ministry of Population and Social Affairs has a national child protection 
database, which is updated from the report forms completed at the <i>fokontany</i> level. The data 
provided by child protection networks from January to August 2012 showed that 1,043 
children suffered abuse, with 3.16 per cent of cases linked to sexual exploitation. Children 
aged 15 to 17 are the worst affected (51 per cent), followed by children aged 6 to 14 (35 per 
cent).10 Statistics from the Ministry of Population and Social Affairs show that sexual 
violence within the family remains the most common form. 
</p>
<p>13. The investigation conducted by ILO on child victims of sexual exploitation in the 
cities of Antsiranana, Toliara and Antananarivo highlighted the extent of the problem and 
indicated that the average age of entry into prostitution was 13 for girls and 12 for boys.11 
The Antananarivo vice and minors protection squad confirmed that child victims of sexual 
exploitation were increasingly younger and that their number was constantly growing. 
</p>
<p>14. In 2000, the number of child victims of prostitution was reportedly between 1,309 
and 2,217 in Toamasina and between 700 and 850 in Nosy Be. In 2005, approximately 70 
per cent of girl workers aged 12 to 18 in the Ilakaka region &#8212; which has a very high level 
of child workers &#8212; were victims of commercial sexual exploitation. In 2006, almost a 
quarter (23 per cent) of all 2,640 working children aged 6 to 17 in Antsiranana were victims 
of child sexual exploitation. The vast majority of sexually exploited children are girls (90 
per cent). In Toliara and Ifaty, 28 per cent of working children aged 12 to 17 are victims of 
sexual exploitation (i.e., 2,286 children).12 
</p><p>15. A survey conducted by the Tamaga Youth Forum13 in Toamasina identified 1,000 
child victims of sexual exploitation in Toamasina since 2011, of whom 70 per cent were out 
of school.

</p>
<p><i>  Child sex tourism 
</i></p>
<p>16. With regard to the sexual exploitation of children in tourism, all the stakeholders 
interviewed noted with concern the growing scale of the problem in recent years. They 
explained that for many Malagasy families, engaging with a <i>vazaha</i> (foreigner) is highly 
regarded and possibly conducive to upward social mobility. Madagascar has gradually 
acquired the sad distinction of being a major destination for sex tourism. Ministry of 
Tourism statistics show that Madagascar hosted 225,005 tourists in 2011, 15 per cent more 
than the previous year, and that 58 per cent of the total number of tourists were French.14 
Child sex tourism has increased in coastal cities with the recent development of tourism. 
According to the preamble to Act No. 2007-038 of 2008 amending and supplementing 
provisions of the Criminal Code on human trafficking and sex tourism, &#8220;it has been noted 
that sexual exploitation and sex tourism are currently growing at a staggering rate in 
Madagascar; children are particularly exposed to the widespread and continuing practice of 
child prostitution and sex tourism, hence the need to punish those who sexually exploit 
children, who are treated as sexual and commercial objects&#8221;.15 
17. Sexual exploitation of children in tourism is a growing problem and is becoming 
more and more difficult to control. Sexual predators now try to obtain accommodation in 
private homes, where they can escape controls. Bars, discotheques and karaoke venues are 
also favourite spots. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur was able to witness first-hand the gravity of the situation, in 
the most deprived areas of Antananarivo and in the other cities, in tourist resorts, bars, 
restaurants, caf&#233;s and around nightclubs. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the 
new and growing trend of massage parlours set up as a cover for child sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p><i>  Child pornography  
</i></p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur received only very little information on child pornography. 
Although Internet access and use are still very limited in the country,16 risks do still exist. 
</p>
<p>20. The Ministry of Population and Social Affairs recognizes the existence of this 
problem in Madagascar, while noting that it is still difficult to assess its extent given the 
lack of reliable data.17 The vice and minors protection squad registered only one case of 
child pornography in 2011. A 60-year-old French man had abused a 13-year-old girl in 
Toamasina, and the act had been filmed and made public. An investigation was opened, 
three individuals were remanded in custody and the main perpetrator was arrested in June 
</p><p>2013. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur noted with concern the total lack of supervision of Internet 
caf&#233;s and the absence of awareness-raising on the subject. There is currently no awareness 
of the issue. She encouraged the efforts made to implement a legal framework on 
cybercrime (currently being drafted). 
</p><p>22. The research and various interviews conducted by the Special Rapporteur clearly 
demonstrated the lack of a centralized information and data-collection system that could 
provide reliable disaggregated data despite the existence of the Ministry of Population and 
Social Affairs database. Major obstacles to the collection of information on child sexual 
exploitation are the very low number of reported cases and frequent out-of-court

<p>settlements. In its report, the Ministry of Population and Social Affairs also criticized the 
involvement of senior officials in the handling of some cases of abuse.18 
</p>
<p><b>  Sale of children 
</b></p>
<p>23. The sale of children in Madagascar was not presented as a major problem during the 
visit of the Special Rapporteur. It is difficult to assess the true extent of the sale of children 
for intercountry adoption purposes. The aforementioned report of the Ministry of 
Population and Social Affairs refers to 43 child victims of abduction for illegal adoption 
purposes between 2004 and 2006, 28 of whom were returned to their parents and 15 were 
adopted internationally. Act No. 2005-014 of 7 September 2005 on adoption represents a 
considerable step forward in the protection of children&#8217;s rights in adoption proceedings. 
Nevertheless, there remains a significant risk of illegal adoption given that intercountry 
adoptions account for some 80 per cent of all adoptions in Madagascar. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur noted with concern the continuing practice of early 
marriage, particularly in some rural areas, although since 2007 the minimum legal age for 
marriage has been 18. Marriage is sometimes seen as a strategy for the survival of the 
family. Notwithstanding the legal provision that the union of two persons is illegal if one of 
them is a minor (other than in exceptional circumstances and subject to a court decision), in 
2009, 48 per cent of girls aged 20 to 24 were married or in union before the age of 18.19 
According to UNFPA, this is one of the highest levels in the world.20 
</p>
<p>25. A report by the National Confederation of Human Rights Platforms suggests that 
&#8220;girl markets&#8221; still exist in some southern parts of the country, where men choose a partner 
in exchange for money or goods (<i>tsenan&#8217;ampela</i>, where young girls are displayed in cattle 
markets).21 
</p>
<p><i>  Trafficking in children 
</i>26. Many stakeholders have expressed concern about trafficking in persons &#8212; including 
children &#8212; to neighbouring countries and the Middle East, for domestic servitude and 
sexual exploitation purposes. In August 2013, the Transitional Government issued Decree 
No. 2013-594 suspending the deployment of Malagasy migrant workers to high-risk 
countries. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Causes and risk factors 
</b></p>
<p>27. There are numerous interrelated factors underlying the sale and sexual exploitation 
of children. These include &#8220;push&#8221; factors (families facing severe hardship, poverty, lack of 
economic opportunities, difficulty accessing basic social services, school dropout, non-
secure Internet access, social expectations) and &#8220;pull&#8221; factors relating to demand (growing 
demand for sexual services from children, increasingly structured exploitation networks, 
the fast pace of development in child sex tourism destinations).

<p>28. Some categories of children are at greater risk, namely children living on or roaming 
the streets, children without birth certificates, migrant children, child workers, abandoned 
children and orphans, children from institutions and child victims of sexual abuse within 
the family. 
</p>
<p>29. All the stakeholders interviewed expressed concern about the early sexualization of 
children. According to a joint UNICEF/UNFPA study conducted in the south of the 
island,22 the average age of first sexual intercourse is 12 to 13 &#8212; in some cases even 8 to 10 
&#8212; for girls, and 14 to 17 for boys. In social terms, the high value attached to sexual 
intercourse makes it more likely to occur early. Both male and female adolescents gain 
status from &#8220;daring&#8221; (<i>mahasaky</i>). The study suggests that this promotes social tolerance of 
child sexual abuse and exploitation.23  
</p>
<p>30. Many of the stakeholders interviewed also raised the problem that some customs 
promote social tolerance of child sexual exploitation, and complained of the acquiescence 
of parents and communities. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur also noted that the mirage of the <i>vazaha</i> is highly prevalent, 
particularly in some coastal areas. Having a &#8212; supposedly rich &#8212; foreign sexual partner is 
a symbol of a girl&#8217;s success: such a relationship, in addition to the material benefits it brings 
and which the girl would have to share with her family, reportedly carries a certain amount 
of prestige. 
</p>
<p>32. Family impoverishment in Madagascar and the subsequent lack of parental 
responsibility make Malagasy children highly vulnerable. Their educational and 
employment prospects have shrunk considerably and many have to work to support their 
families. The Special Rapporteur was nevertheless outraged that poverty should be used as 
an argument to justify child sexual exploitation. 
</p><p>33. The health situation in Madagascar is alarming. Half of the children aged under 5 
suffer from chronic malnutritition, placing Madagascar among the six countries with the 
highest levels of malnutrition.24 The maternal mortality rate is 498 per 100,000 and the 
child mortality rate is 24 per 1,000.25 According to UNICEF, an increasing number of 
health-care centres are closing down (more than 250 in 2012). Madagascar has the fourth 
worst record in sub-Saharan Africa in terms of access to safe drinking water.26 In 2010, 
51.2 per cent of the population did not have access to sanitation.27 The Government&#8217;s 
expenditure on sanitation has been reduced by half since 2010. 
</p>
<p>34. According to UNICEF, access to education is limited and inequalities have 
increased in recent years. The quality of education has declined because two thirds of 
teachers have no formal training. Education costs for families have increased even though 
education is supposed to be free of charge. Only 3 out of 10 children complete their primary

<p>school education.28 In addition to the lack of human and financial resources, quality social 
services are not provided in some parts of the country owing to difficulty of access. 
</p>
<p>35. With regard to child labour, the results of the National Child Labour Survey in 
Madagascar carried out in 2007 show that 28 per cent of Malagasy children aged between 5 
and 17 are economically active.29 The majority of economically active children aged 
between 5 and 17 (82 per cent, i.e. some 1,534,000 children, including 1.2 million aged 
under 15) carry out hazardous work. The National Child Labour Survey shows that child 
labour is a major barrier to education. Children end up being sexually exploited mainly as a 
result of: (a) relations and contacts with the prostitution scene, (b) the lax or even complicit 
attitude within the community, including parents, (c) easy access to such work for minors 
and (d) the non-implementation of existing laws. 
</p><p>36. There are no specific data on the actual number of street children in Madagascar. 
The Special Rapporteur nevertheless witnessed the scale of the problem. According to 
information provided by some centres within the Civil Society Platform for Children in 
Antananarivo, the number of street children they receive is estimated at around 4,500. The 
aforementioned Ministry of Population and Social Affairs report suggests that 12 per cent 
of Malagasy children do not live with their parents. 
</p>
<p>37. In terms of demand, the absence of effective control of places of sexual exploitation 
and impunity for perpetrators have made the country a sex tourism destination. Not to 
mention the lack of security for children on the Internet, which provides sexual predators 
with easy access to children, particularly through social networks. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Measures to combat and prevent the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Regional and international instruments for the promotion and 
protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>38. Madagascar ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991 and its two 
optional protocols &#8212; the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict 
&#8212; in 2004.30 
</p>
<p>39. Madagascar ratified the ILO Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138) in 2000 
and Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) in 2001. It also ratified the 
1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of 
Intercountry Adoption in 2004 and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (&#8220;Palermo Protocol&#8221;, 2000) in 2005. 
</p><p>40. Madagascar is a party to most of the international human rights treaties but has not

Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (signed in 2007). 
</p><p>41. Madagascar is a member of the African Union and has ratified several of its 
instruments, such as the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (in 2005), 
the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (in 1992) and the Constitutive Act of 
the African Union (in 2003). 
</p>
<p><b> B. National legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. General legal framework for child protection 
</b></p>
<p>42. Madagascar has a relatively comprehensive legal framework for child protection. 
The Constitution contains many child protection provisions. 
</p>
<p>43. Article 4 of Act No. 2007-023 of 20 August 2007 on the rights and the protection of 
the child provides that &#8220;no child shall be subject to any form of neglect, discrimination, 
exploitation, violence, cruelty or oppression&#8221;. According to article 66, &#8220;the State must 
protect children against all forms of ill-treatment and take legislative, administrative, social 
or other measures to eradicate it&#8221;. Under article 69: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Anyone, including parents, relatives, neighbours, friends, local authorities, 
teachers, religious dignitaries, social workers, medical personnel or criminal 
investigation police, who becomes aware of any abuse or attempted abuse must 
report it to the competent administrative or judicial authorities subject to the 
penalties provided for in article 62, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p> The child may also report the abuse. If a child shows signs of abuse, medical 
personnel must draw up a medico-legal report. 
</p>
<p> For this purpose, the medical personnel shall not be bound by the obligation 
of confidentiality.&#8221;31 
</p>
<p>44. Act No. 2007-040 on the issuance of substitute birth certificates under the National 
Programme for Rehabilitating Birth Registration32 empowers the administrative authorities 
to issue substitute birth certificates. In December 2008, the Government Council approved 
a new procedure that extended the statutory period for systematic birth registration from 12 
to 45 days. The bill was not adopted by the parliament, as it was dissolved during the 
political events of 2009. 
</p>
<p>45. Act No. 2005-014 on adoption33 in Madagascar establishes a new procedure for full 
adoption, including international adoption, and the principle of subsidiarity of intercountry 
adoption. It sets the age for the full adoption of a child at 12 and strengthens the procedure 
both at the administrative and judicial stages to prevent any form of misappropriation. 
Decree No. 2006-596 laying down the procedures for implementing the Act34 establishes 
the Adoption Authority (arts. 2&#8211;13) and regulates the approved social and adoption 
reception centres (arts. 14&#8211;32). It sets out the documents required for the procedure and the 
financial contribution to be made by the adoptive parents (arts. 33&#8211;41).

<p>46. Decree No. 2005-025 of 18 January 200535 establishes a Commission on the Rights 
of the Child to examine legislation on children&#8217;s rights with a view to establishing a legal 
and institutional framework consistent with the principles of the Convention of the Rights 
of the Child. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Sale of children 
</b></p>
<p>47. Act No. 2007-038 amending and supplementing provisions of the Criminal Code on 
human trafficking and sex tourism introduces article 333 ter, which defines sale of children 
as &#8220;any act or transaction whereby a child is transferred by any person or group of persons 
to another for remuneration or any other consideration&#8221;.36 However, the criminal penalty 
imposed for the sale of children is not specified, which can make it difficult to apply in 
practice.  
</p>
<p>48. Article 15 of Act No. 2005-014 on adoption provides for a term of hard labour for 
any material and/or financial gain or other improper benefit or advantage derived from 
adoption proceedings.37 However, a lack of precision, and complexities and gaps in the 
legislation make the system complex. For instance, current legislation provides for a series 
of deadlines or lack of deadlines, resulting in children being institutionalized for extended 
periods, which is inconsistent with the general principles enshrined in the legislation. 
Another shortcoming of the Act is the absence of criteria enabling the Adoption Authority 
to adequately match children for adoption with prospective adoptive parents. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Child prostitution  
</b></p>
<p>49. Many provisions in Malagasy law define and criminalize child sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>50. Article 13 of Decree No. 2007-563 on child labour provides that &#8220;the recruitment, 
use, offer and employment of children of either sex for the purpose of prostitution, the 
production of pornography or commercial sexual exploitation are prohibited&#8221;. 38 
</p>
<p>51. Act No. 2007-038 mentioned above significantly supplemented and amended the 
Criminal Code with regard to combating human trafficking and sex tourism. It introduces 
article 331 bis, which states that &#8220;anyone who violates morals by inciting, promoting or 
encouraging immoral behaviour, corruption or the prostitution of children of either sex, in 
order to satisfy the passions of others, shall be sentenced to a term of hard labour&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>52. The Act also introduces article 333 ter, which states that &#8220;a child means every 
human being below the age of 18 years&#8221; and that &#8220;sexual exploitation of a child of either 
sex, for commercial purposes, refers to an act whereby an adult obtains the services of a 
child to have sexual intercourse for remuneration, compensation or payment in kind or 
cash, paid to the child or to one or more third parties as mentioned in articles 334 to 335 bis 
of the Criminal Code, with or without the consent of the child&#8221;. Pimps are punished under 
articles 334 ter, quater and quinto of the Criminal Code and under the second paragraph of 
article 334 ter: &#8220;If the offence has been committed against a child of either sex below the 
age of 15, the perpetrator shall be sentenced to a term of hard labour.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>53. Article 334 quinto thus amended provides that &#8220;anyone who has sexual intercourse 
with a child in return for payment or any other consideration shall be punished by 2 to 5 
years&#8217; imprisonment and/or a fine of 1 million to 10 million ariary&#8221;.

<p><i>  Sexual exploitation of children in tourism  
</i>54. Sex tourism is defined in article 333 ter of the Criminal Code, as amended by Act 
No. 2007-038, and article 335.1 provides that &#8220;sex tourism shall be punished by a term of 
forced labour if it involves a child of either sex below the age of 15&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>55. Under article 335 ter of the Criminal Code, as amended by article 9 of Act No. 
2007-038, &#8220;nationals and persons normally resident in Madagascar who engage in 
trafficking, sexual exploitation and sex tourism in other countries shall be prosecuted and 
punished in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code&#8221;. Under article 335 
quater, &#8220;requests for the extradition of persons wanted for prosecution in a foreign State 
shall be granted in respect of the offences provided for in this Act or to enforce sentences 
for such offences&#8221;. Extraterritorial jurisdiction thus facilitates action against child sex 
tourism. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>56. Article 333 ter of the Criminal Code, as amended by Act No. 2008-038, defines 
child pornography and article 335.1 provides that: &#8220;Child pornography, representing 
children in any way and by any means, or the possession of pornographic material 
involving children, is punishable by the penalties prescribed by article 334 of the Criminal 
Code&#8221;. This provision also applies to the dissemination of child pornography on the 
Internet. 
</p>
<p>57. Furthermore, since the entry into force of Act No. 98-024 of January 1999, article 
346 of the Criminal Code provides that:  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The act of capturing, recording or transmitting a pornographic image of a 
minor for the purpose of its dissemination shall be punished by 2 to 5 years&#8217; 
imprisonment and a fine of 2 million to 10 million ariary. 
</p>
<p> Disseminating such an image by any means shall be subject to the same 
penalties. 
</p>
<p> Penalties shall be 3 to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment and a fine of 4 million to 20 
million ariary when the minor is under the age of 15.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur noted some gaps and vague wording in the legislation, 
particularly in the definitions and provisions relating to the penalties incurred, and she 
commends the work carried out by the Criminal Justice Reform Commission. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Institutional framework for child protection 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Ministry of Population and Social Affairs is responsible for implementing the 
Government&#8217;s protection and social development policy. Despite its very limited resources 
(its operating budget accounted for 0.68 per cent of the State budget in 2013), its remit is 
absolutely enormous. It is responsible for: (a) developing application frameworks; (b) 
coordinating all activities contributing to economic and social development; (c) 
implementing and following up strategies; (d) developing partnerships; (e) evaluating the 
implementation of relevant national and international instruments; and (f) supporting the 
population in the field of non-formal education and reintegration into social and 
professional life. Through its Family and Child Protection Directorate, the Ministry 
oversees all child protection activities. The Ministry is also responsible for the Adoption 
Authority, which implements policies relating to adoptions. 
</p>
<p>60. The child protection networks are community-based and are responsible for: (a) 
monitoring the situation of children in their district; (b) systematically collecting data and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-19125 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>information on the situation of children; (c) coordinating interventions; (d) establishing 
links between the community and available protection services; (e) providing the 
community with a chain of services for child protection and care in cases of ill-treatment; 
(f) addressing child protection issues in humanitarian emergencies and crisis situations; and 
(g) mobilizing resources and organizing advocacy for child protection. The child protection 
network comprises those involved in informal child protection (children, parents, relatives, 
neighbours, community leaders, associations, religious and traditional leaders) and those 
working in formal or institutional child protection (health, education, population, police, 
gendarmerie, tourism, the courts, youth services, transport, districts, municipalities, 
<i>arrondissements</i> and <i>fokontany</i>). There are a total of 765 community child protection 
networks. Unfortunately, most of the stakeholders interviewed recognized that, despite the 
efforts made, these networks are not always operational. Some members do not attend 
meetings, reports are not systematically submitted and many cases of abuse suffered by 
children are still settled out of court within the community. 
</p>
<p>61. The Ministry of Justice is responsible for the legal protection of children through 
juvenile judges and prosecutors. While some judges do commendable work, all 
stakeholders vehemently criticized the lax attitude, complacency, and even corruption, that 
is poisoning the justice system as a whole. The Malagasy people have no confidence in 
their justice system. Even if the family or the victim takes the matter to court, it is often 
covered up. The Special Rapporteur recalled that impunity is one of the main reasons why 
child sexual exploitation is now so widespread. The Ministry of Justice also suffers from 
limited resources. For instance, there are only 13 juvenile judges in the whole of 
Madagascar and some courts in remote areas do not have access to the Internet. 
</p>
<p>62. The vice and minors protection squad and the gendarmerie play a key role in 
protecting children from sexual exploitation, sale and trafficking by providing assistance to 
child victims. The Special Rapporteur noted the extremely limited resources available to the 
vice and minors protection squad in all the towns visited. The vice and minors protection 
squad and the gendarmerie sometimes have no way of getting to the child victim because 
there is no fuel, or even a vehicle. Data collection is often not computerized and patrols39 
are restricted and cannot be carried out in all high-risk areas. None of the vice and minors 
protection squad premises have special interview rooms adapted to the needs of child 
victims (interviews are not filmed although this is required under Act No. 2007-023). While 
some members of the vice and minors protection squad and the gendarmerie do admirable 
work with very limited resources, the Special Rapporteur was informed not only by child 
victims of sexual exploitation, but also by street children, that they were sometimes 
subjected to violence and blackmail by the police.  
</p><p>63. The Ministry of National Education is involved in child protection through its 
educational policy of risk prevention. In addition to the information and awareness-raising 
activities required from them, educational institutions are also expected to inform the child 
protection network they belong to of any risk or potential risk situations, and may report the 
most serious of them to the police and the judiciary. 
64. The Ministry of Tourism, through its policy on healthy and sustainable tourism 
(resisting the worst aspect of tourism), is committed to combating child sexual exploitation 
in tourism. The Ministry supports the dissemination of material to prevent it (booklets, 
leaflets, posters), and works with many partners to that end. Despite its limited resources, 
the Ministry carries out checks in hotels wherever possible, but is powerless to halt the 
growth of the informal sector.

</p>
<p>65. The Ministry of Youth and Recreation plays an active role in child protection, 
particularly through prevention projects (dealing with addiction, prostitution, sexually 
transmissible diseases and crime) and social reintegration projects, and through its support 
for youth centres and forums.  
</p>
<p>66. The Ministry of Health has produced a handbook on assistance for victims of 
violence, including children, in cooperation with UNFPA. However, such assistance 
remains inadequate and not easily accessible, mainly owing to a lack of resources. 
According to UNICEF, the health sector budget was cut by 40 per cent between 2009 and 
</p><p>2010.  
</p>
<p>67. The Ministry of Public Service and Labour has established a Division for the 
Prevention, Abolition and Monitoring of Child Labour to devise a national plan to combat 
child labour.40 
</p>
<p>68. The voluntary sector also plays an important role in child protection. It takes on a 
liaison or service provision role, sometimes carrying out patrols and providing assistance in 
the community, as well as shelter, accommodation and support facilities, and reintegration 
programmes for children and young adults. The Special Rapporteur noted the need to 
strengthen the voluntary sector and regretted that none of the main international child 
protection NGOs were working in Madagascar. 
</p>
<p>69. The National Child Protection Committee, established by Decree No. 2012-848 of 
25 September 2012,41 is responsible for guiding national child protection policy and 
programmes and for coordinating child protection activities. The Committee is chaired by 
the Minister of Population and Social Affairs and is made up of a steering committee and a 
technical commission comprising specialists from the ministerial departments and bodies 
represented on the steering committee. The steering committee includes a representative 
from the Office of the Prime Minister, a director-general from each ministerial department 
and civil society representatives. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the establishment of 
the National Child Protection Committee but noted with concern that the steering 
committee had not met once since it was formed. The various stakeholders interviewed 
criticized the decision makers for their lack of involvement. Strengthening the relationship 
between the Committee and the child protection networks is essential for effective 
coordination. The Committee also needs to be strengthened through technical and financial 
support. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Policies and programmes for the identification, support and follow-up 
of children 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Policies, action plans and programmes  
</b></p>
<p>70. In recent years, Madagascar has developed child protection policies and action 
plans, including the National Action Plan to Combat Child Sex Tourism, the National 
Action Plan to Combat Child Labour, the National Plan of Action on Violence Against 
Children,42 the National Policy for the Advancement of Women,43 the National Gender and 
Development Action Plan and the plan of action to implement the recommendations of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC/C/MDG/CO/3-4, para. 12) of 3 February 2012 
(in progress).

<p>71. The Governance for Child Protection programme, developed in cooperation with 
UNICEF, should strengthen the institutional and legal child protection system. It aims to 
establish and strengthen the community-based system to protect children from violence, 
abuse and exploitation and helps put a stop to the non-registration of children at birth. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur noted that it was difficult to assess the real impact of these 
policies in the absence of a standardized information system providing sound knowledge of 
the number and profile of child victims and children at risk, and of a monitoring and 
evaluation system measuring the impact of initiatives undertaken on the situation of 
children. She regretted that many policies, action plans and programmes could not be 
properly implemented owing to the many obstacles at the executive level and also a serious 
lack of resources. The Special Rapporteur also noted with regret the absence of a 
comprehensive national child protection policy.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Identification, support and rehabilitation of children  
</b></p>
<p>73. The effective care and protection of children who are victims of sale, trafficking, 
abuse or sexual exploitation is a complex process that requires an interdisciplinary, holistic 
approach in order to provide children with medical, psychological, social and legal support 
and assistance, to facilitate their rehabilitation and reintegration and to ensure appropriate 
follow-up.  
</p>
<p><i> (a) Identification, reporting and complaint mechanisms  
</i>74. There are many reporting mechanisms in Madagascar. As mentioned earlier, Act 
No. 2007-02344 introduced several innovations, including mandatory reporting, to 
strengthen the protection of child victims. Various provisions of the aforementioned Act 
No. 2007-03845 against sex tourism also encourage reporting. Report forms, available at the 
<i>fokontany</i> level, have been devised by the Ministry of Population and Social Affairs.  
75. Two hotlines have been set up. The helpline (147) is used as a tool to report cases of 
ill-treatment and violence against children and child abuse and exploitation. The 147 
helpline counselling centres operating from the vice and minors protection squad in 11 
towns received and referred 1,090 calls in 2012. The majority of cases involve sexual abuse 
and physical assault of minors. The 511 hotline is operated by the Association Serasera 
Fanantenana and aims to provide young people with guidance and advice on various issues 
affecting them directly. Both hotlines receive support from UNICEF. 
</p>
<p>76. In addition to the protection provided under criminal law, child victims may seek 
assistance from non-judicial referral mechanisms, namely, counselling and legal advice 
centres and legal clinics. The counselling and legal advice centres, supported by UNFPA, 
have been created at the municipal level to ensure that child victims are heard. The legal 
clinics are attached to the Ministry of Justice in cooperation with technical and financial 
partners. The Rapporteur noted with regret that their resources are too limited to provide 
effective psychological and social care to victims. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur noted during interviews that most of the complaint 
mechanisms were deficient. Many stakeholders also expressed concern over the slow pace 
of legal procedures, which adversely affects the right of child victims to an appropriate 
remedy. Moreover, the participation of children in legal proceedings is inconsistent with 
international standards (Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and

<p>Witnesses of Crime46) which provide that children&#8217;s testimonies and safety should be taken 
into account and confidentiality observed.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Support and rehabilitation 
</i>78. A pool of lawyers specializing in the protection of women and child victims of 
abuse was established in September 2011. At the moment, this pool operates in 
Antananarivo and there are plans to extend it throughout the national territory. The Ministry 
of Justice expressed concern about the absence of social workers in the courts. There are 
reportedly only two social workers for the whole of Antananarivo. According to the 
Association of Professional Social Workers, counselling for child victims is less than 
adequate and psychological assessments are hardly ever done. 
</p>
<p>79. According to the Ministry of Population and Social Affairs, there are 75 social 
centres and 21 authorized adoption centres, which cater for a total of 7,583 children. 
Altogether, 161 centres have been identified. The vice and minors protection squad 
emphasized the difficulty of finding centres for children with disabilities and the problem of 
having to pay for expert medical assessments (a medical report provided in cases of abuse 
or ill-treatment costs 6,000 ariary). 
</p><p>80. The foster family system (Decree No. 2006-88547) is an alternative temporary 
placement measure, ordered where children are at risk (street children, lost children, child 
victims of violence or abandonment) before they are returned to their families of origin or, 
as a last resort, adopted. A circular on implementation of the Decree provides for the 
system to be tested in four pilot areas (Diego-Suarez, Antsirabe, Toamasina and 
Antananarivo); however, only the Diego-Suarez project has been implemented. 
81. Many associations specializing in combating all forms of ill-treatment, abuse and 
exploitation of children, including trafficking and prostitution, provide care to child 
victims. Their mission is to report such cases and to receive, house and/or reintegrate child 
victims of sexual exploitation, but they operate with very limited resources. They also face 
many obstacles created by the authorities and sometimes receive inadequate support from 
United Nations agencies, as the Special Rapporteur observed during her visits to 
programmes and reception centres. 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur expressed deep concern at the obvious lack of programmes 
and mechanisms providing integrated care. There is an acute shortage of social 
reintegration mechanisms in Madagascar in relation to the very large and growing number 
of children at risk and child victims. The Special Rapporteur also noted that there are few 
initiatives to follow up children taken into care, owing to a lack of resources. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Prosecution and punishment of offenders  
</i>83. The Special Rapporteur noted with deep concern that none of the judicial services 
interviewed had been able to cite a single conviction for child sexual exploitation, even 
though it is recognized to be a real plague in Madagascar.  
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur noted with alarm the large number of complaints that are not 
upheld, as a result of the lack of enforcement of laws by the judicial authorities and also 
frequent out-of-court settlements. One of the major challenges in the protection of child 
victims relates to impunity and corruption, which seriously hinders law enforcement.

</b></p>
<p><b> E. Preventive measures 
</b></p>
<p>85. The public and private media produce programmes on the fight against sexual 
tourism and child sexual exploitation and trafficking. For example, local radio stations in 
Ambanja, in the Diana Region, simultaneously broadcast a programme on child protection 
every Wednesday at 2 p.m. 
</p>
<p>86. Furthermore, audiovisual information and awareness-raising materials have been 
produced on child sexual exploitation. With the support of UNICEF and UNDP, films have 
been produced and broadcast on the public and private channels (<i>Vero sy Haingo, Aina, 
Jaomalaza, Fandrika</i>). 
87. In an effort to eliminate child labour, the Tackling child labour through education 
(TACKLE) project, coordinated by ILO and supported by the European Commission, the 
Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labour, aims to ensure equitable access to 
primary education and to skills development. 
</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur regrets that sex education is included only in the secondary 
school curriculum48 despite the fact that most pupils are already sexually active. According 
to information received, little information is provided on contraception and protection 
against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Although according to UNICEF figures, the 
prevalence of HIV/AIDS is only 0.3 per cent, the Special Rapporteur expressed great 
concern about the risks incurred by children frequently having unprotected sex, which leads 
to a high level of early pregnancies.49 During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was also 
informed that most child sexual exploitation victims did not use any contraception or 
protection against STDs.  
</p>
<p>89. In an effort to prevent sex tourism, the Ministry of Tourism, in cooperation with a 
number of partners, distributed 33,000 posters and 50,000 brochures throughout the 
national territory, through the regional tourism directorates, tourism professionals and their 
partners. An awareness-raising campaign was launched in 2011 in three pilot regions. As 
part of the campaign, 3,700 copies of a new booklet, &#8220;Best practices for tourism 
professionals in combating child sex tourism&#8221; were produced in 2012 with the support of 
End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking Children for Sexual Purposes 
(ECPAT) France. The Special Rapporteur recommended that this awareness-raising 
material should be prominently displayed in aircraft, including on domestic flights.50 
</p>
<p>90. The prevention of all forms of child exploitation is a long-term endeavour which 
should extend beyond mere awareness-raising campaigns. Effective prevention addresses 
the root causes of the problem, including risk factors, push factors and factors linked to 
demand.

</p>
<p><b> F. Training and capacity-building  
</b></p>
<p>91. In terms of capacity-building for practising judges, particularly those handling cases 
involving minors, in-service training is scheduled annually at the National College of the 
Judiciary and Court Officers.  
</p>
<p>92. For the Criminal Investigation Police, the National Police Academy and the National 
Gendarmerie Academy provide specialized training on the concept of abuse and the rights 
of children, in listening and interviewing techniques in dealing with child victims, and in 
child protection laws and procedures. At least 50 officers from the Brigade for the 
Protection of Minors are trained each year. 
</p>
<p>93. In order to implement the recommendations made during the universal periodic 
review (A/HRC/14/13), the Ministry of Justice organized training sessions on combating 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, in partnership with UNDP and the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR). 
</p><p>94. The sociology department of the University of Antananarivo provides training for 
social workers. The Association of Professional Social Workers also provides training for 
social workers on the protection of the rights of child victims. The Special Rapporteur 
noted, however, that the social work sector was not highly regarded and was under-funded. 
</p>
<p>95. Training for doctors providing care to child victims is planned for 2014. A handbook 
on medical care for victims of sexual violence, for use by medical professionals, was 
approved in 2012. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur noted with serious concern the lack 
of involvement of the health sector in child protection issues. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Participation by children  
</b></p>
<p>96. The Rapporteur welcomed the many initiatives involving children and young people 
in Madagascar. She visited the Tamaga Youth Forum in Toamasina and spoke to the young 
people there, who carry out prevention, awareness-raising, training, outreach and 
counselling activities. She also met with members of the Nosy Be Youth Centre who are 
equally very involved in prevention activities focusing, for instance, on sexual exploitation. 
Despite the poor condition of their premises and the very limited resources available, these 
young people do admirable work and represent a beacon of hope for the country.  
</p>
<p>97. The Special Rapporteur was informed of other initiatives in place, such as the 
Children&#8217;s Parliament in Diego-Suarez, which, however, appears not to be working 
properly.  
</p>
<p>98. UNICEF supported the introduction of Junior Reporters&#8217; Clubs. Their mission is to 
host programmes, cover the news, encourage discussion and promote reflection on topics of 
interest to them, through the medium of radio. Forty Junior Reporters&#8217; Clubs are currently 
in operation in 21 regions of Madagascar. Their aim is to raise awareness among their peers 
&#8212; but also among adults &#8212; about issues that affect them. They investigate local issues and 
initiate discussion with their peers, their elders and local officials in order to find local 
solutions. 
</p>
<p>99. The Special Rapporteur noted with regret that so little weight is given to children&#8217;s 
testimonies in Madagascar and lamented the burden imposed by a &#8220;culture of silence&#8221;.  </p>

<p>GE.13-19125 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b> H. Monitoring bodies 
</b></p>
<p>100. The National Human Rights Council was established in 2008. It had been in 
existence since 1996 as the National Human Rights Commission. It is not operational yet 
because it has no members. There is no independent mechanism in Madagascar to follow 
up and monitor the human rights situation, particularly that of children&#8217;s rights.51 
</p>
<p><b> I. Social responsibility of the private sector  
</b></p>
<p>101. The private sector in Madagascar has started to take action against child sexual 
exploitation, particularly in the tourism sector. During her official visit, the Special 
Rapporteur attended the closing session of a training workshop for hotels in combating 
child sexual exploitation, which brought together some 60 hotels in Nosy Be and resulted in 
the signing of a code of conduct against the commercial sexual exploitation of children (a 
project supported by UNICEF, ILO, the European Union, the African, Caribbean and 
Pacific Group of States and the Madagascar National Tourist Board). The Special 
Rapporteur also noted that the Toliara and Toamasina Regional Tourist Boards were firmly 
committed to the issue and actively participated in awareness-raising activities. 
</p>
<p>102. The telecommunications sector has also demonstrated its commitment to child 
protection. The telephone operators Telma, Orange and Airtel supported the establishment 
of hotlines 147 and 511. 
</p>
<p>103. The Special Rapporteur noted with concern Internet providers&#8217; lack of commitment 
to protecting children online. 
</p>
<p><b> J. International and regional cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>104. In the light of the political situation and the international community&#8217;s non-
recognition of the Transitional Government, international cooperation has declined since 
</p><p>2009. Only emergency activities (health, education, food) have been maintained. 
105. The Special Rapporteur encourages the international community to support the 
introduction of efficient mechanisms for good governance and justice, the establishment of 
a comprehensive child protection policy and the implementation of local development plans 
(including a child protection and family support component) to effectively and sustainably 
combat all forms of violence against children and child abuse and exploitation. 
</p>
<p>106. The Special Rapporteur commends the efforts made by international organizations 
to support child protection and development projects but these initiatives would be more 
effective if they were part of a synergistic and concerted effort. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The scourge of child sexual exploitation through prostitution and sex tourism is

attitudes. Its spiralling levels, especially since 2009, are alarming. The true extent of

<p><b>20</b> GE.13-19125 
</p>
<p><b>the problem is difficult to determine owing in part to reluctance to report cases, and to 
fear of reprisals. The few cases reported do not give rise to severe penalties such as 
those prescribed by law. Significant social and economic hardship, the complicity of 
some parents and school dropout have made children highly vulnerable to all forms of 
economic and sexual exploitation. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>While Madagascar has a relatively comprehensive legal framework, its 
implementation lacks effectiveness because of impunity and children&#8217;s difficulty in 
accessing remedies guaranteeing their protection and safety. Out-of-court settlements 
are often made at the community level, at the children&#8217;s expense, their testimonies 
receiving very little attention. The Special Rapporteur expresses deep concern at the 
trivialization of child sexual exploitation and impunity for perpetrators of such 
crimes. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Notwithstanding the initiatives undertaken, the support provided to children 
remains highly fragmented and suffers from a severe lack of resources. The Special 
Rapporteur stresses the seriousness of the situation and the need to take urgent action 
to create a comprehensive child protection framework. Eliminating child sexual 
exploitation in Madagascar is a long-term process that will simultaneously require (a) 
capacity-building in institutions and services for children, (b) combating corruption 
and impunity, (c) ensuring operational intersectoral coordination, (d) establishing 
accountability mechanisms, (e) implementing sustainable social and economic 
alternatives and (f) promoting protective social norms. These measures will be largely 
dependent on stable policies that respect human rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>In a spirit of dialogue and cooperation, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
make the following recommendations. She is confident that every effort will be made 
to implement them and stands ready to offer her full cooperation and assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>In order to effectively and sustainably protect all children from all forms of 
violence, abuse and exploitation, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
adopt a cross-cutting approach based on children&#8217;s rights, with a view to establishing 
a comprehensive national strategic framework for child protection. This strategy will 
make it possible to establish integrated protection mechanisms consistent with 
international human rights standards. </b></p>
