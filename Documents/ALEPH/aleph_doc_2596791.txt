Explanatory Note
This Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-212795) of Comstock
Resources, Inc. (the “Company”) is being filed solely to (i) update the Calculation of Registration Fee
Table  on  the  cover  page  of  the  Registration  Statement,  (ii)  amend  Item  21  of  Part  II  and  the  Index  to
Exhibits and (iii) file updated Exhibits 5.1, 5.2, 25.1, 25.2, and 25.3.
This Amendment No. 1 does not modify any provision of the preliminary prospectus constituting Part I or
Items  20  or  22  of  Part  II  of  the  Registration  Statement.  Accordingly,  this  Amendment  No.  1  does  not

Company is filing a Prospectus Supplement, which amends certain terms of the preliminary prospectus.
PART II
INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS
Item 20. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
Section 78.7502 of the Nevada Revised Statutes permits a corporation to indemnify any person who was,
is or is threatened to be made a party in a completed, pending or threatened proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (except an action by or in the right of the corporation), by reason
of being or having been an officer, director, employee or agent of the corporation or serving in certain
capacities at the request of the corporation. Indemnification may include attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement. The person to be indemnified must have acted in good faith and in a
manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with
respect to any criminal action, such person must have had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct
was unlawful.
With respect to actions by or in the right of the corporation, indemnification may not be made for any
claim,  issue  or  matter  as  to  which  such  a  person  has  been  finally  adjudged  by  a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction to be liable to the corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the corporation, unless and
only to the extent that the court in which the action was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction
determines upon application that in view of all circumstances the person is fairly and reasonably entitled
to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper.
Unless indemnification is ordered by a court, the determination to pay indemnification must be made by
the stockholders, by a majority vote of a quorum of the Board of Directors who were not parties to the
action,  suit  or  proceeding,  or  in  certain  circumstances  by  independent  legal  counsel  in  a  written
opinion. Section 78.751 of the Nevada Revised Statutes permits the articles of incorporation or bylaws to
provide for payment to an indemnified person of the expenses of defending an action as incurred upon
receipt  of  an  undertaking  to  repay  the  amount  if  it  is  ultimately  determined  by  a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction that the person is not entitled to indemnification.
Section  78.7502  also  provides  that  to  the  extent  a  director,  officer,  employee  or  agent  has  been
successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any such action, he must be indemnified by the
corporation against expenses, including attorneys’ fees, actually and reasonably incurred in connection
with the defense.
Article VI, “Indemnification of Directors, Officers, Employees and Agents,” of the Company’s Amended
and  Restated  Bylaws  provides  as  follows  with  respect  to  indemnification  of  the  Company’s  directors,
officers, employees and agents:
Section 1.   To the fullest extent allowed by Nevada law, any director of the Company shall not be liable
to the Company or its shareholders for monetary damages for an act or omission in the director’s capacity
as a director, except that this Article VI does not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for:
(a)   an act or omission which involves intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law; or
(b)   the payment of dividends in violation of N.R.S. 78.300.
Section 2.   The Company shall indemnify each director, officer, employee and agent, now or hereafter
serving the Company, each former director, officer, employee and agent, and each person who may now
or hereafter serve or who may have heretofore served at the Company’s request as a director, officer,
employee  or  agent  of  another  corporation  or  other  business  enterprise,  and  the  respective  heirs,
executors, administrators and personal representatives of each of them against all expenses actually and
reasonably incurred by, or imposed upon, him in connection with the defense of any claim, action, suit
II-1
or proceeding, civil or criminal, against him by reason of his being or having been such director, officer,
employee or agent, except in relation to such matters as to which he shall be adjudged by a court of
competent jurisdiction after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom in such action, suit or proceeding to be
liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of duty. For purposes hereof, the term
“expenses” shall include but not be limited to all expenses, costs, attorneys’ fees, judgments (including
adjudications other than on the merits), fines, penalties, arbitration awards, costs of arbitration and sums
paid out and liabilities actually and reasonably incurred or imposed in connection with any suit, claim,
action or proceeding, and any settlement or compromise thereof approved by the Board of Directors as
being  in  the  best  interests  of  the  Company.  However,  in  any  case  in  which  there  is  no  disinterested
majority of the Board of Directors available, the indemnification shall be made: (1) only if the Company
shall be advised in writing by counsel that in the opinion of counsel (a) such officer, director, employee or
agent was not adjudged or found liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of
duty as such director, officer, employee or agent or the indemnification provided is only in connection with
such matters as to which the person to be indemnified was not so liable, and in the case of settlement or
compromise,  the  same  is  in  the  best  interests  of  the  Company;  and  (b)  indemnification  under  the
circumstances is lawful and falls within the provisions of these Bylaws; and (2) only in such amount as
counsel shall advise the Company in writing is, in his opinion, proper. In making or refusing to make any
payment  under  this  or  any  other  provision  of  these  Bylaws,  the  Company,  its  directors,  officers,
employees and agents shall be fully protected if they rely upon the written opinion of counsel selected by,
or in the manner designated by, the Board of Directors.
Section 3.   Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by
the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by the
Board  of  Directors  upon  receipt  of  an  undertaking  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  director,  officer,  employee,
representative or agent to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to
be indemnified by the Company as authorized in these Bylaws.
Section 4.   The Company may indemnify each person, though he is not or was not a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company, who served at the request of the Company on a committee created
by the Board of Directors to consider and report to it in respect of any matter. Any such indemnification
may be made under the provisions hereof and shall be subject to the limitations hereof, except that (as
indicated) any such committee member need not be nor have been a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Company.
Section 5.   The provisions hereof shall be applicable to actions, suits or proceedings (including appeals)
commenced after the adoption hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions to act occurring before or
after the adoption hereof.
Section 6.   The indemnification provisions herein provided shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, or by law or statute, both as to action in his official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to
be  a  director,  officer,  employee  or  agent  and  shall  inure  to  the  benefit  of  the  heirs,  executors  and
administrators of such a person.
Section 7.   The Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was
a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other
enterprise, and persons described in Section 4 of this Article above, against any liability asserted against
him and incurred by him in any such capacity or arising out of his status, as such, whether or not the
Company would have the power to indemnify  him  against  such  liability  under  the  provisions  of  these
Bylaws.

Item 21. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.
A list of exhibits filed with this registration statement on Form S-4 is set forth on the Exhibit Index and is
incorporated herein by reference.
Item 22. Undertakings.
The undersigned registrants hereby undertake:
(i)
To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to
this registration statement:
(1)
to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act;
to  reflect  in  the  prospectus  any  facts  or  events  arising  after  the  effective  date  of  the
(2)
to  reflect  in  the  prospectus  any  facts  or  events  arising  after  the  effective  date  of  the
registration  statement  (or  the  most  recent  post-effective  amendment  thereof)  which
individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth
in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in the
volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed
that  which  was  registered)  and  any  deviation  from  the  low  or  high  end  of  the  estimated
maximum  offering  range  may  be  reflected  in  the  form  of  prospectus  filed  with  the
Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price
represent no more than a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set
forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and
(3)
to  include  any  material  information  with  respect  to  the  plan  of  distribution  not  previously
disclosed  in  the  registration  statement  or  any  material  change  to  such  information  in  the
registration statement.
(ii) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective
amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered
therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide
offering thereof.
(iii) To remove from the registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being
registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.
(iv) That,  for  purposes  of  determining  liability  under  the  Securities  Act  to  any  purchaser,  each
prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering,
other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance
on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the
date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration
statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated
or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the
registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use,
supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that
was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date
of first use.
(v) That,  for  the  purpose  of  determining  liability  of  the  registrants  under  the  Securities  Act  to  any
purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned registrants undertake that in a
primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrants pursuant to this registration statement,
regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities
are offered or sold to such
II-3
purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrants will each
purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrants will each
be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:
(1)
any  preliminary  prospectus  or  prospectus  of  the  undersigned  registrants  relating  to  the
offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;
(2)
any  free  writing  prospectus  relating  to  the  offering  prepared  by  or  on  behalf  of  the
undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrants;
(3)
the portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material
information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the
undersigned registrants; and
(4)
any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrants
to the purchaser.
Insofar  as  indemnification  for  liabilities  arising  under  the  Securities  Act  may  be  permitted  to
directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrants pursuant to the provisions described in
Item  20,  or  otherwise,  the  registrant  has  been  advised  that  in  the  opinion  of  the  SEC  such
indemnification  is  against  public  policy  as  expressed  in  the  Securities  Act  and  is,  therefore,
unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the
payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of
the  registrant  in  the  successful  defense  of  any  action,  suit  or  proceeding)  is  asserted  by  such
director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant
will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit
to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public
policy  as  expressed  in  the  Securities  Act  and  will  be  governed  by  the  final  adjudication  of  such
issue.
(vi)
(vii) To respond to requests for information that is incorporated by reference into the prospectus pursuant
to Items 4, 10(b), or 11 or 13 of this form, within one business day of receipt of such request, and to
send the incorporated documents by first class mail or other equally prompt means. This includes
information  contained  in  documents  filed  subsequent  to  the  date  of  the  registration  statement
through the date of responding to the request.
(viii) To supply by means of a post-effective amendment all information concerning a transaction, and the
company  being  acquired  involved  therein,  that  was  not  the  subject  of  and  included  in  the
registration statement when it became effective.
