NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited)
Note 1—Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial information for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, have been prepared by the Company and were not audited by its independent
registered public accountants. In the opinion of management, all normal and recurring
adjustments have been made to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows of the Company at June 30, 2016 and for all reported periods. Results of operations
for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full
year or any future periods.
The balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements
at that date. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have
been condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes thereto included in the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Certain prior
period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
Unless the context otherwise indicates, any references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to
the “Company,” "we," or "us" refer to PetroQuest Energy, Inc. ("PetroQuest") and its wholly-
owned consolidated subsidiaries, PetroQuest Energy, L.L.C. (a single member Louisiana limited
liability company), PetroQuest Oil & Gas, L.L.C. (a single member Louisiana limited liability
company), TDC Energy LLC (a single member Louisiana limited liability company) and Pittrans,
Inc. (an Oklahoma corporation).
Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisition:
In June 2014, the Company entered into a joint venture in Louisiana for an aggregate purchase
price of $24 million. The assets acquired under the joint venture include an average 37% working
interest in an approximately 30,000 acre leasehold position in Louisiana and exclusive rights,
along with the Company's joint venture partner, to a 200 square mile proprietary 3D survey which
has generated several conventional and shallow non-conventional oil focused prospects.
The purchase price was comprised of $10 million in cash and $14 million in cash funding for
future drilling, completion and lease acquisition costs. At December 31, 2015, $4.4 million of this
drilling carry remained outstanding and was reflected as accrued acquisition costs in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. During February 2016, the Company paid $4.4 million to settle this
liability with its joint venture partner in connection with the terms of the agreement.
Divestitures:
On June 4, 2015, the Company completed the sale of a majority of its interests in the Woodford
and Mississippian Lime (the “Sold Assets”) for $260.2 million. At December 31, 2014, the
estimated proved reserves attributable to the Sold Assets totaled approximately 227 Bcfe, which
represented approximately 57% of the Company's estimated proved reserves. Under the full cost
method of accounting, sales of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments of
capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized, unless the adjustment significantly alters the
relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. A significant alteration is generally
not expected to occur for sales involving less than 25% of the total proved reserves. If the
divestiture of the Sold Assets was accounted for as an adjustment of capitalized costs with no
gain or loss recognized, the adjustment would have significantly altered the relationship between
capitalized costs and proved reserves. Accordingly, the Company recognized a gain on the sale
of $21.5 million in June 2015. The carrying value of the properties sold was determined by
allocating total capitalized costs within the full cost pool between properties sold and properties
retained based on their relative fair values.
In March 2016, the Company sold certain non-producing assets in East Texas for $7 million in
connection with the negotiation of a joint venture. This sale was accounted for as an adjustment
to the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties. Negotiations of the terms and conditions of this
joint venture are currently ongoing. If the Company is unable to reach an agreement with respect
to the joint venture, the Company will be required to purchase the non-producing assets for $5.0
million on or before December 31, 2016.
On April 20, 2016, the Company completed the sale of a majority of its remaining Woodford
Shale assets in the East Hoss field (the "East Hoss Assets") for approximately $18 million,
subject to customary post-closing purchase price adjustments, effective April 1, 2016. This sale
was accounted for as an adjustment to the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties.

Table of Contents
Note 3—Equity
Common Stock
On May 18, 2016, the Company effected a reverse split of the Company's common stock at a
ratio of one share of newly issued common stock for each four shares of issued and outstanding
common stock (the "Reverse Split"). The purpose of the Reverse Split was to increase the per
share trading price of the Company's common stock in order to regain compliance with the New
York Stock Exchange continued listing standards. The Reverse Split proportionately reduced the
total number of outstanding shares of common stock from approximately 70.1 million shares to
approximately 17.5 million shares. All references in the consolidated financial statements and
notes to consolidated financial statements to the number of shares, per share data, restricted
stock and stock option data have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Split.
Convertible Preferred Stock
The Company has 1,495,000 shares of 6.875% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual
Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) outstanding.
The following is a summary of certain terms of the Series B Preferred Stock:
Dividends. The Series B Preferred Stock accumulates dividends at an annual rate of 6.875% for
each share of Series B Preferred Stock. Dividends are cumulative from the date of first issuance
and, to the extent payment of dividends is not prohibited by the Company’s debt agreements,
assets are legally available to pay dividends and the Company’s board of directors or an
authorized committee of the board declares a dividend payable, the Company pays dividends in
cash, every quarter.
In connection with an amendment to the Company's bank credit facility prohibiting the Company
from declaring or paying dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, the Company suspended the
quarterly cash dividend on its Series B Preferred Stock beginning with the dividend payment due
on April 15, 2016. Under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, any unpaid dividends will
accumulate. As of June 30, 2016, the Company has deferred one dividend payment and has
accrued a $2.6 million payable which is included in Other long-term liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2016. If the Company fails to pay six quarterly dividends
on the Series B Preferred Stock, whether or not consecutive, holders of the Series B Preferred
Stock, voting as a single class, will have the right to elect two additional directors to the
Company's Board of Directors until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series B
Preferred Stock are paid in full.
Mandatory conversion. The Company may, at its option, cause shares of the Series B Preferred
Stock to be automatically converted at the applicable conversion rate, but only if the closing sale
price of the Company’s common stock for 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive
trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date the Company gives the
conversion notice equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion price in effect on each such trading
day.
Conversion rights. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the
option of the holder, into 0.8608 shares of the Company’s common stock (which is based on a
conversion price of approximately $58.08 per share of common stock as adjusted for the Reverse
Split, subject to further adjustment) plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to the
Company’s right to settle all or a portion of any such conversion in cash or shares of the
Company’s common stock. If the Company elects to settle all or any portion of its conversion
obligation in cash, the conversion value and the number of shares of the Company’s common
stock it will deliver upon conversion (if any) will be based upon a 20 trading day averaging
period.
Upon any conversion, the holder will not receive any cash payment representing accumulated
and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, whether or not in arrears, except in limited
circumstances. The conversion rate is equal to $50 divided by the conversion price at the time.
The conversion price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. The
conversion price on the conversion date and the number of shares of the Company’s common
stock, as applicable, to be delivered upon conversion may be adjusted if certain events occur.

Note 5—Long-Term Debt
On August 19, 2010, the Company issued $150 million in principal amount of its 10% Senior
Notes due 2017. On July 3, 2013, the Company issued an additional $200 million in principal
amount of its 10% Senior Notes due 2017 (collectively, the "2017 Notes").

Table of Contents
On January 14, 2016, the Company announced the commencement of a private exchange offer
(the "Exchange") and consent solicitation (the "Consent Solicitation") to certain eligible holders
of its outstanding 2017 Notes. The Exchange closed on February 17, 2016, and in satisfaction of
the tender of $214.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes, representing
approximately 61% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes, in the
Exchange the Company (i) paid approximately $53.6 million of cash, (ii) issued $144.7 million
aggregate principal amount of its new 10% Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2021 (the
"2021 Notes") and (iii) issued approximately 1.1 million shares of its common stock. Following
the completion of the Exchange, $135.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes
remain outstanding. The Consent Solicitation eliminated or waived substantially all of the
restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing the 2017 Notes.
The Exchange was accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring pursuant to guidance provided
by FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") section 470-60 "Troubled Debt
Restructurings by Debtors." The Company determined that the future undiscounted cash flows
from the 2021 Notes issued in the Exchange through the maturity date exceeded the adjusted
carrying amount of the 2017 Notes tendered in the Exchange. Accordingly, no gain on
extinguishment of debt was recognized in connection with the Exchange. The excess of the
future undiscounted cash flows from the 2021 Notes issued in the Exchange over the remaining
carrying value of the 2017 Notes tendered in the Exchange of $13.9 million is reflected as part of
the carrying value of the 2021 Notes. Such excess will be amortized under the effective interest
method as a reduction of interest expense over the term of the 2021 Notes. At June 30, 2016,
$13.0 million of the excess remained as part of the carrying value of the 2021 Notes and the
Company recognized $0.9 million of amortization expense as a reduction to interest expense
during the first half of 2016.
The indenture governing the 2021 Notes contains affirmative and negative covenants that,
among other things, limit the ability of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors of the 2021
Notes to incur indebtedness; purchase or redeem stock; make certain investments; create liens
that secure debt; enter into transactions with affiliates; sell assets; refinance certain
indebtedness; merge with or into other companies or transfer substantially all of their assets; and,
in certain circumstances, to pay dividends or make other distributions on stock. The 2021 Notes
are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries
of the Company.
The 2021 Notes are secured by second-priority liens on substantially all of the Company's and
the subsidiary guarantors' oil and gas properties and substantially all of their other assets to the
extent such properties and assets secure the Credit Agreement (as defined below), except for
certain excluded assets. Pursuant to the terms of an intercreditor agreement, the security interest
in those properties and assets that secure the 2021 Notes and the guarantees are contractually
subordinated to liens that secure the Credit Agreement and certain other permitted indebtedness.
Consequently, the 2021 Notes and the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to the Credit
Agreement and such other indebtedness to the extent of the value of such assets.
The 2021 Notes bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum on the principal amount and interest is
payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning August
15, 2016. At June 30, 2016, $5.4 million had been accrued in connection with the August 15,
2016 payment and the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the 2021
Notes. Interest on the 2017 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 and the
2017 Notes mature on September 1, 2017. At June 30, 2016, $4.5 million had been accrued in
connection with the September 1, 2016 interest payment and the Company was in compliance
with all of the covenants under the 2017 Notes.
During 2015, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt
Issuance Costs", which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements
to present such costs as a direct deduction from the related liability rather than as an asset. As a
result, the 2017 Notes are reflected net of $0.9 million and $3.0 million of related financing costs
at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The 2021 Notes are reflected net of $1.2
million of related financing costs as of June 30, 2016.
The following table reconciles the face value of the 2017 Notes and 2021 Notes to the carrying
value included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 (in thousands):

The Company and PetroQuest Energy, L.L.C. (the “Borrower”) have a Credit Agreement (as
amended, the “Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,
Capital One, N.A., IberiaBank, Bank of America, N.A. and The Bank of Nova Scotia. The Credit
Agreement provides the Company with a revolving credit facility that permits borrowings based
on the commitments of the lenders and the available borrowing base as determined in
accordance with the Credit Agreement.
8
Table of Contents
The Credit Agreement does not presently allow the Company to issue letters of credit thereunder.
The credit facility matures on the earlier of June 4, 2020 or February 19, 2017 if any portion of the
Company’s 2017 Notes remains outstanding as of such date which has not been refinanced with
either permitted refinancing debt or permitted second lien debt with a maturity date no earlier than
180 days after June 4, 2020, all as defined in the Credit Agreement.
The borrowing base under the Credit Agreement is determined by March 31 and September 30
of each year and is based upon the valuation of the reserves attributable to the Company’s oil
and gas properties as of January 1 and July 1 of each year. If the Company incurs any
borrowings, or causes the lenders to issue any letters of credit, under the Credit Agreement (the
“Financial Covenant Reinstatement Date”), two interim redeterminations would occur on July 31
and December 31 of each year commencing on the first July 31 or December 31 subsequent to
the Financial Covenant Reinstatement Date. The Company or the lenders may also request two
additional borrowing base re-determinations each year. Each time the borrowing base is to be re-
determined, the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement will propose a new borrowing
base as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, which must be approved by all lenders if the
borrowing base is to be increased, or by lenders holding two-thirds of the amounts outstanding
under the Credit Agreement if the borrowing base remains the same or is reduced. As of June 30,
2016, the borrowing base and aggregate commitments of the lenders were both $22.5 million.
The Company has no borrowings outstanding under (and no letters of credit issued pursuant to)
the Credit Agreement.
The obligation of the lenders to make loans on the account of any borrowing or issue letters of
credit under the Credit Agreement, include that (i) at the time of and after giving effect to the
requested borrowing or issuance, the Company will be in compliance with the restrictive financial
covenants described below, (ii) at the time of and after giving effect to the requested borrowing or
issuance, there will be no Excess Cash, defined as any unrestricted cash and cash equivalents
of the Company or any of its other Subsidiaries that exceeds $10 million, and (iii) after giving
effect to the requested borrowing or issuance, the aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding
under (and letters of credit issued pursuant to) the Credit Agreement will not exceed $5 million. In
addition, the Company is obligated to make mandatory prepayments on each business day from
and after the Financial Covenant Reinstatement Date in the amount of any Excess Cash on such
day and, once the borrowings are fully prepaid, the Company is required to pay any Excess Cash
to the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement to provide cash collateral for any
outstanding letters of credit. The Company anticipates that, pursuant to the restrictive financial
covenants described below, the Company will not be able to utilize the borrowing base for the
foreseeable future.
The Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries, including a lien on all equipment and at least 90% of the
aggregate total value of the Borrower’s oil and gas properties. Outstanding balances under the
Credit Agreement bear interest at the alternate base rate (“ABR”) plus a margin (based on a
sliding scale of 1% to 2% depending on total commitments) or the adjusted LIBO rate
(“Eurodollar”) plus a margin (based on a sliding scale of 2% to 3% depending on total
commitments). The alternate base rate is equal to the highest of (i) the JPMorgan Chase prime
rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% or (iii) the adjusted LIBO rate (subject to a
floor of 0.0%) plus 1%.  For the purposes of the definition of alternate base rate only, the adjusted
LIBO rate for any day is based on the LIBO Rate at approximately 11:00 a.m. London time on
such day. For all other purposes, the adjusted LIBO rate is equal to the rate at which Eurodollar
deposits in the London interbank market for one, two, three or six months (as selected by the
Company) are quoted, as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for Eurocurrency liabilities.
Outstanding letters of credit will be charged a participation fee at a per annum rate equal to the
margin applicable to Eurodollar loans, a fronting fee and customary administrative fees. In
addition, the Company pays commitment fees of 0.5% of the average daily unused amount of the
commitments.
The Company and its subsidiaries are not presently, but will become, subject to certain restrictive
financial covenants under the Credit Agreement after the Financial Covenant Restatement Date,
including (i) a maximum ratio of total debt to EBITDAX (as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for
the fiscal quarter period then ending) multiplied by four of 4.00 to 1.0 as of the last day of any
fiscal quarter, (ii) a minimum ratio of consolidated current assets (including unused availability
but excluding non-cash assets under ASC 815) to consolidated current liabilities (excluding non-
cash obligations under ASC 815 and ASC 410 and, for the fiscal quarters ending September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2016, liabilities in respect of the Company’s 2017 Notes) of 1.0 to 1.0 as
of the last day of any fiscal quarter and (iii) a minimum ratio of EBITDAX to total cash interest
expense, determined on a four quarter basis as of the end of each fiscal quarter, of 3.0 to 1.0, as
of the last day of any fiscal quarter, all as defined in the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement also includes customary restrictions with respect to debt, liens, dividends,
distributions and redemptions, investments, loans and advances, nature of business,
international operations and foreign subsidiaries, leases, sale or discount of receivables,
mergers or consolidations, sales of properties, transactions with affiliates, negative pledge
agreements, gas imbalances and swap agreements. The Credit Agreement also currently
prohibits the Company from declaring and paying dividends on its Series B Preferred Stock.

Note 7—Ceiling Test
The Company uses the full cost method to account for its oil and gas properties. Accordingly, the
costs to acquire, explore for and develop oil and gas properties are capitalized. Capitalized costs
of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD&A and related deferred taxes, are limited to the
estimated future net cash flows from estimated proved oil and gas reserves, including the effects
of cash flow hedges in place, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair value of
unevaluated properties, as adjusted for related income tax effects (the full cost ceiling). If
capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling, the excess is charged to ceiling test write-down of
oil and gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurs.
In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimated future net cash flows from estimated proved
reserves are based on an average of the first day of the month spot price for a historical 12-month
period, adjusted for quality, transportation fees and market differentials. At March 31, 2016 and
June 30, 2016, the prices used in computing the estimated future net cash flows from the
Company’s estimated proved reserves, including the effect of hedges in place at that date,
averaged $2.19 and $2.15 per Mcf of natural gas, $45.92 and $42.12 per barrel of oil and $1.91
and $1.71 per Mcfe of Ngl, respectively. As a result of lower commodity prices and their negative
impact on the Company's estimated proved reserves and estimated future net cash flows, the
Company recognized ceiling test write-downs of approximately $18.9 million and $12.8
million during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively. The
Company’s cash flow hedges in place at March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 decreased the
ceiling test write-downs by approximately $0.8 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
At March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015, the prices used in computing the estimated future net cash
flows from the Company's estimated proved reserves, including the effect of hedges in place at
that date, averaged $3.31 and $3.20 per Mcf of natural gas, $81.33 and $71.27 per barrel of oil
and $3.52 and $3.35 per Mcfe of Ngl, respectively. As a result of lower commodity prices and
their negative impact on the Company's estimated proved reserves and estimated future net cash
flows, the Company recognized ceiling test write-downs of approximately $108.9 million and
$65.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015, respectively.
The Company's cash flow hedges in place at March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015 increased the
ceiling test write-downs by approximately $14 million and $1 million, respectively.
Note 8—Derivative Instruments
    
The Company seeks to reduce its exposure to commodity price volatility by hedging a portion of
its production through commodity derivative instruments. When the conditions for hedge
accounting are met, the Company may designate its commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges.
The changes in fair value of derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment
are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities
are produced. If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in the
fair value of the derivative are recorded in the income statement as derivative income (expense).
At June 30, 2016, the Company's derivative instrument was designated as an effective cash flow
hedge.
Oil and gas sales include additions (reductions) related to the settlement of gas hedges of
$1,155,000 and $4,181,000, oil hedges of $0 and ($288,000) and Ngl hedges of $0 and
$136,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Table of Contents
Oil and gas sales include additions (reductions) related to the settlement of gas hedges of
$2,187,000 and $6,505,000, oil hedges of $0 and ($261,000) and Ngl hedges of $0 and
$157,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

At June 30, 2016, the Company had recognized an accumulated other comprehensive loss of
approximately $0.5 million related to the estimated fair value of its effective cash flow hedges.
Based on estimated future commodity prices as of June 30, 2016, the Company would reclassify
approximately $0.3 million, net of taxes, of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings
during the next six months. These losses are expected to be reclassified to oil and gas sales
based on the schedule of gas volumes stipulated in the derivative contracts.

•
As defined in ASC Topic 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value. As presented in the tables below, this hierarchy
consists of three broad levels:
Level 1: valuations consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities and has the highest priority;
Level 2: valuations rely on quoted prices in markets that are not active or observable inputs over
the full term of the asset or liability;
Level 3: valuations are based on prices or third party or internal valuation models that require
inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement and are less observable and thus have
the lowest priority.
•
•

Table of Contents
The Company classifies its commodity derivatives based upon the data used to determine fair
value. The Company’s derivative instrument at June 30, 2016 was in the form of a swap based
on NYMEX pricing for natural gas. The fair value of this derivative is derived using an
independent third-party’s valuation model that utilizes market-corroborated inputs that are
observable over the term of the derivative contract. The Company’s fair value calculations also
incorporate an estimate of the counterparties’ default risk for derivative assets and an estimate of
the Company’s default risk for derivative liabilities. As a result, the Company designates its
commodity derivatives as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The following table summarizes the net valuation of the Company’s derivatives subject to fair
value measurement on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in

The fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents approximated book value at June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015. The fair value of the 2017 Notes was approximately $68.6 million
and $238 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, as compared to the
book value of $135.6 million and $350.0 million, respectively. The fair value of the 2021 Notes
was approximately $98.4 million as of June 30, 2016 as compared to the book value of $157.7
million (including the $13.0 million excess of future undiscounted cash flows from the 2021 Notes
over the remaining carrying value of the 2017 Notes described in Note 5) and the face value of
$144.7 million. The fair value of the 2017 and 2021 Notes was determined based upon market
quotes provided by an independent broker, which represents a Level 2 input.
Note 10—Income Taxes
The Company typically provides for income taxes at a statutory rate of 35% adjusted for
permanent differences expected to be realized, primarily statutory depletion, non-deductible
stock compensation expenses and state income taxes. As a result of ceiling test write-downs
recognized, the Company has incurred a cumulative three year loss. Because of the impact the
cumulative loss has on the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets through
future earnings, the Company assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on the
future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, the Company established a
valuation allowance for a portion of the deferred tax asset. The valuation allowance was $166.6
million as of June 30, 2016.

Note 12 - Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-02, "Leases" ("ASU 2016-02"), which will require lessees to
recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases classified as
operating leases under previous guidance. Public entities are required to adopt ASU 2016-02 for
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
PetroQuest Energy, Inc. is an independent oil and gas company incorporated in the State of
Delaware with primary operations in Texas, Louisiana and the shallow waters of the Gulf of
Mexico. We seek to grow our production, proved reserves, cash flow and earnings at low finding
and development costs through a balanced mix of exploration, development and acquisition
activities. From the commencement of our operations through 2002, we were focused exclusively
in the Gulf Coast Basin with onshore properties principally in southern Louisiana and offshore
properties in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico shelf. During 2003, we began the
implementation of our strategic goal of diversifying our reserves and production into longer life
and lower risk onshore properties. As part of the strategic shift to diversify our asset portfolio and
lower our geographic and geologic risk profile, we refocused our opportunity selection processes
to reduce our average working interest in higher risk projects, shift capital to higher probability of
success onshore wells and mitigate the risks associated with individual wells by expanding our
drilling program across multiple basins.
We have successfully diversified into onshore, longer life basins through a combination of
selective acquisitions and drilling activity, partially offset by our recent asset divestitures in
Oklahoma as discussed below. As a result of our transition to lower-risk, longer life basins, we
have realized a 95% drilling success rate on 913 gross wells drilled over the last 10 years.
On June 4, 2015, we completed the sale of a majority of our interests in the Woodford Shale and
Mississippian Lime for $260.2 million. In March 2016, we sold certain non-producing assets in
East Texas for $7 million and in April 2016, we sold the majority of the remainder of our
Woodford Shale assets for approximately $18 million.
Our liquidity position continues to be negatively impacted by the prolonged decline in commodity
prices that began in late 2014. At June 30, 2016, we had $68.9 million in cash and approximately
$280 million of debt represented by our 2017 Notes and 2021 Notes, $136 million of which
becomes due in September 2017. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our net loss
available to common stockholders totaled $63.3 million and our negative cash flow from
operating activities totaled $26.1 million. Although we have no borrowings outstanding under our
Credit Agreement, we do not believe we will be able to utilize the Credit Agreement for the
foreseeable future as a result of the financial covenants thereunder. We are evaluating additional
sources of liquidity including asset sales, joint ventures, exchange offers and alternative
financing arrangements to replace the Credit Agreement, but there is no assurance that these
sources will provide sufficient, if any, incremental liquidity.
In response to lower commodity prices we have implemented a variety of initiatives aimed at
preserving liquidity. In addition to the recent asset sales discussed above, we have reduced our
2016 capital expenditure budget to between $15 million and $20 million, a significant reduction
from 2015 spending of approximately $65 million, as well as suspended the quarterly dividend
on our outstanding Series B Preferred Stock beginning with the dividend payment in April 2016
(which will save $5.1 million annually). We are also working to reduce our cash costs by at least
25% from 2015 levels.
Our significantly decreased level of capital spending has had and is expected to continue to have
a negative impact on our production and cash flow from operating activities. We expect
production to continue to decline throughout 2016 and when combined with current commodity
prices and our existing cost structure, including 10% interest expense on the $280 million of debt,
we believe that we will continue to incur significant losses and negative cash flow from operating
activities for the remainder of 2016. We are evaluating various options to address the September
2017 maturity of our remaining 2017 Notes as well as assessing our overall capital structure. See
"Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for more information.

Our estimates of proved oil and gas reserves constitute those quantities of oil and gas, which, by
analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be
economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing
economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which
contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is
reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the
estimation. At the end of each year, our proved reserves are estimated by independent petroleum
engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC. These estimates, however,
represent projections based on geologic and engineering data. Reserve engineering is a
subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to
measure. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quantity and quality of
available data, engineering and geological interpretation and professional judgment. Estimates
of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend
upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the area
compared with production from other producing areas, the assumed effect of regulations by
governmental agencies, and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices, future operating
costs, severance taxes,

development costs and workover costs. The future drilling costs associated with reserves
assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to the extent that these
reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic. Any significant variance in the assumptions
could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves, which could affect the
carrying value of our oil and gas properties and/or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas
properties.
Disclosure requirements under Staff Accounting Bulletin 113 (“SAB 113”) include provisions that
permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have
been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes. The rules
also allow companies the option to disclose probable and possible reserves in addition to the
existing requirement to disclose proved reserves. The disclosure requirements also require
companies to report the independence and qualifications of third party preparers of reserves and
file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates. Pricing is based on a
12-month average price using beginning of the month pricing during the 12-month period prior to
the ending date of the balance sheet to report oil and natural gas reserves. In addition, the 12-
month average will also be used to measure ceiling test impairments and to compute
depreciation, depletion and amortization.
Full Cost Method of Accounting
We use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and gas properties. Under
this method, all acquisition, exploration and development costs, including certain related
employee costs, incurred for the purpose of exploring for and developing oil and natural gas are
capitalized. Acquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire
property. Exploration costs include the costs of drilling exploratory wells, including those in
progress and geological and geophysical service costs in exploration activities. Development
costs include the costs of drilling development wells and costs of completions, platforms, facilities
and pipelines. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in
the period incurred. Sales of oil and gas properties, whether or not being amortized currently, are
accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized, unless such
adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved
reserves of oil and gas.
The costs associated with unevaluated properties are not initially included in the amortization
base and primarily relate to ongoing exploration activities, unevaluated leasehold acreage and
delay rentals, seismic data and capitalized interest. These costs are either transferred to the
amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible
impairment or reduction in value.
We compute the provision for depletion of oil and gas properties using the unit-of-production
method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities. Unevaluated costs
and related carrying costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties
associated with these costs are evaluated. In addition to costs associated with evaluated
properties, the amortization base includes estimated future development costs related to non-
producing reserves. Our depletion expense is affected by the estimates of future development
costs, unevaluated costs and proved reserves, and changes in these estimates could have an
impact on our future earnings.
We capitalize certain internal costs that are directly identified with acquisition, exploration and
development activities. The capitalized internal costs include salaries, employee benefits, costs
of consulting services and other related expenses and do not include costs related to production,
general corporate overhead or similar activities. We also capitalize a portion of the interest costs
incurred on our debt. Capitalized interest is calculated using the amount of our unevaluated
property and our effective borrowing rate.
Capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated DD&A and related deferred taxes,
are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, including the
effect of cash flow hedges in place, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value
of unproved properties, as adjusted for related income tax effects (the full cost ceiling). If
capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling, the excess is charged to write-down of oil and gas
properties in the quarter in which the excess occurs.
Given the volatility of oil and gas prices, it is probable that our estimate of discounted future net
cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term. If oil or gas prices
remain at current levels or decline further, even for only a short period of time, or if we have
downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves, it is possible that write-downs of oil and
gas properties could occur in the future.
Future Abandonment Costs
Future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production
platforms, gathering systems, wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and
seabed. We develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of
production structure, depth of water, reservoir characteristics, depth of the reservoir, market
demand for equipment, currently available procedures and consultations with construction and
engineering consultants. Because these costs typically extend many years into the future,
estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and
judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors, including changing
technology, the timing of estimated costs, the impact of future inflation on current cost estimates
and the political and regulatory environment.

Table of Contents
Derivative Instruments
We seek to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility by hedging a portion of our
production through commodity derivative instruments. The estimated fair values of our commodity
derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The changes in fair value
of those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in other
comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged oil and natural gas quantities are produced. If a
hedge becomes ineffective because the hedged production does not occur, or the hedge
otherwise does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in the fair value of the
derivative are recorded in the income statement as derivative income (expense).
Our hedges are specifically referenced to NYMEX prices for natural gas. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our hedges at the time we enter the contracts, and periodically over the life of the
contracts, by analyzing the correlation between NYMEX prices and the posted prices we receive
from our designated production. Through this analysis, we are able to determine if a high
correlation exists between the prices received for the designated production and the NYMEX
prices at which the hedges will be settled. At June 30, 2016, our derivative instrument was
designated as an effective cash flow hedge.
Estimating the fair value of derivative instruments requires valuation calculations incorporating
estimates of future NYMEX prices, discount rates and price movements. As a result, we calculate
the fair value of our commodity derivatives using an independent third-party’s valuation model
that utilizes market-corroborated inputs that are observable over the term of the derivative
contract. Our fair value calculations also incorporate an estimate of the counterparties’ default
risk for derivative assets and an estimate of our default risk for derivative liabilities.

Net loss available to common stockholders totaled $24,143,000 and $61,083,000 for the quarters
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, while net loss available to common stockholders
totaled $63,280,000 and $183,323,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The primary fluctuations were as follows:
Production Total production decreased 38% and 32% during the three and six month periods
ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the 2015 periods. The decreases in total
production were primarily the result of the divestment of a majority of our Oklahoma assets on
June 4, 2015 and normal production declines at our Gulf Coast and East Texas fields. Partially
offsetting
17
Table of Contents
these decreases was the successful completion of our Thunder Bayou discovery, which
commenced production in June 2015. Due to the current low commodity price environment, our
capital expenditures budget for 2016 is significantly reduced as compared to 2015. As a result of
the substantial decrease in capital spending, combined with our 2015 and 2016 Oklahoma
divestments, we expect our total production for the remainder of 2016 to continue to decrease as
compared to 2015.
Gas production during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 decreased 40% and
35%, respectively, from the comparable periods in 2015. The decreases were primarily the result
of the divestment of a majority of our Oklahoma assets on June 4, 2015 and normal production
declines at our Gulf Coast and East Texas fields. Partially offsetting these decreases was the
successful completion of our Thunder Bayou discovery. We expect our average daily gas
production to decrease during the remainder of 2016 as compared to 2015 due to our 2015 and
2016 Oklahoma divestments and substantial decrease in capital spending.
Oil production during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 decreased 24% and
15%, respectively, from the 2015 periods due primarily to normal production declines at our Gulf
Coast and East Texas fields and downtime at certain of our Gulf of Mexico properties during the
first quarter of 2016 due to a damaged third party pipeline. Partially offsetting these decreases
was an increase due to the commencement of production at our Thunder Bayou discovery in
June 2015. As a result of normal production declines and substantial decrease in capital
spending, we expect our average daily oil production to continue to decrease during the
remainder of 2016 as compared to 2015.
Ngl production during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 decreased 34% and
27%, respectively, from the respective 2015 periods primarily due to our 2015 Oklahoma
divestiture and normal production declines at certain of our Gulf Coast and East Texas fields.
Additionally, Ngl production declined at several of our fields in the Gulf Coast where we decided
to cease processing until prices improve for the residual products. Offsetting these decreases
was the successful completion of our Thunder Bayou discovery. We expect our average daily
Ngl production to continue to decrease during the remainder of 2016 as compared to 2015
primarily due to the divestment of the liquids rich portion of our Oklahoma acreage position and
substantial decrease in capital spending.
Prices Including the effects of our hedges, average gas prices per Mcf for the three and six month
periods ended June 30, 2016 were $2.07 and $1.99, respectively, as compared to $2.78 and
$2.76 for the respective 2015 periods. Average oil prices per Bbl for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 were $43.18 and $36.55, respectively, as compared to $56.79 and $52.07
for the respective 2015 periods and average Ngl prices per Mcfe were $1.95 and $1.87 for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $2.55 and $2.81 for the
respective 2015 periods. Stated on an Mcfe basis, unit prices received during the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 were 22% and 26% lower, respectively, than the prices received
during the comparable 2015 periods.
Revenue Including the effects of hedges, oil and gas sales during the three months ended
June 30, 2016 decreased 51% to $15,824,000, as compared to oil and gas sales of $32,550,000
during the 2015 period. Including the effects of hedges, oil and gas sales during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 decreased 50% to $33,144,000, as compared to oil and gas sales of
$66,001,000 during the 2015 period. These decreases were primarily the result of lower average
realized prices for our production during 2016 as well as decreased production as discussed
above.
Expenses Lease operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled
$6,864,000 and $15,041,000, respectively, as compared to $11,191,000 and $22,093,000 during
the respective 2015 periods. Per unit lease operating expenses totaled $1.14 and $1.10 per
Mcfe, respectively, during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 as compared to
$1.16 and $1.10 per Mcfe during the respective 2015 periods. Total lease operating expenses
decreased during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of our
Oklahoma divestitures. As a result of our Oklahoma divestitures, we expect total lease operating
expenses during the remainder of 2016 to decrease as compared to 2015.
Production taxes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled ($48,000) and
$290,000, respectively, as compared to $948,000 and $1,904,000, respectively, during the 2015
periods. Per unit production taxes totaled ($0.01) and $0.02 per Mcfe, respectively, during the
three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $0.10 per Mcfe during the
comparable 2015 periods. The decreases in production taxes were primarily due to lower
commodity prices for our production during the 2016 periods as compared to the 2015 periods as
severance taxes for the majority of our properties that are subject to severance taxes are
assessed on the value of oil and gas sales. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2016 we
received production tax refunds on certain of our East Texas wells which have now qualified for a
gas tax credit. As a result of the current commodity pricing environment and lower estimated
production as a result of our 2015 and 2016 Oklahoma divestitures, we expect a continued
decrease in our total and per unit production taxes during 2016 as compared to 2015.
General and administrative expenses during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
totaled $3,871,000 and $12,470,000, respectively, as compared to $6,519,000 and $11,858,000
during the 2015 periods. General and administrative expenses during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 included $4,808,000 of costs related to the issuance of the 2021 Notes. ASC

"Troubled Debt Restructurings by Debtors" requires financing costs related to a troubled debt
restructuring to be expensed in the period incurred. Offsetting this increase were lower employee
related costs, including share-based compensation. Included in general and administrative
expenses for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 were share-based
compensation costs of $582,000 and $1,095,000, respectively, compared to $1,434,000 and
$2,952,000, respectively, during the 2015 periods. We capitalized $1,634,000 and $3,188,000,
respectively, of general and administrative expenses during the three and six month periods
ended June 30, 2016 compared to $2,357,000 and $4,597,000, respectively, during the 2015
periods. We expect total general and administrative expenses during the remainder of 2016 to be
lower than 2015.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) expense on oil and gas properties for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $7,014,000, or $1.17 per Mcfe, and
$16,964,000, or $1.24 per Mcfe, respectively, as compared to $17,996,000, or $1.86 per Mcfe,
and $38,313,000, or $1.91 per Mcfe, respectively, during the comparable 2015 periods. The
decreases in the per unit DD&A rate are primarily the result of the recent ceiling test write-downs.
As a result of current year ceiling test write-downs, we expect our DD&A rate to be lower for the
remainder of 2016.
At March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the prices used in computing the estimated future net cash
flows from our estimated proved reserves, including the effect of hedges in place at that date,
averaged $2.19 and $2.15 per Mcf of natural gas, $45.92 and $42.12 per barrel of oil and $1.91
and $1.71 per Mcfe of Ngl, respectively. As a result of lower commodity prices and their negative
impact on our estimated proved reserves and estimated future net cash flows, we
recognized ceiling test write-downs of approximately $12,782,000 and $31,639,000 during
the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively.  At March 31, 2015 and
June 30, 2015, the prices used in computing the estimated future net cash flows from our
estimated proved reserves, including the effect of hedges in place at that date, averaged $3.31
and $3.20 per Mcf of natural gas, $81.33 and $71.27 per barrel of oil and $3.52 and $3.35 per
Mcfe of Ngl, respectively. As a result of lower commodity prices and their negative impact on our
estimated proved reserves and estimated future net cash flows, we recognized ceiling test write-
downs of approximately $65,495,000 and $174,406,000 during the three and six month periods
ended June 30, 2015, respectively. See Note 7, “Ceiling Test” for further discussion of the ceiling
test write-downs. Utilizing current strip prices for oil and gas prices for the third quarter of 2016
and projecting the effect on the estimated future net cash flows from our estimated proved
reserves as of June 30, 2016, we expect to recognize an additional ceiling test write-down of $4
million to $8 million in the third quarter of 2016.
Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated properties, totaled $6,503,000 and
$14,760,000 during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to
$8,596,000 and $16,470,000, respectively, during the 2015 periods. During the three and six
month periods ended June 30, 2016, our capitalized interest totaled $247,000 and $555,000,
respectively, as compared to $1,379,000 and $3,376,000, respectively, during the 2015 periods.
The decrease in interest expense during the 2016 periods was the result of the Exchange,
including an $868,000 non-cash reduction related to the amortization of the excess carrying
value on the Exchange (see Note 5 - Long-Term Debt), as well as the repayment of our bank
debt in June 2015.
Income tax expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $475,000 and
$561,000, respectively, as compared to income tax expense of $2,000,000 and $1,073,000
during the comparable 2015 periods. We typically provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of
35% adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized, primarily statutory depletion,
non-deductible stock compensation expenses and state income taxes.
As a result of ceiling test write-downs, we have incurred a cumulative three-year loss. Because of
the impact the cumulative loss has on the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax
assets through future earnings, we assessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on
the future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, we established a valuation
allowance for a portion of our deferred tax asset. The valuation allowance was $166,551,000 as
of June 30, 2016.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have historically financed our acquisition, exploration and development activities principally
through cash flow from operations, bank borrowings, issuances of equity and debt securities,
joint ventures and sales of assets. However, our liquidity position continues to be negatively
impacted by the prolonged decline in commodity prices that began in late 2014. At June 30,
2016, we had $68.9 million in cash and approximately $280 million of debt represented by our
2017 Notes and 2021 Notes. In addition, at June 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of
approximately $0.3 million as compared to a working capital surplus of approximately $50.5
million as of December 31, 2015. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to the $58.4
million in cash payments made in connection with the Exchange discussed in "Source of Capital:
Debt" below. In addition, due to the prolonged decline in commodity prices and our substantial
debt outstanding, we have continued to incur significant losses and negative cash flow from
operating activities. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our net loss available to common
stockholders totaled $63.3 million and negative cash flow from operating activities totaled $26.1
million.

Table of Contents
Although we have no borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement, we are not permitted
to borrow under the Credit Agreement until such time as we are able to comply with the financial
covenants thereunder. We expect that for the foreseeable future we will not be permitted to
borrow under the Credit Agreement, and when we are able to comply with the financial
covenants under the Credit Agreement, our ability to utilize the borrowing base thereunder will be
limited to $5 million, subject to certain terms and conditions. For additional information, see

"Source of Capital: Debt" below.
Our liquidity may be further negatively impacted by federal bonding requirements related to our
properties located on the Outer Continental Shelf (the "OCS"). To cover the various obligations of
lessees on the OCS, the BOEM and the BSEE generally require that lessees have substantial
net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be satisfied.
Because we are not exempt from the BOEM's supplemental bonding requirements, we engage
surety companies to post the requisite bonds. Pursuant to the terms of our surety agreements, we
may be required to post collateral at the surety companies' discretion. Two of our surety
companies have requested collateral be posted to support certain of the bonds issued on our
behalf and to date, we have provided cash deposits totaling $5.2 million to partially satisfy these
requests. The surety companies may request additional collateral which could have a material
adverse effect on our liquidity position. If we fail to satisfy the request for collateral, we may be in
default under our agreements with the surety companies, which could cause a cross-default
under our Credit Agreement and potentially the indenture governing the 2021 Notes. In addition,
recently updated BOEM financial assurance and risk management requirements may increase
the amount of surety bonds or other security required to be provided by us. For additional
information, see "Item 1A Risk Factors - We may be required to post additional collateral to
satisfy the collateral requirements related to the surety bonds that secure our offshore
decommissioning obligations or to increase the amount of surety bonds or other security required
pursuant to updated BOEM financial assurance and risk management requiremrnts".
In response to lower commodity prices and the resulting impact to our liquidity, we have recently
completed asset sales generating approximately $25 million in net proceeds. In addition, we
have implemented a variety of cost cutting initiatives aimed at preserving liquidity:
we have reduced our 2016 capital expenditure budget to between $15 million and $20 million, a
significant reduction from 2015 spending of approximately $65 million;
we have suspended the quarterly dividend on our outstanding Series B Preferred Stock
beginning with the dividend payment in April 2016, which will save $5.1 million annually; and
we are also working to reduce our cash costs by at least 25% from 2015 levels, including the
interest expense savings realized through debt repayments under our Credit Agreement as well
as through the Exchange discussed in "Source of Capital; Debt" below.
Our substantially decreased level of capital spending has had and is expected to continue to
have a negative impact on our production and cash flow from operating activities. We expect
production to continue to decline throughout 2016 and when combined with current commodity
prices and our existing cost structure, including 10% interest expense on the $280 million of debt
represented by our 2017 Notes and 2021 Notes, we believe that we will continue to incur
significant losses and negative cash flow from operating activities for the remainder of 2016. In
addition, $136 million of the indebtedness represented by our 2017 Notes will mature on
September 1, 2017 and would be reflected as a current liability on our September 30, 2016
balance sheet if not refinanced prior to the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ended September 30, 2016, which would raise substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern.
We are evaluating additional sources of liquidity including asset sales, joint ventures, exchange
offers and alternative financing arrangements to replace the Credit Agreement, but there is no
assurance that these sources will provide sufficient, if any, incremental liquidity. We are also
evaluating various options to address the September 2017 maturity of our 2017 Notes as well as
assessing our overall capital structure. These options include additional public or private
exchanges of 2017 Notes for new secured debt and/or common stock, refinancing the 2017
Notes with unsecured debt and/or common stock as well as a broader restructuring of our 2017
•
•
and 2021 Notes. To assist the Board of Directors and management team in evaluating these
options, we have retained Jefferies LLC and Seaport Global as our financial advisors and Porter
Hedges LLP as our legal advisor. There is no assurance that any refinancing or debt or equity
restructuring will be possible or that additional equity or debt financing can be obtained on
acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to improve our liquidity position, and refinance or
restructure our debt, we may seek bankruptcy protection to continue our efforts to restructure our
business and capital structure. As a part of that process, we may have to liquidate our assets and
may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our consolidated financial
statements. See "Item 1A Risk Factors - We may seek the protection of the Bankruptcy Court,
which may harm our business and place equity holders at significant risk of losing all of their
interests in the Company".
Source of Capital: Operations
Net cash flow provided by (used in) operations decreased from $5.6 million during the six months
ended June 30, 2015 to ($26.1) million during the 2016 period. The decrease in operating cash
flow during 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily attributable to decreases in oil and gas
revenues as well as the timing of payment of payables based on operational activity.

Source of Capital: Divestitures
We do not budget for property divestitures; however, we are continuously evaluating our property
base to determine if there are assets in our portfolio that no longer meet our strategic objectives.
From time to time we may divest certain assets in order to provide liquidity to strengthen our
balance sheet or capital to be reinvested in higher rate of return projects. We are currently
exploring divestment opportunities for certain of our assets. We cannot assure you that we will be
able to sell any of our assets in the future.
In June 2015, we sold a majority of our interests in the Woodford and Mississippian Lime fields
for cash proceeds of $260.2 million. Net proceeds from the sale were used to repay all
borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facility and increase our cash on hand. In April
2016, we sold the majority of our remaining Woodford Shale assets in Oklahoma for
approximately $18 million.
In March 2016, we sold certain non-producing assets in East Texas for $7 million in connection
with the negotiation of a joint venture. Negotiations of the terms and conditions of this joint
venture are currently ongoing. If we are unable to reach an agreement with respect to the joint
venture, we will be required to purchase the non-producing assets for $5.0 million on or before
December 31, 2016.

On August 19, 2010, we issued $150 million in principal amount of our 10% Senior Notes due
2017. On July 3, 2013, we issued an additional $200 million in principal amount of our 10%
Senior Notes due 2017 (collectively, the "2017 Notes").
On January 14, 2016, we announced the commencement of the Exchange and consent
solicitation (the "Consent Solicitation") to certain eligible holders of our outstanding 2017 Notes.
The Exchange closed on February 17, 2016, and in satisfaction of the tender of $214.4 million in
aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes, representing approximately 61% of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes, in the Exchange, we (i) paid
approximately $53.6 million of cash, (ii) issued $144.7 million aggregate principal amount of our

Carrying Value
The indenture governing the 2021 Notes contains affirmative and negative covenants that,
among other things, limit our ability and the subsidiary guarantors of the 2021 Notes to incur
indebtedness; purchase or redeem stock; make certain investments; create liens that secure
debt; enter into transactions with affiliates; sell assets; refinance certain indebtedness; merge
with or into other companies or transfer substantially all of their assets; and, in certain
circumstances, to pay dividends or make other distributions on stock. The 2021 Notes are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
The 2021 Notes are secured by second-priority liens on substantially all of our and our
subsidiary guarantors' oil and gas properties and substantially all of our other assets to the extent
such properties and assets secure the Credit Agreement (as defined below), except for certain
excluded assets. Pursuant to the terms of an intercreditor agreement, the security interest in
those properties and assets that secure the 2021 Notes and the guarantees are contractually
subordinated to liens that secure the Credit Agreement and certain other permitted indebtedness.
Consequently, the 2021 Notes and the guarantees will be effectively subordinated to the Credit
Agreement and such other indebtedness to the extent of the value of such assets.
The 2021 Notes bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum on the principal amount and interest is
payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning August
15, 2016. At June 30, 2016, $5.4 million had been accrued in connection with the August 15,
2016 payment. Interest on the 2017 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September
1 and the 2017 Notes mature on September 1, 2017. At June 30, 2016, $4.5 million had been
accrued in connection with the September 1, 2016 interest payment.
We have a Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Capital One, N.A., IberiaBank, Bank of America, N.A. and The
Bank of Nova Scotia. The Credit Agreement provides us
21
Table of Contents
with a revolving credit facility that permits borrowings based on the commitments of the lenders
and the available borrowing base as determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement. The
Credit Agreement does not presently allow us to issue letters of credit thereunder. The credit
facility matures on the earlier of June 4, 2020 or February 19, 2017 if any portion of our 2017
Notes remains outstanding as of such date which has not been refinanced with either permitted
refinancing debt or permitted second lien debt with a maturity date no earlier than 180 days after
June 4, 2020, all as defined in the Credit Agreement.
The borrowing base under the Credit Agreement is determined by March 31 and September 30
of each year and is based upon the valuation of the reserves attributable to our oil and gas
properties as of January 1 and July 1 of each year. If we incur any borrowings, or cause the
lenders to issue any letters of credit, under the Credit Agreement (the “Financial Covenant
Reinstatement Date”), two interim redeterminations would occur on July 31 and December 31 of
each year commencing on the first July 31 or December 31 subsequent to the Financial
Covenant Reinstatement Date. We or the lenders may also request two additional borrowing
base re-determinations each year. Each time the borrowing base is to be re-determined, the
administrative agent under the Credit Agreement will propose a new borrowing base as it deems
appropriate in its sole discretion, which must be approved by all lenders if the borrowing base is
to be increased, or by lenders holding two-thirds of the amounts outstanding under the Credit
Agreement if the borrowing base remains the same or is reduced. As of June 30, 2016, the
borrowing base and aggregate commitments of the lenders were both $22.5 million. We have no
borrowings outstanding under (and no letters of credit issued pursuant to) the Credit Agreement.
The obligation of the lenders to make loans on the account of any borrowing or issue letters of
credit under the Credit Agreement, include that (i) at the time of and after giving effect to the
requested borrowing or issuance, we will be in compliance with the restrictive financial
covenants described below, (ii) at the time of and after giving effect to the requested borrowing or
issuance, there will be no Excess Cash, defined as any unrestricted cash and cash equivalents
of the Company or any of its other Subsidiaries that exceeds $10 million, and (iii) after giving
effect to the requested borrowing or issuance, the aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding
under (and letters of credit issued pursuant to) the Credit Agreement will not exceed $5 million. In
addition, we are obligated to make mandatory prepayments on each business day from and after
the Financial Covenant Reinstatement Date in the amount of any Excess Cash on such day and,
once the borrowings are fully prepaid, we are required to pay any Excess Cash to the
administrative agent under the Credit Agreement to provide cash collateral for any outstanding
letters of credit. Based on our expectations for the third quarter of 2016, we anticipate that,
pursuant to the restrictive financial covenants described below, we will not be able to utilize the
borrowing base for the foreseeable future.
The Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets and our
subsidiaries, including a lien on all equipment and at least 90% of the aggregate total value of
the Borrower’s oil and gas properties. Outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement bear
interest at the alternate base rate (“ABR”) plus a margin (based on a sliding scale of 1% to 2%
depending on total commitments) or the adjusted LIBO rate (“Eurodollar”) plus a margin (based
on a sliding scale of 2% to 3% depending on total commitments). The alternate base rate is equal
to the highest of (i) the JPMorgan Chase prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus
0.5% or (iii) the adjusted LIBO rate (subject to a floor of 0.0%) plus 1%.  For the purposes of the
definition of alternate base rate only, the adjusted LIBO rate for any day is based on the LIBO
Rate at approximately 11:00 a.m. London time on such day. For all other purposes, the adjusted
LIBO rate is equal to the rate at which Eurodollar deposits in the London interbank market for
one, two, three or six months (as selected by us) are quoted, as adjusted for statutory reserve
requirements for Eurocurrency liabilities. Outstanding letters of credit will be charged a
participation fee at a per annum rate equal to the margin applicable to Eurodollar loans, a fronting
fee and customary administrative fees. In addition, we pay commitment fees of 0.5% of the
average daily unused amount of the commitments.
We and our subsidiaries are not presently, but will become, subject to certain restrictive financial
covenants under the Credit Agreement after the Financial Covenant Restatement Date, including
(i) a maximum ratio of total debt to EBITDAX (as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for the fiscal
quarter period then ending) multiplied by four of 4.00 to 1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter,
(ii) a minimum ratio of consolidated current assets (including unused availability but excluding
non-cash assets under ASC 815) to consolidated current liabilities (excluding non-cash
obligations under ASC 815 and ASC 410 and, for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2016, liabilities in respect of our 2017 Notes) of 1.0 to 1.0 as of the last day of
any fiscal quarter and (iii) a minimum ratio of EBITDAX to total cash interest expense, determined
on a four quarter basis as of the end of each fiscal quarter, of 3.0 to 1.0, as of the last day of any
fiscal quarter, all as defined in the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement also includes customary restrictions with respect to debt, liens, dividends,
distributions and redemptions, investments, loans and advances, nature of business,
international operations and foreign subsidiaries, leases, sale or discount of receivables,
mergers or consolidations, sales of properties, transactions with affiliates, negative pledge
agreements, gas imbalances and swap agreements. The Credit Agreement also currently
prohibits us from declaring and paying dividends on its Series B Preferred Stock.

Source of Capital: Issuance of Securities
Our shelf registration statement, which expires in September 2016, allows us to publicly offer and
sell up to $350 million of any combination of debt securities, shares of common and preferred
stock, depositary shares and warrants. The registration statement does not provide any
assurance that we will or could sell any such securities.
Use of Capital: Exploration and Development
Our 2016 capital expenditure budget, which includes capitalized interest and general and
administrative costs, is expected to range between $15 million and $20 million (which from the
midpoint of such range, represents a 73% reduction from our 2015 capital expenditures), of which
$8.4 million was incurred during the first six months of 2016, before consideration of $7 million of
proceeds received from the sale of certain East Texas non-producing assets. During the six
months ended June 30, 2016, we funded our capital expenditures with cash on hand. We plan to
fund our capital expenditures during the remainder of 2016 with cash on hand.
Use of Capital: Acquisitions
We do not budget for acquisitions; however, we are continuously evaluating opportunities to
expand our existing asset base or establish positions in new core areas.
We expect to finance our future acquisition activities, if consummated, through cash on hand. We
may also utilize sales of equity or debt securities, sales of properties or assets or joint venture
arrangements with industry partners, if necessary. We cannot assure you that such additional
financings will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other
than statements of historical facts included in and incorporated by reference into this Form 10-Q
are forward looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks,
trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.
Among those risks, trends and uncertainties are: the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and
significantly depressed oil prices since the end of 2014; our indebtedness and the significant
amount of cash required to service our indebtedness; our ability to improve our liquidity position
and refinance or restructure our indebtedness, including our remaining 2017 Notes; the potential
need to sell assets or seek bankruptcy protection; our estimate of the sufficiency of our existing
capital sources, including availability under our bank credit facility and the result of any
borrowing base redetermination; our ability to post additional collateral to satisfy our offshore
decommissioning obligations; our ability to hedge future production to reduce our exposure to
price volatility in the current commodity pricing market; ceiling test write-downs resulting, and that
could result in the future, from lower oil and natural gas prices; our ability to raise capital to fund
cash requirements for future operations; limits on our growth and our ability to finance our
operations, fund our capital needs and respond to changing conditions imposed by our bank
credit facility and restrictive debt covenants; our ability to find, develop, produce oil and natural
gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to replace reserves and sustain production;
approximately 50% of our production being exposed to the additional risk of severe weather,
including hurricanes and tropical storms and flooding, and natural disasters; losses and liabilities
from uninsured or underinsured drilling and operating activities; changes in laws and
governmental regulations as they relate to our operations; the operating hazards attendant to the
oil and gas business; the volatility of our stock price; and our ability to meet the continued listing
standards of the New York Stock Exchange with respect to our common stock or to cure any
deficiency with respect thereto.
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are
reasonable, we cannot assure you that such expectations reflected in these forward looking
statements will prove to have been correct.
When used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the words “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,”
“plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-
looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, actual results could
differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements for a
number of important reasons, including those discussed under “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
You should read these statements carefully because they discuss our expectations about our
future performance, contain projections of our future operating results or our future financial
condition, or state other “forward-looking” information. You should be aware that the occurrence
of any of the events described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition
and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our common stock could
decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.

We cannot guarantee any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except
as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We experience market risks primarily in two areas: commodity prices and interest rates. Because
our properties are located within the United States, we do not believe that our business
operations are exposed to significant foreign currency exchange risks.
Commodity Price Risk
Our revenues are derived from the sale of our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids
production. Based on projected sales volumes for the remainder of 2016, a 10% change in the
prices we receive for our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production would have a
$2.5 million impact on our revenues.
We seek to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility by hedging a portion of production
through commodity derivative instruments. In the settlement of a typical hedge transaction, we
will have the right to receive from the counterparties to the hedge the excess of the fixed price
specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index multiplied by the quantity
hedged. If the floating price exceeds the fixed price, we are required to pay the counterparties this
difference multiplied by the quantity hedged. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we
received $2.2 million from the counterparties to our derivative instruments in connection with
hedge settlements.
We are required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price (when the
floating price exceeds the fixed price) regardless of whether we have sufficient production to
cover the quantities specified in the hedge. Significant reductions in production at times when the
floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge
agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production. Hedging will also
prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed
amount specified in the hedge.
Our Credit Agreement requires that the counterparties to our hedge contracts be lenders under
the Credit Agreement or, if not a lender under the Credit Agreement, rated A-/A3 or higher by
S&P or Moody’s. Currently, the counterparty to our existing hedge contract is a lender under the
Credit Agreement.
As of June 30, 2016, we had entered into the following commodity derivative instrument:
Production Period
Daily Volumes

Type
Weighted
Average Price
5,000 Mmbtu $2.50
Natural Gas:

The Company has approximately 0.9 Bcf of gas volumes at $2.50 per Mcf hedged for the
remainder of 2016. For further discussion of our commodity derivative instruments, please see
Item 1, Note 8 "Derivative Instruments" in this Form 10-Q.
Interest Rate Risk
Debt outstanding under our bank credit facility is subject to a floating interest rate. As of June 30,
2016, we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility.
Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s management, including its
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, completed an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities
and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on that evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded:
that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure (a) that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the
i.Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (b) that such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and
ii.that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
24
Table of Contents
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures will detect or uncover all failures of persons within the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the
Company’s periodic reports. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of
disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the
circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during
the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Part II
Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
In May 2016, a class action lawsuit on behalf of holders of the Company's 10% Senior Notes due
2017 (the "2017 Notes") was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York,
relating to the Company's February 2016 debt exchange, whereby the Company privately
exchanged a combination of cash, shares of the Company's common stock and newly issued
10% Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes") for the 2017 Notes. The
lawsuit alleges that the Company violated the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the indenture
governing the 2017 Notes and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by benefiting
itself and a minority of noteholders who are qualified institutional buyers ("QIBs"). According to
the lawsuit, as a result of the Company's private debt exchange in which only QIBs (and non-U.S.
persons under Regulation S) were eligible to participate, the Company unjustly enriched itself at
the expense of class members by reducing indebtedness, extending the maturity date of its long
term debt and reducing the value of the 2017 Notes. The lawsuit seeks damages and attorney's
fees, in addition to declaratory relief that the debt exchange and the liens created for the benefit
of the 2021 Notes are null and void and that the debt exchange effectively resulted in a default
under the indenture for the 2017 Notes.
PetroQuest is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal
course of business, including worker's compensation claims, tort claims and contractual disputes.
Some of the existing known claims against us are covered by insurance subject to the limits of
such policies and the payment of deductible amounts by us. Management believes that the
ultimate disposition of all uninsured or unindemnified matters resulting from existing litigation will
not have a material adverse effect on PetroQuests's business or financial position.
Item 1A. RISK FACTORS
Oil and natural gas prices are volatile, and an extended decline in the prices of oil and natural
gas would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to meet
our financial obligations and results of operations.
Our future financial condition, revenues, results of operations, profitability and future growth, and
the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily on the prices we receive
for our oil and natural gas production. Our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity
and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms also substantially depends upon oil and
natural gas prices. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and oil
prices have been significantly depressed since the end of 2014 as demonstrated by the SEC
pricing for the value of crude oil and natural gas, which has decreased significantly as of
December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014. For example, the SEC pricing at
December 31, 2015 for crude oil (WTI Cushing) and natural gas (Henry Hub) was $50.28 per Bbl
and $2.58 per MMBtu, respectively, as compared to $94.99 per Bbl to a low of $4.35 per MMBtu
for crude oil and natural gas, respectively, as of December 31, 2014. These markets will likely
continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we will receive for our production, and the levels
of our production, will depend on numerous factors beyond our control.
These factors include:
•relatively minor changes in the supply of or the demand for oil and natural gas;
•the condition of the United States and worldwide economies;
•market uncertainty;
•the level of consumer product demand;
•weather conditions in the United States, such as hurricanes;
25
Table of Contents
•
•
•the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;
domestic and foreign governmental regulation and taxes, including price controls adopted by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission;
political conditions or hostilities in oil and natural gas producing regions, including the Middle
East and South America;
•the price and level of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and
•the price and availability of alternate fuel sources.
We cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices and such prices may decline further. An
extended decline in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition,
liquidity, ability to meet our financial obligations and results of operations. Lower prices have
reduced and may further reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce
economically and has required and will likely require us to record additional ceiling test write-
downs and may cause our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 to decline
compared to our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2015. Substantially all of our oil and
natural gas sales are made in the spot market or pursuant to contracts based on spot market
prices. Our sales are not made pursuant to long-term fixed price contracts.
To attempt to reduce our price risk, we periodically enter into hedging transactions with respect to
a portion of our expected future production. We cannot assure you that we can enter into effective
hedging transactions in the future or that such transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the
effect of any decline in oil or natural gas prices. Any substantial or extended decline in the prices
of or demand for oil or natural gas would have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, liquidity, ability to meet our financial obligations and results of operations.
We are not permitted to borrow under our bank credit facility, which limits our liquidity position
and could impact the development of our properties and thus limit future cash flow from
operations.
Historically, we have financed our acquisition, exploration and development activities principally
through cash flow from operations, borrowings under our bank credit facility, issuances of equity
and debt securities, joint ventures and sales of assets. However, we are not permitted to borrow
under our bank credit facility until such time as we can comply with the financial covenants
thereunder. We expect that for the foreseeable future, we will not be permitted to borrow under
the facility, and when we are able to comply with the financial covenants under the facility, our
ability to utilize the borrowing base under the facility will be limited to $5 million, subject to certain
terms and conditions. The unavailability of our bank credit facility limits our liquidity position. As a
result, we may be unable to fund the planned development of our properties, which could limit
our future cash flows from operations.
Our outstanding indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our
business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.
As of June 30, 2016, the aggregate amount of our outstanding indebtedness, net of cash on
hand, was $222.4 million. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our high level
of debt could have important consequences for you, including the following:
it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding
indebtedness, including our 2017 Notes and 2021 Notes, and any failure to comply with the
obligations of any of our debt agreements, including financial and other restrictive covenants,
could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;
the covenants contained in our debt agreements limit our ability to borrow money in the future for
acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate
obligations and may limit our flexibility in operating our business;
we will need to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay interest on our debt,
approximately $28.0 million per year for interest on our 2017 Notes and 2021 Notes alone, and
to pay quarterly dividends (which we suspended beginning with the dividend payment due in
April 2016), if permissable under the terms of our debt agreements and declared by our Board of
Directors, on our Series B Preferred Stock of approximately $5.1 million per year, which will
reduce the amount of money we have for operations, capital expenditures, expansion,
acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities;

•
the amount of our interest expense may increase because certain of our borrowings in the future
may be at variable rates of interest, which, if interest rates increase, could result in higher
interest expense;
we may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which may put us at a
competitive disadvantage;
we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry
or the economy in general, especially extended or further declines in oil and natural gas prices;
and
our debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business
and the industry in which we operate.
Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance,
which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not
be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental
•
•
regulation. We cannot be certain that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to allow us
to pay the principal and interest on our debt, including our 2017 Notes and 2021 Notes, and meet
our other obligations. If we do not have enough cash to service our debt, we may be required to
refinance all or part of our existing debt, including our 2017 Notes and 2021 Notes, sell assets,
borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance our debt, sell assets, borrow
more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
We may seek the protection of the Bankruptcy Court, which may harm our business and place
equity holders at significant risk of losing all of their interests in the Company.
We are in the process of analyzing various options to address our liquidity as well as assessing
our overall capital structure, including the September 2017 maturity of our 2017 Notes. If we are
unable to improve our liquidity position and refinance or restructure our debt, a filing under
Chapter 11 of the U. S. Bankruptcy Code may be unavoidable. Seeking Bankruptcy Court
protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and liquidity. So long as a proceeding related to a Chapter 11 proceeding continues,
our senior management would be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort
dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations.
Bankruptcy Court protection also might make it more difficult to retain management and other key
personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, the longer a
proceeding related to a Chapter 11 proceeding continues, the more likely it is that our customers
and suppliers would lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our businesses successfully and
would seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.
Additionally, we have a significant amount of secured indebtedness that is senior to our
unsecured indebtedness and a significant amount of total indebtedness that is senior to our
existing preferred stock and common stock in our capital structure. As a result, we believe that
seeking Bankruptcy Court protection under a Chapter 11 proceeding could result in a limited
recovery for unsecured noteholders, if any, and place equity holders at significant risk of losing
all of their interests in the Company.
We may be required to post additional collateral to satisfy the collateral requirements related to
the surety bonds that secure our offshore decommissioning obligations or to increase the amount
of surety bonds or other security required pursuant to updated BOEM financial assurance and
risk management requirements.
     To cover the costs for various obligations of lessees on the OCS, including costs for such
decommissioning obligations as the plugging of wells, the removal of platforms and other
facilities, the decommissioning of pipelines and the clearing of the seafloor of obstructions
typically performed at the end of production, the BOEM generally requires that the lessees post
substantial bonds or other acceptable financial assurances that such obligations will be met.
Failure to post the requisite bonds or otherwise satisfy the BOEM’s security requirements could
have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Because we are not exempt from the BOEM's supplemental bonding requirements, we engage
surety companies to post the requisite bonds. Pursuant to the terms of our surety agreements, we
may be required to post collateral at the surety companies' discretion. Two of our surety
companies have requested collateral be posted to support certain of the bonds issued on our
behalf. To date, we have provided cash deposits totaling $5.2 million to partially satisfy these
requests. The surety companies may request additional collateral which could have a material
adverse effect on our liquidity position. If we fail to satisfy the request for collateral, we may be in
default under our agreements with the surety companies, which could cause a cross-default
under our bank credit facility and potentially the indenture governing the 2021 Notes.
     In addition, on July 14, 2016, the BOEM issued a notice to lessees to clarify the procedures
and criteria that the BOEM will use to determine if and when additional security is required for
OCS leases. This notice, which becomes effective on September 12, 2016, may result in an
increase to the amount of surety bonds or other security required to be posted by us pursuant to
these updated BOEM financial assurance and risk management requirements.
We can provide no assurance that we can continue to obtain bonds or other surety in all cases
given these new expenses and updated BOEM requirements, and if we are unable to obtain the
additional required bonds or the increased amount of required

collateral as requested, the BOEM may require any or all of our operations on federal leases to
be suspended or canceled or otherwise impose monetary penalties, and any one or more of such
actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations,
financial condition, and liquidity.
Lower oil and natural gas prices may cause us to record ceiling test write-downs, which could
negatively impact our results of operations.
We use the full cost method of accounting to account for our oil and natural gas operations.
Accordingly, we capitalize the cost to acquire, explore for and develop oil and natural gas
properties. Under full cost accounting rules, the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas
properties may not exceed a “full cost ceiling” which is based upon the present value of
estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, including the effect of hedges in place,
discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unevaluated properties. If at the
end of any fiscal period we determine that the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas
properties exceed the full cost ceiling, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings in
the period then ended. This is called a “ceiling test write-down.” This charge does not impact
cash flow from operating activities, but does reduce our net income and stockholders' equity.
Once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date.
We review the net capitalized costs of our properties quarterly, using a single price based on the
beginning of the month average of oil and natural gas prices for the prior 12 months. We also
assess investments in unevaluated properties periodically to determine whether impairment has
occurred. The risk that we will be required to recognize further write-downs of the carrying value
of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low or volatile. In
addition, write-downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our
estimated proved reserves or our unevaluated property values, or if estimated future development
costs increase. As a result of the decline in commodity prices, we recognized a ceiling test write-
down of approximately $31.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Utilizing current
strip prices for oil and gas prices for the third quarter of 2016 and projecting the effect on the
estimated future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves as of June 30, 2016, we
expect to recognize an additional ceiling test write-down of $4 million to $8 million in the third
quarter of 2016.
