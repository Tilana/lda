CHAIRMAN’S REPORT 9-! ' WNW”
\

Welcome,
It is my pleasure to present our 2016 Annual Report.
While conducting a fiscally responsible business, looking after our people, looking after the environment and the
needs of the community, the Stavely team has again added value in ways that we might not have expected a year
ago.
The team has continued to expand exploration targets at our Victorian Projects. And, at the same time the team
has been able to gain significant Victorian government co-funding for exploration, has acquired excellent
exploration ground in Queensland and has begun a review of the copper production potential at our mineral
deposits in Victoria.
As you know, one of our key exploration targets has been a Cadia-type gold-copper porphyry at our Stavely and
Varram Park Projects in Victoria. The targets, along with other high priority targets, formed the basis for seven
joint funding proposals to the Victorian Government. During the proposal review, the Victorian Government
utilised an independent panel of experts. The response was enthusiastic support for Stavely’s proposals, and
resulted in grant of over $1 million of co-funding from the Victorian government. Key, high-priority targets that
could add substantial value to Staver will now proceed later this year with a much more cost-effective approach
for shareholders.
In February, Stavely acquired Ukalunda Pty Ltd, which held an application for the Ravenswood West gold and
copper exploration project in north Queensland, near the historical Ravenswood mining centre (+4 million ounces
of gold production). The exploration license has now been granted and exploration has begun targeting breccia
pipe mineralisation that could be similar to nearby Mt. Wright (1 million ounces of gold Mineral Resources).
Prompted by indications of additional copper resources at the Stavely project, improved copper price projections,
and the drop in the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar, Stavely recently conducted a conceptual study of
copper production potential from our two flagship projects, Stavely and Ararat. Stavely and Ararat have been a
major attraction as they contain some 130kt of copper in Inferred Mineral Resources. Results from the study
were quite encouraging, and, the results led to plans to conduct a Scoping Study to review mining and processing
options to further improve the potential economics.
Stavely now uses its excellent team to lever off multiple projects that can be run in parallel. The exciting
Ravenswood Project in tropical north Queensland provides a field season during winter months when the western
Victoria field is too wet for meaningful field programmes. So now, with these complimentary projects, exploration
fieldwork on a substantial number of exciting targets can continue throughout the year. Scoping study of copper
production potential will be conducted coincident with exploration.
Our team has placed Stavely in an admirable position with fresh projects for gold and copper in historic mining
areas that have demonstrated stable, supportive communities and governments. At the time of writing, we have
$1.5m cash, no debt and substantial financial support from government co-funding and drilling contractor share
subscription agreements. Additionally, a path to transition Stavely to copper producer may be indicated by our
future Scoping Study of our flagship projects.
While the market is slow to turn positive, our shareholders have been very supportive. We are not in a position to
issue dividends, but we were able to show our thanks as we distributed credits of $748,000 to our shareholders
via a new government EDI program. Thank you for your stellar support.
Our highly qualified and highly capable team is enthusiastic about drilling our high priority projects in Victoria with
potential for discovery of a Cadia-style copper-gold porphyry, drilling new gold and copper Mt. Wright- style gold
mineralised breccia pipe projects in Queensland, and completing a Scoping Study for copper production from our
flagship resources in Victoria. We look forward to reporting our successes in the future.
Thank you
BILL PLVLEV

consented to the inclusion in the stavely Minerals’ 2015 Annual Report of the matters oased on his information in the form and
context in which it appears.
As there has been no new information generated from the Mineral Resource areas, Mr Cairns has reviewed the underlying
assumptions in the 2015 Mineral Resources reports and finds that there have heen no material changes and that the underlying
assumptions and technical parameters remain valid. There are therefore no changes to the Mineral Resources estimates from this
annual review.
stavely Minerals’ policy for Mineral Resources estimates is to have the estimates done by suitaoly aualified and experienced
external consultants and have these estimates reviewed internally oy suitaoly aualified and experienced stavely Minerals’
personnel.

Appendix 1: Mt Ararat Mineral Resource Estimate
Summary:
The Mount Ararat August 2015 Inferred Resource Estimate is an inverse distance squared Cu, Au, Ag and Zn estimate
of the planar, steeply dipping VMS style mineralisation of the deposit and is tabulated below. The estimate was
undertaken, classified and reported according to the guidelines set out in The Australasian Code for Reporting of
Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Dre Reserves (the JORC Code, 2012 Edition).

Table shows rounded estimates. This rounding may cause apparent computational discrepancies.
Significant ﬁgures do not imply precision. Nominal copper grade reporting cuts applied. Three
material types reported as varied economic factors will be applicable to the deposit base on reported
material types.
The estimate:

a was based on recent 2014-15 Staver Minerals drilling and historic drilling data which is of unknown
reliability and quality that tests a discrete steeply dipping body of base metal mineralisation.

o Extends for a strike length of 830m (towards 335deg), vertically for 350m and ranges mostly between 1m
and 3m thick (total massive + sub-massive + stringer mineralisation). The mineralisation is modelled
between 4m and 14m thick in the upper 50m (this may be real, due to supergene actions or introduced due
to the suspected wet/difficult RC drilling conditions).

o Is underpinned by 309 Cu assays from 64 holes (271 nominal 1m composites). High grade restrictions are
applied to the Cu, Au, Ag and Zn grade interpolations (55m radius of influence). A tonnage factor of
3.17g/cc was applied to all mineralised blocks.

a Reconciles well both statistically and spatially with the source assay data.

Minimum of 20 and maximum of 40 composites utilised to estimate grade.
The Mt Ararat resource is classified as Inferred under the guidelines set out
in the 201210RC Code.

Moisture and recovery 15 of 18 RC holes drilled by Centaur Mining encountered wet drilling through
the mineralisation. Grade profiles suggest down hole smearing of grade
[cross-contamination) in the oxide/supergene mineralisation.

Core recovery averages 85% through the oxide/weathered mineralisation,
down from >97% recorded for the supergene and primary mineralisation.
There is no information or data to assess the affect core loss has on grade.

Cut-off parameters The resource is reported by mineralisation thickness and oxidation state.
Cuts of 0.5%, 1.0% and 2.0% copper were applied. These breakdowns and
grade tonnage plots are reported to allow differing economic assessment on
the project.

Mining factors or assumptions Not applied, however resource is reported at 1m and 2m thicknesses and by
oxidation state to allow for assessment of both underground and open cut
mining methods.

Metallurgical factors or Not evaluated as risks associated with historic data over-riding feature

assumptions affecting the confidence of the estimate.

Environmental factors or Not evaluated as risks associated with historic data over-riding feature

assumptions affecting the confidence of the estimate.

Classification The estimate is classified as Inferred under the JORC Code [2012 Edition).
Absence of QA/QC and important data for evaluating risk to the estimate
[such as recover and moisture versus grade) are key factors in assigning an
Inferred Classification.

Discussion of relative accuracy/ Not undertaken other than that stated under the classification section.

Appendix 2: Thursday‘s Gossan Mineral Resource Estimate

Summary:

The Thursday Gossan Chalcocite Copper Inferred Resource Estimate, remains unchanged from the Thursday Gossan

Chalcocite Copper Inferred Resource Estimate, August 2013. There has been no additional data collected from the

deposit and although economic circumstances affecting the mining industry have changed since 2013 the

assumptions utilised in 2013 remain valid, if not for the current situation but for future situations. Staver Minerals
have advised that tenure over the Thursday Gossan Chalcocite deposit is in good standing and that there are no
impediments to undertaking further evaluation Of the deposit.

Details of the 2013 resource estimate have been reported in "Thursday Gossan Copper, Victoria, Australia, 2013

Resource Estimate Report” prepared for Northern Platinum Pty Ltd, a forerunner for Staver Minerals Limited who

now hold tenure over the project area. The following summary Of the 2013 Inferred Resource Estimate applies to

the 2015 resources publically stated by Staver and is repeated here unchanged to support their statement. The
reader can substitute 2015 for 2013 and Stavely Minerals for Northern Platinum in the text on the following pages.

The Thursday Gossan Chalcocite Copper August 2013 Inferred Resource estimate is an inverse distance squared Cu

estimate Of the tabular sub—horizontal supergene style mineralisation Of the deposit and is tabulated below. The

estimate was undertaken, classified and reported according to the guidelines set out in The Australasian Code for

Reporting ofExp/aration Results, Mineral Resources and Dre Reserve (the IDRC Code, 2012 Edition).

Table shows rounded estimates. This rounding may cause apparent computational discrepancies. Significant

ﬁgures do not imply precision. Nominal copper grade reporting Cuts applied. Three mineralised thicknesses

reported as varied economic factors are likely to be applicable to each.

The estimate:

a Is based On historic drilling data of unknown reliability and quality however there are no obvious reasons to
question that the holes were drilled to test a flat lying su pergene copper deposit.

a Extends intermittently for a strike length of 4000m (NS) a breadth of 1500m and Vertically up to 60m thick.
The model includes prospects known as Thursday Gossan Chalcocite Copper, Junction and Drysdale.

o Is underpinned by 2355 Cu assays from 225 holes (1493 nominal 3m composites). Cu grades were
interpolated without any cuts Or restrictions. A tonnage factor of 2.10g/cC was applied to all mineralised
blocks.

a Reconciles well both statistically and spatially with the source assay data.

bias for 9 holes used in the resource estimate.
No QC samples were inserted into any of the sample batches from the
Thursday Gossan drilling. No laboratory QC data was made available for
assessment as part of this resource estimate.
Beaconsfield Gold undertook a limited (selective) umpire laboratory
programme (29 samples), entire residual material assaying (94 intervals) and
56 sub-sample assays of residual material (66 intervals). These projects
provide limited insight into sampling and assay reliability. This data indicates
that:
Both significant bias and precision issues are suspected in the Beaconsfield
Gold dataset (OnSite Laboratory) and that there appears to be a period of
instrument malfunction or systems/procedural breakdown at grades greater
than 3000ppm Cu at the laboratory.
The spear vs total sample dataset shows a significant relative bias in favour
of the spear sample, manifesting greatest within samples containing higher
copper grades.

Verification of sampling and Beaconsfield Gold undertook a limited (selective) umpire laboratory

assaying programme (29 samples), entire residual material assaying (94 intervals) and
56 sub-sample assays of residual material (66 intervals). These projects
provide limited insight into sampling and assay reliability.

Location of data Holes within the Thursday Gossan area are recorded as being surveyed
under three systems: AM666 Zone 545, MGA zone 54 and GDASA Zone 545.
All coordinates were converted to GDA94 zone 545 by previous workers.
These conversions have not been checked by NPTor HA. The August 2013
estimate is undertaken using the supplied GDA94 545 grid references.
Beaconsfield Gold holes were located by hand held GPS. No information on
survey methods for other workers.

Data spacing and distribution Area showing the thickest and highest tenor of mineralisation tested at
nominal 50m centres by predominantly vertical holes.
Areas less well mineralised tested mostly at 100m centres by vertical
drillholes

Orientation of data in relation to Drill orientation appropriate for testing offlat-lying mineralisation

geological structure Underlying geology indicates that primary mineralisation may be sub
vertical. Supergene mineralisation is controlled by pre-existing geology,
groundwater movement and surface/weathering events. It is unknown from
the current dataset if there is any sub-vertical fabric within the supergene
mineralisation and if so then vertical holes will not adequately sample this
feature ofthe mineralisation.

Criteria Explanation

Mineral tenement and land The mineralisation is situated within exploration licence ELASSS (expires

tenure status 05/04/2014) which is currently held by Northern Platinum Pty Ltd. Northern
Platinum advises that the tenement is considered in good standing by the
Victorian Department of Environment and Primary Industries and that they
cannot foresee any reasons that would inhibit the tenement being renewed
for a further term in 2014.

Criteria Explanation
Thursday Gossan Chalcocite Copper, Junction and Drysdale.

The block model and grade estimate encompasses the extent of the
mineralisation.

Estimation and modelling Copper grades were interpolated into a Vulcan V non-regular block model

techniques with 20x20x10 metre parent blocks — subblocked to 2.5x2.5x2.5 metre
minimum block dimensions.
3m composite intervals utilised.

No high grade sample treatment applied.

Single pass ID2 interpolation run employed utilising 200m sample search
within the plane of mineralisation (97.8% of blocks within the TIN domain
estimated).

Minimum of 10 and maximum of 20 composites utilised to estimate grade.
The Mt Ararat resource is classified as Inferred under the guidelines set out
in the 2012 IORC Code.

Moisture and Recovery 27 of 28 AC/RC holes with moisture information recorded wet drilling
conditions through the mineralisation. It is unknown if the wet conditions
has introduced bias or contamination into the dataset as relevant/detailed
information is not available.

Available core recovery data suggests that biases caused by both loss and
enrichment may be affecting the resource dataset.

Cut-off parameters The resource estimate is reported at 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.5% Cu cuts and by
three mineralised thicknesses domains - <10m, 10-20m and >20m thick.
These breakdowns and grade tonnage plots are reported to allow differing
economic assessment on the project.

Mining factors or assumptions Not applied, however resource is reported at three thicknesses for input into
this discipline.

Metallurgical factors or Not evaluated as risks associated with historic data over-riding feature

assumptions affecting the confidence of the estimate.

Environmental factors or Not evaluated as risks associated with historic data over-riding feature

Classification The estimate is classified as Inferred under the JORC Code [2012 Edition).
Absence of (IA/QC, the indicated sampling and assaying issues and absence
of important data for evaluating other risks to the estimate [such as recover
and moisture versus grade) are key factors in assigning an Inferred
Classification.

B. REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE
The  Board  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  Company’s  remuneration  structures  are  aligned  with  the  long-term 
interests of Stavely and its shareholders
Once the Board is of a sufficient size and structure, and the Company’s operations are of a sufficient magnitude, to assist 
the Board in fulfilling its duties, the Board will establish a Remuneration Committee. Until that time, the Board has taken 
a view that the full Board will hold special meetings or sessions as required. The Board are confident that this process is 
stringent and full details of remuneration policies and payments are provided to shareholders in the annual report and 
on the web.  The Board has adopted the following policies for Directors’ and executives’ remuneration.
C. PRINCIPLES USED TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND AMOUNT OF REMUNERATION
Remuneration Philosophy 
The  performance  of  the  Group  depends  upon  the  quality  of  its  Directors  and  Executives.  To  prosper,  the  Group  must 
attract, motivate and retain highly skilled Directors and Executives. 
 
To this end, the Group embodies the following principles in its remuneration framework:
 
 

provide competitive rewards to attract high calibre Executives; 
link Executive rewards to shareholder value; and 
in  the  future,  will  establish  appropriate,  demanding  performance  hurdles  in  relation  to  variable  Executive 
remuneration.
In  accordance  with  best  practice  corporate  governance,  the  structure  of  non-executive  director  and  executive 
compensation is separate and distinct.
2016 Annual Report  |  Page 38
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Non-Executive directors’ remuneration 
Objective 
The Board seeks to set aggregate remuneration at a level which provides the Group with the ability to attract and retain 
Directors of the highest calibre, whilst incurring a cost which is acceptable to shareholders. 
 
Structure 
Non-executive  Directors’  fees  are  paid  within  an  aggregate  limit  which  is  approved  by  the  shareholders  from  time  to 
time. Retirement payments, if any, are agreed to be determined in accordance with the rules set out in the Corporations 
Act  as  at  the  time  of  the  Director’s  retirement  or  termination.  Non-executive  Directors’  remuneration  may  include  an 
incentive  portion  consisting  of  options,  as  considered  appropriate  by  the  Board,  which  may  be  subject  to  shareholder 
approval  in  accordance  with  ASX  listing  rules.  The  option  incentive  portion  is  targeted  to  add  to  shareholder  value  by 
having a strike price considerably greater than the market price at the time of granting. 
 
The  amount  of  aggregate  remuneration  sought  to  be  approved  by  shareholders  and  the  manner  in  which  it  is 
apportioned  amongst  Directors  is  reviewed  annually.  The  Board  considers  the  amount  of  Director  fees  being  paid  by 
comparable companies with similar responsibilities and the experience of the Non-executive Directors when undertaking 
the annual review process. 
 
Executive Director Remuneration  
Objective 
The  Group  aims  to  reward  Executives  with  a  level  and  mix  of  remuneration  commensurate  with  their  position  and 
responsibilities within the Group and so as to:
 
 

reward Executives for company, and individual performance; 
ensure continued availability of experienced and effective management; and 
ensure total remuneration is competitive by market standards.
Structure 
In  determining  the  level  and  make-up  of  Executive  remuneration,  the  Board  negotiates  a  remuneration  to  reflect  the 
market  salary  for  a  position  and  individual  of  comparable  responsibility  and  experience.  Remuneration  is  regularly 
compared with the external market by participation in industry salary surveys and during recruitment activities generally. 
If required, the Board may engage an external consultant to provide independent advice in the form of a written report 
detailing market levels of remuneration for comparable Executive roles.
Remuneration consists of a fixed remuneration and a long term incentive portion as considered appropriate.
Fixed Remuneration - Objective 
The  level  of  fixed  remuneration  is  set  so  as  to  provide  a  base  level  of  remuneration  which  is  both  appropriate  to  the 
position and is competitive in the market. Fixed remuneration is reviewed annually by the Board and the process consists 
of a review of Group and individual performance, and relevant comparative remuneration in the market. As noted above, 
the Board may engage an external consultant to provide independent advice.
Fixed Remuneration - Structure 
The fixed remuneration is a base salary or monthly consulting fee.
Variable Pay — Long Term Incentives - Objective 
The objective of long term incentives is to reward Executives in a manner which aligns this element of remuneration with 
the creation of shareholder wealth. The incentive portion is payable based upon attainment of objectives related to the 
Executive’s  job  responsibilities.  The  objectives  vary,  but  all  are  targeted  to  relate  directly  to  the  Group’s  business  and 
financial performance and thus to shareholder value.
Variable Pay — Long Term Incentives – Structure 
Long term incentives granted to Executives are delivered in the form of options. The option incentives granted are aimed 
to  motivate  Executives  to  pursue  the  long  term  growth  and  success  of  the  Group  within  an  appropriate  control 
framework  and  demonstrate  a  clear  relationship  between  key  Executive  performance  and  remuneration.  Director 
options  are  granted  at  the  discretion  of  the  Board  and  approved  by  shareholders.  Other  key  management  employees
2016 Annual Report  |  Page 39
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
may  be  granted  options.  Performance  hurdles  are  not  attached  to  vesting  periods;  however  the  Board  determines 
appropriate vesting periods to provide rewards over a period of time to key management personnel.
During the year, no performance related cash payments were made.
D. SERVICE AGREEMENTS
On appointment to the board, all non-executive directors enter into a service agreement with the Company in the form 
of a letter of appointment.  The letter summarises the board policies and terms, including compensation, relevant to the 
office of director.

These  options  were  granted  to  recognise  the  efforts  of  Stavely’s  directors  and  consultants  and  provide  a  retention 
incentive.  It is important to note that in March 2015, all directors and staff agreed to reduce their salaries / fees in order 
to  maximise  cash  for  exploration  expenditure.  Issue  of  these  Director  options  were  approved  by  Shareholders  at  the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting held on 18 November 2015. 
 
* Value at grant date has been calculated in accordance with AASB 2 Share-based Payment. Stavely used a Black Scholes 
option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share 
price  at  grant  date  and  the  expected  volatility  of  the  underlying  share,  the  expected  dividend  yield  and  the  risk-free 
interest rate for the term of the option.  Further details are in note 13 of the financial statements. 
 
Shares issued to Key Management Personnel on exercise of compensation options 
During the year to 30 June 2016, there were no compensation options exercised by Directors or other Key Management

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD
The names, skills, experiences and period of office of the Directors of the Company in office at the date of this Statement 
are set out in the Director’s Report.  A summary of these skills and experiences are provided in graph 1. 
 
The composition of the Board is determined using the following principles: 
 

Persons nominated as Non-executive Directors shall be expected to have qualifications, experience and expertise of 
benefit  to  the  Company  and  to  bring  an  independent  view  to  the  Board’s  deliberations.  Persons  nominated  as 
Executive Directors must be of sufficient stature and security of employment to express independent views on any 
matter.

The Chairperson should ideally be independent, but in any case be Non-executive and be elected by the Board based 
on his/her suitability for the position.

The roles of Chairperson and Managing Director should not be held by the same individual.
  All  Non-executive  Directors  are  expected  voluntarily  to  review  their  membership  of  the  Board  from  time-to-time 
taking into account length of service, age, qualifications and expertise relevant to the Company’s then current policy 
and programme, together with the other criteria considered desirable for composition of a balanced board and the 
overall interests of the Company.

The Company considers that the Board should have at least three Directors (minimum required under the Company's 
Constitution) and to have a majority of independent Directors but acknowledges that this may not be possible at all 
times  due  to  the  size  of  the  Company.    Currently  the  Board  has  four  Directors,  with  only  Mr  William  Plyley  as 
independent.  The number of Directors is maintained at a level which will enable effective spreading of workload and 
efficient decision making.
The Board has accepted the following definition of an independent Director: 
 
An independent Director is a Director who is not a member of management (a Non-executive Director) and who: 
 
(a) holds less than 5% of the voting shares of the Company and is not an officer of, or otherwise associated directly or
indirectly with, a shareholder of more than 5% of the voting shares of the Company;
(b) within  the  last  three  years  has  not  been  employed  in  an  executive  capacity  by  the  Company  or  another  group
member, or been a Director after ceasing to hold any such employment;
(c)  within the last three years has not been a principal of a material professional adviser or a material consultant to the
Company or another group member, or an employee materially associated with the service provided;
(d) is  not  a  material  supplier  or  customer  of  the  Company  or  other  group  member,  or  an  officer  of  or  otherwise
associated directly or indirectly with a material supplier or customer;
(e) has no material contractual relationship with the Company or another group member other than as a Director of the
Company;
(f)  has not served on the board for a period which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially interfere with
the Director’s ability to act in the best interests of the Company; and
(g) is  free  from  any  interest  and  any  business  or  other  relationship  which  could,  or  could  reasonably  be  perceived  to,
materially interfere with the Director’s ability to act in the best interests of the Company.
The materiality thresholds are assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant Director’s specific 
circumstances, rather than referring to a general materiality threshold.

INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL ADVICE AND ACCESS TO COMPANY INFORMATION
Each Director has the right of access to all relevant Company information and to the Company’s Executives and, subject to 
prior consultation with the Chairperson, may seek independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. A copy of 
advice received by the Director is made available to all other members of the Board.
2016 Annual Report  |  Page 48
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
NOMINATION COMMITTEE / APPOINTMENT OF NEW DIRECTORS
Because of the size of the Company and the size of the Board, the Directors do not believe it is appropriate to establish a 
separate Nomination Committee. The Board has taken a view that the full Board will hold special meetings or sessions as 
required. The Board are confident that this process for selection and review is stringent and full details of all Directors are 
provided to shareholders in the annual report and on the web.  
 
The composition of the Board is reviewed on an annual basis to ensure the Board has the appropriate mix of expertise 
and experience. Where a vacancy exists, through whatever cause, or where it is considered that the Board would benefit 
from  the  services  of  a  new  Director  with  particular  skills,  the  Board  determines  the  selection  criteria  for  the  position 
based  on  the  skills  deemed  necessary  for  the  Board  to  best  carry  out  its  responsibilities  and  then  appoints  the  most 
suitable candidate who must stand for election at the next general meeting of shareholders. 
 
All new non-executive directors are required to sign a letter of appointment which sets out the key terms and conditions 
of their appointment, including roles and responsibilities, time commitments and remuneration.  Executive directors and 
other senior executives enter into an employment agreement which governs the terms of their appointment. 
 
The  Board  undertakes  appropriate  checks  prior  to  nominating  a  director  for  election  by  shareholders.    These  checks 
include  a  police  and  reference  checks.    Shareholders  are  provided  with  all  material  information  in  its  possession 
concerning a director standing for election or re-election in the relevant notice of meeting. 
 
An informal induction is provided to all new directors, which includes meeting with technical and financial personnel to 
understand Stavely’s business, including strategies, risks, company policies and health and safety.   
 
All directors are required to maintain professional development necessary to maintain their skills and knowledge needed 
to perform their duties.  In additional to training provided by relevant professional affiliations of the directors, additional 
development is provided through attendance at seminars and provision of technical papers on industry related matters 
and developments offered by various professional organisations, such as accounting firms and legal advisors.
TERM OF OFFICE
Under  the  Company's  Constitution,  the  minimum  number  of  Directors  is  three.  At  each  Annual  General  Meeting,  one 
third of the Directors (excluding the Managing Director)  must  resign, with Directors resigning by rotation based on the 
date of their appointment. Directors resigning by rotation may offer themselves for re-election.
PERFORMANCE OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGING DIRECTOR
The performance of all Directors, the Board as a whole and the Managing Director is reviewed annually. 
 
The Board meets once a year with the specific purpose of conducting a review of its composition and performance. This 
review includes: 
 

Determining  the  appropriate  balance  of  skills  and  experience  required  to  suit  the  Company’s  current  and  future 
strategies;


Comparing the requirements above against the skills and experience of current Directors and Executives;
Assessing the independence of each Director;
  Measuring the contribution and performance of each Director;


Assessing any education requirements or opportunities; and
Recommending any changes to Board procedures, Committees or the Board composition.
A review was undertaken in June 2016.
2016 Annual Report  |  Page 49
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
PERFORMANCE OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES
The Board meets at least annually to review the performance of senior Executives, considerations include the following: 
 

The performance of the senior Executive in supplying the Board with information in a form, timeframe and quality 
that enables the Board to effectively discharge its duties;


Feedback from other senior Executives; and
Any particular concerns regarding the senior Executive.
A review of senior executives was undertaken in June 2016.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST
In accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and the Company’s constitution, Directors must keep the Board advised, on 
an ongoing basis, of any interest that could potentially conflict with those of the Company. Where the Board believes a 
significant  conflict  exists,  the  Director  concerned  does  not  receive  the  relevant  Board  papers  and  is  not  present  at  the 
Board meeting whilst the item is considered. Details of Directors related entity transactions with the Company are set out 
in the related parties note in the financial statements.
DIVERSITY
Stavely  recognises  the  benefits  arising  from  employee  and  Board  diversity,  including  a  broader  pool  of  high  quality 
employees, improving employee retention, accessing different perspectives and ideas and benefiting from all available 
talent. 
 
Diversity includes, but is not limited to, gender, age, ethnicity and cultural background. 
 
Stavely’s  Diversity Policy defines the initiatives which  assist  Stavely with maintaining and improving the diversity of its 
workforce.    A  copy  of  Stavely’s  Diversity  Policy  can  be  found  on  Stavely’s  website  at  http://www.stavely.com.au/wp-
content/uploads/2014/03/Corporate-Governance-Plan.pdf. 
  In  accordance  with  this  policy  and  ASX  Corporate 
Governance Principles, the Board has established the following objectives in relation to gender diversity.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
BOARD REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Once the Board is of a sufficient size and structure, and the Company’s operations are of a sufficient magnitude, to assist 
the Board in fulfilling its duties, the Board will establish a Remuneration Committee. Until that time, the Board has taken 
a view that the full Board will hold special meetings or sessions as required. The Board are confident that this process is 
stringent and full details of remuneration policies and payments are provided to shareholders in the annual report and 
on the web.
AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE
The Audit and Risk Committee consists of the following directors:
  Mr Peter Ironside (non-executive director). Chairman of the Committee. Appointed 16 January 2014.
  Ms Jennifer Murphy (technical executive director).  Appointed 16 January 2014.
  Mr William Plyley (non-executive director).  Appointed 16 January 2014.

found  on  Stavely’s  website  at
The Committee held two meetings during the year ended June 2016.  Details of attendance are disclosed in the Directors’ 
Report.  The Board reviewed the performance of this committee in June 2016.
RISK OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT
The Board determines the Company’s ‘risk profile’ and is responsible overseeing and approving risk management strategy 
and policies, internal compliance and internal control systems. In summary, the Company policies are designed to ensure 
strategic, operational, legal, reputation and financial risks are identified, assessed, effectively and efficiently managed and 
monitored to enable achievement of the Company’s business objectives. 
 
The  Company’s  Risk  Register  identifies  the  material  risks  for  the  Company.    These  risks  include  loss  of  a  significant 
tenement,  failure  to  raise  future  capital,  insufficient  new  reserves  converted  from  resources  and  the  occurrence  of  a 
fatality or permanent disabling injury to persons whom Stavely has a duty of care.  The Risk Register records all current 
controls  in  place  to  minimise  the  risks,  and  identifies  the  overall  control  effectiveness.    The  Board  and  Audit  and  Risk 
Committee review the Risk Register on a regular basis. 
 
The  Board  reviewed  the  Risk  Management  Framework,  including  the  policies,  procedures  and  the  Company’s  Risk 
Register on 21 June 2016. 
 
A  summary  of  Stavely’s  Risk  Management  review  procedures  can  be  found  in  the  corporate  governance  information 
section of the Company website at www.stavely.com.au. 
 
Considerable importance is placed on maintaining a strong control environment. The Board actively promotes a culture of 
quality and integrity. 
 
Control procedures cover management accounting, financial reporting, compliance and other risk management issues. 
 
No internal audit function is currently in place due to the size of the Company, however the Audit and Risk Committee 
regularly  assess  the  need  for  an  internal  audit  function.  The  Board  encourages  management  accountability  for  the 
Company’s financial reports by ensuring ongoing financial reporting during the year to the Board. Quarterly, the Financial 
Controller  (or  equivalent)  and  the  Managing  Director  are  required  to  state  in  writing  to  the  Board  that  in  all  material 
respects:

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
(a)
Basis of Preparation 
These  financial  statements  are  general  purpose  financial  statements,  which  have  been  prepared  in  accordance 
with  the  requirements  of  the  Corporations  Act  2001,  Australian  Accounting  Standards  and  other  authoritative 
pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board. The financial report has also been prepared on a 
historical cost basis.
The financial report is presented in Australian dollars, which is the Group’s functional and presentation currency. 
 
Stavely Minerals Limited is a for-profit entity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements. 
 
The  annual  report  of  Stavely  Minerals  Limited  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  was  authorised  for  issue  in 
accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 2 September 2016. 
 
Statement of Compliance 
 
These  financial  statements  comply  with  Australian  Accounting  Standards  and  International  Financial  Reporting 
Standards (IFRS).
Adoption of new and revised standards and Change in Accounting Standards
Early adoption of accounting standards
The Group has not elected to apply any pronouncements before their operative date in the annual reporting year 
beginning 1 July 2015.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
None of the new standards and amendments to standards that are mandatory for the first time for the financial 
year beginning 1 July 2015 affected any of the amounts recognised in the current year or any prior period and are 
not likely to affect future periods. 
 
Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not  mandatory for  30 June 
2016 reporting year.  The Group’s assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations that may 
have an impact on the Group is set out below: 
 
AASB 9 Financial Instruments
AASB  9  includes  requirements  for  the  classification  and  measurement  of  financial  assets.    There  is  no  material 
impact for Stavely.  This standard is not applicable until the financial year commencing 1 July 2018.
AASB 16 Leases
AASB 16 requires a  lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a  term  of more than 12  months.  
Stavely  has  not  yet  determined  the  impact  on  the  group  accounts.    This  standard  is  not  applicable  until  the 
financial year commencing 1 July 2019. 
 
Significant accounting estimates and judgments 
 
Significant accounting judgments 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, apart 
from  those  involving  estimations,  which  have  the  most  significant  effect  on  the  amounts  recognised  in  the 
financial statements.

(d)
2016 Annual Report  |  Page 59
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued
Exploration assets 
The Company’s accounting policy for exploration expenditure is set out at Note 1(i). The application of this policy 
necessarily  requires  management  to  make  certain  estimates  and  assumptions  as  to  future  events  and 
circumstances. Any such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after 
having capitalised acquisition expenditure under the policy, it is concluded that the expenditures are unlikely to 
be recovered by future exploitation or sale, then the relevant capitalised amount will be written off to  profit or 
loss. 
 
Significant accounting estimates and assumptions 
The carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities are often determined based on estimates and assumptions of 
future events. The key estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting year are: 
 
Impairment of assets 
In determining the recoverable amount of assets, in the absence of quoted market prices, estimations are made 
regarding the present value of future cash flows using asset-specific discount rates and the recoverable amount of 
the  asset  is  determined.  Value-in-use  calculations  performed  in  assessing  recoverable  amounts  incorporate  a 
number of key estimates. 
 
Share-based payment transactions 
The  Group  measures  the  cost  of  equity-settled  transactions  by  reference  to  the  fair  value  of  the  equity 
instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes model. 
 
Commitments - Exploration 
The Group has certain minimum exploration commitments to maintain its right of tenure to exploration permits. 
These commitments require estimates of the cost to perform exploration work required under these permits.   
 
Basis of consolidation and Business Combinations 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Stavely Minerals limited (“Company” 
or “Parent Entity”) and its subsidiaries as at 30 June each year (the Group).  Subsidiaries are all entities over which 
the group has control. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement  with  the  investee  and  has  the  ability  to  affect  those  returns  through  its  power  over  the  investee. 
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:
-
- 
-
Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities 
of the investee), 
Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and  
The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same period as the parent entity, using consistent 
accounting policies. 
 
In  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  all  intercompany  balances  and  transactions,  income  and 
expenses  and  profit  and  losses  resulting  from  intra-group  transactions  have  been  eliminated  in  full.  Subsidiaries 
are  fully  consolidated  from  the  date  on  which  control  is  transferred  to  the  Group  and cease  to  be  consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. Control exists where the company has the power 
to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
 
The  acquisition  of  subsidiaries  has  been  accounted  for  using  the  purchase  method  of  accounting.  The  purchase 
method  of  accounting  involves  allocating  the  cost  of  the  business  combination  to  the  fair  value  of  the  assets 
acquired  and  the  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities  assumed  at  the  date  of  acquisition.  Accordingly,  the 
consolidated financial statements include the results of subsidiaries for the period from their acquisition.
(e)

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued
(f)
(g)
(h)
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations regardless of whether equity 
instruments or other assets are acquired. Cost is measured as the fair value of the assets given, shares issued or 
liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange plus costs directly attributable to the combination. Where 
equity  instruments  are  issued  in  a  business  combination,  the  fair  value  of  the  instruments  is  their  published 
market price as at the date of exchange, adjusted for any conditions imposed on those shares. Transaction costs 
arising on the issue of equity instruments are recognised directly in equity. 
 
All  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities  assumed  in  a  business  combination  are 
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of the business combination 
over the net fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. If the 
cost  of  acquisition  is  less  than  the  Group's  share  of  the  net  fair  value  of  the  identifiable  net  assets  of  the 
subsidiary,  the  difference  is  recognised  as  a  gain  in  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive 
income, but only after a reassessment of the identification and measurement of the net assets acquired. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash  comprises  cash  at  bank  and  in  hand.  Cash  equivalents  are  short  term,  highly  liquid  investments  that  are 
readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as 
described above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade and other receivables 
Receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for 
doubtful debts. Current receivables for GST are due for settlement within 30 days and other current receivables 
within 12 months. Cash on deposit is not due for settlement until rights of tenure are forfeited or performance 
obligations are met.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment 
losses. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: 
 
Plant and equipment  -  2 to 5 years 
Motor vehicles 
-  2 to 5 years 
 
The assets' residual values, useful lives and amortisation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at 
each financial year end. 
 
Disposal 
An  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is  derecognised  upon  disposal  or  when  no  further  future  economic 
benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or 
loss in the year the asset is derecognised.

when  it  is  incurred  and  included  as  part  of  cash  flows  from  operating  activities.    Exploration  costs  are  only 
capitalised to the balance sheet if they result from an acquisition.  
 
Evaluation expenditure is capitalised to the balance sheet. Evaluation is deemed to be activities undertaken from 
the beginning of the pre-feasibility study conducted to assess the technical and commercial viability of extracting a 
mineral resource before moving into the Development phase. The criteria for carrying forward the costs are: 
 
-
Such  costs  are  expected  to  be  recouped  through  successful  development  and  exploitation  of  the  area  of 
interest, or alternatively by its sale; or 
evaluation  activities  in  the  area  of  interest  which  has  not  yet  reached  a  state  which  permits  a  reasonable 
assessment  of  the  existence  or  otherwise  of  economically  recoverable  reserves,  and  active  and  significant 
operations in, or in relation to, the area are continuing.
-
Costs carried forward in respect of an area of interest which is abandoned are written off in the year in which the 
abandonment decision is made. 
 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. Where 
an indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of recoverable amount. Where the carrying 
amount  of an asset  exceeds its recoverable amount  the asset  is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. 
 
Recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. It is determined for an individual 
asset, unless the asset’s value in use cannot be estimated to be close to its fair value less costs to sell and it does 
not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, in which 
case, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
 
In  assessing  value  in  use,  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  are  discounted  to  their  present  value  using  a  pre  tax 
discount  rate  that  reflects  current  market  assessments  of  the  time  value  of  money  and  the  risks  specific  to  the 
asset. 
 
Where  an  impairment  loss  subsequently  reverses,  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  is  increased  to  the  revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior 
years.

Other financial assets 
Financial assets in the scope of AASB 139  Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement  are classified as 
either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or 
available-for-sale investments, as appropriate. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at 
fair value, plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transactions 
costs.  The  Group  determines  the  classification  of  its  financial  assets  after  initial  recognition  and,  when  allowed 
and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year-end. 
 
All  regular  way  purchases  and  sales  of  financial  assets  are  recognised  on  the  trade  date,  i.e.  the  date  that  the 
Group commits to purchase the asset. Regular  way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets 
under  contracts  that  require  delivery  of  the  assets  within  the  period  established  generally  by  regulation  or 
convention in the marketplace. 
 
(i)   Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial  assets  classified  as  held  for  trading  are  included  in  the  category  ‘financial  assets  at  fair  value  through 
profit or loss’. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the 
near term. Gains or losses on investments held for trading are recognised in profit or loss. The fair values of quoted 
investments  are  based  on  last  trade  prices.  If  the  market  for  financial  assets  is  not  active  (and  for  unlisted 
securities), the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. 
 
(ii) 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses 
are recognised in profit or loss when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through 
the amortisation process. 
 
Trade and other payables 
Trade payables and other payables are carried at amortised costs and represent liabilities for goods and services 
provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the  Group becomes 
obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services. 
 
Provisions 
Provisions  are  recognised  when  the  Group  has  a  present  obligation  (legal  or  constructive)  as  a  result  of  a  past 
event,  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying  economic  benefits  will  be  required  to  settle  the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Loans and receivables
Wages, salaries and, annual leave
Employee leave benefits 
(i) 
Liabilities  for  wages  and  salaries,  including  non-monetary  benefits  and  annual  leave  and  expected  to  be  settled 
wholly within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in other payables in respect of employees’ services 
up to the reporting date. They are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. 
 
(ii)   Other long-term employee benefit obligations 
The  liability  for  long  service  leave  and  annual  leave  not  expected  to  be  settled  wholly  within  12  months  of  the 
reporting  date  are  recognised  in  the  provision  for  employee  benefits  and  measured  as  the  present  value  of 
expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date using 
the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of 
employee departures, and period of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the 
reporting date on  corporate bonds with terms to maturity and currencies that match, as closely as possible, the 
estimated future cash outflows.  The obligations are presented as current liabilities if the Group does not have an 
unconditional  right  to  defer  settlement  for  at  least  12  months  of  the  reporting  date,  regardless  of  when  actual 
settlement is expected to occur.

(o)
Issued capital 
Ordinary  shares  are  classified  as  equity.  Incremental  costs  directly  attributable  to  the  issue  of  new  shares  or 
options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
(p)
(q)
(r)
Leases 
Leases in which  a  significant  portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not  transferred to the Group as 
lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net  of any incentives received 
from the lessor) are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Revenue recognition  
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the  Group and the 
revenue can be reliably measured. 
 
Interest revenue is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the financial asset.   
 
Share-based payment transactions 
 Equity settled transactions: 
The Group provides benefits to executive directors, employees and consultants of the Group in the form of share-
based payments, whereby those individuals render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-
settled transactions). 
 
When provided, the cost  of these equity-settled transactions with these individuals is  measured by reference to 
the  fair  value  of  the  equity  instruments  at  the  date  at  which  they  are  granted.  The  fair  value  of  options  is 
determined using a Black-Scholes model. 
 
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account  is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions 
linked to the price of the shares of Stavely Minerals Limited (market conditions) if applicable. 
 
The  cost  of  equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a  corresponding increase in equity, over the 
period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant 
individuals become fully entitled to the award (the vesting date). 
 
The  cumulative  expense  recognised  for  equity-settled  transactions  at  each  reporting  date  until  vesting  date 
reflects: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii)
the grant date fair value of the award;  
the extent to which the vesting period has expired; and 
the number of awards that, in the opinion of the Directors of the  Company, will ultimately vest taking into 
account such factors as the likelihood of non-market performance conditions being met.
This opinion is formed based on the best available information at balance date.
No  expense  is  recognised  for  awards  that  do  not  ultimately  vest,  except  for  awards  where  vesting  is  only 
conditional upon a market condition. 
 
If an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense 
not  yet  recognised for the award is recognised immediately. If an equity-settled award is  forfeited, any expense 
previously recognised for the award is reversed. However, if a new award is substituted for a cancelled award and 
designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new award are treated as if 
they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.

(s)
Income tax 
Current  tax  assets  and  liabilities  for  the  current  and  prior  periods  are  measured  at  the  amount  expected  to  be 
recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are 
those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
 
Deferred income tax is provided on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. 
 
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except:
  when the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability 
in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; or
  when the taxable temporary difference is associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates or interests 
in  joint  operations,  and  the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the  temporary  difference  can  be  controlled  and  it  is 
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax 
assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible  temporary  differences  and  the  carry-forward  of  unused  tax  credits  and  unused  tax  losses  can  be 
utilised, except: 
  when  the  deferred  income  tax  asset  relating  to  the  deductible  temporary  difference  arises  from  the  initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the 
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; or
  when  the  deductible  temporary  difference  is  associated  with  investments  in  subsidiaries,  associates  or 
interests  in  joint  operations,  in  which  case  a  deferred  tax  asset  is  only  recognised  to  the  extent  that  it  is 
probable  that  the  temporary  difference  will  reverse  in  the  foreseeable  future  and  taxable  profit  will  be 
available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
The  carrying  amount  of  deferred  income  tax  assets  is  reviewed  at  each  balance  sheet  date  and  reduced  to  the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred 
income tax asset to be utilised.   
 
Unrecognised  deferred  income  tax  assets  are  reassessed  at  each  balance  sheet  date  and  are  recognised  to  the 
extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 
 
Deferred  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  measured  at  the  tax  rates  that  are  expected  to  apply  to  the  year 
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that  have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
 
Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in profit or loss. 
 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current 
tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to the same taxable entity 
and the same taxation authority.
The amount of benefits brought to account or which may be realised in the future is based on the assumption that 
no adverse change will occur in income legislation and the anticipation that the Group will derive sufficient future 
assessable income to enable the benefit to be realised and comply with the conditions of deductibility imposed by 
the law.

Other taxes 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except: 
  when the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in 
which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item 
as applicable; and 
receivables and payables, which are stated with the amount of GST included.
 
 
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or 
payables in the balance sheet.  Cash flows are included in the Cash Flow Statement on a gross basis and the GST 
component of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities, which is recoverable from, or payable to, 
the taxation authority, are classified as operating cash flows.  Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net 
of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority. 
 
Borrowing Costs 
Borrowing  costs are expensed in the period in  which  they are incurred except  borrowing costs that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of a qualifying asset that necessarily takes a substantial 
period to get ready for its intended use or sale.  In this case, borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of 
such a qualifying asset.
Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated as net profit attributable to members of the parent, adjusted to exclude any 
costs  of  servicing  equity  (other  than  dividends),  divided  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  ordinary  shares, 
adjusted for any bonus element.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as net profit attributable to members of the parent, adjusted for: 
 

costs of servicing equity (other than dividends); 
the  after  tax  effect  of  dividends  and  interest  associated  with  dilutive  potential  ordinary  shares  that  have 
been recognised as expenses; and 
other non-discretionary changes in revenues or expenses during the period that would result from the dilution 
of potential ordinary shares; divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential 
ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element.

Segment reporting 
An  operating  segment  is  a  component  of  an  entity  that  engages  in  business  activities  from  which  it  may  earn 
revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of 
the same entity), whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity's chief operating decision maker to 
make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete 
financial information is available. Management will also consider other factors in determining operating segments 
such as the existence of a line manager and the level of segment information presented to the board of Directors. 
  
Operating  segments  have  been  identified  based  on  the  information  provided  to  the  chief  operating  decision 
makers – being the executive management team. 
 
The Group aggregates two or more operating segments when they have similar economic characteristics, and the 
segments are similar in each of the following respects: 
- Nature of the products and services, 
- Type or class of customer for the products and services, 
- Methods used to distribute the products or provide the services, and if applicable 
- Nature of the regulatory environment. 
 
Operating  segments  that  meet  the  quantitative  criteria  as  prescribed  by  AASB  8  are  reported  separately.  
However,  an  operating  segment  that  does  not  meet  the  quantitative  criteria  is  still  reported  separately  where 
information about the segment would be useful to users of the Financial Statements.

The assessed fair values of the options were determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, taking into account 
the  exercise  price,  term  of  option,  the  share  price  at  grant  date  and  expected  price  volatility  of  the  underlying  share, 
expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the option. The inputs to the model used were:
Grant date
Option exercise price ($)
Expected life of options (years)
Dividend yield (%)
Expected volatility (%)
Risk-free interest rate (%)
Underlying share price ($)

The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that 
may  occur.  The  expected  volatility  reflects  the  assumption  that  the  historical  volatility  is  indicative  of  future  trends, 
which  may also not  necessarily be the actual outcome. No other features of options granted were incorporated into 
the measurement of fair value.
(c)  Weighted average fair value
The weighted average fair value of equity-based payment options granted during the year was $0.06804 (2015: nil). 
  
(d)  Range of exercise price
The range of exercise price for options granted as share based payments outstanding at the end of the year was $0.23 to 
$0.27 (2015: $0.27). 
 
(e)  Weighted average remaining contractual life
The weighted average remaining contractual life of share based payment options that were outstanding as at the end of

Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the board of directors that are 
used  to  make  strategic  decisions.    The  Group  does  not  have  any  material  operating  segments  with  discrete  financial 
information.  The Group does not have any customers and all its’ assets and liabilities are primarily related to the mining 
industry and are located within Australia.  The Board of Directors review internal management reports on a regular basis 
that  is  consistent  with  the  information  provided  in  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive  income, 
balance  sheet  and  statement  of  cash  flows.   As  a  result  no  reconciliation  is  required  because  the  information  as 
presented is what is used by the Board to make strategic decisions.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
NOTE 18 – FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES 
 
The  Group’s principal  financial instrument  comprises cash. The  main purpose of this  financial instrument  is to provide 
working capital for the Group’s operations. 
 
The  Group  has  various  other  financial  instruments  such  as  sundry  debtors,  security  bonds  and  trade  creditors,  which 
arise directly from its operations. 
 
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be 
undertaken. 
 
The main risk arising from the Group’s financial instruments is interest rate risk. The Board reviews and agrees on policies 
for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. 
 
Interest rate risk 
At balance date the  Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the  Group’s cash 
and bonds. The Group constantly analyses its exposure to interest rates, with consideration given to potential renewal of 
existing positions, the mix of fixed and variable interest rates and the period to which deposits may be fixed. 
 
At balance date, the Group had the following financial assets exposed to variable interest rates that are not designated in 
cash flow hedges: 
 
 
Financial Assets: 
Cash and cash equivalents  - interest bearing 
Trade and other receivables - bonds

$
30 June 2016 
$
1,372,318 
80,000
478,927 
80,000
Net exposure 
 
Sensitivity 
At  30 June 2016, if interest  rates had increased by 0.5% from the year end variable rates with all other  variables held 
constant, post tax profit and equity for the Group would have been $7,261 higher (2015: changes of 0.5% $2,795 higher).  
The 0.5% (2015: 0.5%) sensitivity is based on reasonably possible changes, over a financial year, using an observed range 
of historical RBA movements over the last year.
1,452,318
558,927
Liquidity risk 
The Group has no significant exposure to liquidity risk as there is effectively no debt. The Group manages liquidity risk by 
monitoring immediate and forecast cash requirements and ensuring adequate cash reserves are maintained. 
 
Credit risk 
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counter party will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the 
Group. The Group has adopted the policy of dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral 
or  other  security  where  appropriate,  as  a  means  of  mitigating  the  risk  of  financial  loss  from  defaults.  The  Group 
measures credit risk on a fair value basis.
Significant  cash  deposits  are  with  institutions  with  a  minimum  credit  rating  of  AA  (or  equivalent)  as  determined  by  a 
reputable credit rating agency e.g. Standard & Poor.   
 
The  Group  does  not  have  any  other  significant  credit  risk  exposure  to  a  single  counterparty  or  any  group  of 
counterparties having similar characteristics.
