<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
<i>Guided</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration on the Right 
</p>
<p>to Development, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and other relevant 
human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 62/219 of 22

<p><i>Recalling also</i> General Assembly resolutions 54/205 of 22 December 1999, 55/61 of 
4 December 2000, 55/188 of 20 December 2000, 56/186 of 21 December 2001, 57/244 of

</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 17/23 of 17 June 2011, 19/38 
of 23 March 2012 and 22/12 of 21 March 2013, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the entry into force on 14 December 2005 of the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption,  
</p>
<p><i>Reiterating</i> the commitment to ensure the effective enjoyment of all civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights for everyone, including the right to development, and 
</p>

<p>the obligation of all States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to 
promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all peoples may, for their own ends, freely dispose of their natural 
wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international 
economic cooperation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law, 
and that in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that fighting corruption at all levels is a priority and that corruption is a 
serious barrier to effective resource mobilization and allocation and diverts resources away 
from activities that are vital for poverty eradication, the fight against hunger, and economic 
and sustainable development, 
</p>
<p><i>Alarmed</i> at cases in which the proceeds of corruption-related crimes that involve 
vast quantities of assets may constitute a substantial proportion of the resources of States, 
the deprivation of which threatens the political stability and sustainable development of 
those States and has a negative impact on the application by States of the maximum 
available resources to the full realization of all human rights for all, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that the enjoyment of human rights, be they economic, social and 
cultural, or civil and political, in particular the right to development, is seriously 
undermined by corruption and the transfer of funds of illicit origin, which may endanger the 
stability and security of societies, undermine the values of democracy and morality and 
jeopardize social, economic and political development, especially when an inadequate 
national and international response leads to impunity, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the United Nations Convention against Corruption, underlining its central 
role in fostering international cooperation to facilitate the repatriation of the proceeds of 
corruption-related crimes, and stressing the need for universal adherence to the Convention 
and for its full implementation, as well as the full implementation of the resolutions and 
decisions of the Conference of the States Parties to the Convention, particularly those 
adopted at its fourth and fifth sessions, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also </i>that the United Nations Convention against Corruption underlines 
that States parties should not decline to render mutual legal assistance, pursuant to the 
Convention, including on the ground of bank secrecy, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the work carried out by different United Nations bodies, including 
the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, as well as international and regional 
organizations, in preventing and combating all forms of corruption, 
</p>
<p><i>Encouraging </i>all relevant United Nations mechanisms to continue their consideration 
of the negative impact of illicit financial flows on the enjoyment of human rights, to further 
explore policy responses to the phenomenon and to coordinate their efforts in this regard, </p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that supportive domestic legal systems are essential in preventing and 
combating corrupt practices and the transfer of assets of illicit origin and in returning such 
assets, and recalling that the fight against all forms of corruption requires strong institutions 
at all levels, including at the local level, able to take efficient preventive and law 
enforcement measures consistent with the United Nations Convention against Corruption, 
in particular chapters II and III thereof, 
</p>
<p><i>Appreciating</i> the continued efforts of the Conference of the States Parties to the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption, through its various intergovernmental 
working groups, to oversee the review process of the implementation of the Convention, to 
advise on the provision of technical assistance for building institutional and human capacity 
in States parties for the prevention of corruption, and to enhance international cooperation, 
including in the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, </p>


<p><i>Affirming</i> the responsibilities of requesting and requested States in the repatriation of 
funds of illicit origin, cognizant that countries of origin must seek repatriation as part of 
their duty to ensure the application of the maximum available resources to the full 
realization of all human rights for all, including the right to development, address human 
rights violations and combat impunity, and that recipient countries, on the other hand, have 
a duty to assist and facilitate repatriation, including through judicial assistance, as part of 
their obligation of international cooperation and assistance under chapters IV and V of the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption and in the field of human rights 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>that article 2.1 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights notes the need for each State party to take steps, individually and through 
international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the 
maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full 
realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant by all appropriate means, and article 3.<footnote name="3">A/HRC/25/52. </footnote> 
of the Declaration on the Right to Development, which notes that States have the duty to 
cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
development, </p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> the commitment made at the 2005 World Summit and the 2010 high-level 
plenary meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals to make 
the fight against corruption a priority at all levels and to curb the illicit transfer of funds, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> at the difficulties, in particular the practical difficulties, that both 
requested and requesting States face in the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, taking into 
account the particular importance of the recovery of stolen assets for sustainable 
development and stability, and noting the difficulties of providing information establishing 
a link between the proceeds of corruption in the requested State and the crime committed in 
the requesting State, which in many cases may be difficult to prove, bearing in mind that 
everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until 
proven guilty according to law, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the progress made towards the implementation of the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption, while recognizing that States continue to face challenges in 
recovering funds of illicit origin owing to, inter alia, differences in legal systems, the 
complexity of multijurisdictional investigations and prosecutions, lack of familiarity with 
the mutual legal assistance procedures of other States and difficulties in identifying the flow 
of funds of illicit origin, and noting the particular challenges in recovering them in cases 
involving individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions and 
their family members and close associates, and recognizing also that legal difficulties are 
often exacerbated by factual and institutional obstacles, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with serious concern</i> that, as highlighted in the interim report by the 
Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial 
obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, 
social and cultural rights,1 despite the scarcity of available public data, most illicit financial 
outflows are from developing countries and that, despite increased efforts by the 
international community to curb the flow of illicit funds, recent studies indicate that such 
flows grew in real terms by an annual average of 8.6 per cent, exceeding the average rate of 
economic growth in developing countries, over the period 2001 to 2010, and it is estimated 
that developing countries lost between 783 billion and 1,138 billion United States dollars in 
illicit financial outflows in 2010, while, as indicated in the comprehensive study prepared 
by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the negative impact of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>non-repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin on the enjoyment of 
human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights,2 only about 2 per cent of 
the estimated funds of illicit origin annually leaving the developing world are repatriated to 
their countries of origin, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with serious concern</i> <i>also </i>that, as highlighted by the Independent Expert on 
the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on 
the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights in 
his final report,3 while official development assistance remains an important source of 
finance for poverty alleviation and development, the substantial amounts lost to illicit 
financial flows &#8212; estimated at 946.7 billion dollars in 2011 &#8212; could help the efforts of 
developing countries to mobilize domestic resources for poverty alleviation, development 
and realization of human rights, and to reduce their dependence on external financing, 
which can lead to the erosion of ownership of national development agendas, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>the particular concern of developing countries and countries with economies 
in transition regarding the return of assets of illicit origin derived from corruption, in 
particular to countries from which they originated, consistent with the principles of the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption, in particular chapter V thereto, so as to 
enable countries to design and fund development projects in accordance with their national 
priorities in view of the importance that such assets can have to their sustainable 
development, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that the illicit acquisition of personal wealth can be particularly damaging 
to democratic institutions, national economies and the rule of law, and stressing that any 
resource that the State is deprived of because of corruption has potentially the same 
negative effect, regardless of whether it is exported or domestically retained, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Takes note</i> <i>with appreciation</i> of the comprehensive study prepared by the 
Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial 
obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, 
social and cultural rights;3 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Calls upon</i> all States that have not yet acceded to the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption to consider doing so as a matter of priority; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon</i> States to consider enacting legislation to address offences by 
business enterprises, including multinational corporations, which deprive Governments of 
legitimate domestic sources of revenue for the implementation of their development 
agendas; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Asserts</i> the urgent need to repatriate illicit funds to the countries of origin 
without conditionalities, in accordance with the United Nations Convention against 
Corruption and in line with the commitments made at the 2005 World Summit and the 2010 
high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development 
Goals to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels and to curb the illicit 
transfer of funds, and urges all States to step up their efforts to trace, freeze and recover 
those funds; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Acknowledges</i> the importance of compliance with international human rights 
law in relation to the repatriation of funds of illicit origin by, inter alia, promoting human 
rights-based policy coherence in the deliberations and actions by States Members of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 A/HRC/19/42 and Corr.1. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>Human Rights Council and in the intergovernmental process of implementing the United 
Nations Convention against Corruption; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Invites</i> the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention 
against Corruption to consider ways of adopting a human rights-based approach in the 
implementation of the Convention, including when dealing with the repatriation of funds of 
illicit origin, and appreciates the continued efforts of the Open-ended Intergovernmental 
Working Group on Asset Recovery of the Conference to assist States parties in fulfilling 
their obligations under the Convention to prevent, detect and deter in a more effective 
manner the international transfer of funds of illicit origin and to strengthen international 
cooperation in asset recovery, bearing in mind that, regardless of the capacities, resources 
and willingness of the requesting State&#8217;s institutions and authorities, there is a victim 
society that is suffering the consequences of the transfer of those funds; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Welcomes</i> the decision made at the fifth session of the Conference of the 
States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption to renew the mandate of 
open-ended intergovernmental expert meetings on international cooperation to advise and 
assist States with regard to extradition and mutual legal assistance, and notes with 
appreciation the Stolen Assets Recovery Initiative of the World Bank Group and the United 
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and encourages coordination among existing 
initiatives; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Calls upon</i> States to consider establishing an intergovernmental working 
group on the negative impact of illicit financial flows on the enjoyment of human rights, 
and to further explore policy responses to the phenomenon; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Realizes</i> that, while illicit financial outflows from the least developed 
countries may account for only a small portion of all outflows of funds of illicit origin 
worldwide, they have a particularly negative impact on social development and the 
realization of social, economic and cultural rights in these countries, given the size of their 
economies, and expresses deep concern that such outflows, as estimated by the United 
Nations Development Programme, exceed the total official development assistance 
received by many of the least developed countries and, in some cases, surpass their debt 
service payments; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Underscores</i> that the repatriation of funds of illicit origin would provide 
States that have undergone regime change with a further opportunity to improve the 
realization of economic, social and cultural rights and to fulfil their obligation to meet the 
legitimate aspirations of their peoples; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Acknowledges</i> the important role that civil society can play in exposing 
corruption and drawing attention to the negative impact of the non-repatriation of funds of 
illicit origin on the rule of law and the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, 
and reiterates in this context the obligation of States to protect reporting persons in 
accordance with article 33 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the 
Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society 
to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Welcomes</i> recent national initiatives to adopt anti-money-laundering 
legislation as an important step in the fight against corruption and the willingness 
demonstrated by some States to cooperate in facilitating the repatriation of funds of illicit 
origin, and calls for more robust regulations in this regard, including through the 
implementation of policies aimed at reducing the flow of funds of illicit origin, ensuring 
their repatriation and the provision of technical assistance to developing countries; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Calls for </i>further international cooperation through, inter alia, the United 
Nations system, in support of national, subregional and regional efforts to prevent and </p>


<p>combat corrupt practices and the transfer of assets of illicit origin, in accordance with the 
principles of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, and in this regard 
encourages close cooperation at the national and international levels between anti-
corruption agencies, law enforcement agencies and financial intelligence units; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Calls upon</i> all States requested to repatriate funds of illicit origin to uphold 
fully their commitment to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels and to 
curb the illicit transfer of funds, and to acknowledge that, in fulfilling their obligations in 
this regard under the United Nations Convention against Corruption, they also have a 
responsibility towards societies affected by corruption to make every effort to achieve the 
repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin in order to diminish the 
negative impact of non-repatriation, including on the enjoyment of human rights, in 
particular economic, social and cultural rights in the countries of origin by, inter alia, 
lowering the barriers imposed on requiring jurisdictions at the tracing stage and enhancing 
cooperation in this regard between anti-corruption agencies, law enforcement agencies and 
financial intelligence units, in particular taking into account the risks of dissipation of those 
funds and, where appropriate, by delinking confiscation measures from a requirement of 
conviction in the country of origin; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Calls upon</i> all States requesting the repatriation of funds of illicit origin to 
uphold fully their commitment to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels 
and to curb the illicit transfer of funds, and to apply the principles of accountability, 
transparency and participation in the decision-making process regarding the allocation of 
repatriated funds to the realization of economic, social and cultural rights in order to 
improve prevention and detection procedures, correct identified weaknesses or 
mismanagement, prevent impunity, provide effective remedies directed at creating 
conditions for avoiding new human rights violations and improve the overall administration 
of justice; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Reaffirms</i> that it is the obligation of the State to investigate and prosecute 
corruption, calls upon all States to strengthen criminal proceedings directed at freezing or 
restraining funds of illicit origin, and encourages requesting States to ensure that adequate 
national investigative procedures have been initiated and substantiated for the purpose of 
presenting mutual legal assistance requests and, in this context, encourages requested States 
to provide information on legal frameworks and procedures to the requesting State; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Underlines</i> that there is also a corporate responsibility to comply with and 
respect all applicable laws and human rights, and a need for greater access to effective 
remedies by victims in order to realize effective prevention of, and remedy for, business- 
related human rights harm, as set out in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights;<footnote name="4">A/HRC/17/31, annex. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Stresses</i> <i>the need</i> for transparency in financial institutions and effective due 
diligence measures to be applied by financial intermediaries, calls upon States to seek 
appropriate means in accordance with their international obligations to ensure the 
cooperation and responsiveness of financial institutions to foreign requests to freeze and 
recover funds of illicit origin and the provision of an efficient mutual legal assistance 
regime to States requesting repatriation of those funds, and encourages the promotion of 
human and institutional capacity-building in that regard; 
</p>
<p>19.<i>  Recalls</i> the importance of the mechanism for the review of implementation of 
the United Nations Convention against Corruption, and urges State parties to comply with 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>their obligations in the conduct of the country reviews to enhance effective implementation 
of the Convention as a preventive measure for the outflow of illicit financial flows;  
</p>
<p>20. <i>Requests</i> the Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other 
related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human 
rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, to continue to consider the impact 
of illicit financial flows on the enjoyment of human rights as part of the mandate; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Also requests</i> the Independent Expert to undertake a further study to analyse 
the negative impact of illicit financial flows on the enjoyment of human rights in the 
context of the post-2015 development agenda, and to present an interim study to the Human 
Rights Council at its twenty-eighth session and a final study to the Council at its thirty-first 
session; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to provide all necessary facilities and 
assistance, from within existing resources, to allow the Independent Expert to carry out the 
mandate set out in the present resolution in the manner she or he independently plans, 
including by holding consultations, and calls upon all relevant stakeholders, including 
States and United Nations bodies and agencies, as well as other international and regional 
entities, to cooperate fully with the Independent Expert in this regard; 
</p>
<p>23. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention 
of all Member States and different forums dealing with the issue of the repatriation of funds 
of illicit origin within the United Nations system for consideration and necessary action and 
coordination as appropriate, particularly within the context of the Conference of the States 
Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption; 
</p>
<p>24. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this matter under the same agenda 
item.
