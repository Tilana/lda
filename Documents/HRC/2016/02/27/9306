<p> The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/113, contains

raised in previous reports. Further, this report features highlights from the mission of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to Afghanistan from 15 to 21 November 2007.  
</p>
<p> With the intensification of armed conflict, protection of civilians has become a major 
human rights concern. Insurgency-related violence has cost hundreds of civilian lives and created 
new groups of displaced persons. Coupled with increased criminality, it has hindered aid 
delivery and further constrained humanitarian access. Poverty, lack of access to food, medical 
care and education persist, particularly affecting women, children and the disabled. Despite 
advances in women&#8217;s rights, they still face severe social, economic and political discrimination. 
Laudable efforts in the rule of law, police and governance reform are yet to produce institutions 
that systematically protect human rights. Arbitrary detention remains commonplace and reports 
of torture persist. Impunity remains entrenched and there is little progress in transitional justice. 
Journalists face increased levels of threats and intimidation, undermining the vibrant media that 
has flourished in recent years.  </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/113 and has been 
prepared in cooperation with the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). 
The report builds on my previous reports and my mission to Kabul, Khost and Mazar-i-Sharif 
undertaken from 15 to 21 November 2007. During my mission, I met with President Karzai, 
various Government ministers, the Chief Justice, the Speaker of the Parliament and other 
parliamentarians, commanders of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), 
representatives of the diplomatic community, members of the Afghanistan Independent Human 
Rights Commission (AIHRC), as well as human rights defenders, civil society activists and 
victims&#8217; groups. 
</p>
<p>2. Security and respect for human rights seriously deteriorated in Afghanistan in 2007 owing 
mainly to the deepening conflict, setbacks in institutional reform, persistent poverty, and the 
continued inability of government to effectively deliver essential services, security and justice. 
Alongside corruption and insufficient institutional capacity, these factors have heightened 
physical, economic and social vulnerability. The unprecedented increase of opium production 
in 2007 also posed a grave threat to the rule of law and security. 
</p>
<p>3. Human rights and their defenders have come under attack by those who view human rights 
as a Western-imposed concept, as counter to local religious and cultural traditions, and as a 
luxury that Afghanistan cannot afford. Yet, insecurity in Afghanistan generally emanates from 
failure to address ongoing human rights concerns and violations, including effectively addressing 
past violations. During my visit to Afghanistan, I found Afghans from all walks of life claiming 
their rights to food, shelter, education, a livelihood, health, justice and physical security. The 
creation of new institutions to protect human rights is not, and should not be perceived as an 
attack on traditional systems, but seeks to complement and build upon the latter&#8217;s strengths. 
</p>
<p>4. Regrettably, progress in implementing the Action Plan on Peace, Reconciliation and 
Justice, adopted by the Government in December 2005 and slated for completion by end of 2008, 
has been extremely limited. Significant political opposition to transitional justice in Afghanistan, 
exemplified by the adoption by Parliament of the National Reconciliation Charter, or amnesty 
law, in March 2007, seriously undermines the Action Plan. 
</p>
<p><b>I. POVERTY AND OTHER ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND  
CULTURAL RIGHTS ISSUES 
</b></p>
<p>5. This year, the Government of Afghanistan is submitting a periodic report on 
implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(ICESCR). According to the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission&#8217;s (AIHRC) 
second report on economic, social and cultural rights, published in August 2007, the Government 
is failing to meet its minimum core obligations under ICESCR. The Afghanistan Human 
Development Report 2007 (AHDR) confirms that the Government continues to struggle to 
deliver essential services consistently to rural, urban and remote areas and to spur development 
of the official economy, which is critical to promoting these rights.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>6. One consequence of the limited progress in ensuring reliable access to safe drinking water, 
food, health care, education and sanitation is that Afghanistan continues to suffer from high 
mortality rates across all segments of the population. The average life expectancy in Afghanistan 
is 43.3 years for women and 43.4 years for men.  
</p>
<p>7. Despite some progress, the AIHRC found that provision of and access to adequate health 
care, particularly for women and children, remains a serious concern. Afghanistan&#8217;s under-five 
and maternal mortality rates are amongst the highest in the world at 257 per 1,000 live births and 
1,600 deaths per 100,000 live births, respectively. The maternal mortality rate stems from 
insufficient awareness and access to prenatal care (14.3 per cent receive such care) and to skilled 
attendants during childbirth (12 per cent receive this care). While immunization programmes 
have increased recently, one third of children do not receive vaccinations against tuberculosis. At 
the same time, although its child mortality rate is the third highest globally, Afghanistan has 
managed to reduce its child mortality rate by 25 per cent since 2001. This reduction illustrates 
the positive effects in some sectors of concentrated efforts at the local level to realize social 
rights. 
</p>
<p>8. Health is also affected by access to sanitation, safe drinking water, food, and education. 
AHDR reports that the Government remains unable to ensure reliable and equal access to these, 
particularly to safe drinking water. Urban households (64 per cent) are about three times more 
likely to enjoy safe drinking water than rural households (26 per cent). Only 2.6 million Afghans 
have access to safe sanitation. 
</p>
<p>9. Government has improved children&#8217;s access to formal education. Ministry of Education 
statistics for the second half of 2007 show more than 5.6 million children enrolled in schools, 
compared to a little more than 1 million five years ago. More than 35 per cent of these students 
are girls. Despite this progress, half of Afghan children - predominantly girls - still do not attend 
school and Afghanistan continues to suffer from a 72 per cent adult illiteracy rate, with the 
lowest female literacy rate in the world, estimated at between 10-19 per cent. Low school 
attendance and high dropout rate of girls can be attributed largely to traditional perceptions, 
poverty, lack of facilities and transportation in remote areas, and security concerns. Early 
marriage also tends to deprive girls of the opportunity to receive secondary education. Poverty 
also means that children drop out to work, often in dangerous, exploitative or hazardous 
conditions. 
</p>
<p>10. Afghanistan, the fifth poorest country in the world according to ADHR, continues to 
struggle to tackle poverty. AIHRC reported that 60.3 per cent of interviewees earned less than 
one United States dollar per day - the World Bank&#8217;s benchmark for &#8220;absolute poverty&#8221;. 
Economic vulnerability and widespread poverty most severely impact upon women, children, the 
disabled, elderly, and the landless, and are significant factors in the deterioration of the security 
situation throughout the country. It also generates economic migrants, as evidenced most visibly 
in the deportation by the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2007 of more than 360,000 such persons 
back to Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p>11. The Afghan economy remains dependent on international aid and is held back in part by 
the inability of the Government to protect property rights. AIHRC reports illicit land seizures, 
particularly in rural areas, among the most prevalent human rights violations. According to 
UNAMA, difficulties in resolving disputes over land persist because of lack of coherent legal </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>framework, policy, administration, and enforcement. Given the often volatile nature of property 
disputes, failure to address the issue not only threatens security, but also undermines the rule of 
law and economic development. Government must take concrete measures to address 
deficiencies in the protection and administration of property rights, building upon constructive 
elements of traditional mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>12. The economic, social and political consequences of the illicit narcotics trade, which is said 
to account for almost 50 per cent of Afghanistan&#8217;s gross domestic product (GDP), hamper the 
Government&#8217;s ability to promote and protect economic and social rights. The consequent 
land-grabbing, subversion of rule of law and insecurity caused by the illicit narcotics trade 
further undermine the Government&#8217;s ability to deliver services and implement development 
programming. 
</p>
<p>13. During my mission to Afghanistan, I emphasized the need for an integrated approach to 
human rights encompassing civil and political rights as well as economic, social and cultural 
rights. Respecting the right to development is critical to progress, and requires the participation 
of the most vulnerable groups in the development process on the fundamental basis of equality. I 
strongly call for such an approach to be reflected in the final Afghanistan National Development 
Strategy (ANDS). 
</p>
<p><b>II.  DISCRIMINATION 
</b></p>
<p>14. Although the Constitution formally recognizes equality and the principle of 
non-discrimination, in reality discriminatory practices based on sex, religion, ethnic, tribal, 
family and political affiliation exist throughout Afghanistan. Discrimination against women and 
girls remains pervasive, ingrained and extremely deleterious. Other forms of discrimination, 
while present, cannot be fully analysed due to absence of systematic data.  
</p>
<p>15. Women and girls in Afghanistan have continued to make gains in the workplace, education 
and government, but progress remains tentative, with social, political and economic 
discrimination against women still pervasive. With the Government beginning to implement 
projects taking into account gender, its current reliance on the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs to 
tackle women&#8217;s issues must shift to obliging each element of government to promote women&#8217;s 
rights.  
</p>
<p>16. Women&#8217;s continued exclusion from formal and informal public policy and 
decision-making processes (women hold only 9 per cent of formal positions, well below the 
international benchmark of 30 per cent) deprives them of the necessary tools to advance 
women&#8217;s rights. The Minister for Women&#8217;s Affairs is the only female Minister in the 
Government, down from three female Ministers in 2005. There is no female Supreme Court 
justice. Women currently comprise 26 per cent of the overall civil service, although a significant 
proportion of these derive from the Minister for Women&#8217;s Affairs staff. Women account for 
approximately 5 per cent of prosecutors and judges, and only 0.4 per cent of the police force. To 
compound matters, women serving in the Government, particularly in sensitive positions such as 
provincial heads of the Minister for Women&#8217;s Affairs and in the police, frequently are subject to 
threats, intimidation and sometimes murder.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>17. The President&#8217;s support for the campaign against gender violence is encouraging and 
hopefully will be matched by actions. Just as critical are the President&#8217;s endorsement of the 
National Action Plan for Women in Afghanistan (NAPWA) and his active support for its 
realization.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Violence against women and discrimination in the criminal justice system 
</b>18. High levels of violence against women and girls remain of grave concern. UNAMA, 
AIHRC and the Minister for Women&#8217;s Affairs received more than 2,000 cases in 2007, likely 
only a fraction of cases due to limited access and awareness. 
</p>
<p>19. The caseload confirms that harmful customary practices such as honour killings, <i>ba&#8217;ad</i> (the 
exchange of girls to settle disputes), trafficking in women, under-aged and forced marriages and 
severe domestic violence continue. Of 450 cases received by UNAMA between January and 
September 2007, a large proportion involves young women or girls who claim forced 
engagement or marriage coupled with domestic violence. Forced couplings often are financially 
motivated, with the bride-price alleviating debt or immediate economic hardship of the bride&#8217;s 
family. Between 40 and 57 per cent of all marriages involve girls under the age of 16.  
</p>
<p>20.  In most documented cases, the perpetrators of violence against women are close family 
members though non-family members known to the victim, or State officials, in many cases 
policemen, also are perpetrators. Many cases involve more than one perpetrator, or a series of 
violations, often in connection with attempts of the victims to seek protection or redress.  
</p>
<p>21. The judicial and law enforcement systems still fail to protect and provide justice to women. 
This emanates from entrenched cultural attitudes and practices, the absence of female lawyers 
and judges, and the inability of many women to physically access the judicial system without a 
male escort. This amplifies rights issues caused by the weak judiciary. The few women lawyers, 
prosecutors and judges in the legal system frequently suffer from discrimination and 
marginalization by male colleagues. Social practices relegating women to the home, particularly 
in remote areas, often restrict them from joining the police and judiciary, rendering it difficult to 
increase female representation. 
</p>
<p>22. Women also continue to be criminalized unfairly. Victims, particularly of sexual offences, 
often find themselves accused and detained illegally on charges of immorality. An alarming 
number of women are detained for allegedly &#8220;running away&#8221; (elopement), which is not a crime 
under the Criminal Code, or for <i>zina</i> (adultery) as to which the penal provisions are ambiguous. 
Reportedly, in this context, women and girls are occasionally convicted of non-existent offences 
in order to provide justification for their detention.  
23. These failures lead to attempts to resolve violence against women cases by non-judicial 
means, which may not adequately protect the victim. Generally, where the police&#8217;s Family 
Response Unit, the Department of Women&#8217;s Affairs, or a traditional council of elders intervenes, 
the victim is usually returned to her husband&#8217;s or parents&#8217; home with a written undertaking from 
the perpetrator that he will desist from further abusive action. Putting aside the absence of 
remedy in respect of abuse suffered, without adequate monitoring, it is unclear if these 
undertakings as to conduct in the future are honoured. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  ARMED CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE 
</b></p>
<p>24. Armed conflict in Afghanistan has intensified significantly throughout 2007. The Southern, 
South-Eastern and Eastern regions of the country have seen regular fighting, but violence has 
also increased notably in other areas, including in the North-Eastern, Western and Central 
regions. The impact of the conflict on civilians, including non-combatant casualties, destruction 
of civilian property, loss of livelihoods, displacement, and severe limitations or complete denial 
of access to essential services, has become a pre-eminent concern. When UNAMA&#8217;s mandate 
was renewed in March 2007, an explicit mandate was given to it to monitor the situation of 
civilians affected by the conflict. Continued cooperation has been sought and maintained with 
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Afghan 
national forces to ensure they are cognizant of their responsibilities under international 
humanitarian and human rights law and that they also understand and respect the United Nations 
role to investigate impartially and independently cases involving civilian casualties. Similar 
efforts must also be made with anti-Government elements (AGEs) that are party to the armed 
conflict. 
</p>
<p>25. Operations by international and national security forces and AGEs have killed and injured 
large numbers of non-combatants. In 2007, almost 1,500 Afghan civilians were killed as a result 
of such operations. The death of non-combatants amounts to a violation of international 
humanitarian law unless rules of proportionality, necessity and targeting are fully respected. 
Thus, while not all civilian deaths during the reporting period are in violation of international 
humanitarian law, serious violations can be substantiated in several incidents. 
</p>
<p>26. Protection of civilians was a key focus of my Afghanistan mission. In meetings with both 
national and international authorities and in press statements, I stressed the need for all sides of 
the conflict to strictly respect human rights and international humanitarian law principles. I also 
emphasized that certain international and Afghan military operations resulting in civilian 
casualties, even if they are not, strictly speaking, in breach of international law, are nonetheless 
liable to erode support amongst Afghans for the Government and the international military 
presence, as well as public support abroad in contributing States, for continued international 
military engagement in Afghanistan. To help bridge the distance between individual and victims 
and those who bear responsibility, forces involved in such incidents need to be more responsive 
and accessible to victims and their families and communities, and ensure appropriate and 
comprehensive redress. Achieving this requires a systematized and consistent approach to 
investigation of incidents and to compensation, with the latter ideally administered by a 
competent, impartial third-party backed by a trust fund.  
</p>
<p>27. Another concern is that the Afghan National Police (ANP), instead of being able to focus 
on their civilian law-enforcement duties, frequently are compelled to engage in combat and, 
when attacked, may be left without military support for a prolonged period of time. ANP also are 
being targeted by anti-governmental elements through suicide attacks, improvised explosive 
devises (IEDs) and abductions. The Ministry of Interior registered around 900 insurgency-related 
deaths of police officers in the last nine months of 2007, which is significantly higher than the 
number of Afghan army casualties in the same period. ANP are not mandated, trained or </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>equipped for such a role and are therefore more susceptible to casualties. Combat engagement by 
the police moreover hampers achieving the long-term goal of developing a strong, responsive 
civilian police force dedicated to law enforcement and points to a serious security gap that needs 
to be filled by alternative mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Attacks by anti-Government elements (AGEs) 
</b>28. AGE attacks accounted for over half the non-combatant casualties registered by UNAMA 
in 2007. Of particular concern are tactics that directly target Afghan civilians, in clear breach of 
basic norms of international humanitarian law. AGEs frequently issue threats and carry out direct 
attacks against civilians, including children, perceived to be cooperating with the Government 
and its international supporters. Regular and well-publicized hangings and beheadings of alleged 
&#8220;spies&#8221; in conflict areas terrorize the civilian population and create a feeling of insecurity. 
Consequently, in some areas of the country, fear of reprisals has notably reduced active support 
for the Government.  
</p>
<p>29. UNAMA monitoring shows that suicide attacks and IEDs detonated in public areas by 
AGEs have caused a high number of civilian casualties. While most of these attacks were 
directed primarily against military or government targets, many were carried out in crowded 
civilian areas, causing extensive civilian casualties. Such attacks are in violation of international 
humanitarian law if they inherently cannot discriminate between the legitimate military target 
and non-combatants. 
</p>
<p>30. Furthermore, the perpetrators of suicide bombings and other armed attacks tend to use 
perfidious or other tactics that violate international humanitarian law. They do not usually 
distinguish themselves from ordinary civilians, and in some cases actively use civilian guise. 
AGEs also violated international humanitarian law repeatedly when they carried out operations 
from inside civilian locations and used non-combatants as human shields. Those responsible 
should be held to account for such crimes.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Operations by international and national security forces 
</b></p>
<p>31. Combat operations by national and international security forces have led to almost half of 
the non-combatant casualties recorded by UNAMA in 2007. Although Afghan national and 
international forces have increased efforts to minimize harm to non-combatants, there remain 
allegations of the use of disproportionate force in some cases, particularly in relation to defensive 
air strikes and force-protection incidents. Force-protection incidents are those in which military 
forces fire at individuals who come too close to military convoys or fail to follow instructions at 
checkpoints. Some AGE tactics, which constitute violations of international humanitarian law, 
have contributed to development of these force-protection protocols and other defensive tactics. 
Even if the AGE tactics are in breach of international humanitarian law, this does not absolve 
military forces of their own responsibility to avoid or at least minimize harm to civilians and 
their property. There also have been a few incidents in which serious misconduct by international 
and national security forces could be substantiated.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>32. Concern has been repeatedly expressed regarding house searches by Afghan national and 
international forces, with allegations ranging from cultural insensitivity to excessive use of force 
to gain entry into compounds and potentially serious misconduct leading to the loss of life. 
Communities throughout conflict regions have reported particular concerns about night-time 
raids. Civilian casualties resulting from operations conducted by international forces have 
generated outrage amongst the population in affected areas and several demonstrations have 
taken place, most notably in the Eastern region. Killings of civilians by AGEs have tended not to 
result in similar public reaction. Concerns have also been expressed about cases of alleged 
mistreatment and prolonged arbitrary detention of some persons detained by international forces. 
</p>
<p>33. Throughout 2007, the Afghan Government and international military forces have adjusted 
tactics in response to many of the above concerns, and have supported internal and external 
independent investigations and reviews, including establishing structures in collaboration with 
UNAMA to facilitate information-sharing and remedial action. While positive, the effectiveness 
of these initiatives still needs to be assessed more fully. Notably, many of these developments 
resulted from a workshop on the protection of civilians held in August led by the United Nations 
in collaboration with AIHRC. Senior ISAF officials participated in this workshop which 
reviewed the most pressing protection challenges and discussed developing a collaborative 
protection framework. The lack of access to other parties to the conflict, however, is a continuing 
concern. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Humanitarian access 
</b></p>
<p>34. Humanitarian access has become increasingly impaired in conflict-affected areas. At 
least 78 districts are now rated by the United Nations as extreme risk areas, and are therefore 
inaccessible to United Nations agencies. According to the Afghanistan NGO Security Office 
(ANSO), the number of attacks against the personnel and property of non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and humanitarian workers in 2007 is the highest since 2001. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>35. There are 120,000 long-term displaced people in Afghanistan. In 2007, the Government 
estimated that approximately 37,000 individuals were displaced as a result of growing insecurity 
and recent violence linked to armed conflict in their areas of origin. While reports indicate that 
the nature of recent displacement is temporary, in some cases, there has been limited or no 
access to displaced populations. The operational capability of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is now limited to approximately 55 per cent of the 
country. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>36. Many children have been victimized in AGE attacks, sometimes as direct targets, and in 
military operations. Attacks against schools continue, threatening students and teachers. The 
United Nations has also documented high-profile cases in which children are used to perpetrate 
attacks and as human shields in blatant breach of international human rights and humanitarian 
law. In the light of Security Council resolution 1612 (2005), a task force on children in armed 
conflict is being set up in Afghanistan. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  IMPUNITY 
</b></p>
<p>37. Re-establishing the rule of law, and ending impunity for past and present crimes, remains a 
key to securing peace and stability in Afghanistan. Individuals suspected of committing grave 
violations of human rights, including war crimes, have not been held to account. Some continue 
to hold high-ranking positions of authority, fundamentally compromising the confidence of the 
population in the integrity of its Government. 
</p>
<p>38. Impunity for current crimes also remains a problem. In two major incidents, senior 
government officials have not been held to account for potentially serious violations despite 
substantial evidence suggesting their culpability.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Transitional justice 
</b>39. During my mission, I reminded all stakeholders that transitional justice is a multifaceted 
process which focuses on the victims&#8217; right to truth, compensation and rehabilitation. It should 
not be reduced to the single, though obviously important, issue of prosecution of those with 
responsibility for past crimes. While the commitment to ensure individual criminal 
accountability remains vital, there must also be a recommitment by the Government and the 
international community to advance the broader dimensions of the transitional justice agenda.  
40. In response to a Human Rights Watch report republished in December 2006 in which the 
names of suspected war criminals and violators of human rights holding seats in the Wolesi Jirga 
(Lower House of Parliament) were listed, the Wolesi Jirga and the Meshrano Jirga (the Upper 
House of Parliament) passed the &#8220;National Reconciliation Charter&#8221; by a majority vote. Under 
this Charter all political parties and other belligerent groups associated with the two and a half 
decades of conflict in Afghanistan would be granted full immunity from prosecution. It called on 
all parties, including present AGEs, to strive towards national reconciliation and offered to grant 
immunity from prosecution to all those endorsing the process. Refusing to sign the Charter, 
President Karzai stressed that under Islamic principles he was constitutionally bound to respect 
the principle that only the victims of human rights violations had the right to forgive the 
perpetrators. I have since repeatedly expressed my concern that this Charter could lead to past 
serious human rights violations going unpunished and that it would undermine the process 
towards securing long-term peace and construction of durable institutions of the Government.  
</p>
<p>41. In general, both national and international efforts to address past abuses have been limited 
and are hampered by growing hostility to the transitional justice process. The deadlines for the 
benchmarks established under the Action Plan for Peace, Reconciliation and Justice have mostly 
passed without any significant progress being achieved, thus putting compliance with the 
envisaged overall time frame for the Action Plan in serious doubt. The only benchmark on which 
substantial steps were taken was the establishment of a &#8220;clear and transparent national 
appointments mechanism for all senior level appointments&#8221;. The Senior Appointments Panel was 
set up by September 2006 and showed initial promise. Rules of procedure were adopted in 
October 2007, but these did not establish clear operational guidelines nor provide guarantees or 
requirements for impartiality or independence.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>42. There are encouraging signs that civil society actors are beginning to mobilize on 
transitional justice. Following the passage of the Charter through the houses of Parliament, civil 
society actors issued a resolution condemning any attempt by the Parliament to grant amnesty to 
persons who had committed human rights violations. On 10 December 2007, the day officially 
designated by the President as National Remembrance Day, demonstrations took place in front 
of the premises of AIHRC, UNAMA and the President&#8217;s Office by a group of 350 women 
representing the mothers of war victims. They demanded that the Government and other relevant 
actors take action to uncover the fate of the disappeared and denounced the Parliament&#8217;s 
adoption of the Charter. 
</p>
<p>43. According to AIHRC, 84 mass grave sites have been identified throughout the country. 
However, there is currently no effective system of verification or documentation of the sites or 
witness testimonies, nor is there forensic capacity to investigate the graves, identify victims and 
preserve evidence for possible future criminal proceedings. There is no security in place to 
protect alleged gravesites and some, such as those in Faizabad and Dasht-i-Chamtala, have been 
destroyed through uncontrolled digging. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Impunity for current crimes and general lack of accountability 
</b></p>
<p>44. Drug-related criminal gangs, warlords and AGEs continue to pose serious threats to 
security and the rule of law. UNAMA received several complaints concerning police failure to 
conduct proper investigations or to act impartially and independently. There continue to be 
allegations of police corruption leading to the release of suspects without proper investigation or 
charges being laid, as well as cases where police are alleged to have failed to act when 
confronted with traditional practices or powerful local interests. 
</p>
<p>45. Both a demonstration in Sheberghan in May and a suicide bombing in Baghlan in 
November resulted in the bodyguards of government officials opening fire on unarmed civilians, 
killing and injuring scores of people on both occasions. While the Government commendably 
initiated independent investigations into both incidents, neither has made any substantive 
findings public. Further, even in the face of a detailed AIHRC report documenting serious 
wrongdoing by the governor in the Sheberghan case, the Government has taken no action to 
ensure his accountability.  
</p>
<p><b>V.  DEFICITS IN DEMOCRACY 
</b></p>
<p>46. Significant achievements in democratic institution-building have so far happened primarily 
in government structures. Institutions such as the Provincial Councils and Parliament need 
continued support, including technical assistance in integrating human rights in their legislative 
agendas. However, civil society groups, which play a critical role in bridging the gap between 
Government and the Afghan public, remain underdeveloped and need more sustained and 
generous support from the international community. This role becomes particularly important as 
the country moves towards an electoral year in 2009.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>47. A new media law adopted by both houses of Parliament was rejected by President Karzai 
at the end of 2007. The law generally represents an important step forward, but contains 
provisions which may be used or interpreted in a manner that would breach international 
standards concerning freedom of expression. For example, it contains broad provisions requiring 
freedom of expression to be in accordance with Islamic principles, banning published materials 
that are deemed immoral, and requiring prior approval for distribution of publications by 
international and intergovernmental agencies. These provisions are not clearly defined and are 
open to diverse interpretations which give rise to rule-of-law concerns as to possibilities for 
arbitrary censorship.  
</p>
<p>48. The media, which has flourished in recent years, faced increased levels of violence and 
serious threats in 2007. Numerous complaints have been received concerning violent attacks 
against journalists across the country with 20 verified cases reported in the Central and the 
Eastern regions alone. Two of these cases concerned the murder of female journalists. In most 
cases, no action was taken by the relevant authorities. 
</p>
<p>49. In June 2007, the National Directorate of Security (NDS) distributed to Afghan journalists 
a list of restrictions intended to curtail their reporting of the deteriorating security situation. The 
Ministry of Information and Culture also issued a circular in November 2007, asking all 
electronic media to refrain from broadcasting content that might disturb the public.  
</p>
<p><b>VI.  INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY 
</b></p>
<p>50. Particularly at the district level, the Government&#8217;s capacity to deliver essential services, 
law enforcement, justice and security requires significant additional attention. Corruption, 
insecurity and inadequacy of legal and regulatory frameworks, qualified personnel and physical 
infrastructure severely undermine executive, judicial and law enforcement institutions&#8217; 
functionality and promotion of the rule of law, and in turn diminish confidence in Government. 
These dynamics also hamper access to Government by civil society. 
</p>
<p>51. This lack of capacity has encouraged utilization of alternative dispute resolution and 
security mechanisms. The traditional justice system remains strong and generally responsive, 
however it can be problematic, particularly its accessibility to and treatment of women and other 
vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p>52. In the security sector, private security companies (PSCs) have grown rapidly in recent 
years, with up to 10,000 armed and organized employees in Kabul alone. Until now, PSCs have 
operated in Afghanistan with ad hoc registration or under arrangement with the Ministry of 
Interior. Legal accountability for human rights violations committed by these employees 
continues to remain unclear. 
</p>
<p>53. To meet its human rights obligations, the Government of Afghanistan needs to more 
actively integrate human rights considerations into its analysis, policy, and programming. The 
ANDS process provides a unique opportunity to do so and ensure institutions&#8217; capacities to fulfil </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>obligations are developed. Encouragingly, the Ministry of Justice has agreed to take up the 
mantle as lead agency in respect of human rights vis-&#224;-vis the ANDS process and it should be 
supported by both the Government and international community.  
</p>
<p>54. Within ANDS, human rights have been subsumed under governance and public 
administrative reform rather than being treated as a separate cross-cutting sector. Of particular 
concern is that some authorities critical to realizing human rights and transitional justice-related 
benchmarks, such as the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Interior, the 
Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development and the Ministry of 
Culture and Information, were not listed as responsible for implementing the sector strategy.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Administration of justice 
</b>55. The Afghan justice system still struggles. A conference on rule of law in Afghanistan, held 
in Rome on 2 and 3 July 2007, achieved greater donor commitment and coherence of reform 
efforts. After the conference, the national justice sector strategy and national justice programme 
were finalized. Their implementation is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2008. These 
commitments build upon discussions about key problems facing the Afghan justice system, 
including low salaries; inadequate facilities for courts and prosecutors; prisons which fail to meet 
internationally accepted standards; lack of formal training and education of judicial personnel; 
and inadequate access to basic resources, including copies of Afghan laws.  
</p>
<p>56. Many of these problems as well as others were confirmed by two monitoring programmes, 
the joint AIHRC-UNAMA Arbitrary Detention Verification Campaign (ADVC) and UNAMA&#8217;s 
Legal System Observation Project (LSOP), which also enjoyed OHCHR technical support. 
ADVC monitored more than 1,100 detentions nationwide between November 2006 and 
September 2007, while LSOP observed 110 criminal proceedings in five regions between March 
and June 2007. They both confirmed widespread arbitrary and illegal detentions often resulting 
from ineffective judicial and law enforcement institutions, discriminatory and illegal practices 
and the absence of oversight and accountability mechanisms. While there are allegations of 
prolonged and arbitrary detention in non-Afghan run facilities, the campaigns did not cover these 
facilities. It is hoped that UNAMA and AIHRC will be granted access to them promptly and 
unrestrictedly. 
</p>
<p>57. Specifically, law enforcement and judicial officials continue to detain and convict people 
on arbitrary grounds for customary practices, breach of sharia law (see chapter II above) and 
civil disputes, and pressure suspects to surrender. Detainees are rarely informed of their rights or 
given access to legal counsel, and few defence lawyers mount active defences.  
</p>
<p>58. In fact, the right to legal representation is systematically misunderstood and denied by the 
judiciary in criminal cases. While the absence of a traditional legal representation for accused 
persons or suspects is likely the cause, the effect is to erode rights protections. One consequence 
of the broad denial of legal counsel during interrogation is that reports of torture and ill-treatment 
of detainees and prisoners continue. Less than one quarter of those interviewed, though, claimed 
to have been ill-treated or tortured while in detention. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>59. Another effect is that, despite relevant provisions in the Afghan Interim Criminal 
Procedure Code and ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR), defence lawyers are given inadequate or no notice of hearings, and are often criticized 
or intimidated by judges, prosecutors and police for defending their clients. The principle of 
presumption of innocence is also not systematically respected. Courts convict without providing 
defendants the opportunity to challenge evidence, using evidence such as police reports and 
witness statements. Encouragingly, the Advocates Law, which establishes the Afghan Bar 
Association and strengthens legal aid, was passed recently. I hope that, with its passage, rights 
protection will improve in both the criminal and civil systems.  
</p>
<p>60. Prosecutors and the courts systematically breach legal time limits leading to widespread 
illegal detention. Significant numbers of cases are backlogged for months, sometimes years, at 
the Appeals and Supreme Courts. Reasons for these delays include active disregard for or 
ignorance of legal time limits, and under-resourcing. Breach of time limits balloons the 
population in detention centres. With the judiciary unable to deal with those arrested 
expeditiously, 50 per cent of persons in detention centres are awaiting trial. Absence of model 
bail rules also contribute to an excessive population of pretrial detainees.  
</p>
<p>61. Overall, the population of detention centres has increased exponentially. As of 
March 2007, 10,400 detainees and prisoners were incarcerated; slightly more than 300 were 
female. In 2001, only 600 people were in detention, though by March 2005 5,500 people were 
in detention.  
</p>
<p>62. Many detention centres in Afghanistan still fail to meet minimum internationally accepted 
standards for condition of detention. In general, conditions are worse for women than for men. 
Women in detention often have a poorer level of food, clothing, heating and health care. Despite 
being required by law, adequate separate housing for female detainees and prisoners with 
children remains an issue, with the number of children accompanying their mothers almost equal 
to the total number of females in detention. Where there are no detention facilities for women, 
normally at the district level, women are often detained in private homes, under ill-defined 
custodial arrangements where they are vulnerable to abuse. 
</p>
<p>63. Private homes or facilities also continue to be used to detain parties in an effort to settle 
private disputes rather than seeking redress from the formal law enforcement and justice 
systems. During 2007, in Spinghar district of Nangarhar alone there were 10 reported cases of 
such private detentions related to the narcotics trade. Other verified cases of detention of 
individuals in private prisons include those detained for personal disputes, disputes over 
property, timber, gems, vehicles and other personal property. Powerful tribal elders and 
commanders often are linked to private detention with local authorities frequently acquiescing, 
failing to take action or at most limiting their intervention in securing the release of the persons 
detained.  
</p>
<p>64. The application of the death penalty in Afghanistan is of grave concern. 
On 7 October 2007, the Government ended an unofficial three-year moratorium by carrying 
out death sentences against 15 men. The men were executed by firing squad following the 
constitutionally required presidential endorsement. According to witnesses interviewed by 
UNAMA, the inmates were denied last religious rites, had their hands and feet tied, and some 
were reportedly shot seven or eight times, including in the head. The executions were carried out </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>secretly and their relatives were not informed. None of the 15 appeared to have had a fair trial 
and strong doubts exist concerning the guilt of at least 4 of them. All these elements are 
inconsistent with Afghanistan&#8217;s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. In my discussion with the President I raised my deep concern regarding this 
matter and I hope that the Government will remain within the emerging international consensus 
on this issue, reflected most recently by the General Assembly&#8217;s adoption of a call for a general 
moratorium on the death penalty, and put a halt to future executions. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Security sector 
</b></p>
<p>65. Effective rule of law requires a mechanism to hold the National Directorate of Security 
accountable for its actions, while still respecting the complex demands of protecting domestic 
security. NDS conducts intelligence gathering, surveillance, arrest, detention and prosecution of 
those suspected of crimes against national security. Unlike the police force, which is legally 
mandated to identify crimes and arrest suspects, NDS operates under a presidential decree, which 
has not yet been made public. Apparently accountable only to the President, NDS has not been 
the object of reforms. NDS also operates detention centres without adequate judicial oversight 
with only sporadic access granted to independent monitoring bodies. UNAMA and AIHRC 
receive reports of torture, illegal and arbitrary arrests and incommunicado detentions by NDS. 
I raised these concerns with relevant authorities during my mission, and I am encouraged by 
their assurances that UNAMA will be given free and unrestricted access to NDS facilities, and 
that it will be also advised of the identities of those detained by NDS so that families of the 
detainees can be duly informed. I am also pleased by the Government&#8217;s decision to investigate 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment of detainees and look forward to the publication of its 
findings. 
</p>
<p>66. Despite some progress, there are concerns about the Ministry of the Interior and the 
Afghan National Police&#8217;s effectiveness and respect for human rights, including widespread 
allegations of corruption and factionalism at central, provincial and district levels. I am 
encouraged by the Ministry of Interior&#8217;s development of a Human Rights Unit and look forward 
to its increasing effectiveness and integration in the coming year.  
</p>
<p>67. The pay and rank reform, which included a merit-based selection process, has resulted in 
the removal of some human rights offenders from positions in the Ministry of the Interior and the 
police. The vetting process, however, failed to fully observe Department of Peacekeeping 
Operations policy and OHCHR criteria for vetting of public officials, particularly on 
transparency, due process and rights to appeal or for judicial review. Further, recommendations 
by the international community for removal of officers based on evidence were in many cases 
ignored or overturned by senior government officials.  
</p>
<p>68. To date, activities of both Afghan and international PSCs, now numbering more than 60 
have been largely unregulated. With PSCs increasingly being drawn into military-type activities 
when operating in volatile areas, the need to improve regulation has been recognized by 
authorities. The 6 November 2007 suicide-bombing in Baghlan province, in which 
approximately 70 people were killed and more than 110 injured, vividly illustrated why. An 
official investigation suggested that, following the explosion, individually hired bodyguards </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>indiscriminately opened fire approximately for five minutes, adding to the number of casualties. 
Many PSCs have upgraded equipment since an October 2007 incident in Kandahar in which a 
PSC was caught in a six-hour battle, causing casualties on both sides. A draft regulation on PSCs 
was discussed throughout 2007 by involved government institutions and international actors, but 
had yet to be finalized as of December 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  National human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>69. AIHRC remains an effective and key national partner in the promotion and protection of 
human rights in Afghanistan. It was recently recommended to be accredited with status &#8220;A&#8221; by 
the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights. In addition to gaining international recognition, this accreditation 
accords AIHRC participatory and speaking rights in United Nations human rights forums. The 
subcommittee responsible for accreditation applications however noted with concern that 
funding from external sources, such as from donors, should not compose the core funding of 
AIHRC and that it is the responsibility of the State to set aside a minimum allocation in the 
national budget. 
</p>
<p>70. AIHRC often finds itself in a difficult balancing act on contentious issues, not simply to 
avoid risking direct attacks, but to preserve its own space for action. The worsening security 
situation has restricted access by AIHRC staff in conflict-affected areas, and its staff members 
continued to face intimidation. Hostility by some Parliamentarians towards the work of AIHRC 
and some of its members led to the passing of amendments to the Law on the Structure of 
Government, which require, inter alia, heads of all independent commissions including AIHRC 
to be appointed only after receiving a vote of confidence by the Wolesi Jirga. In this regard, the 
International Coordinating Committee stressed the need for amendments to the law not to be 
retroactively applied so as to ensure that AIHRC&#8217;s independence and effectiveness are preserved, 
both in reality and in appearance. 
</p>
<p>71. To strengthen its capacity in the field of international humanitarian law and the protection 
of civilians, the AIHRC, with support of UNAMA, established a new Special Investigations 
Team (SIT). This investigations team is responsible for supervising, coordinating and analysing 
AIHRC&#8217;s activities related to the most serious conflict-related violations of international 
humanitarian law and human rights law, as well as for conducting the investigation of and 
reporting on emblematic cases. UNAMA has seconded an adviser for SIT&#8217;s first year.  
</p>
<p><b>VII.  TECHNICAL COOPERATION 
</b></p>
<p>72. In 2007, OHCHR funded several activities by UNAMA Human Rights Officers in the 
regions, including to legal aid clinics, workshops and trainings aimed at raising human rights 
awareness. Several events and activities were organized in conjunction with Peace Day 
celebrations on 21 September and Human Rights Day on 10 December. This year Human Rights 
and Remembrance Day was marked by victims and their families, women&#8217;s groups, and the 
media as a day of action to demand justice for past violations. President Karzai acknowledged </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the problems associated with the role and influence of &#8220;warlords&#8221; in the Government and the 
weakness of institutions. At the provincial level, human rights activists, government authorities, 
UNAMA and AIHRC spoke about the compatibility of human rights and women&#8217;s rights with 
Islam.  
</p>
<p>73. The human rights treaty reporting project based in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs 
supported by OHCHR, UNAMA, UNDP and the Canadian International Development Agency 
(CIDA) successfully produced a Common Core Document for submission to the United Nations 
treaty bodies. The ICESCR country report also is slated for completion in January 2008. 
OHCHR is currently exploring options for a second phase of the project in 2008.  
</p><p>74. The joint project between OHCHR and the United Nations Development Fund for Women 
(UNIFEM) aimed at establishing referral centres for women in two regions, as well as between 
OHCHR and the UNDP National Programme on Action for Disability (NPAD) on media 
programming, concluded at the end of 2007. Another initiative intended to be implemented by 
several United Nations agencies in 2007, designed to raise awareness of economic and social 
rights among the rural population in two regions, has now been postponed until 2008. 
</p>
<p>75. In July 2007, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) followed up its previous mission by 
jointly undertaking with UNAMA and the Ministry of the Interior&#8217;s Criminal Investigation 
Department (CID), a preliminary assessment of a mass grave discovered in Dasht-i-Chamtala in 
the north-west outskirts of Kabul, and an assessment of the overall situation regarding mass 
graves in Afghanistan. As a result of the visit, OHCHR, CID and PHR signed a tripartite 
agreement providing for long-term cooperation in building CID&#8217;s forensic technical capacity. 
The partnership established by the agreement should support the training of CID in forensic 
investigations and the development of a coherent approach to the investigation, documentation 
and securing of mass graves. 
</p>
<p>76. OHCHR is also providing technical support to the Government with the appointment in 
June 2007 of an adviser to help the Ministry of Interior improve the human rights performance of 
the police and of a consultant in October 2007 to assist developing strategies and approaches for 
mainstreaming human rights into the ANDS process. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>77. Throughout 2007, the Government and its international partners have increasingly 
concentrated efforts on military counter-insurgency and security sector reform. There is a 
realization that the conflict cannot be overcome by military means alone, and that an integrated, 
overarching civilian-led strategy is necessary to ensure Afghanistan&#8217;s long-term stability and 
development. It is essential that an integrated strategy effectively addresses the main human 
rights challenges identified in this report - growing insecurity, setbacks in institutional reform, 
persistent poverty and the continued inability of national institutions to effectively deliver 
essential services, including security and justice. It is essential to underscore that the 
Government of Afghanistan is ultimately responsible to uphold its human rights obligations, 
which also were confirmed in its Constitution. The international community&#8217;s responsibility 
is to provide appropriate support and assistance to the Government in fulfilling its commitments. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IX.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> In view of the situation described in this report, I make the following 
recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The international community should ensure that international human rights 
and humanitarian law informs an integrated governance strategy, drawing on the strength 
of traditional and cultural mechanisms, with Afghans firmly in the lead. Doing so requires 
promoting civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights as vital interdependent 
foundations for progress and ensuring outreach to and meaningful participation of civil 
society actors as well as disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. It also requires policy and 
programme decisions which would enable the humanitarian community to regain and 
maintain critical humanitarian space;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) All parties to the conflict in Afghanistan must take further measures to ensure 
greater respect for human rights and international humanitarian law principles and 
thereby enhance protection of civilians. International military forces must be more 
responsive and accessible to families in ensuring redress and this should include a 
systematized and consistent approach to compensation ideally administered by a 
competent third party backed by a trust fund;   
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The international community must nurture and defend civil society and 
freedom of expression. It must commit greater technical and financial support for the 
development of civil society groups, including victim groups, as a critical pillar of 
democratic institution-building. The Government of Afghanistan must reaffirm the 
constructive role of civil society and provide the necessary platform for meaningful public 
discourse. This must be buttressed by concrete efforts to promote the continuing growth of 
the media and protect freedom of expression;   
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Government of Afghanistan, with support from the international 
community, should seize the opportunity provided by the upcoming report on 
Afghanistan&#8217;s compliance with the ICESCR and the ongoing ANDS process to develop 
concrete policy and programme initiatives to strengthen Government&#8217;s delivery of services 
necessary for the enjoyment of social, economic and cultural rights. In this respect, the 
international community should continue to build government capacity to comply with its 
human rights treaty reporting obligations, which will provide key guidance for monitoring 
its implementation as it moves forward; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The Government of Afghanistan and the international community should 
provide the necessary political, technical and financial support for the Ministry of Justice 
as the lead agency with responsibility for monitoring and reporting on State 
implementation of human rights-related benchmarks in the Afghanistan Compact. In this 
regard, the Terms of Reference of the Ministry of Justice as lead agency needs to be 
immediately defined and the Ministry&#8217;s Unit to be created for this purpose promptly 
resourced;    </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (f) The Government of Afghanistan and the international community must 
reinstate women&#8217;s rights at the top of policy and donor agendas. Provision of financial 
support and enactment of concrete policies and programmes aimed at ensuring changes at 
the community level, in partnership with religious leaders, elders and other local leaders as 
well as civil society groups, are required. The President is urged to endorse the National 
Action Plan for Women in Afghanistan (NAPWA), which, together with  the ANDS Gender 
Equity Cross-Cutting Strategy, should be actively supported and mainstreamed into the 
work of the Government. Efforts should be made to reverse marginalization of and combat 
violence against women and ensure that laws and international standards are applied, 
rather than harmful customary practices;    
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) The Government of Afghanistan and the international community must 
recommit to the transitional justice agenda alongside efforts to build the rule of law sector. 
This should include a commitment to advance the broader and victim-centred dimensions 
of transitional justice, such as truth-seeking, compensation and rehabilitation. As part of 
the reform of law enforcement and judicial system, the Government of Afghanistan and the 
international community must focus on raising the accountability of police and judicial 
officials at the district, provincial and central levels, including through the establishment of 
appropriate oversight mechanisms involving key stakeholders. To promote accountability, 
the Government of Afghanistan is urged to publicize the reports, including findings and 
recommendations, of specially constituted commissions tasked to investigate allegations of 
abuse of power;   
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Building on the current tripartite agreement between OHCHR, UNAMA and 
the Ministry of Interior&#8217;s Criminal Investigation Department, the Government of 
Afghanistan, with assistance from the international community, is encouraged to provide a 
clear mandate for forensic investigation experts on the investigation of mass graves related 
to past abuses;   
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) With the international community&#8217;s support, the Afghan National Police must 
fully develop as a civilian law enforcement body and the Government of Afghanistan 
should develop alternative mechanisms to fill security gaps. The Ministries of Justice and 
Interior should continue their cooperation with UNAMA and AIHRC to develop solutions 
to the problems identified in the ADVC and LSOP initiatives, with particular focus on 
preventing arbitrary arrests and detentions, promoting the role of defence counsels, and 
developing judicial capacity to deal with cases in a timely manner;   
 (j) The Government of Afghanistan is urged to promptly commence reforms 
needed within NDS. Reliable and non-supervised access should be granted for AIHRC and 
UNAMA to all detention facilities in Afghanistan so as to assist those running the detention 
centres in complying with international standards and its decree should be made public, 
enabling proper domestic and public scrutiny;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) The Government of Afghanistan, with support of its international partners, is 
urged to take the remaining measures necessary to win full &#8220;A&#8221; accreditation for the </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission by the International Coordinating 
Committee of National Institutions for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights. 
This includes earmarking a minimum allocation in the national budget for AIHRC and 
ensuring policy and legislation are in place to protect AIHRC&#8217;s independence; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) The Government of Afghanistan is strongly urged to reinstate its moratorium 
on the death penalty and join the ever-growing community of States around the world 
which has opted for moratoria on the death penalty, in recognition of the problems and 
difficulties inherent in its application; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) The Government, with the support of the international community, must 
institute concrete efforts to address deficiencies in the system of administration and 
protection of property rights, and in particular should build on traditional mechanisms 
where these can be utilized to ensure the property rights of all affected individuals are 
protected in a fair and just manner.
