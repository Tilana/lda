The Woodlands, Texas — August 2, 2016 — Newfield Exploration Company (NYSE: NFX) today
reported its second quarter 2016 unaudited financial and operating results. Additional
operational details can be found in the Company’s @NFX publication, located on its website.
Newfield plans to host a conference call at 10 a.m. CDT on August 3, 2016. To listen to the call, please visit
Newfield’s website at http://www.newfield.com. To participate in the call, dial 785-830-7977 and enter conference code
4680250 about 10 minutes prior to the scheduled start time.
“Newfield continued its streak of solid operational results across the organization,” said Newfield Chairman Lee K.
Boothby. “We have taken proactive steps to improve our capital structure, refine our asset base, and high-grade our
investments into the Anadarko Basin. The results are evident — lower operating expenses, improving margins in the
face of low commodity prices and the realization of operational efficiencies that we expect to retain in the future.
“Today, we increased our average type curve in STACK by 15% to approximately 1.1 MMBOE gross. This increase is
backed by the drilling of more than 100 wells to date — the largest sample set in the industry. Our well results
continue to improve as we optimize our completions and look for innovative ways to enhance returns in our upcoming
full-field development campaign. We recently closed on our previously announced STACK acquisition and have
allocated additional capital to these assets in the second half of this year. We remain excited about STACK and the
play’s potential to drive our growth in production and reserves for years to come.”
Second Quarter 2016 Financial and Production Summary
For the second quarter, the Company recorded a net loss of $667 million, or $3.36 per share (all per share amounts
are on a diluted basis). The loss was primarily attributable to the following items:
·                  a full-cost ceiling test impairment of $522 million, or $2.63 per share;
·                  unrealized derivative losses of $197 million, or $0.99 per share; and
·                  organizational restructuring and severance costs of $12 million, or $0.06 per share.
After adjusting for these effects, net income for the second quarter would have been $64 million, or $0.32 per share.
Revenues for the second quarter were $381 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $306 million.
Discretionary cash flow from operations was $228 million.
Newfield’s total net production in the second quarter of 2016 was 15.3 MMBOE, comprised of 45% oil, 18% natural
gas liquids and 37% natural gas. Domestic production in the second quarter was 13.7 MMBOE.
2016 Production Guidance and Capital Investments
Newfield again increased expectations for its 2016 production. The increase is related primarily to stronger
performance year-to-date from existing assets and the recently acquired assets in the Anadarko Basin STACK play.
Domestic net production is now expected to be 53 — 54.5 MMBOE. Total Company net production guidance was
raised to 58 — 59.5 (previous forecast: 56 — 58 MMBOE).
The Company’s 2016 capital budget was increased to $700 — $750 million (excludes capitalized interest and direct
internal costs; excludes acquisitions; previous capital range: $625 — $675 million). The increase reflects
approximately $40 million for two STACK pilots (previously disclosed), and approximately $50 million for additional
drilling activities on existing assets and assets associated with recently acquired properties in STACK.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted Net Income (Earnings Stated Without the Effect of Certain Items)
Earnings stated without the effect of certain items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings without the effect of
these items are presented because they affect the comparability of operating results from period to period. In addition,
earnings without the effect of these items are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts.
This measure should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) as defined by generally accepted
accounting principles.
A reconciliation of earnings for the second quarter of 2016 stated without the effect of certain items to net income
(loss) is shown below:

(1) Our effective tax rate is less than 1% due to valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets.
Discretionary Cash Flow from Operations
Discretionary cash flow from operations represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in
operating assets and liabilities and is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas
exploration and production company’s ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or
incur additional debt. This measure should not be considered an alternative to net cash provided by operating
activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles.
