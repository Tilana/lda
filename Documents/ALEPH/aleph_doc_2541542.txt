"NORTHWESTERN MINERAL VENTURES INC.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2005
THE AMOUNTS ARE IN CANADIAN DOLLARS UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED
The following discussion of the financial condition and results of the
operations of Northwestern Mineral Ventures Inc. ("Northwestern" or the
"Company") constitutes management's review of the factors that affected the
Company's financial and operating performance for the three months ended
September 30, 2005. This discussion dated November 21, 2005 should be read in
conjunction with the Company's audited Financial Statements and Notes to the
Financial Statements for periods ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003,
and the interim financial statements for the period July 1, 2005 to September
30, 2005, which have all been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally
accepted accounting principles. These documents along with others published by
the Company are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or from the office of the
Company.
The Company was formed in September 2003 for the purpose of acquiring, exploring
and developing properties prospective for the discovery of precious and base
metals and other minerals. The Company does not have any projects that generate
revenue at this time. The Company's ability to carry out its business plan rests
with its ability to secure equity and other financings.
The Company's common shares trade under the symbol "NWT" on the TSX Venture
Exchange, under the symbol "NMV" on the Berlin and Frankfurt Stock Exchanges,
and under the stock symbol "NWTMF" on the NASD Bulletin Board.
On September 6, 2005, the Company completed a two for one stock split, pursuant
to which each issued common share of Northwestern was subdivided into two common
shares (the "Stock Split"). It is expected that the greater number of
outstanding common shares resulting from the stock split will provide a wider
opportunity for investors to become shareholders of Northwestern and increase
liquidity in Northwestern's listed securities. The stock split was approved at a
special meeting of the shareholders of Northwestern held on August 22, 2005.
OVERVIEW OF PERFORMANCE
The Company is focused on uranium and iron oxide copper gold ("IOCG")
exploration in Canada, the United States and Mexico. The Company has also
applied for two uranium concessions in the Republic of Niger, and is awaiting
final government approval.
BEAR PROJECT, NORTHWEST TERRITORIES, CANADA
Given the significant potential of other properties in its portfolio, the
Company has decided not to proceed further with its Longtom claim, located in
the Bear Province of Canada's Northwest Territories. As such, the September 23,
2003 Option Agreement between Fronteer Development Group Inc. (TSX: FRG) and
Northwestern has been mutually cancelled.
PICACHOS PROJECT, MEXICO
By way of a Letter of Intent dated May 19, 2005, the Company increased its
option interest to 100% in the silver-gold project (the "Picachos Project") in
the Durango state, Mexico. Under the
<PAGE>
terms of the Letter of Intent, Northwestern will be granted the right at
feasibility to acquire RNC Gold Inc.'s ("RNC") remaining 50% stake in the
Picachos Project. The purchase price of $20 million is payable as: $3 million at
the completion of a feasibility study, and then $9 million at the commencement
of commercial production, and then $2 million on each of the first through
fourth anniversaries of the commencement of commercial production. The Company
is also required to issue RNC 100,000 shares (the "NWT Shares") from its
treasury on the execution of a formal agreement. On October 14, 2005,
Northwestern entered into a final Agreement with RNC to formalize the terms of
the Letter of Intent, and the Company issued the NWT Shares to RNC.
The Company has completed its first phase exploration program on Picachos during
the third quarter, 2005. The Company is now evaluating the data, and during the
fourth quarter, the Company expects to prepare a budget and program of $1
million for the second phase of exploration.
If commenced, the second phase exploration program would consist of airborne
magnetometer surveys, and preparing the most advanced targets for underground or
adit development for controlled bulk sampling.
The Durango region of Mexico is a rugged upland area with high relief which
exposes tens to hundred of meters of vertical section through the mineralized
strategraphy. Accordingly, the vein systems can easily be accessed by driving
adits into hillsides to provide underground bulk samples at an early stage of
exploration without relying solely on diamond drilling.
FIRE FLY PROJECT, UTAH, USA
On September 29, 2005, the Company signed a Letter of Intent to acquire 100%
ownership of two uranium-vanadium mines, collectively called the "Firefly
Project", in the La Sal uranium district in southeastern Utah from GeoXplor
Corp.
Under the terms of the Letter of Intent, Northwestern will pay US$5,100,000 to
acquire the Firefly Project from GeoXplor. An initial payment of US$100,000 is
due upon execution of a Formal Agreement incorporating the terms of the Letter
of Intent. Northwestern will make an additional payment of US$5,000,000 to
GeoXplor once a decision is made to commence production on the Firefly Project
or on July 31, 2011, whichever is earlier. In addition, GeoXplor will receive
300,000 common shares from Northwestern's treasury to be released on or prior to
the first, second and third anniversaries of the Execution Date of the Formal
Agreement, which will incorporate the terms of the Letter of Intent. GeoXplor is
also entitled to a 2% net smelter royalty on the production of uranium and
vanadium from the Firefly Project. Northwestern has agreed to spend a minimum of
US$700,000 on the Firefly Project on or prior to the third anniversary of the
Execution Date.
The Company is currently conducting due diligence of the above-noted transaction
and expects to enter into a Formal Agreement with GeoXplor during the fourth
quarter of 2005.
WATERBURY PROJECT, SASKATCHEWAN, CANADA
On November 15, 2005 the Company announced the completion of a Formal Option
Agreement to acquire up to 75% ownership of the Waterbury Project, which
includes nine highly prospective uranium claims in the prolific eastern
Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, Canada, from CanAlaska Ventures Ltd. (TSX-V:
CVV). Waterbury is located within 12 kilometers (seven miles) of the world's
second largest high-grade uranium deposit.
<PAGE>
The Waterbury Project claims total 12,417 hectares (30,683 acres) and are
favorably located in close proximity to several of the world's largest uranium
mines. The Waterbury Project hosts the same unconformity-type uranium
mineralization as found in the nearby uranium mines. Two major fault systems
associated with significant uranium deposits underlie the property area.
Under the terms of the Formal Option Agreement, Northwestern will pay, in
installments, a total of C$150,000 to acquire an initial 50% interest in the
Waterbury Project from CanAlaska. In addition, CanAlaska would receive a 3% net
smelter royalty (NSR) and 300,000 shares from Northwestern's treasury to be
released in stages beginning on or prior to the Execution Date of the Formal
Agreement, which will incorporate the terms of the Letter of Intent.
Northwestern has agreed to spend a minimum of C$2.0 million on the Waterbury
Project prior to April 1, 2008. Northwestern can boost its ownership to 60% by
spending an additional C$2.0 million on the property within two years of vesting
its 50% interest. Thereafter, Northwestern can increase its stake to 75% by
completing a Bankable Feasibility Study within two years from the date it vests
its 60% interest and spend an annual minimum of C$500,000 at Waterbury.
CanAlaska would also receive an additional 200,000 shares from Northwestern's
treasury if the Company elects to increase its stake to 75%. CanAlaska will act
as operator of the property until Northwestern has a vested 60% interest, at
which time Northwestern may become the operator.
On execution of the Formal Option Agreement, Northwestern has proceeded to
advance the first option payment of C$25,000 and issue 100,000 common shares to
CanAlaska.
OTHER
The overall objective of the Company is to expand the geological knowledge
related to the Pichachos, Fire-Fly and Waterbury Projects and to assist with the
development of mineralization that is economically significant. The Company will
also continue to evaluate the acquisition of other high quality exploration
properties in order to augment and strengthen its current Uranium and IOCG
property portfolio. To this end, the Company announced in June of 2005 that it
has filed applications for two uranium concessions in the Republic of Niger, for
which the Company is now awaiting government approval.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS/MINERAL ACTIVITIES
For the three months ended September 30, 2005, the Company incurred total
deferred exploration expenses of $91,294 (compared to $444,119 during the three
months ending September 30, 2004). A total of $78,518 was spent of the Picachos
project ($56,281 for the three months ending September 30, 2004) and a total of
$10,862 to complete the Company's obligation on the Bear project. As a result of
the decision not to proceed further with the Bear Project $602,193 of deferred
exploration expenses was written off during the quarter. The loss from
operations for the three months ended September 30, 2005 was $776,012 or $0.01
per share ($186,657 or $0.01 per share in the third quarter of 2004).
The loss from operations for second quarter of 2005 was as a result of the
deferred exploration expenditures written off ($602,193), on investor relations
and business development, management services and office costs.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At September 30, 2005 the Company had a working capital surplus of $464,981
(964,035 at December 31, 2004). The Company does not have sufficient funds to
meet its current property option obligations, however the ability of the Company
to successfully acquire additional mineral projects is conditional on its
ability to secure financing when required. The Company proposes to meet
additional financing requirements through equity financing. In light of the
continually changing financial markets, there is no assurance that new funding
will be available at the times required or desired by the Company.
SHARES ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING
As of September 30, 2005, the issued and outstanding common shares of the
Company totaled 76,854,334. Effective September 6, 2005, the Company completed a
stock-split, whereby each common share was subdivided into two common shares. On
August 2, 2005 the Company granted 40,000 stock options (prior to the 2 for 1
Stock Split) exercisable at $0.94 per share, which expire on August 2, 2008.
On October 18, 2005, 400,000 share purchase warrants, at an exercise price of
$0.475, were exercised, resulting in proceeds of C$190,000 to the Company.
On October 11, 2005, and on October 19, 2005, respectively, an aggregate of
55,000 share purchase warrants were exercised at an exercise price of $0.475,
for total proceeds of C$26,125 to the Company.
On October 14, 2005, 1,900,000 stock options were granted to the Company's new
president. These stock options are exercisable at a price of $0.75 per share,
and expire after five years.
As of November 21, there are currently 2,782,834 share purchase warrants, 63,000
broker warrants and 3,900,000 stock options (post Stock Split) outstanding which
also entitle the holders to purchase common shares of the Company. These stock
options, warrants and broker warrants, if exercised, would result in the
issuance of 6,745,835 common shares of the Company.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
During the three months ending September 30, 2005 consulting fees paid to
officers and directors totaled $25,938 ($52,500 for the third quarter of 2004).
<PAGE>
PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS
While the Company continues to evaluate quality exploration projects and
financing opportunities, there are no further transactions currently pending.

properties for mineral resources and has not determined whether the properties
contain economically recoverable reserves. The recovery of the amounts shown for
the resource properties and the related deferred expenditures is dependent upon
the existence of economically recoverable reserves, confirmation of the
Company's interest in the underlying mineral claims, the ability of the Company
to obtain necessary financing to complete the exploration, and upon future
profitable production.
The business of mining and exploring for minerals involves a high degree of risk
and there can be no assurance that current exploration programs will result in
profitable mining operations. The recoverability of the carrying value of
exploration properties and the Company's continued existence is dependent upon
the preservation of its interest in the underlying properties, the discovery of
economically recoverable reserves, the achievement of profitable operations, or
the ability of the Company to raise alternative financing, if necessary, or
alternatively upon the Company's ability to dispose of its interests on an
advantageous basis. Changes in future conditions could require material write
downs of the carrying values. Some of the Company's mining assets are located
outside of Canada and are subject to the risk of foreign investment, including
increases in taxes and royalties, renegotiation of contracts, currency exchange
fluctuations and political uncertainty.
Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to the properties on which
it is conducting exploration and in which it has an interest, in accordance with
industry standards for the current stage of exploration of such properties,
these procedures do not guarantee the Company's title. Property title may be
subject to unregistered prior agreements and non-compliance with regulatory
requirements.
As at September 30, 2005, the Company had cash and equivalents of $403,654 and
working capital of $464,981. Management of the Company believes that it has
sufficient funds to pay its ongoing administrative expenses and to meet its
liabilities for the ensuing twelve months as they fall due. However, the Company
does not have sufficient resources to (i) meet its Pichachos Project obligations
and (ii) acquire other properties. The Company's ability to continue operations
and fund its exploration property expenditures is dependent on management's
ability to secure additional financing. Management is actively pursuing such
additional sources of financing, and while it has been successful in doing so in
the past, there can be no assurance it will be able to do so in the future.
Because of this uncertainty there is some doubt about the ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include the
adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern. Such adjustments could be material.
The unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial
information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes
to the financial statements required by Canadian generally accepted accounting
principles for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a
fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and nine
month periods ended September 30, 2005 may not be necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2005.
The balance sheet at December 31, 2004 has been derived from the audited
financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information
and footnotes required by Canadian generally accepted accounting principles for
annual financial statements. The interim financial statements have been prepared
by management in accordance with the accounting policies described in the
Company's annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004. For
further information, refer to the financial statements and notes thereto
included in the Company's annual financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

31, 2004 audited financial statements.
(2) Refer to Supplement I of the September 30, 2005 unaudited financial
statements for details of additions to the Company's interest in exploration
properties and deferred exploration expenditures.
(3) The Company has formalized an amendment to its Option Agreement with RNC
Gold Inc. ("RNC") covering the Picachos Project. The amendment grants the
Company the right to acquire a 100% interest in the property portfolio.
The Company will be granted the right at feasibility to acquire RNC's remaining
50% stake in the Picachos Project. The purchase price of C$20 million is payable
as: C$3 million at feasibility, C$9 million at the commencement of commercial
production, and C$2 million on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of
the commencement of commercial production. Upon execution of a formal agreement,
the Company will issue 200,000 common shares from its treasury to RNC as
consideration for the agreement. The shares will be subject to any applicable
regulatory hold periods. As of September 30, 2005, the amendment has been
formalized and put into a formal agreement but has not been signed by RNC.
(4) Project generation for properties in Africa. Management assesses the value
assigned to the other category for each regulatory financial statement reporting
period. If no properties are acquired, the other category will be written-down
to its net realizable value.
(5) The Company has decided to terminate the Bear Project and focus on other
projects. There were no financial penalties associated with the termination of
the Bear Project. As a result, capitalized Bear Project costs of $602,193 have
been written-off during the period.
3.   SHARE CAPITAL

3.   SHARE CAPITAL (continued)
(b) Effective September 8, 2005, the Company completed a stock-split, where-by
each issued common share of the Company was sub-divided into two common shares.
Each registered shareholder of the Company received one (1) additional new share
for every common share held. No action was required by the shareholders.
Immediately following the stock-split, the Company had 76,854,334 common shares
issued and outstanding. The outstanding warrants and stock-options were also
sub-divided at the same ratio as the common shares. The exercise prices of the
warrants and stock options were adjusted to reflect the stock-split.
(c) Stock options to acquire 100,000 common shares at $0.575 per share were
exercised for gross cash proceeds of $57,500.

          392,850      2,000,000
          =======      =========
(1) On April 23, 2004, 300,000 stock options (Prior to Stock-split (2 for 1))
exercisable at $0.675 per share were issued to a firm that provides investor
relations to the Company. The following assumptions were used under the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model: dividend yield of 0%; expected volatility of
100%; risk-free interest rate of 4% and an expected life of 3 years. These
options were valued at $128,850.
(2) On October 22, 2004, 60,000 stock options (Prior to Stock-split (2 for 1))
exercisable at $0.72 per share were granted to a consultant of the Company. The
following assumptions were used under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model:
dividend yield of 0%; expected volatility of 100%; risk-free interest rate of 4%
and an expected life of 3 years. These options were valued at $27,600 and will
be charged to exploration property expenditures when certain vesting conditions
have been met.
(3) On August 2, 2005, 40,000 stock options (Prior to Stock-split (2 for 1))
exercisable at $0.94 per share were granted to a consultant of the Company. The
following assumptions were used under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model:
dividend yield of 0%; expected volatility of 100%; risk-free interest rate of 4%
and an expected life of 3 years. These options were valued at $23,920 and will
be charged to exploration property expenditures when certain vesting conditions
have been met.
6.   LOSS PER SHARE
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the loss for the period by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period,
including contingently issuable shares which are included when the conditions
necessary for issuance have been met. Diluted loss per share is calculated in a
similar manner, except that the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding is increased to include potentially issuable common shares from the
assumed exercise of common share purchase options and warrants, if dilutive. The
number of additional shares included in the calculation is based on the treasury
stock method for options and warrants. The effect of potential issuances of
shares under options and warrants would be anti-dilutive, and accordingly basic
and diluted loss per share are the same.
7.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company was charged $67,500 during the period (2004 - $63,750) for
consulting and other services rendered by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company. The Company was also charged $11,900 (2004 - $nil) by the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company. These amounts have all been expensed in the
statement of operations and deficit.
These transactions are in the normal course of operations and are measured at
the exchange amount which is the consideration established and agreed to by the
related parties.

8.   INCOME TAXES
The estimated taxable income for the period is $nil. Based upon the level of
historical taxable income, it cannot be reasonably determined if the Company
will realize the benefits from future income tax assets or the amounts owing
from future income tax liabilities. Consequently, the future recovery or loss
arising from differences in tax values and accounting values have been reduced
by an equivalent estimated taxable temporary difference valuation allowance.
This estimated taxable temporary difference valuation allowance will be adjusted
in the period that it can be determined that it is more likely than not that
some or all of the future tax assets or future tax liabilities will be realized.
For further information about the Company's losses for tax purposes, refer to
the audited December 31, 2004 financial statements. The benefits for these
losses and the estimated loss for the period are not recognized in these
financial statements.
9.   POTENTIAL PROPERTY ACQUISITION
Northwestern signed a Letter of Intent to acquire 100% ownership of two
uranium-vanadium mines, collectively called the "Firefly Project", in the La Sal
uranium district in southeastern Utah from GeoXplor Corp.
Under the terms of the Letter of Intent, Northwestern will pay US$5,100,000 to
acquire the Firefly Project from GeoXplor. An initial payment of US$100,000 is
due upon execution of a Formal Agreement incorporating the terms of the Letter
of Intent. Northwestern will make an additional payment of US$5,000,000 to
GeoXplor once a decision is made to commence production on the Firefly Project
or on July 31, 2011, whichever is earlier. In addition, GeoXplor will receive
300,000 common shares from Northwestern's treasury to be released on or prior to
the first, second and third anniversaries of the Execution Date of the Formal
Agreement, which will incorporate the terms of the Letter of Intent. These
shares will be subject to any applicable regulatory hold periods. GeoXplor is
also entitled to a 2% net smelter royalty on the production of uranium and
vanadium from the Firefly Project.
Northwestern has agreed to spend a minimum of US$700,000 on the Firefly Project
on or prior to the third anniversary of the Execution Date. Ashworth
Explorations Ltd. will act as operator of the Firefly Project until the second
anniversary of the Execution Date, at which time Northwestern becomes the
operator.
The Letter of Intent is subject to regulatory approval, due diligence and
environmental assessment. Other terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
10.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT
(a)  Potential Property Acquisition
On October 12, 2005, Northwestern signed a Letter of Intent to acquire up to 75%
ownership of nine highly prospective uranium claims, collectively called the
"Waterbury Project", in the eastern Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, Canada, from
CanAlaska Ventures Ltd. (TSX-V: CVV).
Under the terms of the Letter of Intent, Northwestern will pay, in installments,
a total of C$150,000 to acquire an initial 50% interest in the Waterbury Project
from CanAlaska. In addition, CanAlaska would receive a 3% net smelter royalty
(NSR) and 300,000 shares from Northwestern's treasury to be released in stages
beginning on or prior to the Execution Date of the Formal Agreement, which will
incorporate the terms of the Letter of Intent. These shares will be subject to
any regulatory hold periods. Northwestern has agreed to spend a minimum of C$2.0
million on the Waterbury Project prior to April 1, 2008. Northwestern can boost
its ownership to 60% by spending an additional C$2.0 million on the property
within two years of vesting its 50% interest. Thereafter, Northwestern can
increase its stake to 75% by completing a Bankable Feasibility Study within two
years from the date it vests its 60% interest. During this development stage,
Northwestern would spend an annual minimum of C$500,000 at Waterbury. CanAlaska
would also receive an additional 200,000 shares from Northwestern's treasury.
