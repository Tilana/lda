Notes: 
Throughout  this  report,  the  calculation  of  barrels  of  oil  equivalent  (“boe”)  is  based  on  the  conversion  ratio  that  six  thousand  cubic  feet  of  natural  gas  is 
equivalent to one barrel of oil. For a further discussion about this term, refer to the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section in this report. 
For net capital expenditures, amounts include capital expenditures acquired for cash, equity issuances, acquisition costs and net debt assumed on corporate 
acquisitions. 
Funds flow from operating activities is a non-GAAP term that represents net earnings/losses and asset retirement expenditures except for non-cash items. For a 
further discussion about this term, refer to the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section in this report. 
Total units outstanding include trust units plus exchangeable shares outstanding at period end. The exchangeable shares are converted at the exchange ratio at 
the end of the period. 
Average  daily  production  per  million  trust  units  is  calculated  using  the  weighted  average  number  of  units  outstanding  during  the  period  plus  the  weighted 
average number of exchangeable shares outstanding for the period converted at the average exchange ratio for the period.

FINANCIAL & OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
Zargon Energy Trust is pleased to report its financial results for the second quarter of 2009. Funds flow from 
operating activities was $20.92 million ($0.91 per diluted trust unit) in the 2009 second quarter compared with 
$17.85 million ($0.84 per diluted trust unit) in the 2009 first quarter and $32.02 million ($1.55 per diluted trust 
unit) in the 2008 second quarter.
Highlights from the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, are noted below: 
(cid:121)  Second quarter 2009 production averaged 9,520 barrels of oil equivalent per day, three percent above 
both the preceding quarter and the corresponding quarter of 2008. Higher second quarter production 
volumes were primarily due to the additional volumes provided by the acquisition of Masters Energy 
Inc. (“Masters”) which offset natural declines, the shut-in of selected high cost natural gas properties 
and weather related outages during the quarter. For the second quarter of 2009, Zargon’s production 
averaged  413  barrels  of  oil  equivalent  per  day  per  million  trust  units  outstanding  compared  to  432 
barrels of oil equivalent per day per million trust units outstanding for the prior quarter and 447 barrels 
of oil equivalent per day per million trust units outstanding in the corresponding quarter of 2008.
(cid:121)  Revenue  and  funds  flow  from  operating  activities  in  the  2009  second  quarter  increased  12  percent 
and  17  percent,  respectively,  from  the  prior  quarter.  Realized  oil  prices  increased  40  percent  and 
realized  natural  gas  prices  decreased  34  percent  from  the  prior  quarter.  Realized  risk  management 
gains decreased two percent from the prior quarter.
(cid:121)  The Trust  declared  three  monthly  cash  distributions  of  $0.18  per  trust  unit  in  the  second  quarter  of 
2009  for  a  total  of  $11.26  million. These  cash  distributions  were  equivalent  to  a  payout  ratio  of  59 
percent of the Trust’s second quarter funds flow from operating activities on a diluted trust unit basis 
and,  after  considering  the  effect  of  the  exchangeable  shares  not  receiving  distributions,  the 
distributions amounted to 54 percent of funds flow from operating activities.
(cid:121)  The  Trust’s  second  quarter  exploration  and  development  capital  expenditures  (excluding  property 
acquisitions and dispositions) decreased 33 percent from the prior quarter to $8.56 million primarily as 
a result of reduced drilling, completions and equipping of wells.
(cid:121)  Due in part to the proceeds received from the June issuance of trust units, debt net of working capital 
(excluding  unrealized  risk  management  assets/liabilities  and  future  income  taxes)  decreased  16 
percent from the prior quarter to $77.47 million at June 30, 2009, which represents approximately 43 
percent  of  the Trust’s  available  credit  facilities  at  June  30,  2009.  The Trust's  balance  sheet  remains 
strong with a debt net of working capital to annualized funds flow from operating activities ratio of 1.0 
times.
(cid:121)  On April 29, 2009, Zargon closed the acquisition of Masters for a total consideration of approximately 
1.475  million  Zargon  trust  units,  $5.70  million  in  cash  and  the  assumption  of  approximately  $13.29 
million  of  net  debt  (including  adjustments  and  transactions  costs)  for  a  total  transaction  value  of 
approximately $40.03 million.
(cid:121)  On  June  5,  2009,  the Trust  closed  an  offering  of  2.365  million  trust  units  on  a  bought  deal basis  at
$15.00 per unit for total gross proceeds of $35.48 million ($33.44 million net of issue costs).
(cid:121)  On July 27, 2009, the Trust amended and renewed its syndicated committed credit facilities of $180 
million. These  facilities  are  available  for  general  corporate  purposes  and  the  acquisition  of  oil  and 
natural gas properties.
(cid:121)  On July 28, 2009, the Trust announced the proposed acquisition of Churchill Energy Inc. (“Churchill”), 
which  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  late  September,  2009. The  proposed  transaction  is  valued  at 
approximately  $15.00  million,  including  the  assumption  of  approximately  $5.80  million  of  net  debt 
(including  adjustments  and  transaction  costs).  Churchill  shareholders  may  elect  to  receive  either 
0.01363 trust units or $0.22 cash for each Churchill common share, subject to a maximum of $4.60
Z A R G O N   E N E R G Y   T R U S T   2
million  cash.  Churchill  is  currently  producing  approximately  400  barrels  of  oil  equivalent  per  day 
primarily from its operated Grand Forks, Brazeau and Jarrow/Killam properties in Alberta.
Production (1) 
Oil  and  liquids  production  averaged  4,780  barrels  per  day  in  the  2009  second  quarter,  a  five  percent 
increase from the preceding quarter and a 12 percent increase from the corresponding 2008 quarter. The 
increase  in  production  volumes  was  primarily  due  to  the  acquisition  of  Masters  which  offset  natural 
declines  and  the  impact  from  Williston  Basin  spring  access  related  shut-ins.  Further  oil  production 
increases are anticipated for the balance of 2009 with the addition of volumes from the recent drilling of 
wells at Steelman in the Williston Basin and Taber in the Alberta Plains.
Natural gas production volumes in the second quarter of 2009 averaged 28.44 million cubic feet per day, 
a two percent increase from the previous quarter and a five percent decrease from the corresponding 
period of 2008. The second quarter 2009 natural gas production increased primarily due to the acquisition 
of Masters which offset natural declines, facility and processing plant maintenance related outages and 
the shut-in of selected high cost natural gas properties. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate that 
the Trust’s natural gas production volumes will show moderate declines, as we have restricted capital to 
our natural gas development business during this period of very low natural gas prices and netbacks.
Capital Expenditures (1) 
Zargon’s second quarter field capital program totalled $8.56 million, a 25 percent decrease from the 2008 
second quarter field capital expenditures and a 33 percent decrease from the prior quarter. During the 
quarter,  Zargon  drilled  three  gross  wells  (3.0  net)  that  resulted  in  3.0  net  oil  wells  for  a  100  percent 
success  ratio. This  oil  exploitation  focused  drilling  program  included  one Taber  horizontal  well  in  the 
Alberta Plains and two Steelman horizontal wells in the Williston Basin.
For the second half of 2009, Zargon is planning on an oil exploitation focused drilling program that will be 
primarily targeted on opportunities in the Williston Basin, which will include five Steelman Frobisher oil 
exploitation  horizontal  wells  along  with  three  additional  horizontal  wells  at  Fertile  (Torquay/Bakken), 
Elswick and Manor. At Taber in the Alberta Plains, we will also be following up on our successful second 
quarter exploitation location with the drilling of two horizontal wells. With success, two additional Taber 
horizontal wells will be drilled prior to year end. With the continuation of low natural gas prices, we are 
proceeding cautiously with our natural gas programs and as a result, three Alberta Plains Jarrow natural 
gas wells that were planned to be drilled this summer have been deferred until this fall. In West Central 
Alberta, we are currently planning on proceeding with the drilling of one Pembina natural gas exploration 
target and one step-out natural gas location at Kakut in the Peace River Arch area.
Since spring break up, we have had good results with our Williston Basin oil exploitation program where 
we have drilled three Steelman Frobisher horizontal wells and one Elswick horizontal well.  Initial results 
are encouraging and we are anticipating average initial production rates in excess of 100 barrels per day 
per well.
Over the last few quarters, Zargon has successfully redirected its business from a conventional natural 
gas exploration focus to an increased emphasis on exploitation enabled by periodic accretive acquisitions 
and reservoir management.  Specifically, we have made good progress with our oil exploitation initiatives 
as evidenced by our recent Williston Basin Frobisher programs and last year’s corporate acquisitions of 
Rival Energy Ltd. and Newpact Energy Corp., this spring’s corporate acquisition of Masters and now the 
recently announced corporate acquisition of Churchill.  Furthermore, we continue to make good progress 
with  our  detailed  technical  review  of  our  Little  Bow  tertiary  (Alkaline  Surfactant  Polymer)  oil  recovery 
initiative and look forward to finalizing our plans for this Southern Alberta opportunity by the first quarter 
of 2010.
Conversely,  in  recent  months  very  low natural gas  prices  and netbacks have caused Zargon to  further 
restrict its natural gas focused drilling. As a result of these trends, Zargon’s production base is becoming
3   S E C O N D   Q U A R T E R   R E P O R T   2 0 0 9
more oil weighted and is expected to reach a 53 percent oil weighting (6:1 equivalency) by the end of 
this year, up from the 43 percent average oil weighting in calendar 2007.
In the second quarter of 2009, the purchase of 10 thousand net acres of Crown lands at an average price 
of $31 per acre and the addition of approximately 108 thousand net acres from the Masters acquisition, 
allowed Zargon to increase its quarter end undeveloped land inventory to 533 thousand net acres, up 102 
thousand net acres from the balance reported at the end of the first quarter of 2009. For the remainder 
of the year, Zargon will continue to be an active participant at Alberta Crown land sales during this period 
of low Crown land sale costs.
Zargon  continues  to  take  advantage  of  the  industry’s  current  lower  property  and  corporate  acquisition 
costs with the announcement and closing of the acquisition of Masters and also with the announcement 
of the acquisition of Churchill which is expected to close in late September, 2009. During this period of 
opportunity,  Zargon  will  continue  to  use  its  strong  balance  sheet  and  solid  cash  flows  augmented  by 
substantial  hedge  gains  along  with  the  proceeds  from  the  recent  issuance  of  trust  units  to  pursue 
additional property and corporate acquisitions.
Guidance (1) 
In the May 12, 2009 press release announcing the first quarter 2009 results, Zargon provided updated 
production guidance of 9,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the second quarter of 2009, and then 
10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the remainder of 2009. Consistent with guidance, Zargon’s 
production averaged 9,520 barrels of oil equivalent in the second quarter. Production for the remainder of 
the year is now anticipated to average 9,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day (not including volumes from 
the  pending  acquisition  of  Churchill).   This  new  guidance  reflects  the  impact  of  continued  natural  gas 
declines  and,  in  selected  cases,  natural  gas  shut-ins  of  marginal  properties. These  declines  are  being 
mostly offset by new exploitation oil volumes coming from our horizontal drilling programs. This guidance 
continues  to  be  premised on  the  previously  announced 2009  field  capital budget  of $37  million  which 
has now been mostly redirected for the remainder of the year to oil exploitation projects, primarily in the 
Williston Basin.
Zargon continues to be well positioned during this current period of lower commodity prices (particularly 
for  natural  gas)  with  a  continued  strong  balance  sheet,  attractive  commodity  hedge  position  and  an 
inventory of promising opportunities that has recently been augmented by corporate acquisitions. We are 
pleased  that  our  historical  conservative  hedging,  debt  and  distribution  policies  have  enabled  our 
organization to maintain the current monthly $0.18 per unit distribution for 45 consecutive months. Going 
forward, Zargon will continue with its disciplined approach pertaining to the matching of our cash flow 
sources with our distributions and/or field capital and acquisition expenditure uses. To date, during this 
commodity price downturn, we have been able to maintain distributions primarily due to our substantial 
2009 positive hedges and the strength of the forward commodity price strip which indicates improved 
pre-hedge  cash  flows  in  2010.  As  we  move  towards  December  2010,  we  will  continue  to  carefully 
balance our projected cash flows with the competing uses for our cash resources, while recognizing that 
Zargon  remains  committed  to  our  partial  cash  flow  distributing  model  both  before  and  after  the  trust 
sunset date.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is a review of Zargon Energy Trust’s 2009 second quarter financial results and should be 
read in conjunction with the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and the 
audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2008. The consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). All amounts are in Canadian dollars 
unless otherwise noted. All references to “Zargon” or the “Trust” refer to Zargon Energy Trust and all references to the “Company” refer 
to Zargon Oil & Gas Ltd.
In the MD&A, reserves and production are commonly stated in barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”) on the basis that six thousand cubic feet of 
natural gas is equivalent to one barrel of oil. Boes may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand 
cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalent conversion method primarily applicable to the burner tip and 
does not represent a value equivalent at the wellhead.
The following are descriptions of non-GAAP measures used in this MD&A: 
(cid:121)  The MD&A contains the term “funds flow from operating activities” (“funds flow”), which should not be considered an alternative to, or 
more meaningful than, “cash flows from operating activities” as determined in accordance with Canadian GAAP as an indicator of the 
Trust’s  financial  performance.  This  term  does  not  have  any  standardized  meaning  as  prescribed  by  GAAP  and,  therefore,  the  Trust’s 
determination of funds flow from operating activities may not be comparable to that reported by other trusts. The reconciliation between 
cash  flows from operating  activities and funds flow from operating activities  can be found  in  the table below  and in the consolidated 
statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements. The Trust evaluates its performance based on net earnings and funds 
flow  from  operating  activities.  The  Trust  considers  funds  flow  from  operating  activities  to  be  a  key  measure  as  it  demonstrates  the 
Trust’s ability to generate the cash necessary to pay distributions, repay debt and to fund future capital investment. It is also used by 
research analysts to value and compare oil and gas trusts, and it is frequently included in published research when providing investment 
recommendations.  Funds  flow  from  operating  activities  per  unit  is  calculated  using  the  diluted  weighted  average  number  of  units  for 
the period.

(cid:121)  The Trust also uses the term “debt net of working capital” or “net debt”. Debt net of working capital, as presented, does not have any 
standardized  meaning  prescribed  by  Canadian  GAAP  and  may  not  be  comparable  with  the  calculation  of  similar  measures  for  other 
entities. Debt net of working capital, as used by the Trust, is calculated as bank debt and any working capital deficit excluding unrealized 
risk management assets/liabilities and future income taxes.
32.02
20.92

(cid:121)  Operating netbacks per boe equal total petroleum and natural gas revenue per boe adjusted for realized risk management gains and/or 
losses  per  boe,  royalties  per  boe  and  production  costs  per  boe.  Operating  netbacks  are  a  useful  measure  to  compare  the  Trust’s 
operations with those of its peers.
(cid:121)  Funds  flow  netbacks  per  boe  are  calculated  as  operating  netbacks  less  general  and  administrative  expenses  per  boe,  interest  and 
financing charges per boe, asset retirement expenditures per boe and current income taxes per boe. Funds flow netbacks are a useful 
measure to compare the Trust’s operations with those of its peers.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER 
(cid:121)  During the second quarter of 2009, the Trust realized funds flow from operating activities of $20.92 
million  and  declared  total  distributions  of  $11.26  million  ($0.54  per  trust  unit)  to  unitholders.  For 
Canadian  income  tax  purposes,  the  distributions  are  currently  estimated  to  be  100  percent  taxable 
income to unitholders.
(cid:121)  Average  field  prices  received  (before  the  impact  of  financial  risk  management  contracts)  for  oil  and 
liquids  and  for  natural  gas  increased  40  percent  to  $59.95  per  barrel  and  decreased  34  percent  to 
$3.77 per thousand cubic feet, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2009.
(cid:121)  Second  quarter  production  volumes  were  9,520  barrels  of  oil  equivalent  per  day,  a  three  percent
increase from the first quarter 2009 production levels.
(cid:121)  During  the  second  quarter  of  2009,  the Trust  drilled  three  gross  wells  (3.0  net)  with  a  100  percent 
success  rate.  Total  field  exploration  and  development  capital  expenditures  (excluding  property 
acquisitions  and  dispositions)  were  $8.56  million  for  the  quarter  compared  to  $12.78  million  for  the 
prior quarter.
(cid:121)  The Trust continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with a combined debt net of working capital 
(excluding  unrealized  risk  management  assets/liabilities  and  future  income  taxes)  of  $77.47  million, 
which represents approximately 43 percent of the Trust’s available credit facilities at June 30, 2009.
(cid:121)  On  April  29,  2009,  Zargon  closed  the  Arrangement  Agreement  to  acquire  all  the  issued  and 
outstanding  common  shares  of  Masters  Energy  Inc.  (“Masters”)  for  a  total  consideration  of 
approximately  1.475  million  Zargon  trust  units,  $5.70  million  in  cash  and  the  assumption  of 
approximately  $13.29  million  of  net  debt  (including  adjustments  and  transactions  costs)  for  a  total 
transaction  value  of  approximately  $40.03  million.  This  acquisition  brought  1,230  barrels  of  oil 
equivalent per day of production along with a significant Alkaline Surfactant Polymer (ASP) tertiary oil 
recovery opportunity at the Little Bow oil property in Southern Alberta.
(cid:121)  On  June  5,  2009,  the Trust  closed  an  offering  of  2.365  million  trust  units  on  a  bought  deal basis  at 
$15.00 per unit for total gross proceeds of $35.48 million ($33.44 million net of equity issuance costs). 
(cid:121)  On July 27, 2009, the Trust amended and renewed its syndicated committed credit facilities of $180 
million. These  facilities  are  available  for  general  corporate  purposes  and  the  acquisition  of  oil  and 
natural gas properties.
(cid:121)  On July 28, 2009, the Trust announced the proposed acquisition of Churchill Energy Inc. (“Churchill”), 
which  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  late  September,  2009. The  proposed  transaction  is  valued  at 
approximately  $15.00  million,  including  the  assumption  of  approximately  $5.80  million  of  net  debt 
(including  adjustments  and  transaction  costs).  Churchill  shareholders  may  elect  to  receive  either 
0.01363 trust units or $0.22 cash for each Churchill common share, subject to a maximum of $4.60 
million  cash.  Churchill  is  currently  producing  approximately  400  barrels  of  oil  equivalent  per  day 
primarily from the operated Grand Forks, Brazeau and Jarrow/Killam properties in Alberta.
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Second  quarter  2009  revenue  of  $35.84  million  was  12  percent  above  the  $31.98  million  in  the  first 
quarter of 2009 and 49 percent below the $69.66 million in the second quarter of 2008. A 40 percent 
increase in oil and liquids prices received and a three percent increase in production volumes were the 
primary  reasons  for  the  increased  revenues  when  compared  to  the  prior  quarter  amounts.  Second 
quarter 2009 realized oil and liquids field prices averaged $59.95 per barrel before the impact of financial 
risk management contracts and were 40 percent higher than the preceding quarter’s $42.97 per barrel 
and  were  46  percent  lower  than  the  $111.58  per  barrel  recorded  in  the  2008  second  quarter.  Zargon’s 
crude oil field price differential from the Edmonton par price decreased to $5.95 per barrel in the second 
quarter  of  2009  compared  to  $6.55  per  barrel  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009.  Natural  gas  field  prices
7   S E C O N D   Q U A R T E R   R E P O R T   2 0 0 9
received  averaged  $3.77  per  thousand  cubic  feet  before  the  impact  of  financial  risk  management 
contracts in the second quarter of 2009 ($3.22 per thousand cubic feet before the impact of physical and 
financial risk management contracts), a 34 percent decrease from the preceding quarter levels and 61 
percent below the 2008 second quarter prices. Zargon’s realized field prices differ from the benchmark 
AECO  average  daily  price  due  to  a  combination  of  fixed  price  physical  contracts  (see  note  11  to  the 
interim  unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements)  and  from  the  impact  of  Zargon  receiving  AECO 
monthly index pricing for a portion of its natural gas production.

Natural gas production volumes increased by two percent in the second quarter of 2009 to 28.44 million 
cubic feet per day from 27.92 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2009 and were five percent 
lower  than  the  2008  second  quarter. When  compared  to  the  prior  quarter,  the  2009  second  quarter 
increase in natural gas production volumes were primarily a result of 2.28 million cubic feet per day of 
production  volume  additions  from  the  April  29,  2009  acquisition  of  Masters,  which  offset  reduced 
production from the shut-in of high cost natural gas properties, facility and processing plant maintenance 
related outages and natural production declines. Oil and liquids production during the second quarter of 
2009 was 4,780 barrels per day, which is five percent above the 2009 first quarter rate of 4,560 barrels 
per  day  and  12  percent  above  the  second  quarter  of  2008  level. The  year-over-year  increase  in  oil  and
Z A R G O N   E N E R G Y   T R U S T   8
liquids production volumes was also primarily due to the post acquisition contribution of 407 barrels of oil 
per day of production volume additions coming from the Masters properties. On a barrel of oil equivalent 
basis,  Zargon  produced  9,520  barrels  of  oil  equivalent  per  day  in  the  second  quarter  of  2009,  which 
represents a three percent increase from the 9,213 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of 
2009 and a three percent increase when compared to the second quarter of 2008.

Zargon’s commodity price risk management policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors, allows 
the  use  of  forward  sales,  costless  collars  and  other  instruments  up  to  a  24  month  term  and 
approximately 30 percent of oil and natural gas working interest production in order to partially offset the 
effects  of  commodity  price  fluctuations.  Zargon’s  management  considers  financial  risk  management 
contracts  to  be  effective  on  an  economic  basis,  but  has  decided  not  to  designate  these  contracts  as 
hedges  for  accounting  purposes  and,  accordingly,  for  these  contracts,  an  unrealized  gain  or  loss  is 
recorded based on the fair value (mark-to-market) of the contracts at the period end.
Specifically, in the 2009 second quarter, relatively lower oil and natural gas prices brought about a net 
realized financial risk management gain totalling $7.45 million, consisting of a $1.12 million gain on natural 
gas  contracts  and  a  $6.33  million  gain  on  oil  contracts  (foreign  exchange  contracts  are  considered  in 
conjunction with the oil contracts), that compares to a $7.63 million realized net gain in the first quarter of 
2009 and a $8.95 million realized net loss in the second quarter of 2008.
The 2009 second quarter unrealized risk management loss resulted from oil contract (including related 
foreign  exchange  contract)  losses  of  $13.21  million,  and  by  unrealized  risk  management  natural  gas 
contract losses of $0.44 million resulting in a total loss of $13.65 million for the quarter, which compares 
to a net $6.17 million loss for the 2009 first quarter and a net $29.63 million loss in the second quarter of 
2008. These non-cash unrealized risk management gains or losses are generated by the change over the 
reporting period in the mark-to-market valuation of Zargon’s risk management contracts. Recent volatility 
in commodity prices has resulted in significant fluctuations in the mark-to-market amount of unrealized 
risk management assets and liabilities. The period-over-period changes in these valuations directly impact 
net earnings/losses. Zargon’s commodity risk management positions are fully described in note 11 to the 
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements.
Royalties,  inclusive  of  the  Saskatchewan  Resource  Surcharge,  totalled  $5.99  million  for  the  second 
quarter of 2009, an increase of seven percent from the $5.59 million preceding quarter expense and a 
decrease of 57 percent from $14.04 million in the second quarter of 2008. The variations in royalty rates
9   S E C O N D   Q U A R T E R   R E P O R T   2 0 0 9
generally track changes in production volumes and prices. As a percentage of petroleum and natural gas 
revenue, royalty rates in 2008 tended to move in a relatively narrow range from 20 to 21 percent and 
were 20.2 percent in the second quarter of 2008. Commencing in 2009, the oil and natural gas royalty 
structure  changed  for  Alberta  production  volumes  (as  disclosed  in  our  2008  Annual  Financial  Report). 
Reflecting  lower  commodity  prices  and  the  modified  royalty  structure,  on  a  consolidated  basis,  the 
second quarter of 2009 royalties resulted in a rate of 16.7 percent (17.4 percent excluding revenue that 
does not attract royalty expenses) which compared to 17.5 percent (18.8 percent excluding revenue that 
does  not  attract  royalty  expenses)  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009.  For  the  remainder  of  the  year  Zargon 
expects  that  its  royalty  rate  will  range  from  18  to  20,  but  will  ultimately  depend  on  the  actual  price 
received for our production.
On  a  unit  of  production  basis,  production  costs  of  $13.08  per  barrel  of  oil  equivalent  in  the  second 
quarter of 2009 compares with $13.56 per barrel of oil equivalent in the preceding quarter and $11.22 per 
barrel of oil equivalent in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in the 2009 second quarter costs (on 
a  unit  of  production  basis)  primarily  relates  to  first  quarter  2009  weather  related  expenses  and  prior 
period  adjustments.  Despite  the  addition  of  the  slightly  more  expensive  Masters  properties,  Zargon 
anticipates that its production costs can be maintained in the $13.00 to $13.50 range for the remainder 
of the year.

Measured on a unit of production basis, general and administrative expenses (net of recoveries) were 
$4.18 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first half of 2009 compared to $2.92 in the first half of 2008 and 
$3.08  for  the  twelve  month  period  of  2008. The  year-over-year  increase  in  general  and  administrative 
expenses on a per unit of production basis are primarily due to additional office lease costs and the costs 
related to the expansion of Zargon’s technical staff and consultants, as Zargon repositions itself for its 
renewed exploitation and acquisition initiatives. Also included in the 2009 first six months are one-time 
employment  related  charges  that  increased  the  general  and  administrative  expenses  by  approximately 
$0.37 per barrel of oil equivalent.
Expensing of unit-based compensation in the second quarter of 2009 was $0.28 million, an eight percent 
increase from the second quarter of 2008 and a 97 percent increase from the prior quarter. The increase 
is a result of 0.38 million unit rights granted on May 20, 2009 at a price of $15.56 per unit right pursuant
Z A R G O N   E N E R G Y   T R U S T   1 0
to  the Trust’s  new  unit  rights  incentive  plan  as  approved  at  Zargon’s  Annual  and  Special  meeting  of 
Unitholders held on April 22, 2009.
Zargon’s borrowings are through its syndicated bank credit facilities. Interest and financing charges on 
these  facilities  in  the  2009  second  quarter  were  $0.49  million,  $0.13  million  lower  than  the  previous 
quarter amount of $0.62 million and a decrease of $0.87 million from $1.36 million in the second quarter 
of  2008. This  year-over-year  decrease  is  primarily  due  to  a  decrease  in  average  bank  debt  levels  and 
declining  interest  rates.  In  particular  bank  debt  levels  were  decreased  in  June  2009,  when  the Trust 
closed an offering of 2.365 million trust units on a bought deal basis at $15.00 per unit for total gross 
proceeds of $35.48 million ($33.44 million net of equity issuance expenses). Zargon’s current available 
syndicated  committed  credit  facilities  and  borrowing  base  are  $180  million,  with  approximately  61 
percent unutilized at June 30, 2009.
On  July  27,  2009,  Zargon  amended  and  renewed  its  syndicated  committed  credit  facilities  of  $180 
million. The  next  renewal  date  is  June  29,  2010. These  facilities  continue  to  be  available  for  general 
corporate purposes and the potential acquisition of oil and natural gas properties. For the remainder of 
2009  through  to  the  2010  renewal,  Zargon’s  borrowing  costs  will  be  higher  as  general  debt  pricing, 
standby fees and extension fees have risen considerably in the current economic environment. Interest 
rates fluctuate under the syndicated facilities with Canadian prime, US prime, and US base rates plus an 
applicable  margin  between  125  basis  points  and  275  basis  points  (2008  –  zero  and  32.5  basis  points, 
respectively), as well as with Canadian banker’s acceptance and LIBOR rates plus an applicable margin 
between 275 basis points and 425 basis points (2008 – 97.5 and 157.5 basis points, respectively).  Credit 
facility extension fees of approximately $0.58 million were paid at the July 27, 2009 renewal and will be 
reflected in the 2009 third quarter interest expense.
Current income taxes for the 2009 second quarter were $0.43 million, and related primarily to the United 
States operations. When compared to prior periods, current income taxes decreased $0.56 million from 
the 2008 second quarter and decreased $0.04 million relative to the first quarter of 2009. The decreased 
2009 taxable income is primarily due to reduced oil prices. A reduced capital program for this geographic 
region  tends  to  result  in  reduced  tax  pool  claims  and,  therefore,  continues  to  cause  minimal  levels  of 
United States taxes. Provided that oil prices remain low, a similar level of United States current income 
taxes is predicted for the remaining quarters of 2009. Total corporate tax pools as at June 30, 2009, are 
approximately  $235  million,  which  represents  an  increase  of  25  percent  from  the  comparable  $188 
million of tax pools available to Zargon at December 31, 2008, primarily a result of the tax pools acquired 
as part of the recent Masters acquisition.

Reflecting  the  impact  of  the  Masters  acquisition,  depletion  and  depreciation  expense  for  the  second 
quarter of 2009 increased seven percent to $15.68 million compared to the prior quarter and the second 
quarter of 2008, $14.72 million and $14.69 million, respectively. On a per barrel of oil equivalent basis, 
the depletion and depreciation rates were $18.09, $17.75 and $17.47 for the second and first quarters of 
2009 and the second quarter of 2008, respectively. The 2008 calendar year depletion and depreciation 
rate was $17.61 per barrel of oil equivalent.
The provision for accretion of asset retirement obligations for the first half of 2009 was $1.26 million, a 
20 percent increase compared to the first half of 2008. The year-over-year increase is due to changes in 
the estimated future liability for asset retirement obligations as a result of wells added through Zargon’s 
drilling program inclusive of wells acquired/disposed of in the current year and wells acquired with the 
recent corporate acquisitions.
The recovery of future taxes for the second quarter of 2009 was $6.11 million compared to a recovery of 
$3.73 million in the prior quarter and a recovery of $7.77 million in the second quarter of 2008. The 2009 
second quarter increase in the future tax recovery, when compared to the 2009 first quarter recovery, is 
primarily related to a decrease in net earnings as a result of the increase in unrealized risk management 
losses in the quarter.
On  October  31,  2006,  the  Federal  Government  announced  tax  proposals  pertaining  to  taxation  of 
distributions paid by trusts and the personal tax treatment of trust distributions. Currently, the Trust does 
not pay tax on distributions as tax is paid by the unitholders. On June 12, 2007, the Federal Government 
enacted these tax proposals, which would have resulted in taxation of distributions at the Trust level at a 
rate of 31.5 percent effective January 1, 2011. Subsequent 2007 fourth quarter legislation lowered this 
tax  rate  to  29.5  percent  in  2011  and  28.0 percent  beyond 2011  to  assimilate  recent corporate  tax  rate 
changes. Prior to June 2007, the Trust estimated the future income tax on certain temporary differences 
between amounts recorded on its balance sheet for book and tax purposes to have a nil effective tax 
rate. On February 26, 2008, the Federal Government, in its Federal Budget, announced further changes to 
the specified investment flow through (“SIFT”) tax rules. The provincial component of the SIFT tax will be 
based  on  the  provincial  rates  where  the  SIFT  has  a  permanent  establishment  rather  than  using  a  13.0 
percent flat rate. During the 2009 first quarter this tax rate change had been substantively enacted, and 
the future income tax impact  has been recorded in the financial statements. Under  the  legislation,  the 
Trust now estimates the effective tax rate on the post 2010 reversal of these temporary differences to be 
approximately  26.5  percent  for  2011  and  25.0  percent  thereafter.  Until  2011,  Zargon’s  future  tax 
obligations are reduced as distributions are made from the Trust and, consequently, it is anticipated that 
Zargon’s effective tax rate will continue to be low until that time.
On  December  15,  2006,  the  Canadian  Federal  Department  of  Finance  stated  its  intention  to  allow 
conversions of SIFT income trusts to a corporation without any adverse tax consequences to investors. 
On  July  14,  2008,  the  Department  of  Finance  released  the  draft  legislative  proposals  to  allow  the 
conversion of these SIFT trusts into corporations. Zargon is currently reviewing and assessing this recent 
legislation  and  is  considering  its  potential  impact  on  the  organization  while  Zargon’s  management 
develops its strategic plan beyond 2010, which is the effective date of the new SIFT tax rules.
According to the January 19, 2005 CICA pronouncement, EIC-151 “Exchangeable Securities Issued by 
Subsidiaries of Income Trusts”, Zargon Energy Trust must reflect the exchangeable securities issued by its 
subsidiary (Zargon Oil & Gas Ltd.) as a non-controlling interest. Prior to 2005, these exchangeable shares 
were  reflected  as  a  component  of  unitholders’  equity.  Accordingly,  the  Trust  has  reflected  a  non-
controlling  interest  of  $27.07  million  on  the Trust’s  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  at  June  30,  2009. 
Consolidated net losses have been reduced for net losses attributable to the non-controlling interest of 
$0.35 million in the second quarter of 2009. In accordance with EIC-151 and given the circumstances in 
Zargon’s case, each exchangeable share redemption is accounted for as a step-purchase, which, in the 
second quarter of 2009, resulted in an increase in property and equipment of $0.01 million, a decrease in 
unitholders’ equity and non-controlling interest of $0.34 million and a nominal increase in future income 
tax  liability.  Funds  flow  was  not  impacted  by  this  change.  The  cumulative  impact  to  date  of  the
Z A R G O N   E N E R G Y   T R U S T   1 2
application  of  EIC-151  has  been  to  increase  property  and  equipment  by  $55.24  million,  unitholders’ 
equity and non-controlling interest by $65.64 million, increase future income tax liability by $18.21 million 
and allocate net earnings of $28.61 million to exchangeable shareholders.
Funds flow from operating activities in the 2009 second quarter of $20.92 million was $3.07 million, or 
17 percent higher than the preceding quarter and $11.10 million or 35 percent lower than the prior year 
second  quarter. The increase in  funds  flow  from  the  preceding  quarter  was  primarily  due  to  increased 
revenues (net of related royalties) as a result of higher oil prices and higher production volumes resulting 
from the acquisition of Masters. Compared to the prior year second quarter, a three percent increase in 
production volumes and an increase in realized risk management contract gains were more than offset 
by  rising  production  costs,  general  and  administrative  costs  and  a  50  percent  decrease  in  commodity 
prices. Funds flow on a per diluted trust unit basis was $0.91 for the second quarter of 2009, an eight 
percent increase from the prior quarter and a 41 percent decrease from the 2008 second quarter.
Net losses were $2.55 million for the 2009 second quarter compared to $0.37 million of net earnings in 
the preceding quarter and $4.51 million of net losses in the second quarter of 2008. The net earnings 
track  the  funds  flow  from  operating  activities  for  the  respective  periods  modified  by  asset  retirement 
expenditures  and  non-cash  charges,  which  include  depletion  and  depreciation,  unrealized  risk 
management gains/losses, future income taxes/recoveries and non-controlling interest. In addition to the 
previously noted items impacting funds flow, the primary reason for the reduced second quarter 2009 
net earnings are due to $13.65 million of non-cash unrealized risk management losses in the quarter.

CORPORATE ACQUISITIONS
On April 29, 2009, Zargon closed the Arrangement Agreement to acquire all the issued and outstanding 
common shares of Masters Energy Inc. for a total consideration of approximately 1.475 million Zargon 
trust  units,  $5.70  million  in  cash  and  the  assumption  of  approximately  $13.29  million  of  net  debt 
(including  adjustments  and  transactions  costs)  for  a  total  transaction  value  of  approximately  $40.03 
million.  This  acquisition  brought  1,230  barrels  of  oil  equivalent  per  day  of  production  along  with  a
1 3   S E C O N D   Q U A R T E R   R E P O R T   2 0 0 9
significant  Alkaline  Surfactant  Polymer  (ASP)  tertiary  oil  recovery  opportunity  at  the  Little  Bow  oil 
property in Southern Alberta.
The results of operations of Masters have been included in the consolidated financial statements since 
April 29, 2009. In relation to the second quarter 2009 results, the Masters acquisition has contributed 
approximately  787  barrels  of  oil  equivalent  per  day  of  production  volumes  to  Zargon’s  total  quarterly 
production volumes of 9,520 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
On July 28, 2009, Zargon announced that it entered into an Arrangement Agreement pursuant to which 
Zargon  has  agreed  to  make  an  offer  to  acquire  all  the  issued  and  outstanding  common  shares  of 
Churchill  Energy  Inc.  (“Churchill”).  Pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  Churchill  shareholders 
would receive approximately 0.01363 trust units or $0.22 cash for each Churchill common share, subject 
to a maximum of $4.60 million cash. This corporate acquisition is valued at approximately $15.00 million 
and is expected to be completed in late September 2009, at which time the results of operations would 
be included in the consolidated financial statements. Churchill is currently producing approximately 400 
barrels of oil equivalent per day.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Total  net  capital  expenditures  (including  net  property  acquisitions  and  consideration  and  net  debt 
assumed for corporate acquisitions) of $62.40 million in the first half of 2009 were 27 percent lower than 
the first half of 2008 which had included the Rival Energy Ltd. and Newpact Energy Corp. acquisitions. 
Field expenditures of $21.34 million for the 2009 first half reflected a similar exploration and development 
field  program  when  compared  to  $20.85  million  for  the  2008  first  half,  representing  a  two  percent 
increase. Drilling and completion expenses of $9.99 million were five percent higher than the prior year’s 
first half amount of $9.50 million. During the first half of 2009, 10.4 net wells were drilled compared to 
14.3 net wells in the first half of 2008. Field capital expenditures (excluding net property acquisitions) for 
the first half of 2009 were allocated to Alberta Plains – $9.66 million, West Central Alberta – $5.86 million 
and Williston Basin – $5.82 million.
On June 5, 2009, the Trust closed an offering of 2.365 million trust units on a bought deal basis at $15.00 
per unit for total gross proceeds of $35.48 million ($33.44 million net of equity issuance costs). The net 
proceeds of the offering were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under existing credit facilities, and 
in turn will also be used to partially fund the 2009 capital expenditure program and for general corporate 
purposes.
Funds flow from operating activities in the 2009 first half of $38.77 million, proceeds from the issuance 
of  trust  units  of  $55.75  million  (due  to  the  acquisition  of  Masters,  the  equity  issuance  and  unit  right 
exercises)  funded  the  capital  program  including  corporate  and  property  acquisitions,  the  decrease  in 
bank debt, the changes in working capital and the cash distributions to the unitholders.
At June 30, 2009, the Trust continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with a combined debt net of 
working capital (excluding unrealized risk management assets and liabilities and future income taxes) of 
$77.47  million,  compared  to  $91.92  million  at  the  end  of  the  2009  first  quarter,  which  represents 
approximately 43 percent of the Trust’s available credit facilities at June 30, 2009.
The volatility of oil and natural gas prices, the changes relating to Alberta royalties and Canadian income 
trust  tax  rules  and  recent  global  economic  concerns  have  partially  restricted  the  oil  and  natural  gas 
industry’s ability to attract new capital from debt and equity markets. Zargon’s historically conservative 
strategy of maintaining a relatively low cash distribution to funds flow ratio and conservative debt levels 
should  enable  Zargon  to  maintain  modified  capital  and  distribution  programs  during  periods  of  limited 
access to debt and equity capital.

During the first half of 2009, Zargon has maintained a base monthly distribution of $0.18 per trust unit. 
Management  monitors  the Trust’s  distribution  policy  with  respect  to  forecasted  net  cash  flows,  debt 
levels  and  capital  expenditures.  Zargon’s  cash  distributions  are  discretionary  to  the  extent  that  these 
distributions do not cause a breach of the financial covenants under Zargon’s credit facilities and to the 
extent the Trust (non-consolidated) is not taxable. As a crude oil and natural gas Trust, Zargon’s reserve 
base is depleted with production and Zargon, therefore, relies on ongoing exploration, development and 
acquisition  activities  to  replace  reserves  and  to  offset  production  declines.  The  success  of  these 
exploration, development and acquisition capital programs, along with commodity price fluctuations and 
the Trust’s  ability  to  manage  costs,  are  the  main  factors  influencing  the  sustainability  of  the Trust’s 
distributions.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, cash flows from operating activities (after changes in 
non-cash working capital) of $21.94 million and $37.67 million, respectively, exceeded cash distributions 
of $11.26 million and $21.30 million, respectively. For the three months and six months ended June 30, 
2008, cash flows from operating activities (after changes in non-cash working capital) of $36.44 million 
and  $51.71  million,  respectively,  exceeded  cash  distributions  of  $9.71  million  and  $19.26  million, 
respectively.
For  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2009,  cash  distributions  of  $11.26  and  $21.30  million, 
exceeded net losses of $2.55 and $2.19 million, respectively. For the three months ended June 30, 2008, 
net  losses  of  $4.51  million  were  exceeded  by  cash  distributions  of  $9.71  million.  For  the  six  months 
ended  June  30,  2008,  net  earnings  of  $0.04  million  were  exceeded  by  cash  distributions  of  $19.26 
million. Net earnings/losses include significant non-cash charges, which were $23.88 million for the 2009 
second quarter and $41.82 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009, that do not impact cash flow. 
Net earnings/losses also include fluctuations in future income taxes due to changes in tax rates and tax 
rules. In the instances where distributions exceed net earnings, a portion of the cash distribution paid to 
unitholders may represent an economic return of the unitholders’ capital.
For  the  2009  second  quarter,  cash  distributions  and  net  capital  expenditures  totalled  $60.22 million 
($20.19 million excluding the $40.03 million attributed to the Masters corporate acquisition), which was 
$38.28 million higher than the cash flows from operating activities (after changes in non-cash working 
capital) of $21.94 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2009, cash flows from operating activities 
(after  changes  in  non-cash  working  capital)  were  exceeded  by  cash  distributions  and  net  capital 
expenditures (including the cash and non-cash portion of corporate acquisitions) by $46.03 million. For 
the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2008,  cash  distributions  and  net  capital  expenditures  were 
exceeded  by  and  exceeded  cash  flows  from  operating  activities  (after  changes  in  non-cash  working 
capital) by $0.45 and $53.44 million, respectively. Zargon relies on access to debt and capital markets to 
the  extent  cash  distributions  and  net  capital  expenditures  exceed  cash  flows  from  operating  activities 
(after  changes  in  non-cash  working  capital).  Over  the  long  term,  Zargon  expects  to  fund  cash
1 5   S E C O N D   Q U A R T E R   R E P O R T   2 0 0 9
distributions  and  capital  expenditures  with  its  cash  flows  from  operating  activities;  however,  it  will 
continue to fund acquisitions and growth through additional debt and equity issuances. In the crude oil 
and natural gas industry, because of the nature of reserve reporting, the natural reservoir declines and 
the  risks  involved  in  capital  investment,  it  is  not  possible  to  distinguish  between  capital  spent  on 
maintaining  productive  capacity  and  capital  spent  on  growth  opportunities.  Therefore,  maintenance 
capital is not disclosed separately from development capital spending.
At August 12, 2009, Zargon Energy Trust had 22.436 million trust units and 1.849 million exchangeable 
shares outstanding. Assuming full conversion of exchangeable shares at the effective August 12, 2009 
exchange ratio of 1.55759, there would be 25.316 million trust units outstanding. Pursuant to the trust 
unit rights incentive plans, there are currently an additional 1.731 million trust unit incentive rights issued 
and outstanding.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
As disclosed in the December 31, 2008 annual audited consolidated financial statements, on January 1, 
2009, the Trust adopted the following Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) Handbook 
Sections:
Section 3064 “Goodwill and Intangible Assets”, replacing Section 3062 “Goodwill and Other Intangible 
Assets”.  Under  this  new  guidance,  fewer  items  meet  the  criteria  for  capitalization.  Section  3064 
establishes  standards  for  the  recognition,  measurement,  presentation  and  disclosure  of  goodwill  and 
intangible assets subsequent to its initial recognition. Requirements concerning goodwill are unchanged 
from the requirements included in the previous Section 3062, as the new Section was only amended for 
intangible  assets.  The  adoption  of  the  abstract  did  not  significantly  impact  the  Trust’s  consolidated 
financial statements.
Effective January 1, 2009, the Trust retrospectively adopted the recommendations of Emerging Issues 
Committee  abstract  173  “Credit  Risk  and  the  Fair  Value  of  Financial  Assets  and  Financial  Liabilities”, 
which was issued in January 2009, without restatement of prior periods. The abstract requires that an 
entity’s own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparty are taken into account in determining the 
fair  value  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities,  including  derivative  instruments,  for  presentation  and 
disclosure  purposes. The  adoption  of  the  abstract  did  not  significantly  impact  the Trust’s  consolidated 
financial statements.
In addition, the Trust has assessed new and revised accounting pronouncements that have been issued 
that are not yet effective and determined the following may have a significant impact on the Trust:
In  December  2008,  the  CICA  issued  Section  1582 “Business  Combinations”,  which  will  replace  CICA 
Section 1581 of the same name. Under this guidance, the purchase price used in a business combination 
is based on the fair value of shares exchanged at the market price at the date of the exchange. Currently 
the purchase price used is based on the market price of the shares for a reasonable period before and 
after  the  date  the  acquisition  is  agreed  upon  and  announced. This  new  guidance  generally  requires  all
Z A R G O N   E N E R G Y   T R U S T   1 6
acquisition  costs  to  be  expensed,  which  currently  are  capitalized  as  part  of  the  purchase  price. 
Contingent liabilities are to be recognized at fair value at the acquisition date and remeasured at fair value 
through  earnings  each  period  until  settled.  Currently,  only  contingent  liabilities  that  are  resolved  and 
payable are included in the cost to acquire the business. In addition, negative goodwill is required to be 
recognized immediately in earnings, unlike the current requirement to eliminate it by deducting it from 
the  non-current  assets  in  the  purchase  price  allocation.  Section  1582  will  be  effective  for  the Trust  on 
January 1, 2011, with prospective application. The Trust is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption 
of the new Section on its consolidated financial statements.
In December 2008, the CICA issued Sections 1601 “Consolidated Financial Statements”, and 1602 “Non-
controlling  Interests”,  which  replaces  existing  guidance  under  Section  1600  “Consolidated  Financial 
Statements”.  Section  1601  establishes  standards  for  the  preparation  of  consolidated  financial 
statements. Section 1602 provides guidance on accounting for a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary 
in  consolidated  financial  statements  subsequent  to  a  business  combination. These  standards  will  be 
effective for the Trust on January 1, 2011. The Trust is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of 
these new Sections on its consolidated financial statements.
In  January  2006,  the  CICA  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“AcSB”)  adopted  a  strategic  plan  for  the 
direction of accounting standards in Canada. As part of that plan, the AcSB confirmed in February 2008 
that International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) will replace Canadian GAAP in 2011 for profit-
oriented  Canadian  publicly  accountable  enterprises.  As  Zargon  will  be  required  to  report  its  results  in 
accordance with IFRS starting in 2011, the Trust is assessing the potential impacts of this changeover and 
developing  its  plan  accordingly.  Zargon  has  enlisted  an  independent  consulting  firm  to  assist  with  the 
assessment  and  planning  of  this  project.  To  date,  Zargon  management  with  the  assistance  of  an 
independent consulting firm has performed an analysis of key differences between Canadian GAAP as it 
pertains to Zargon and IFRS. Zargon’s internal steering committee is in the process of planning the steps 
required to achieve the proper implementation of IFRS.
The  International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“IASB”)  has  issued  amendments  to  IFRS  1,  which 
addresses first time adoption of IFRS.  The IASB will allow additional optional exemptions, one of which 
relates  to  full  cost  oil  and  gas  accounting,  resulting  in  a  reduced  administrative  transition  from  the 
current Canadian full cost accounting for oil and gas activities to IFRS. The election is available at the time 
of  adoption  only. The  exemption  would  permit  the Trust  to  measure  exploration  and  evaluation  assets 
under IFRS at the carrying amount determined under Canadian GAAP at the date of transition to IFRS.  In 
addition,  the  carrying  amount  under  Canadian  GAAP  of  production  or  development  assets  could  be 
allocated on a pro rata basis to the underlying assets using either reserve volumes or reserve values at 
the date of transition.  The assets to which this exemption is applied would be required to be tested for 
impairment at the date of transition under IFRS standards.
MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL REPORTING SYSTEMS
Zargon  is  required  to  comply  with  National  Instrument  52-109  “Certification  of  Disclosure  in  Issuers’ 
Annual  and  Interim  Filings”,  otherwise  referred  to  as  Canadian  SOX  (“C-Sox”).  The  2009  certificate 
requires  that  the Trust  disclose  in  the  interim  MD&A  any  changes  in  the Trust’s  internal  controls  over 
financial reporting that occurred during the period that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to 
materially  affect  the Trust’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting. The Trust  confirms  that  no  such 
changes were made to the internal controls over financial reporting during the first half of 2009.
Because of their inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements, errors or fraud. Control systems, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide 
only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control systems are met.

OUTLOOK
With  a  strong  balance  sheet,  533  thousand  net  acres  of  undeveloped  land,  a  promising  internally 
generated  project  inventory  and  its  ability  to  execute  accretive  asset  and/or  corporate  acquisitions, 
Zargon continues to be well positioned to meet its value-creating objectives in 2009 and beyond. At this 
time in early August 2009, future commodity markets indicate that in 2009 both oil and natural gas prices 
will  be  considerably  lower  than  their  2008  averages.  Furthermore,  there  is  evidence  that  some  of  the 
upward  pressures  on  the  industry’s  input  costs  have  been  alleviated,  allowing  for  improved  capital 
program efficiencies for field activities and for property and corporate acquisitions.
Although  the  recent  world-wide  economic  crisis,  depressed  commodity  prices  and  changes  to  the 
Canadian  income  trust  tax  rules  after  2010  have  negatively  impacted  our  industry,  we  are  optimistic 
about  Zargon’s  long  term  value-seeking  strategy.  Consistent  with  its  history,  Zargon  will  continue  to 
adhere  to  a  conservative  and  focused  strategy  of  exploiting  its  existing  asset  base  while  executing 
accretive acquisitions which will be funded by debt or equity issuances.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 (unaudited).
1.  BAS IS OF PR ESENTATIO N 
The interim unaudited consolidated financial statements of Zargon Energy Trust (the “Trust” or “Zargon”) have been prepared by 
management  in  accordance  with  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles. The  interim  unaudited  consolidated  financial 
statements have been prepared following the same accounting policies and methods in computation as the consolidated financial 
statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, except as noted below. The disclosures provided below are incremental to 
those  included  with  the  annual  audited  consolidated  financial  statements.  These  interim  unaudited  consolidated  financial 
statements do not include all disclosures required in the annual consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction 
with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in the Zargon Energy Trust annual financial report for the year ended 
December 31, 2008.
The Trust’s principal business activity is the exploration for and development and production of petroleum and natural gas in Canada 
and the United States (“US”).
2.  CHANG ES  IN ACCOUNTING  POLIC IES 
As disclosed in the December 31, 2008 annual audited consolidated financial statements, on January 1, 2009, the Trust adopted the 
following Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) Handbook Sections:
Section  3064 “Goodwill  and  Intangible  Assets”,  replacing  Section  3062 “Goodwill  and  Other  Intangible  Assets”.  Under  this  new 
guidance,  fewer  items  meet  the  criteria  for  capitalization.  Section  3064  establishes  standards  for  the  recognition,  measurement, 
presentation  and  disclosure  of  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  subsequent  to  its  initial  recognition.  Requirements  concerning 
goodwill are unchanged from the requirements included in the previous Section 3062, as the new Section was only amended for 
intangible assets. The adoption of the abstract did not significantly impact the Trust’s consolidated financial statements.
Effective  January  1,  2009,  the Trust  retrospectively  adopted  the  recommendations  of  Emerging  Issues  Committee  abstract  173 
“Credit Risk and the Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”, which was issued in January 2009, without restatement 
of prior periods. The abstract requires that an entity’s own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparty are taken into account in 
determining  the  fair  value  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities,  including  derivative  instruments,  for  presentation  and  disclosure 
purposes. The adoption of the abstract did not significantly impact the Trust’s consolidated financial statements.
In addition, the Trust has assessed new and revised accounting pronouncements that have been issued that are not yet effective 
and determined the following may have a significant impact on the Trust:
In  December  2008,  the  CICA  issued  Section  1582 “Business  Combinations”,  which  will  replace  CICA  Section  1581  of  the  same 
name. Under this guidance, the purchase price used in a business combination is based on the fair value of shares exchanged at the 
market  price  at  the  date  of  the  exchange.  Currently  the  purchase  price  used  is  based  on  the  market  price  of  the  shares  for  a 
reasonable period before and after the date the acquisition is agreed upon and announced. This new guidance generally requires all 
acquisition  costs  to  be  expensed,  which  currently  are  capitalized  as  part  of  the  purchase  price.  Contingent  liabilities  are  to  be 
recognized at fair value at the acquisition date and remeasured at fair value through earnings each period until settled. Currently, 
only  contingent  liabilities  that  are  resolved  and  payable  are  included  in  the  cost  to  acquire  the  business.  In  addition,  negative 
goodwill is required to be recognized immediately in earnings, unlike the current requirement to eliminate it by deducting it from the 
non-current assets in the purchase price allocation. Section 1582 will be effective for the Trust on January 1, 2011, with prospective 
application. The Trust is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the new Section on its consolidated financial statements.
In December 2008, the CICA issued Sections 1601 “Consolidated Financial Statements”, and 1602 “Non-controlling Interests”, which 
replaces  existing  guidance  under  Section  1600 “Consolidated  Financial  Statements”.  Section  1601  establishes  standards  for  the 
preparation of consolidated financial statements. Section 1602 provides guidance on accounting for a non-controlling interest in a 
subsidiary in consolidated financial statements subsequent to a business combination. These standards will be effective for the Trust 
on January 1, 2011. The Trust is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of these new Sections on its consolidated financial 
statements.
Z A R G O N   E N E R G Y   T R U S T   2 4
In January 2006, the CICA Accounting Standards Board (“AcSB”) adopted a strategic plan for the direction of accounting standards 
in Canada. As part of that plan, the AcSB confirmed in February 2008 that International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) will 
replace Canadian  GAAP  in  2011  for  profit-oriented  Canadian publicly  accountable  enterprises. The Trust  is  currently  reviewing  the 
standards  to  determine  the  potential  impact  on  its  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  Trust,  with  the  assistance  of  an 
independent consulting firm, has performed a diagnostic analysis that identifies differences between the Trust’s current accounting 
policies and IFRS. At this time, the Trust is evaluating the impact of these differences and assessing the need for amendments to 
existing accounting policies in order to comply with IFRS.
The International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) has issued amendments to IFRS 1, which addresses first time adoption of 
IFRS.   The  IASB  will  allow  additional optional  exemptions,  one  of  which  relates  to  full  cost  oil and  gas  accounting,  resulting in a 
reduced administrative  transition  from  the  current  Canadian  full  cost  accounting  for  oil  and  gas  activities  to IFRS. The  election is 
available at the time of adoption only. The exemption would permit the Trust to measure exploration and evaluation assets under 
IFRS at the carrying amount determined under Canadian GAAP at the date of transition to IFRS.  In addition, the carrying amount 
under Canadian GAAP of production or development assets could be allocated on a pro rata basis to the underlying assets using 
either reserve volumes or reserve values at the date of transition.  The assets to which this exemption is applied would be required 
to be tested for impairment at the date of transition under IFRS standards.
3.  ACQU IS ITIONS

On April 29, 2009, a subsidiary of the Trust acquired all of the outstanding shares of Masters Energy Inc. (“Masters”), a public oil

(1)  As a result of shareholders redeeming exchangeable shares, property and equipment has cumulatively increased $55.24 million, $0.09 million relating to the 
first six months of 2009, $3.39 million relating to 2008 and $51.76 million relating to prior years. The effect of these increases has resulted in additional 
depletion and depreciation expense of approximately $24.78 million, $2.47 million relating to the first six months of 2009, $5.59 million relating to 2008, and 
$16.72 million relating to prior years.
5.  LONG TERM DEBT 
On July 27, 2009, Zargon amended and renewed its syndicated committed credit facilities, the result of which was the maintaining 
of  the  available  facilities  and  borrowing  base  of  $180  million. These  facilities  consist  of  a  $170  million  tranche  available  to  the 
Canadian borrower and a US $8 million tranche available to the US borrower. A $300 million demand debenture on the assets of the 
subsidiaries of the Trust has been provided as security for these facilities. The facilities are fully revolving for a 336 day period with 
the provision for an annual extension at the option of the lenders and upon notice from Zargon’s management. The next renewal 
date is June 29, 2010. Should the facilities not be renewed, they convert to one year non-revolving term facilities at the end of the 
revolving 336 day period. Repayment would not be required until the end of the non-revolving term, and, as such, these facilities 
have been classified as long term debt.
Interest rates fluctuate under the syndicated facilities with Canadian prime, US prime and US base rates plus an applicable margin 
between 125 basis points and 275 basis points (2008 – zero and 32.5 basis points, respectively), as well as with Canadian banker’s 
acceptance and LIBOR rates plus an applicable margin between 275 basis points and 425 basis points (2008 – 97.5 and 157.5 basis 
points,  respectively). At  June  30,  2009,  $70.43  million  (December  31,  2008  -  $77.58  million)  had  been  drawn  on  the  syndicated 
committed credit facilities with any unused amounts subject to standby fees. In the normal course of operations Zargon enters into 
various letters of credit. At June 30, 2009, the approximate value of outstanding letters of credit totalled $0.50 million (December 
31, 2008 - $0.52 million).

The proforma total units outstanding at June 30, 2009, including trust units outstanding and trust units issuable upon conversion of 
exchangeable shares, after giving effect to the exchange ratio at the end of the period (see note 8) is 25.283 million units.
On June 5, 2009, the Trust closed an offering of 2.365 million trust units on a bought deal basis at $15.00 per unit for total gross 
proceeds of $35.48 million ($33.44 million net of issue costs).

(1)  During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Trust issued 10,000 unit appreciation rights (“UARS”). The intrinsic value at June 30, 2009 has decreased by 0.02 
million since December 31, 2008 ($0.04 million). These UARS are awards entitling the recipients to receive cash in an amount equivalent to any excess of 
the market value of a stated number of units over a stated price. UARS are included in unit-based compensation expense; however rewards settled in cash 
are liabilities and therefore are not included in contributed surplus.
Trust Unit Rights Incentive Plans and Unit-Based Compensation 
The Trust  has  a  unit  rights  incentive  plan  (the “Old  Plan”)  that  allows  the Trust  to  issue  rights  to  acquire  trust  units  to  directors, 
officers, employees and other service providers. On April 22, 2009, a new unit rights incentive plan (the “New Plan”) was approved. 
The Trust  is  authorized  to  issue  up  to  an  aggregate  of  2.13  million  unit  rights;  however,  the  number  of  trust  units  reserved  for 
issuance upon exercise of the rights shall not at any time exceed 10 percent of the aggregate number of the total outstanding units, 
including  units  issuable  upon  exchange  of  exchangeable  shares  of  Zargon  and  other  fully  paid  securities  of  Zargon  entities 
exchangeable  into  units,  which  are  the  economic  equivalent  of  units  including  full  voting  rights.  At  the  time  of  grant,  unit  right 
exercise  prices  approximate  the  market  price  for  the  trust  units.  At  the  time  of  exercise,  the  rights  holder  has  the  option  of 
exercising at the original grant price or the exercise price as calculated under the Old Plan or the New Plan (the “modified price”). 
Under the Old Plan, the modified price was based on the increment of the amount the monthly distribution exceeded a monthly 
return of 0.833 percent of the Trust’s recorded net book value of oil and natural gas properties (as defined in the Old Plan). Under the 
New Plan, if the monthly distribution exceeds the monthly return of 0.833 percent of the Trust’s recorded net book value of oil and 
natural gas properties (as defined in the New Plan), the entire amount (not the increment) of the distribution is deducted from the 
original grant price. Rights granted under either Plan generally vest over a three-year period and expire approximately five years from 
the grant date. Zargon uses a fair value methodology to value the unit rights grants.
The  weighted  average  assumptions  made  for  unit  rights  granted  for  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2009  include  a 
volatility factor of expected market price of 34.5 percent, a risk-free interest rate of 1.6 percent and an expected life of the unit rights 
of four years. The fair value of the unit rights granted in the quarter was calculated at $4.43 per unit right. Unit-based compensation
Z A R G O N   E N E R G Y   T R U S T   2 8
expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 of $0.28 million (2008 - $0.26 million) and $0.44 million (2008 - $0.52 
million), respectively.
Compensation expense associated with unit rights granted under either Plan is recognized in earnings over the vesting period of the 
Plan with a corresponding increase in contributed surplus. The exercise of trust unit rights is recorded as an increase in trust units 
with a corresponding reduction in contributed surplus. Forfeiture of rights are recorded as a reduction in expenses in the period in 
which they occur.

8.  NON-CONTROL LING  INTER ES T – EXC HANG EABL E SHARES  
Zargon Oil & Gas Ltd. is authorized to issue an unlimited number of exchangeable shares. The exchangeable shares are convertible 
into trust units at the option of the shareholder, based on the exchange ratio, which is adjusted monthly to reflect the distribution 
paid on the trust units. Cash distributions are not paid on the exchangeable shares. During the six months ended June 30, 2009, a 
total  of  0.01  million  (2008  –  0.02  million)  exchangeable  shares  were  converted  into  0.02  million  (2008  –  0.02  million)  trust  units 
based  on  the  exchange  ratio  at  the  time  of  conversion.  At  June  30,  2009,  the  exchange  ratio  was  1.53987  trust  units  per 
exchangeable share.

Per  EIC-151  “Exchangeable  Securities  Issued  by  Subsidiaries  of  Income Trusts”,  if  certain  conditions  are  met,  the  exchangeable 
shares  issued  by  a  subsidiary  must  be  reflected  as  non-controlling  interest  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and,  in  turn,  net 
earnings must be reduced by the amount of net earnings attributed to the non-controlling interest.
The non-controlling interest on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the book value of exchangeable shares at the time of 
the Plan of Arrangement, plus net earnings attributable to the exchangeable shareholders, less exchangeable shares (and related 
cumulative  earnings)  redeemed. The  net  earnings  attributable  to  the  non-controlling  interest  on  the  consolidated  statements  of 
earnings  and  comprehensive  income  represents  the  cumulative  share  of  net  earnings  attributable  to  the  non-controlling  interest 
based on the trust units issuable for exchangeable shares in proportion to total trust units issued and issuable each period end.

9.   WEIG HTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF TOTAL U NITS 
Basic per unit amounts are calculated using the weighted average number of trust units outstanding during the period. Diluted per 
unit amounts are calculated using the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of unit-based compensation. Diluted 
per unit amounts also include exchangeable shares using the “if-converted” method. Due to the fact that at the time of exercise, 
the rights holder has the option of exercising at the original grant price or a modified price as calculated under the Plans, the prices 
used in the treasury stock calculation are the lower prices calculated under the Plans.

10.  CAPITAL  DISC LOSURES 
The Trust’s capital structure is comprised of unitholders’ equity plus long term debt. The Trust’s objectives when managing its capital 
structure are to:
i)  maintain financial flexibility so as to preserve Zargon’s access to capital markets and its ability to meet its financial obligations;
and
ii) finance internally generated growth as well as acquisitions.
The Trust monitors its capital structure and short term financing requirements using the non-GAAP financial metric of debt net of 
working capital (“net debt”) to funds flow from operating activities. Net debt, as used by the Trust, is calculated as bank debt and 
any  working  capital  deficit  excluding  the  current  portion  of  unrealized  risk  management  assets  and  liabilities  and  future  income 
taxes. Funds flow from operating activities represents net earnings/losses and asset retirement expenditures except for non-cash 
items. The metric is used to steward the Trust’s overall debt position as a measure of the Trust’s overall financial strength and is 
calculated as follows:
($ thousands, except ratio)

1.0
87,707
106,909
0.8
Zargon’s net debt to funds flow from operating activities ratio was 1.0, an increase from 0.8 at December 31, 2008, primarily due to 
weak commodity prices negatively affecting funds flow from operating activities.  Bank debt levels decreased in the current quarter 
when the Trust closed on offering of 2.365 million trust units on a bought deal basis of $15.00 per unit for total gross proceeds of 
$35.48 million ($33.44 million net of issue costs). On July 27, 2009, Zargon amended and renewed its syndicated committed credit 
facilities  of  $180  million. The  next  renewal  date  is  June  29,  2010. These  facilities  continue  to  be  available  for  general  corporate 
purposes and the potential acquisition of oil and natural gas properties.
To manage its capital structure, the Trust may adjust capital spending, adjust distributions paid to unitholders, issue new units, issue 
new debt or repay existing debt.
The Trust’s capital management objectives, evaluation measures, definitions and targets have remained unchanged over the periods 
presented.  Zargon  is subject  to  certain  financial  covenants  in  its  credit  facility  agreements and  is in  compliance  with all  financial 
covenants.
11.  FIN ANC IAL  IN STRUMEN TS AND RIS K MAN AGEMEN T CO NTRACTS 
All financial instruments are required to be measured at fair value on initial recognition of the instrument, except for certain related 
party  transactions.  Measurement  in  subsequent  periods  depends  on  whether  the  financial  instrument  has  been  classified  as 
“held-for-trading”,  “available-for-sale”,  “held-to-maturity”,  “loans  and  receivables”,  or  “other  financial  liabilities”  as  defined  by  CICA 
Section 3855.
Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  classified  as  “held-for-trading”  are  measured  at  fair  value  with  changes  in  fair  value 
recognized  in  earnings.  Financial  assets  classified  as  “available-for-sale”  are  measured  at  fair  value,  with  changes  in  fair  value 
recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  (“OCI”)  until  the  asset  is  removed  from  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Financial 
assets classified as “held-to-maturity”, “loans and receivables” and “other financial liabilities” are measured at amortized cost using 
the effective interest method of amortization.
Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities 
Zargon’s financial assets and liabilities are comprised of accounts receivable, deposits, accounts payable, cash distributions payable, 
unrealized  risk  management  assets  and  liabilities  and  long  term  debt.  Fair  values  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities,  summarized 
information  related  to  risk  management  positions  and  discussion  of  risks  associated  with  financial  assets  and  liabilities  are 
presented as follows:
A)  Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities
3 1   S E C O N D   Q U A R T E R   R E P O R T   2 0 0 9
Accounts receivable are designated as “loans and receivables”. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities, cash distributions payable 
and long term debt are designated as “other liabilities”. The fair values of these accounts approximate their carrying amounts.
Risk  management  assets  and  liabilities  are  derivative  financial  instruments  classified  as  “held-for-trading”.  These  accounts  are 
recorded at their estimated fair value using quoted market prices.
B)  Risk Management Assets and Liabilities
The Trust is a party to certain financial instruments that have fixed the price of a portion of its oil and natural gas production and 
foreign exchange conversion rates. The Trust enters into these contracts for risk management purposes only, in order to protect a 
portion of its future cash flow from the volatility of oil and natural gas commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. For financial 
risk  management  contracts,  the Trust  considers  these  contracts  to  be  effective  on  an  economic  basis  but  has  decided  not  to 
designate  these  contracts  as  hedges  for  accounting  purposes  and,  accordingly,  any  unrealized  gains  or  losses  are  recorded  in 
earnings  based  on  the  fair  value  (mark-to-market)  of  the  contracts  at  year  end. The  unrealized  loss  for  the  first  half  of 2009  was 
$19.83 million and the unrealized loss for the first half of 2008 was $36.49 million.
As at June 30, 2009, the Trust had the following outstanding commodity and foreign currency risk management contracts:

Commodity Price Sensitivities  
The  following  table  summarizes  the  sensitivity  of  the  fair  value  of  the  Trust’s  risk  management  positions  to  fluctuations  in 
commodity prices, with all other variables held constant. When assessing the potential impact of these commodity price changes, 
the Trust believes 10 percent volatility is a reasonable long term measure.
Fluctuations of 10% in commodity prices could have resulted in unrealized gains/(losses) on risk management contracts impacting 
net earnings as follows:

C)  Risks Associated with Financial Assets and Liabilities
The  Trust  is  exposed  to  financial  risks  arising  from  its  financial  assets  and  liabilities.  The  financial  risks  include  market  risk 
(commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates), credit risk and liquidity risk. 
(cid:121)  Market Risk
Market  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  fair  value  or  future  cash  flows  of  financial  assets  or  liabilities  will  fluctuate  due  to  movements  in 
market prices and is comprised of the following:
- Commodity Price Risk
As a means of mitigating exposure to commodity price risk volatility, the Trust has entered into various derivative agreements. The 
use of derivative instruments is governed under formal policies and is subject to limits established by the Board of Directors. The 
Trust’s policy is to not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Natural Gas – To partially mitigate the natural gas commodity price risk, the Trust enters into swaps, which fix the Canadian dollar 
AECO prices.
Crude Oil – The Trust has partially mitigated its exposure to the WTI NYMEX price with fixed price swaps.
- Interest Rate Risk
Borrowings under bank credit facilities are market rate based (variable interest rates); thus, carrying values approximate fair values.
At the June 30, 2009 debt pricing levels, the increase or decrease in net earnings for each one percent change in interest rates 
would amount to $0.44 million (2008 - $0.45 million).
- Foreign Exchange Risk
As Zargon operates in North America, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the US/Canadian dollar can have a significant effect 
on the Trust’s reported results. A $0.01 change in the US to Canadian dollar exchange rate would have resulted in a $0.28 million 
(2008 - $0.58 million) increase or decrease in net earnings at  June 30, 2009. In order to mitigate the Trust’s exposure to foreign 
exchange fluctuations, the Trust enters into foreign exchange derivative agreements. 
(cid:121)  Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial asset will default, resulting in the Trust incurring a financial loss. This credit 
exposure is mitigated with credit practices that limit transactions according to counterparties’ credit quality. A substantial portion of 
the Trust’s accounts receivable are with customers in the oil and gas industry and are subject to normal industry credit risks.
The maximum credit risk exposure associated with accounts receivable, accrued revenues and risk management assets is the total 
carrying  value.  The  Trust  monitors  these  balances  monthly  to  limit  the  risk  associated  with  collection.  Of  Zargon’s  accounts 
receivable at June 30, 2009, approximately 35 percent was owing from two companies and Zargon anticipates full collection. As at 
December 31, 2008, approximately 37 percent was owing.
3 3   S E C O N D   Q U A R T E R   R E P O R T   2 0 0 9
(cid:121)  Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk the Trust will encounter difficulties in meeting its financial liability obligations. The Trust manages its liquidity 
risk through cash and debt management. See note 10 for a more detailed discussion.
As at June 30, 2009, Zargon had available unused committed bank credit facilities of approximately $109.07 million compared to 
$101.90 at December 31, 2008. The Trust believes it has sufficient funding through the use of these facilities to meet foreseeable 
borrowing requirements.
