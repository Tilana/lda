<p><b>  Corrigendum </b> 
</p>
<p><b>1. Paragraph 43 
</b></p>
<p>At the end of the paragraph, <i>add </i> 
</p>
<p>The Human Rights Committee may wish to consider drafting a general comment on the right 
of peaceful assembly set out in article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. An expert discussion on the international legal framework for issues arising from 
peaceful protest may also constitute a next step in the process of defining the human rights 
law dimensions of peaceful protest. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Paragraph 44 
</b></p>
<p>The paragraph <i>should read</i> 
</p>
<p>44. A strong human rights culture and strong rule of law are important prerequisites for 
the protection of rights during peaceful protests, and are conducive to opening the space for 
peaceful protests and to human rights compliant management and policing of such protests, 
in particular because such an environment fosters accountability. In this regard, States should 
ensure that effective accountability mechanisms are in place and that remedies and reparation 
are provided to victims of human rights violations in the context of peaceful protest.
