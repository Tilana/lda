<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twentieth session from 
</p>
<p>27 October to 7 November 2014. The review of San Marino was held at the 6th meeting, on 
</p>
<p>29 October 2014. The delegation of San Marino was headed by Pasquale Valentini, 
</p>
<p>Minister for Foreign Affairs. At its 10th meeting, held on 31 October 2014, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group adopted the report on San Marino. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of San Marino: Burkina Faso, Chile, China. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of San 
</p>
<p>Marino: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation prepared in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/SMR/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/20/SMR/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/20/SMR/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, 
</p>
<p>Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 
</p>
<p>transmitted to San Marino through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet 
</p>
<p>of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of San Marino presented its report for the second cycle of the UPR 
</p>
<p>on the human rights situation. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation noted that, in July 2014, it had presented the national report prepared 
</p>
<p>by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with the Ministries of Internal Affairs, 
</p>
<p>Health, Labour and Education and other government offices. It stated that the national 
</p>
<p>report included the steps taken to implement the recommendations accepted during the first 
</p>
<p>review, noting that several provisions adopted in recent years had been based on those 
</p>
<p>recommendations.  
</p>
<p>7. The delegation explained the approach that San Marino had always held towards the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights in the context of its Declaration on the Citizens&#8217; Rights and 
</p>
<p>Fundamental Principles of San Marino Constitutional Order. The delegation stated that San 
</p>
<p>Marino was one of the few States that, in the field of human rights, did not need internal 
</p>
<p>implementation rules, as international law was an integral part of national law, and even 
</p>
<p>superseded this in the event of any conflict.  
</p>
<p>8. The delegation highlighted the human rights conventions that had been ratified or 
</p>
<p>adopted. On 1 July 2010, San Marino ratified the United Nations Convention against 
</p>
<p>Transnational Organized Crime, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking </p>


<p>in Persons, Especially Women and Children, and the Protocol against the Smuggling of 
</p>
<p>Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing it. On 21 July 2011, it ratified the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in 
</p>
<p>armed conflict (OP-CRC-AC) and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (OP-CRC-SC). 
</p>
<p>On 23 October 2013, it acceded to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the 
</p>
<p>Crime of Genocide, and, on 5 September 2014, approved Law No. 138 on &#8220;Regulations on 
</p>
<p>the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide&#8221;. In recent years, San Marino has 
</p>
<p>ratified the following Council of Europe instruments: the Convention on the Protection of 
</p>
<p>Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse; the Convention on Action against 
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Human Beings; Protocol No. 15 amending the Convention for the Protection 
</p>
<p>of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; and the European Charter of Local Self-
</p>
<p>Government. Furthermore, San Marino signed the Council of Europe Protocol No. 16 to the 
</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and the 
</p>
<p>Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and 
</p>
<p>Domestic Violence. The delegation stated that the ratification procedure was ongoing for 
</p>
<p>both instruments. 
</p>
<p>9. Regarding the question submitted by Liechtenstein, the delegation announced that, 
</p>
<p>having ratified on 21 July 2011 the amendment to article 8 of the Rome Statute of the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court, the ratification process of the amendments to the Statute, on 
</p>
<p>the crime of aggression, was expected to be completed during the current session of 
</p>
<p>Parliament.  
</p>
<p>10. The delegation also addressed the question submitted by the Netherlands on the 
</p>
<p>intentions of San Marino to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and its 
</p>
<p>Additional Protocol. It stated that a study on compliance with the Convention had been 
</p>
<p>completed, though, owing to the necessary adjustment of domestic legislation, the 
</p>
<p>introduction of new technologies and specific training of the personnel involved, San 
</p>
<p>Marino was unable to predict a time frame for accession. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation pointed out that progress had been made in the prevention of 
</p>
<p>violence against women and gender violence, through the approval of Law No. 97 of 
</p>
<p>20 June 2008 on &#8220;Prevention and elimination of violence against women and gender 
</p>
<p>violence&#8221;, which introduced into the San Marino legal system the offences of gang 
</p>
<p>violence, stalking and trafficking in human beings, and modified the offence of 
</p>
<p>enslavement. The delegation also commented that the law established the Authority for 
</p>
<p>Equal Opportunities as a mechanism for monitoring its implementation. The establishment 
</p>
<p>of a dedicated authority allowed legislation on the protection of equal opportunity to be 
</p>
<p>completed. The delegation went on to say that the Authority operates alongside the 
</p>
<p>Commission for Equal Opportunities, which deals with issues related to awareness-raising 
</p>
<p>and the promotion of legislative and non-legislative measures to guarantee the legal 
</p>
<p>equality of citizens. 
</p>
<p>12. On 31 May 2012, a decree was adopted to implement the above-mentioned Law. 
</p>
<p>The decree also established an assistance centre for victims of violence.  
</p>
<p>13. The delegation reported that coordination between the Health Authority and the 
</p>
<p>Authority for Equal Opportunities had been established in order to collect data on violence 
</p>
<p>against women and gender violence in San Marino.  
</p>
<p>14. In addition, the delegation stated that a special study group had been established in 
</p>
<p>order to identify the amendments to be made and the requirements to be met in view of the 
</p>
<p>ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence 
</p>
<p>against women. </p>


<p>15. The delegation said that the Parliament of San Marino had adopted a law that 
</p>
<p>introduced amendments to the Criminal Code and the law aimed at reforming family law, 
</p>
<p>by introducing the prohibition of corporal punishment in the exercise of correction or 
</p>
<p>discipline powers.  
</p>
<p>16. The delegation stated that Law No. 142 of 9 September 2014, entitled &#8220;Legislation 
</p>
<p>relating to specific developmental disorders in schools and training facilities&#8221;, had been 
</p>
<p>approved. That law underlined the importance of the role of education for the development 
</p>
<p>of social integration, as strongly reiterated at the Council of Europe Standing Conference of 
</p>
<p>Ministers of Education, held in Helsinki on 26 and 27 April 2014, and aimed at protecting 
</p>
<p>students with specific developmental disorders and special educational needs.  
</p>
<p>17. In the national report, the delegation cited the work carried out by the Ministries of 
</p>
<p>Education and Health for the development of a framework law on disability. The proposed 
</p>
<p>framework law fully incorporates the principles, definitions and content of the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and includes some instruments that are 
</p>
<p>fundamental to its implementation. The delegation stated that the draft law provides for the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a special commission tasked with monitoring the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>principles contained in the Convention. 
</p>
<p>18. The delegation stated that, in response to the recommendations of the Council of 
</p>
<p>Europe Group of States against corruption (GRECO), Law No. 141 of 5 September 2014 
</p>
<p>introduced the &#8220;Code of Conduct of Public Officials&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>19. In response to the question submitted by the Netherlands, the delegation stated that 
</p>
<p>the recommendation made by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance of 
</p>
<p>the Council of Europe on the San Marino Commission for Equal Opportunities had been 
</p>
<p>assessed by the Commission and that it had transmitted its opinion. In the light of this, the 
</p>
<p>Government intended to work with the Commission to develop the necessary measures for 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>20. In reply to the question submitted by Slovenia concerning the measures adopted to 
</p>
<p>improve prison detention conditions in San Marino, the delegation stated that procedures 
</p>
<p>had improved in recent years. According to the delegation, San Marino had acceded in 
</p>
<p>December 1989 to the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or 
</p>
<p>Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The delegation reported that, since then,  a delegation 
</p>
<p>from the Council of Europe European Committee for the Prevention of Torture had visited 
</p>
<p>San Marino four times: in March 1992, June 1999, February 2005 and January 2013. 
</p>
<p>21. With respect to the second question submitted by Slovenia, on raising the minimum 
</p>
<p>age for military recruitment to 18, the delegation stated that the age of 16 for recruitment in 
</p>
<p>the case of general mobilization had been established in previous regulations, which San 
</p>
<p>Marino had long planned to change. The delegation explained that the delay in the 
</p>
<p>amendment of that provision was due to the fact that the measure was part of a more 
</p>
<p>complex ongoing reform concerning the reorganization of the military corps and its 
</p>
<p>regulations. 
</p>
<p>22. In response to the question from Mexico on the freedom of expression in electronic 
</p>
<p>format and the sanctions for improper and legally actionable conduct in the field of 
</p>
<p>publishing and freedom of the media, the delegation stated that a new law sought to balance 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression and protection of the dignity, integrity and privacy of the individual. 
</p>
<p>The delegation explained that, under that new law, certain modes of expression of 
</p>
<p>information had been regulated by introducing a code of ethics for operators and an 
</p>
<p>authority that monitored any abuses or distortions. Moreover, the new law established and 
</p>
<p>governed more flexible instruments for the protection of citizens and more accessible 
</p>
<p>appeal procedures for individuals.  </p>


<p>23. The delegation reported that the law also specifically regulated the field of 
</p>
<p>newspapers and online publications, by making them equal in all aspects and effects to 
</p>
<p>paper publications, with the obvious differences related to the diversity of the means of 
</p>
<p>expression.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>24. During the interactive dialogue, 35 delegations made statements. The 
</p>
<p>recommendations made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>25. Kuwait commended the efforts to promote and protect human rights and welcomed 
</p>
<p>the ratification of a number of international conventions and protocols since 2010, 
</p>
<p>including OP-CRC-SC; the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
</p>
<p>Crime and two Protocols supplementing it; and the Convention on the Prevention and 
</p>
<p>Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. It noted commendable efforts that San Marino had 
</p>
<p>made for the promotion of the rights of persons with disabilities and the accession to related 
</p>
<p>conventions. Kuwait made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>26. Malaysia noted the transparent and consultative approach taken by San Marino with 
</p>
<p>respect to the UPR and the progress made in the field of human rights, through its 
</p>
<p>commitment to implementing the recommendations accepted during the first cycle of the 
</p>
<p>UPR and the introduction of various legislative and institutional measures. In particular, 
</p>
<p>Malaysia commended San Marino for ongoing and continuous steps to protect women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights and promote the role of women in the country, and measures to further integrate 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities into society, in line with its obligations under CRPD, amongst 
</p>
<p>others. It noted the adoption of important laws and provisions relating to violence against 
</p>
<p>women and the enforcement of measures for the protection of women, expressed 
</p>
<p>appreciation for the strong belief of San Marino in the value of the family for human 
</p>
<p>development and its efforts to protect the family institution, and encouraged them to 
</p>
<p>continue in that regard. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Mexico welcomed the adoption of international instruments since the first cycle of 
</p>
<p>the UPR. In particular, it noted the ratification of OP-CRC-SC, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and two Protocols supplementing it. It 
</p>
<p>recognized the advances made in combating domestic violence, notably through the 
</p>
<p>implementation of prevention programmes and the provision of medical and psychological 
</p>
<p>support for victims. It thanked San Marino for the response to its query regarding freedom 
</p>
<p>of expression. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Monaco welcomed the advances made regarding the rights of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, notably the steps taken to implement CRPD, as well as the extension of the 
</p>
<p>advantages to adoptive and foster parents granted under Law No. 43/2014. Monaco 
</p>
<p>requested further information on the functioning of the residential centre for persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities. It welcomed the ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC. Monaco made a 
</p>
<p>recommendation.  
</p>
<p>29. Montenegro commended San Marino for its commitment to the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights, expressing appreciation of its efforts to abolish the death 
</p>
<p>penalty and protect the rights of women and children. While welcoming the dedication of 
</p>
<p>San Marino to the UPR process, Montenegro observed that reports to several committees 
</p>
<p>on the implementation of core human rights instruments were still overdue, and encouraged 
</p>
<p>the Government of San Marino to make additional efforts to improve cooperation with the 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies system. It noted the requests made by the Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>concerning the introduction of a juvenile criminal justice system and asked San Marino to 
</p>
<p>elaborate on the activities taken in that regard. Montenegro made recommendations. </p>


<p>30. The Netherlands commended San Marino on its human rights record and efforts to 
</p>
<p>ratify related instruments. In particular, it welcomed the ratification of the OP-CRC-SC and 
</p>
<p>OP-CRC-AC, as well as the accession to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment 
</p>
<p>of the Crime of Genocide. However, it noted that the independent information and 
</p>
<p>concluding observations of the treaty bodies were out of date, as some country reports were 
</p>
<p>still outstanding. The Netherlands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. The Philippines recognized the strong commitment of the Government of San 
</p>
<p>Marino to the overall development of the country and the fulfilment of the human rights of 
</p>
<p>its people and lauded the accession of San Marino to a number of international human 
</p>
<p>rights conventions in the period under review, particularly its ratification of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and two Protocols 
</p>
<p>supplementing it. It asked how San Marino, as an advocate of women&#8217;s rights, could 
</p>
<p>contribute to the strengthening of regional and international cooperation or partnerships in 
</p>
<p>combating trafficking in women and girls. It noted the remarkable progress achieved by 
</p>
<p>San Marino in the realization of the right to an adequate standard of living and the 
</p>
<p>provision of welfare programmes and other social safety nets for citizens who became 
</p>
<p>vulnerable as a result of the recent global financial instability. The Philippines made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Portugal praised the commitment of San Marino to the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations accepted during the first cycle and welcomed the ratification of OP-CRC-
</p>
<p>SC and OP-CRC-AC. It noted that, although San Marino had accepted a recommendation 
</p>
<p>during the first cycle of the UPR to improve timely reporting, 10 reports to the treaty bodies 
</p>
<p>were still overdue. It welcomed the creation of a working group to prepare a draft law to 
</p>
<p>adapt San Marino&#8217;s legal terminology regarding the concepts of legitimate and natural 
</p>
<p>children, and encouraged efforts in that regard. Portugal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Serbia congratulated San Marino for its dedication to human rights, democracy and 
</p>
<p>the rule of law and noted San Marino&#8217;s efforts to align domestic legislation with 
</p>
<p>international standards, as well as its pledge to comply with international treaties. It 
</p>
<p>applauded San Marino&#8217;s advocacy work to abolish the death penalty worldwide and 
</p>
<p>commended efforts to implement recommendations made by the European Committee for 
</p>
<p>the Prevention of Torture. It noted that constitutional and legislative norms and ratified 
</p>
<p>international treaties on human rights guaranteed equality and freedom from discrimination, 
</p>
<p>and encouraged San Marino to continue its positive promotion of the principle of equality 
</p>
<p>and non-discrimination, taking into account all relevant recommendations of the European 
</p>
<p>Commission against racism and intolerance. Serbia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>34. Sierra Leone commended San Marino&#8217;s efforts to promote and protect human rights 
</p>
<p>in spite of the international economic crisis, which has affected the strategies and measures 
</p>
<p>taken to address the right to a fair trial, as well as the death penalty, violence against 
</p>
<p>women and domestic violence. It was interested to note that San Marino had been the third 
</p>
<p>country to abolish the death penalty. It appreciated efforts to align domestic legislation with 
</p>
<p>international human rights instruments and commended measures to ensure freedom of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief. It acknowledged San Marino&#8217;s efforts to sign, ratify or accede to more 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments since the first cycle of the UPR, but noted that further efforts 
</p>
<p>were required to address racism, xenophobia and corruption. It lauded San Marino&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>financial contribution to OHCHR in 2011 and 2013. Sierra Leone made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Singapore commended the efforts taken by San Marino to combat domestic 
</p>
<p>violence, noting the role played by the Authority for Equal Opportunities in enforcing the 
</p>
<p>Law on the Prevention and Elimination of Violence against Women and Gender Violence, 
</p>
<p>implementing the related decree (97) to assist victims of violence and promoting public 
</p>
<p>awareness on services available, including shelter for victims of domestic violence. A 
</p>
<p>technical-institutional panel of experts was set up in 2012 to improve coordination among </p>


<p>agencies in addressing domestic violence. Singapore noted efforts to build an inclusive 
</p>
<p>society for persons with disabilities, including the drafting of a framework law on disability 
</p>
<p>to strengthen implementation of CRPD, and the preparation of decrees on specific policy 
</p>
<p>themes, such the elimination of architectural barriers, as well as job placements, health and 
</p>
<p>social inclusion. Singapore made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Slovenia noted the implementation of the majority of recommendations accepted 
</p>
<p>under the first cycle of the UPR, including ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC. It 
</p>
<p>noted progress made in the field of anti-discrimination and thanked San Marino for 
</p>
<p>responding to its question on steps taken to improve prison detention conditions. Following 
</p>
<p>the request from the Human Rights Committee, Slovenia requested information on 
</p>
<p>measures that could be taken to modify legislation (article 3 of Act No. 15 of 26 January 
</p>
<p>1990) regarding the exceptional circumstances in which all citizens aged 16 to 60 could be 
</p>
<p>conscripted. Slovenia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>37. Spain welcomed the delegation of San Marino and thanked it for its presentation and 
</p>
<p>the replies to its advanced questions. It congratulated the country on the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>Law on Provisions on Maltreatment within the Family and on Children by the Great and 
</p>
<p>General Council. Spain noted the concerns expressed by the Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>regarding the failure of San Marino to approve a new Code of Criminal Procedure. Spain 
</p>
<p>made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Thailand commended the efforts made by San Marino since its first review, 
</p>
<p>particularly human rights awareness-raising initiatives and the improvement of its 
</p>
<p>normative framework in various areas, aimed at better integration of foreigners and 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups. It expressed appreciation of progress in the protection of children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights, particularly regarding ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC. It expressed 
</p>
<p>interest in the recent examination of a draft law on provisions against child maltreatment in 
</p>
<p>the family and looked forwards to its adoption. While noting steps already taken to better 
</p>
<p>protect the rights of persons with disabilities, Thailand considered that further efforts could 
</p>
<p>be made to promote independent living and better integration into society. Thailand made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Ukraine noted the ratification since the last review of important international human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms and the alignment of domestic legislation with relevant international 
</p>
<p>standards. It appreciated the progress made to protect and promote the rights of its citizens, 
</p>
<p>particularly regarding women&#8217;s rights and gender equality. It recognized the increased 
</p>
<p>representation of women in the San Marino Parliament and encouraged it to take further 
</p>
<p>steps in empowering women to end the underrepresentation of women in the Government, 
</p>
<p>particularly in ministerial positions. Ukraine welcomed efforts regarding freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression, particularly the initiation of procedures on a new draft law on publishing and 
</p>
<p>the profession of media operators, and expressed hope that it would be swiftly adopted and 
</p>
<p>compliant with corresponding international standards. 
</p>
<p>40. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed San Marino&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>firm commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. It commended San 
</p>
<p>Marino for its ongoing efforts to reflect international human rights standards in domestic 
</p>
<p>legislation. The United Kingdom made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. The United States of America commended San Marino&#8217;s exemplary human rights 
</p>
<p>record, longstanding commitment to democracy and the promotion and protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights. While recognizing that labour standards were generally well enforced, it expressed 
</p>
<p>concern that some employers did not consistently abide by safety regulations, including 
</p>
<p>limitations on working hours and the use of personal safety devices, particularly in the 
</p>
<p>informal labour market. It noted that the Ministry for Territory and Environment had not </p>


<p>fully implemented a law that mandated easier access to public buildings for persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, and that many buildings remained inaccessible. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>42. Uruguay noted San Marino&#8217;s ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC, and its 
</p>
<p>accession to regional human rights instruments. It noted the draft law to prohibit the 
</p>
<p>corporal punishment of children in all settings, including at home and in day care, and 
</p>
<p>hoped that it would be discussed fruitfully by the Parliament in order to meet San Marino&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>commitments pursuant to the first cycle of the UPR. It noted San Marino&#8217;s efforts to 
</p>
<p>comply with its international obligations, in particular regular reporting to treaty bodies. It 
</p>
<p>encouraged San Marino to continue those efforts and its cooperation with OHCHR. It 
</p>
<p>welcomed that San Marino was considering acceding to the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR). Uruguay 
</p>
<p>made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>43. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela emphasized San Marino&#8217;s political 
</p>
<p>commitment to implementing recommendations accepted during the first cycle of the UPR, 
</p>
<p>despite the serious international economic crisis. It noted San Marino&#8217;s adherence to 
</p>
<p>international instruments, including the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
</p>
<p>Organized Crime and two Protocols supplementing it, the Convention on the Prevention 
</p>
<p>and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, OP-CRC-SC and OP-CRC-AC. It commended 
</p>
<p>progress made in the legal sphere to promote equality of all people before the law and 
</p>
<p>protect the rights and freedoms of the population and acknowledged the policies to protect 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights and promote their participation in society through the adoption of important 
</p>
<p>legal provisions and measures relating to the protection of women from violence. It made a 
</p>
<p>recommendation. 
</p>
<p>44. Algeria congratulated San Marino on the ratification of OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-
</p>
<p>SC; as well as the adoption of legal provisions relating to violence against women and the 
</p>
<p>promulgation of texts to improve the effectiveness of the legal system, particularly in the 
</p>
<p>area of criminal law. It welcomed the measures taken to consolidate the protection of the 
</p>
<p>family and its solidarity. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Argentina welcomed the delegation of San Marino. It congratulated San Marino for 
</p>
<p>acceding to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. 
</p>
<p>Argentina made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Australia, commending San Marino&#8217;s exemplary human rights record, noted that its 
</p>
<p>human rights framework valued the integrity of the person, afforded a high degree of 
</p>
<p>political participation and enforced civil liberties. Despite the fact that the Declaration on 
</p>
<p>the Citizens&#8217; Rights and Fundamental Principles of San Marino Constitutional Order 
</p>
<p>prohibited discrimination on all grounds, it was concerned that same-sex couples still 
</p>
<p>encountered discrimination in some basic rights, including residency and inheritance. It 
</p>
<p>commended efforts to protect the rights of persons with disabilities in many areas, 
</p>
<p>particularly employment, education, health care and other state services. Australia made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. Brazil welcomed the ratification of OP-CRC-AC, OP-CRC-SC and the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and the enactment of 
</p>
<p>legislation on maltreatment within the family and on children. It maintained that it was 
</p>
<p>important to increase awareness of the importance of combating racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination and xenophobia, through the effective implementation of Law No. 66 on 
</p>
<p>provisions against racial, ethnic and religious discrimination. Noting that Decree 
</p>
<p>No. 60/2012 established various forms of assistance to women who were victims of 
</p>
<p>violence, Brazil asked what specific measures had been taken to prevent gender-based and 
</p>
<p>domestic violence. Brazil made recommendations. </p>


<p>48. Burkina Faso noted San Marino&#8217;s commitment to cooperate with human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, including its standing invitation to the special procedures of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council. It welcomed efforts to abolish the death penalty, combat transnational 
</p>
<p>organized crime, legalize the residence status of foreign nationals and support workers who 
</p>
<p>were victims of the economic crisis. It commended the ratification of various human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments, notably OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC, and regional instruments, by acceding 
</p>
<p>to instruments containing complaint mechanisms and enabling individuals to seek 
</p>
<p>reparation. It welcomed the adoption of legislation to protect female victims of violence, 
</p>
<p>including domestic violence, and actions in favour of children and persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>It encouraged the establishment of the National Observatory on the Family, increased 
</p>
<p>efforts to promote human rights in its educational system and improved reporting to treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies. 
</p>
<p>49. Canada asked San Marino to provide up-to-date information regarding steps to 
</p>
<p>establish an independent ombudsman for the protection and promotion of human rights, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions (Paris 
</p>
<p>Principles). It noted that San Marino had ratified OP-CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC, and had 
</p>
<p>welcomed the contribution that those instruments made to the protection of the rights of 
</p>
<p>children. Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Costa Rica thanked San Marino for the presentation of its national report and 
</p>
<p>congratulated the progress made in the promotion and protection of human rights. It noted 
</p>
<p>that San Marino had ratified several international instruments and had been the first State 
</p>
<p>party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to ratify the amendment to 
</p>
<p>article 8 of that Statute. It welcomed the adoption of measures to prohibit the corporal 
</p>
<p>punishment of children and those that had raised the minimum age of criminal 
</p>
<p>responsibility. Costa Rica made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire said that the national report indicated the constant commitment of the 
</p>
<p>Government of San Marino to the promotion and protection of human rights, through the 
</p>
<p>adoption of various measures and policies for the promotion of equality for all, such as 
</p>
<p>those aimed at combating discrimination; protecting women, children, elderly persons and 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities; combating domestic violence; and strengthening the judicial, 
</p>
<p>political and social systems. Those measures demonstrated the importance that San Marino 
</p>
<p>placed on international obligations and on the protection of fundamental freedoms. It 
</p>
<p>encouraged San Marino to continue to cooperate with international human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Estonia noted San Marino&#8217;s accession to most core international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments and its standing invitation to the special procedures of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council. However, it raised concern at the lack of reporting to the treaty bodies and hoped 
</p>
<p>that San Marino would make positive steps in that regard. It commended the ratification of 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
</p>
<p>and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children supplementing it, OP-
</p>
<p>CRC-SC and OP-CRC-AC. In that regard, it called upon San Marino to review the law on 
</p>
<p>extraordinary military conscription and withdraw the relevant clauses of that law to bring it 
</p>
<p>into compliance with OP-CRC-AC. The protection of women&#8217;s rights and their 
</p>
<p>participation in society was a priority and should continue. There was a need for a freedom 
</p>
<p>of information law in accordance with international standards. Estonia made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. France welcomed the delegation from San Marino. It welcomed the commitment 
</p>
<p>shown by San Marino in favour of human rights, and its accession to various international 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments since its review under the first cycle of the UPR. France made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. </p>


<p>54. Germany thanked San Marino for its national report and welcomed the progress 
</p>
<p>made by the country since the first cycle of the UPR, for example, regarding its human 
</p>
<p>rights legislation. It commended San Marino&#8217;s cooperation with civil society, OHCHR, the 
</p>
<p>special procedures of the Human Rights Council and United Nations treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Ghana welcomed the delegation of San Marino and applauded the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>dedication to the UPR process. Ghana made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. The Holy See welcomed steps taken since the first cycle of the UPR to promote and 
</p>
<p>protect human rights and strengthen legislation and on the administration of justice in line 
</p>
<p>with international instruments. It commended the continued protection of the institution of 
</p>
<p>the family as a union based on a stable relationship between a man and a woman, and the 
</p>
<p>related legislation that extended the right of a parent to be absent from the workplace when 
</p>
<p>his or her child was ill or to assist family members who required special assistance, 
</p>
<p>including owing to disability or serious age-related disease. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Indonesia applauded the priority given to the protection of women&#8217;s rights in 
</p>
<p>national policy and the adoption and effective implementation of Law No. 97/2008 on the 
</p>
<p>prevention and elimination of violence against women and gender violence. The 
</p>
<p>establishment of a national human rights institution in line with the Paris Principles would 
</p>
<p>further support San Marino&#8217;s efforts to combat violence against women, as well as its 
</p>
<p>efforts in other areas. Indonesia noted that San Marino had ratified several international 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments. The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
</p>
<p>All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW) would be particularly 
</p>
<p>relevant, as one third of San Marino&#8217;s population lived abroad. Indonesia made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Ireland commended San Marino for extending a standing invitation to the special 
</p>
<p>procedures of the Human Rights Council. However, it noted that a significant number of 
</p>
<p>reports to the treaty bodies were overdue. It welcomed San Marino&#8217;s ratification of OP-
</p>
<p>CRC-AC and OP-CRC-SC. Ireland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Italy commended San Marino for its commitment to cooperating with international 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms, and for extending a standing invitation to the special procedures 
</p>
<p>of the Human Rights Council. It noted the difficulties faced by San Marino in fulfilling its 
</p>
<p>reporting obligations, and the measures it had taken to end the backlog. It encouraged San 
</p>
<p>Marino to consider best practices and expedite the drafting of reports under the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It asked for information about the 
</p>
<p>function, lessons learned and best practices of the panel created to coordinate measures to 
</p>
<p>prevent and combat violence against women. It asked whether San Marino would consider 
</p>
<p>the establishment of a formal procedure for processing asylum requests. Italy made a 
</p>
<p>recommendation. 
</p>
<p>60. San Marino thanked all the delegations for their interesting and valuable 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. As regards the treatment of asylum applications, the Minister for Foreign Affairs 
</p>
<p>informed the delegations that it was not foreseen to introduce a relevant procedure, given 
</p>
<p>the very low number of applications received in recent years, often submitted by persons 
</p>
<p>from countries that upheld high human rights standards. Establishing a procedure to 
</p>
<p>determine refugee status would prove problematic owing to the lack of border control 
</p>
<p>between Italy and San Marino. 
</p>
<p>62. In the case of foreigners who were unable to return to their home countries, he said 
</p>
<p>that the Government of San Marino may issue an extraordinary stay permit for 
</p>
<p>humanitarian and social protection reasons issued on a case-by-case basis. Beneficiaries </p>


<p>would then be entitled to temporary medical and financial assistance provided by the Social 
</p>
<p>Welfare Institute. 
</p>
<p>63. With respect to questions related to discrimination, including on the basis of sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation and gender identity, and on the need to protect single-parent and non-
</p>
<p>conventional families, he said that all people were equal before the law and all forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination were rejected under the Declaration of Citizens&#8217; Rights. All sectors of the 
</p>
<p>public administration were also abiding by that principle. Such prohibition was reinforced 
</p>
<p>by Law No. 66/2008, which punished anyone who incites or commits any act of 
</p>
<p>discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Law considered it an aggravating 
</p>
<p>circumstance. 
</p>
<p>64. Despite the lack of a national plan against discrimination, he said that San Marino 
</p>
<p>had participated in international campaigns and had carried out national initiatives to raise 
</p>
<p>awareness in that field. 
</p>
<p>65. The Minister said that great importance had been attached to the role played by the 
</p>
<p>Authority and the Commission for Equal Opportunities, which have jointly promoted 
</p>
<p>actions to encourage the participation of all citizens in the political, social and economic 
</p>
<p>life according to the principle of legal equality. 
</p>
<p>66. In that regard, he said that school played a major role. Respect for diversity was 
</p>
<p>discussed and promoted in all school grades, thus favouring integration, learning about 
</p>
<p>different cultures, understanding and tolerance. The fight against discrimination was a 
</p>
<p>practical experience in school, which contributed effectively to inclusion. All children 
</p>
<p>residing in San Marino, including on a temporary basis, were provided with a free 
</p>
<p>education. All children with disabilities, including those with severe disabilities, had access 
</p>
<p>to education, including through the support of professionals and personalized didactical 
</p>
<p>tools. 
</p>
<p>67. Regarding the question of single-parent and non-conventional families, he said that, 
</p>
<p>in San Marino, there had been a growing number of unmarried cohabiting couples. Also, 
</p>
<p>that category of persons was recognized and protected by San Marino family law. Indeed, 
</p>
<p>children born from those relationships enjoyed the same rights as those of children born in 
</p>
<p>wedlock. In that regard, attention was also brought to single-parent families who, on 
</p>
<p>account of their inherent characteristics, required stronger protection. Due consideration 
</p>
<p>had also been given to single-parent families by allowing single people to adopt children. 
</p>
<p>68. The Minister said that a national debate, encouraged by civil society, was ongoing 
</p>
<p>about same-sex unions. Parliament had recently addressed the issue and had decided not to 
</p>
<p>consider same-sex unions on an equal footing to traditional households. Cohabitation 
</p>
<p>between persons of the same sex was recognized if they are entitled to live in the territory, 
</p>
<p>but their rights and duties were regulated by private law. 
</p>
<p>69. As for human rights education, he said that San Marino was committed to the 
</p>
<p>promotion of human rights in education by implementing relevant projects, including 
</p>
<p>training for teachers and the involvement of families. 
</p>
<p>70. He said that education on human rights and the protection and respect for differences 
</p>
<p>followed an interdisciplinary approach and was aimed at promoting the integration of 
</p>
<p>values in all contexts to combat racism and intolerance.  
</p>
<p>71. As regards the question on the facility for persons with disabilities, &#8220;Il Colore del 
</p>
<p>Grano&#8221;, it was explained that the centre hosted persons with various types of disabilities 
</p>
<p>and contributed to their education, rehabilitation and social inclusion by providing 
</p>
<p>assistance, care and treatment, including in support of their families. </p>


<p>72. With reference to international instruments, San Marino recognized the importance 
</p>
<p>of treaties that contain individual complaint mechanisms and was committed to addressing 
</p>
<p>reporting delays and to acceding to OP-ICESCR, the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure, and to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention against 
</p>
<p>Discrimination in Education. 
</p>
<p>73. The Minister said that, for the time being, San Marino did not intend to adhere to or 
</p>
<p>ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
</p>
<p>Disappearance (ICPPED), the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
</p>
<p>Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, ICRMW, nor the 
</p>
<p>Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. 
</p>
<p>74. As regards the establishment of a national institution on human rights based on the 
</p>
<p>Paris Principles, San Marino considered the existing complaint mechanisms to be adequate. 
</p>
<p>Anyone may file a petition to the Head of State to complain about violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights and other related issues. 
</p>
<p>75. On the question about juvenile crime, Law No. 140/2014 raised the age of juvenile 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction to 14, with safeguards for children under 18 and alternative measures to 
</p>
<p>detention under the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>76. The reform of the Criminal Procedure Code was a major priority. Government 
</p>
<p>Decision No. 20/2013 entrusted a technical working group with the drafting of a new code. 
</p>
<p>77. Finally, the Minister committed to giving due consideration to all recommendations 
</p>
<p>to enhance human rights in San Marino. 
</p>
