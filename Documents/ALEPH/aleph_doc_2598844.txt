SUMMARY
At the request of Merrex Gold Inc (Merrex) ACA Howe International Ltd (Howe) has prepared the following 
National Instrument 43-101 (Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects) Qualifying Report in support of a 
spin-off of the Merrex West Mali Gold Project from the parent company. 
 
Merrex  holds  five  contiguous  exploration  permits  in  southwest  Mali,  West  Africa,  collectively  termed  the 
Siribaya Gold Project, in a joint venture with Touba Mining. This land package hosts significant geological 
structures,  associated  anomalous  gold  zones,  extensive  orpailleur  alluvial  gold  workings  and  artisanal 
underground  workings.  The  properties  are  located  in  Kenieba  province,  some  400km  west  of  Bamako,  the 
capital of Mali and 50 km directly to the south of the town of Kéniéba. The permit block covers a total area of 
701 km2 and includes Siribaya, Taya-Malea, Kofia, Babara, and the Kambaya permit, which is in the process 
of registration.

infrastructure
Merrex  has  the  option  to  acquire  95%  of  the  exploration  rights  of  all  the  permits  by  paying  an  aggregate 
amount  of  Cdn$85,000  and  incurring  an  aggregate  Exploration  Expenditure  of  Cdn$750,000.  Touba  will 
retain  a  5% interest  in  the  exploration rights,  will have  a  free carried interest  of  5%  and  will  receive  a  net 
profit interest (NPI) royalty of 5% of profits from any mining title, less any royalties payable to a third party 
by Touba. The Government of Mali automatically acquires a free carried interest of 10% in the exploitation 
Corporation, and has the option to take a supplementary participative interest up to 10% in the Corporation.  
 
Field work can be carried out all year although during the rainy season exploration is restricted to activities, 
which are not affected by ground and surface water, such as diamond drilling. Other field work is restricted to 
the period from end October to end of June.  
 
There 
the  area,  with  no  mains  electricity,  regular  water  supplies  or 
telecommunications,  though  the  permits  are  traversed  by  the  all-year  Faleme  river  which  provides  ample 
water for exploration activities and would be sufficient for mining purposes. The region is generally flat and 
characterised by gentle rolling hills. The rivers and drainage channels are fed, in the wet season, by run-off 
from lateritic plateaus.  
 
The  Kenieba  region  is  situated  within  the  Kenieba-Kedougou  inlier  and  lies  on  the  northeast  flank  of  the 
Archaean  Man  Shield.  Precambrian  rocks  dominate  the  region  and  consist  predominantly  of  Lower 
Proterozoic  Birimian  metamorphic  rocks,  bordered  to  the  east  and  southwest  by  Upper  Proterozoic,  largely 
unmetamorphosed clastic sedimentary rocks. Abundant quartz-tourmaline is associated with granitoids in the 
Kenieba-Kedougou  Inlier.  And  a  close  association  between  silica-tourmaline  alteration  and  gold 
mineralisation  is  recognised.  Late  dolerite  dykes  and  sills  and  numerous  kimberlitic  diatremes  cut  the 
Precambrian formations. Lamprophyric dykes cut all Birimian formations. Up to four periods of laterisation, 
have been recognised across the region. Laterite/saprolite profiles extend to vertical depths of 30 to 50 metres. 
The Birimian rocks are traversed by the regional Malian fault which runs north from the Faleme River to the 
Sadiola gold deposit 120 km to the north. Significant westerly-trending structures have been recognised close 
to  the  Loulo  and  Tabakoto  gold  deposits.  Published  reports  suggest  a  significant  relationship  between  this 
structure and gold mineralisation at Tabakoto.  
  
Artisanal  gold  mining  in  the  Kenieba  region  of  western  Mali  is  recorded  during  the  third  century  and  has 
subsequently  been  conducted  on  a  small  scale  during  the  succeeding  centuries.  In  French  colonial  times, 
which lasted from 1898 to 1960, minor exploitation of alluvial gold deposits by dredging took place and in the 
early 1950s the Service de Geologie et de Prospection Miniere carried out extensive prospecting that resulted 
in  the  discovery  of  a  number  of  gold  prospects  and  deposits.  From  1962,  SONAREM,  the  state  mining 
company undertook exploration with the aid of Soviet loans and technical assistance. In 1969 the Direction 
Nationale  de  la  Geologie  et  des  Mines  (DNGM),  the  state  geological  survey  was  created.  Mines  (DNGM). 
Subsequently, the region has been investigated by Bureau de Recherche Geologique et Miniere (BRGM) and 
Direction Nationale de la Geologie et des

Because the access to this sector is very difficult, especially during the rainy season, very little exploration 
was previously conducted south of the Faleme River, close to the Guinean and Senegalian borders. Only three 
previous operators have conducted significant work in the area covered by the permits of the current Siribaya 
project: SOMAGECO SARL, Syndicat Or and Emerging Africa Gold (EAG). In 1996-1997 EAG owned or 
controlled directly a group of permits which covered approximately the same surface as the current Siribaya 
project, excluding the Kambaya permit. Field work was conducted under contract by the Russian consultant 
Group Geoconsult Ltd. Interpretation maps of the soil geochemical survey were produced by Geoconsult on 
which zones considered to have high potential for economic gold concentration were delineated.  
 
Some 70% of the Siribaya Project area (see figure 4) is overlain by lateritic soil and hardpan. Saprolitised 
Birimian meta-sediments underlie the lateritic profile with interbedded flow-banded rhyodacite and rhyolite, 
and  spherulitic  rhyolites.  Tectonic  breccias  and  hydrothermal  breccias  with  associated  carbonatisation, 
silicification  and  polymetallic  massive  and  disseminated  sulphides  have  been  recognised,  associated  with  a 
significant  northeast-trending  fault  structure.  The  predominant  strike  is  north-northeasterly  and  dips  are 
generally steep towards the west. Fractures parallel to the Birimian rocks correlate with the broad strike of 
anomalous gold zones identified from geochemical data. A satellite imagery interpretation commissioned by 
Merrex has indicated a number of structurally controlled targets, the majority of which remain untested. 
 
Several  types  of  gold  deposits  have  been  encountered  to  date  at  the  Siribaya  Project.  The  first  type  is 
characterised  by  mineralised  lenses  developed in  brecciated  felsic  volcanic  rock  and  interbedded  sediments 
close  to  a  fault.  The  strongest  gold  values intersected  to  date  occur  in  hydrothermal  breccia-style 
mineralisation  with  a  polymetallic  assemblage,  comprising  pyrite  and  arsenopyrite,  with  subordinate 
chalcopyrite, galena and sphalerite. Other styles of mineralisation encountered include stockworks, veins and 
disseminated sulphide hosted by quartz feldspar porphyry (QFP) and felsic dykes. Currently, significant gold 
bearing mineralisation has been encountered at four locations on the Siribaya project area, namely Zones 1B, 
and 1A, the Timeta area, and the Bambadinka sector. These zones are contained within the Siribaya structure, 
which has been traced for some ten kilometres along strike, over a width of two to three kilometres  
 
Merrex’s 2005 to 2008 exploration programme consisted of prospecting, mapping, detailed and sub-regional 
soil geochemistry, pitting, trenching RAB drilling, geophysics, and diamond drilling. 100 by 40 metre grids 
were  established  over  selected  anomalous  areas  covering  about  %  of  the  gold  anomalous  zones  previously 
recognised by EAG; outside of the zones previously covered by EAG, soil sampling was conducted on 400 x 
100  metre  grids,  utilising  GPS  positioning.  In  addition,  187  pits  have  been  excavated  and  sampled,  and  9 
trenches  have  been  excavated,  mapped  and  partially  sampled.  The  geophysical  surveys  have  included  191 
linear kilometres of gradiometric Induced Polarisation (IP) and 6.4 linear kilometres of pole-dipole IP. The 
drilling includes 722 RAB holes totalling 30,283 m, and 84 diamond drill holes (DDH) totalling 14,500 m.  
 
The  geochemical  programme  confirmed  the  gold  zones  previously  outlined  by  EAG  and  defined  numerous 
more  focused  gold  anomalies  in  the  area  associated  with  mapped  structures  and  features  indicated  by 
geophysics and satellite imagery interpretation and suggested additional areas of potential gold mineralisation, 
particularly  on  the  Babara permit,  where  the  most  extensive  gold  anomalies  were  indicated  by  the  Russian 
survey.  
 
The  Siribaya  Zone  contains  a  number  of  significant  gold  anomalous  zones  distributed  along  a  northeast-
trending linear zone some 10 km long and up to 2 km wide coincident with a regional-scale structure visible 
on the government regional airborne magnetic gradient survey; this feature is termed the Siribaya Structure by 
Merrex. Within the zone, artisanal workings have taken place at Berekegni, and at Timeta, at the southern end 
of the trend. Zone 1B covers a discontinuous area some 1 km long, some 250 metres wide, with an easterly 
extension  at  the  southern  end  of  the  zone.  Values  range  from  20ppb  Au  to  in  excess  of  200ppb.  Zone  1B 
appears to extend some 2 to 3 km farther south to Berekegni. Anomaly Zone 1A measures approximately 400 
by  700  metres  and  comprises  a  soil  anomaly  some  300  by  500  metres  in  area,  elongated  along  a  north-
northeast direction. Soil gold values range from 50 to in excess of 200 ppb along a 500metres by 100metres 
trend about 1 km east of Berekegni and a discontinuous zone of focused anomalies extends about a kilometre 
farther north.
ACA HOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
iii
At Timeta a north-northeast anomaly some 400 by 150 m contain several discrete zones ranging from 100 to 
200ppb Au. Bambadinka Zone is zone 5 km long and 2 km wide and contains numerous individual values in 
excess of 1 g/t contained in transported laterite.  
 
On the Babara and Kofia permits, some 15 km east of Siribaya permit, a significant gold-anomalous zone has 
been identified that is larger in area than the soil anomaly on the Siribaya structure  
 
Trench  TY-T-06-02  in  the  centre  of  nomaly  Zone  1A  returned  an  interval  of  3.1  g/t  Au  over  35  metres, 
including a 17-metre core section grading 5 g/t Au. Other significant intervals in trenches included TY-T-07-
08 (1.81 g/t Au over 11.0 metres, 1.80 g/t Au over 9.0 metres and 1.76 g/t Au over 8.0 metres), TY-T-07-07 
(1.97  g/t  Au  over  11.0  metres),  and  TY-T-06-05  (0.98  g/t  Au  over  12.0  metres);  TY-T-06-01  returned  a 
significant interval of 0.93 g/t Au over 7.0 metres at a depth of 7 metres. 
 
An  Induced  Polarisation  (IP)  surveys  over  parts  of  the  Siribaya  and  Taya-Malea  areas  outlined  a  series  of 
linear  chargeability  and  resistivity  zones,  parallel  to  geological  strike,  which  were  interpreted  to  represent 
stratigraphic  variations  and  strike  parallel  shearing.  A  number  of  offsets  were  identified  which  indicate 
faulting along northeast and northwest trends. Correlation with the focused soil anomalies was generally poor, 
though the survey did indicate broad structural and stratigraphic continuity between the main areas of gold 
anomaly.  
 
The Merrex RAB drilling programme confirmed the presence of mineralisation in the areas of geochemical 
anomaly with a depth extension of at least 30 metres, and still open at depth. Numerous RAB holes ended in 
mineralisation and four longitudinal lines along the anomalies, with significant gold grades, provide further 
evidence of the continuity of the mineralisation in a north-south trend. 
 
Subsequent  diamond  drill  campaigns  confirmed  that  the  gold  mineralisation  outlined  in  the  geochemical 
anomalies continued at depth. Zone 1A returned gold assays up 2.69 g/t over drilled lengths of 15 metres and 
2.92 g/t over 34 m. A number of the holes were terminated in mineralisation.  
 
In Zone 1B, drilling focused along a 1 km strike length, which indicated that the mineralisation is controlled 
by a fault zone. Hole SR-08-55 intersected strong gold mineralisation that has now been delineated in detail 
along  a  strike  length  of  350  metres  to  a  depth  of  150  metres  and  remains  open  in  all  directions.  The 
mineralisation appears to plunge, or is down faulted to the south. A resource estimate was completed in late 
2008. . 
 
Based  on  the  integration  of  the  geology,  geochemistry,  geophysics,  RAB  drilling  and  diamond  drilling 
completed in 2007 within Zone 1B, Merrex has generated a geological model and outlined a mineralised sub-
zone which is approximately 350 metres long, 7 - 12 metres average true width, at least 150 metres deep with 
gold grades varying between 2 and 5 g/t gold. The gold is associated with fine grained sulphides including 
arsenopyrite and pyrite with subordinate chalcopyrite and sphalerite disseminated mainly in felsic rocks with 
occasional graphite. This zone is open along strike and at depth.  
 
A detailed independent analysis of the Russian multielement geochemical data has indicated several important 
mineralisation trends and has identified potentially significant pathfinder elements which could assist future 
exploration.  Unfortunately,  Merrex  has  only  assayed  soils  samples  for  gold  to  date,  though  even  with  this 
limited data base, trends normal to the northerly trending Siribaya Structure have been identified. 
 
Howe concludes that in additional to the known mineralisation that is currently being delineated, the Merrex 
permits  contain  large  areas  of  untested  gold  anomalies  that  are  more  extensive  than  the  Siribaya  Zone  and 
have potential for the development of significant gold deposits.
Merrex  has  planned  a  comprehensive  programme  for  the  next  twelve  months,  to  further  delineate  the 
resources at Siribaya, extend the geochemical coverage to the remaining licence areas, test known anomalies 
elsewhere by closely spaced geochemical grids, pitting, trenching and RAB drilling. An aeromagnetic survey 
is also planned to cover all licences. The estimated cost of this programme is $3,600,000.

Howe carried out a resource estimate for Zone 1B of the Siribaya deposit. Doug Roy, M.A.Sc., P.Eng., who is 
an Associate Mining Engineer with Howe, prepared the estimate. 
 
Merrex provided a digital drill hole database in Microsoft Excel format that contained collar surveys, down-
hole  surveys,  geological  logs  and  assays  for  holes  up  to,  and  including  Hole SR-DD-08-76.  Merrex  had 
corrected this data according recommendations that Patrick Hannon made during his site visit. 
 
A review of hardcopy and digital data was undertaken and the assay data was interrogated and verified. No 
major errors were detected. The author determined that the quality of the data was acceptable for the purpose 
of resource estimation. 
 
To provide a common “support” for statistical analysis and grade estimation, samples were regularised over a 
1.0 metre sample interval. 
 
Mineralised  zones  were  outlined  to  enforce  geological  control  during  block  modelling.  A  “loose”  cut-off 
grade  of  0.25 g/tonne  of  gold  was  used.  A  “polygonal  section  model”  was  created  to  facilitate  the  zone 
outlining process. Cross-sections were defined over the site grid. 
 
Twenty mineralised zones were outlined on fourteen cross-sections. Samples that were within the interpreted 
outlines were tagged. Sample statistics were calculated using the tagged samples. 
 
The histograms showed a lognormal distribution. The mean value was 1.42 g/tonne and the “mean plus two 
standard  deviations”  value  occurred  at  9 g/tonne.  That  value  was  selected  as  the  top-cut  value.  Forty-five 
samples had assays that were greater than the top-cut (2 % of the population). 
 
From analysis of the sample statistics, there was no evidence of near-surface supergene gold enrichment. The 
mean  sample  grade  for  the  laterite  zone  was  0.39 g/tonne.  For  the  saprolite  zone,  the  mean  grade  was 
1.10 g/tonne  and  for  the  hard  rock  zone,  the  mean  grade  increased  to  1.69 g/tonne.  In  other  words,  grades 
increased with depth. 
 
Directional semi-variogram data were calculated for several directions within the plane of the mineralisation 
to investigate whether there were trends or shoots within the plane. There were very few sample pairs in the 
strike  direction.  Therefore,  the  results  were  poor.  The  dip  and  normal  (to  the  mineralised  plane)  directions 
both  produced  reasonably  good  results  to  which  models  were  fit.  No  trends  in  the  other  directions  were 
detected.  
 
A  sparse1  block  model  was  constructed  for  the  purpose  of  grade  estimation.  The  ordinary  block  kriging 
(“OBK”) method was used for estimating block grades. Resource classification parameters were chosen based 
on a combination of variography results and the author’s judgement. Resources were reported, as required by 
NI 43-101, according to the CIM Standards on Minerals Resources and Reserves. 
 
Specific gravity (“SG”) values for the laterite cover, for the saprolite zone and for hard rock were 3.0, 1.8 and 
2.8, respectively. 
 
Resources  were  determined  using  a  block  cut-off  grade  of  0.5 g/tonne.  Non-diluted  resources  for  Siribaya 
Zone 1B were estimated to be:

No resources in the Measured category were outlined. 
 
Resources were tallied by “bench.” Grades were higher in the deeper, hard rock zone than in the shallower, 
saprolite zone. The “ounces per vertical metre” value approximately doubled below 100 metres depth. 
 
 
Howe considers that the programme is well planned and should meet its objectives. Howe has examined the 
costings and finds that they are reasonable, inline with costs confirmed during the Howe visits to the project 
and  are based  on  costs  previously  established over  the  several  years during  which  Merrex and Touba  have 
operated in Western Mali.

INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE
At  the  request  of  Merrex  Gold  Inc  (Merrex)  ACA  Howe  International  Ltd  (Howe)  has  prepared  the 
following National Instrument 43-101 (Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects) Qualifying Report, 
which  follows  the  guidelines  of  Companion  Policy  43-101-CP  and  Form  43-101-F1  for  Technical 
Reports. The report has been prepared in support of a spin-off of the Merrex West Mali Gold Project from 
the parent company.
The Merrex West Mali Gold Project comprises five contiguous exploration permits situated within the 
Kenieba gold district in the western region of the Republic of Mali, West Africa. This report is based on 
an assessment of exploration work conducted by Merrex since it acquired its interest in the project in 
June 2006. A detailed review of information provided by the company has formed a major part of this 
study. This has included the examination of drill logs, pit and trench results and a review of the results 
of  geochemical  and  geophysical  results  from  surveys  conducted  by  both  Merrex  and  earlier  owners, 
supplemented  by  personal  visits  to  the  property  by  Howe  personnel  during  various  phases  of  the 
exploration. A Mineral Resource Estimate was completed, based on drilling through July 2008. Various 
internal  summary  reports  prepared  by  the  Company  in  accordance  with  Malian  Government 
requirements have been examined.
Patrick Hannon, M.A.Sc. P.Eng., qualified person (QP), visited the Siribaya site between June 29th and 
July  6th  2008.  During  the  visit,  pits,  trenches,  geological  outcrops  and  diamond  drill  sites  were 
inspected.  Samples  of  drill  core  were  collected  for  assay  and  a  visit  was  made  to  the  ALS  Assay 
Laboratory in Bamaco. A tour of the facilities was provided by Paul Poisson, Operations Manager.
Doug Roy, M.A.Sc. P.Eng., is the qualified person (QP), responsible for the resource calculations.
2.  DISCLAIMER
Howe has relied upon information from Merrex and Touba regarding property ownership, joint venture details 
and environmental issues.
3.  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION
Merrex holds five  contiguous  exploration  permits in  southwest  Mali,  collectively  termed  the  Siribaya  Gold 
Project,  in  a  joint  venture  with  Touba  Mining.  This  land  package  hosts  significant  geological  structures, 
associated  anomalous  gold  zones,  extensive  orpailleur  alluvial  gold  workings  and  artisanal  underground 
workings. The properties are located in Kenieba province, some 400km west of Bamako, the capital of Mali. 
The permits are centred on UTMZone29N 263,000mE, 1,364,700mN. The property boundaries have not been 
legally surveyed, but the corner positions as stated in the permits are accurately located.
The  Siribaya  Project  is  located  at  50  km  directly  to  the  south  of  the  town  of  Kéniéba,  in  the  ‘’cercle’’  of 
Kéniéba, which is a part of the administrative region of Kayes. The permit block covers a total area of 701 
km2  and  includes  four  contiguous,  legally  registered permits,  namely  Siribaya  (132  km2),  Taya-Malea  (150 
km2),  Kofia (150  km2),  Babara (142  km2),  and  the  Kambaya  permit  (127 Km2),  which  is  in  the  process  of 
registration  (the  permit  application  has  been  accepted  by  the  inter-ministerial  commission  in  charge  of  the 
selection of the permits to be registered by the Ministry of Mines of Mali); Kambaya permit is contiguous to 
the western boundary of the Siribaya permit. All these permits are owned by Touba Mining Sarl (Touba) or 
are  controlled  by  Touba.  The  permits  of  Kambaya,  Siribaya,  Taya-Malea  and  Kofia  are  on  the  Keniéba 
topographic sheet; the Babara permit is on the Bafing Makana topographic sheet (see figure 1a).

Merrex is negotiating additional mineral permits in the following areas: east of Babara, south of Taya-Malea, 
south of Siribaya and south of Kambaya; if they are successfully completed, these additions should result in a 
land position of over 1,000 km2.
All  the  permits  included  in  the  project  are  part  of  an  Option  Agreement  between  Merrex  and Touba  dated 
October  18th,  2005.  The  Agreement  stipulates  that  inside  an  area  of  interest  which  includes  all  the  permits 
previously described, Merrex has the option to acquire 95% of the exploration rights of all the permits. To 
exercise its option, Merrex has to pay an aggregate amount of Cdn$85,000 and incur an aggregate Exploration 
Expenditure  of  Cdn$750,000  inside  a  time  limit  of  three  years.  Touba  will  retain  a  5%  interest  in  the 
exploration rights after the exercise of the option by Merrex. If a gold ore body is discovered, the Agreement 
also stipulates that, following a positive Feasibility Study, if decision to proceed to exploitation is reached, a 
mining exploitation corporation will be formed under malian law; Touba will have a free carried interest of 
5% in the Corporation and will receive a net profit interest (NPI) royalty of 5% of the Corporation’s profits 
from  any  mining  title,  less  any  royalties  payable  to  a  third  party  by  Touba.  When  a  mining  exploitation 
Corporation  is  created,  Malian  law  stipulates  that  the  Government  of  Mali  automatically  acquires  a  free 
carried  interest  of  10%  in  the  exploitation  Corporation,  and  has  the  option  to  take  a  supplementary 
participative interest up to 10% in the Corporation. After its formation, the distribution of the capital interest 
of the exploitation Corporation would be then as follows:
•  Merrex Gold Inc:
•  Government of Mali:
•  Touba Mining Sarl:
a minimum participative interest of 75% 
a maximum participative interest of 85% 
a free carried interest of 10% 
a maximum participative interest of 10% 
a free carried interest of 5%
At the date of this report, Merrex has already acquired 95% of the explorations rights held by Touba in the 
project area.

None of the permits described above have ever been legally surveyed. 
 
Artisanal mining has been conducted on alluvial and vein deposits in the past around Berekegni village in the 
Sirabaya permit and in the northern and southern parts of the Taya Malea permit, though there is no current 
mining activity on the property. No resources have been established to date. 
 
Merrex has assured Howe that within the limits of the Siribaya project, the properties are not subject to any 
environmental liabilities, and currently all permits required for exploration are in place.
Merrex also owns the 109 km2 Kakadian Permit which is located in the northern portion of the West Mali 
Gold Belt, and approximately 15 kilometre west of the Sadiola gold mine. This permit is not included in this 
current report.

ACCESSIBILITY,  CLIMATE,  LOCAL  RESOURCES, 
PHYSIOGRAPHY
INFRASTRUCTURE  AND
The permit areas (see figure 1b) are situated 50km south of the town of Kenieba, within the Kayes region, 
western Mali. Kayes, the largest city in the region, is served by regular flights of the local airline STA (Air 
Mali). Kayes can also be reached by rail from Bamako; this takes 10 to 12 hours. Kenieba is then accessed via 
a 245km dirt road. 
 
Kenieba is served by a Government owned airstrip that can be used by charter flights from Bamako. A private 
airstrip near Dabia, a few kilometers from the concession, offers additional access, though landing agreements 
are  difficult  to  negotiate.  Kenieba  can  also  be  reached  from  Bamako  by  paved  and  dirt  roads  via  Kita-
Manantali-Kassama-Kenieba.  The  total  road  distance  via  this  route  is  approximately  450  km,  which  takes 
about 12 to 14 hours. Roads are generally in poor condition and may become impassable in the wet season. 
 
In  addition,  a  new  tarred  road  via  Bamako-Kita-Kouroukoto-Tambafina-Komborea-Dabia  (430  Km)  to 
Senegal is under construction. At present the Bamako-Kita-Kouroukoto section is already tarred. The distance 
from  Bamako  to  site  through  Diéma,  Didieni,  Kayes,  Sadiola,  Kenieba,  Dabia,  Mankouké,  Berekegni  is 
estimated to be 893 km 
  
From Kenieba, the site may be reached by four-wheel drive vehicle along a dirt road running south through 
the  villages  of  Dabia,  Djabaro,  Mankouke  and  Berekegni.  The  Faleme  River  has  to  be  forded  some  12km 
north of Berekegni where Merrex has established a permanent, well equipped camp adjacent to the village. 
While the road is readily passable during the dry season, which lasts from November to May, passage during 
in the wet season is impracticable even to four-wheel drive vehicles and the Faleme River cannot be crossed. 
The  eastern  part  of  the  permit  area  can  be  accessed  via  a  track  that  leaves  the  Kenieba-Berekegni  track  at 
Djabora and continues to the southeast through Sanatafara, Kosara, Kosaya villages to Faraba. From here, a 
track continues southwest via Bouka, Kouba and Kollo villages to a field camp established by Merrex in the 
north of the Barbara permit at Hafia. Numerous bush tracks passable to four-wheel drive vehicle provide dry 
season  access the interiors  of the  permits.  Field  work  can  be carried  out all  year  although  during  the  rainy 
season  exploration  is  restricted  to  activities,  which  are  not  affected  by  ground  and  surface  water,  such  as 
diamond drilling. Other field work is restricted to the period from end October to end of June.  
 
The property lies within the Soudan-Sahel region of West Africa. The climate is subtropical, characterised by 
two distinct seasons: rainy season (June-October) with annual rainfall about 1,400 mm, and the dry season

(October–May) when it does not rain. The period from April to November is generally hot (35-45oC), while 
from December to February it is relatively mild (20-25o C). 
 
There 
the  area,  with  no  mains  electricity,  regular  water  supplies  or 
telecommunications,  though  the  permits  are  traversed  by  the  all-year  Faleme  river  which  provides  ample 
water for exploration activities and would be sufficient for mining purposes. The Kenieba area has a history of 
mining and a large, experienced pool of labour is available.  Heavy equipment such as bulldozers and trucks are 
available  both  in  Kenieba  and  Kayes.  Self  sufficient  exploration  camps  are  required.  Drinking  water  is 
obtained from wells.  
 
The Bamako-Dakar railway passes through Kayes. At present, trains travel every 8 or 9 days between Dakar 
and Bamako and more frequently between Bamako and Kayes and can be used to transport supplies to site. 
 
The  region  is  generally  flat  and  characterised  by  gentle  rolling  hills.  Elevations  within  the  Kenieba  valley 
generally  range  from  120-150metres  above  sea  level.  A  major  escarpment,  the  Tambaoura  Escarpment, 
bounds  the  valley  on  the  northeast  side,  reaching  elevations  up  to  440m,  extending  some  160km  from 
Diabarou  in  the  southeast  to  Sadiola  in  the  northwest.  In  the  south  the  scarp  trends  due  east.  A  similar 
escarpment runs across the southwest corner of the Sirabaya permit. The Falemé river lies about 9 km north of 
the project area and Taya Kô river crosses the Siribaya permit; many seasonal drainage channels occur. The 
rivers and drainage channels are fed, in the wet season, by run-off from the lateritic plateaus.  
 
Vegetation  is  usually  sparse,  consisting  of  thorny  brush,  grass,  and  rare  trees,  more  common  along  water 
courses. Frequent fields of termite mounds occur- the larger mounds provide a useful medium for exploration 
sampling.  The  local  villagers  raise  cattle  and  goats,  and  remote  from  the  widely  separated  centres  of 
population lions, hyenas, hippopotamus, monkeys, antelopes, snakes, lizards and various species of birds are 
found in small numbers.  
 
Potential tailings storage areas, potential waste disposal areas, heap leach pad areas and potential processing 
plant sites are available in the vicinity of the various mineralised areas.
5.  HISTORY
Artisanal  gold  mining  in  the  Kenieba  region  of  western  Mali  is  recorded  during  the  third  century  and  has 
subsequently  been  conducted  on  a  small  scale  during  the  succeeding  centuries.  In  French  colonial  times, 
which lasted from 1898 to 1960, minor exploitation of alluvial gold deposits by dredging took place and in the 
early 1950s the Service de Geologie et de Prospection Miniere carried out extensive prospecting that resulted 
in the discovery of a number of gold prospects and deposits. Artisanal exploitation declined sharply after the 
Second War. In 1960, the colonial rule ended. From 1962, SONAREM, the state mining company undertook 
exploration with the aid of Soviet loans and technical assistance. SONAREM’s monopoly on exploration and 
exploitation ended in 1969 with the creation of Direction Nationale de la Geologie et des Mines (DNGM), the 
state geological survey. Subsequently, the region has been investigated by Bureau de Recherche Geologique et 
Miniere (BRGM) and Direction Nationale de la Geologie et des Mines (DNGM).
BRGM  conducted  geological  mapping  and  gold  exploration  during1979-80  and  photo-geological  mapping 
was conducted by the DNGM in 1987
1979-89
The  Mali  Gold  Syndicate,  a  joint  venture  between  the  BRGM  and  the  Mali  government 
defined 30 gold anomalies in the Kenieba region from soil geochemical sampling. Regional 
soil  geochemical  surveys  were  completed  on  a  1.6  x  0.5  km  grid  south  of  latitude  16ºN. 
Geological mapping at 1:50,000 scale identified a tourmalinised sandstone unit some 200 km 
long with associated gold mineralisation and led to the discovery of the Loulo deposits.

The  Syndicat  Diamant  Mali 
extensive 
diamond/kimberlite  exploration  programme  extending  from  the  Guinea  border,  north  to 
latitude 14° north. This work included airborne magnetic surveys. 
Klockner  Industrie-Anlagen  GmbH  carried  out  a  regional  soil  geochemistry  programme, 
north of latitude 13º, collecting samples on traverses spaced one kilometre apart with samples 
every 250 m. All samples were analysed for gold and every other sample was analysed for a 
suite  of  base  metals.  Three  1:200,000  scale  geologic  maps  were  produced  from  satellite 
imagery, air-photos and reconnaissance mapping. Pitting and stream sediment sampling was 
also conducted. The project led to the discovery of the Sadiola Hill gold deposit. 
BHP Minerals entered an option agreement with the SOMILO (BRGM/Malian government) 
joint  venture  covering  the  Loulo  deposits  and  surrounding  area  and  completed  over  15,000 
metres of drilling. A pre-feasibility study indicated a 9.25 Mt gold deposit grading 3.6 g/t. The 
following year the company conducted a soil survey in the area to the north of the Tabakoto 
mine.
Previous work on Merrex’s mineral permits in the southern portion of the West Mali Gold Belt consisted of 
widespread  prospecting,  mapping  and  geochemical  surveying  with  expenditures  totalling  more  than 
$1,000,000.  This  work,  carried  out  during  the  mid-1990s,  outlined  over  100  km  of  anomalous  gold  zones 
associated with the mapped structures and gold showings. In particular, on the Siribaya permit, the Berekegni 
gold workings were identified. Merrex has acquired the complete database of this historical work. 
 
During the last twenty years, because of the changes of owners and also because of the different reduction 
processes which have affected the old permits, the shape and even the names of the different permits covering 
the current area of the Siribaya project have changed over the years to arrive at the present situation. As the 
legality  of  all  the  current  permits  of  Siribaya  project  is  now  well  established,  the  detailed  and  exhaustive 
compilation  of  all  these  changes  would  be  irrelevant  to  the  current  situation.  Accordingly  this  aspect  is 
discussed  in  a  general  way,  with  comments  concentrating  on  the  most  significant  points  of  the  historic 
development of the Siribaya project area.  
 
Because the access to this sector is very difficult, especially during the rainy season, very little exploration 
was previously conducted south of the Faleme River, close to the Guinean and Senegalian borders. Only three 
previous operators have conducted significant work in the area covered by the permits of the current Siribaya 
project: SOMAGECO SARL, Syndicat Or and Emerging Africa Gold (EAG).
•  Since 1997, SOMAGECO SARL has held an exploration permit which covers more or less the sector 
of  the  Kambaya  permit  which  is  currently  under  application  by  SOMAGECO,  a  small  Malian 
exploration  company  with  very  limited  technical  and  financial  capacities.  The  exploration  work 
conducted, or financed by SOMAGECO, is limited to a technical note on two aspects of the potential 
of the permits: first the presence on the concession of a tourmaline sandstone formation identified by 
the  Syndicat  Or,  (a  joint  venture  between  the  French  Government  survey  BRGM  and  the  Malian 
Government survey, DNGM), during surveys in 1984 to 1985; and secondly describing the presence 
on  the  concession  of  a  quartz  bearing  structure  mined  by  artisanal  miners  along  a  50metres  strike 
length. This note, which was produced by a consultant, was submitted to the DNGM in 1997. In 2006, 
Merrex Gold, as operator of its joint venture with Touba Mining conducted a small reconnaissance 
survey  on  Kambaya  sector.  The  reconnaissance  included  two  small  soil  and  rock  geochemistry 
surveys.  The  soil  geochemistry  survey  covered  an  inferred  fault  zone  on  which  thirty  six  samples 
were  collected;  the  rock  geochemistry  survey  consisted  of  twenty  five  samples  collected  from 
tourmaline sandstone outcrops. All the samples (soil and rock) returned weak gold values below 20 
ppb  though  delineated  a  significant  tourmaline  sandstone  formation  extending  around  0.6-1.2 
kilometres  on  the  Kambaya  concession.  Tourmaline  sandstones  are  the  host  rocks  of  gold 
mineralisation  at  Loulo  mine,  so  their  presence  on  the  Kambaya  concession  is  considered  to  be 
significant and further work is planned by the joint venture to test their potential once the concession 
is granted.

•  During the eighties, Syndicat Or was active on the gold showing known as Wili-Wili, located north of 
the Kofia permit. At that time, the limits of the concession of Syndicat Or covered a small portion of 
the current Merrex Taya-Malea and Kofia permits. Syndicat Or conducted soil and rock geochemistry, 
sub-surface  works  (pitting  and  trenching),  and  detailed  geological  surveys,  all  in  the  immediate 
vivinity  of  Wili-Wili,  outside  the  actual  permits  included  in  the  Siribaya  project.  In  1984-1985 
Syndicat Or also produced a semi-regional geological map at 1: 50 000 scale, which covers most of 
the  surface  of  the  Siribaya  project.  This  map  includes  useful  geological  information,  especially  on 
Merrex’s Babara permit where it delineates a sub north-south tourmaline sandstone formation around 
500 metres in width by at least 10 kilometres in the central part of the Babara concession.
•
•  EMERGING AFRICA GOLD (EAG) conducted the most significant previous work on the Siribaya 
project  area.  In  1996-1997  EAG  owned  or  controlled  directly  a  group  of  permits  which  covered 
approximately the same surface as the current Siribaya project, excluding the Kambaya permit. Field 
work was conducted under contract by the Russian consultant Group Geoconsult Ltd.  
In  the  area  of  the  current  Siribaya  and  Taya-Malea  permits,  the  initial  phase  of  EAG  exploration 
included  the  compilation  of  previous  surveys,  and  production  of  a  set  of  maps  at  1:  50 000  scale 
including  a  topographic  map,  a  geomorphological  map,  a  litho-structural  map,  and  a  map  of  the 
distribution of the artisanal mining sites from air photos at 1: 250 000 scale. A geological survey was 
conducted concurrent with a soil sampling programme on a grid system with spacing of 500 or 1 000 
metres between lines, and a spacing of 100 metres between the collected samples. A total of 165 line 
was surveyed, and 1,651 soil samples and 36 rock samples were collected along the surveyed lines. 
In  the  area  of  the  current  Kofia  and  Babara  permits,  phase  one  of  the  EAG  programme  had  also 
included the compilation of previous work, and production of a similar set of maps at 1: 50 000 scale. 
Concurrent  geological  and  geochemical  surveying  was  conducted  on  a  grid  system  with spacing  of 
500  metres  between the lines  and  100  meters  between  the  sampling  points.  A total  of  450 line  km 
were surveyed, and 4,566 soil samples and 32 rock samples were collected along the surveyed lines.
•
•  For both sectors, in ideal surface conditions, samples were collected at a depth of 30 cm from surface 
and sieved on site until 500 gm of  material less than 80  mesh was accumulated; when a very hard 
lateritic  cap  was  encountered,  samples  were  collected  directly  from  the  surface.  The  soil  samples 
collected were sent to the Spectral Assays Laboratory of Alexandrov near Moscow in Russia where 
they were assayed for gold and 36 other elements by Spectrometry with chemical pre-concentration 
with a detection limit of 3 ppb on gold assays. The rock samples were sent to SOFILAB laboratory of 
Bamako, where they were assayed for gold by Atomic Absorption with a detection limit of 20 ppb. 
Interpretation  maps  of  the  soil  geochemical  survey  were  produced  by  Geoconsult  on  which  zones 
considered  to  have  high  potential  for  economic  gold  concentration  were  delineated.  These  high 
potential  zones  were  the  initial  exploration  targets  investigated  by  Merrex  Gold  Inc.  at  the  end  of 
2005, prior to the full registration of the licences in June 2006.
•
No resource estimates have previously been done within or adjacent to the Siribaya project area, and there has 
been no industrial gold production. No records exist of the artisanal gold production on the licence areas.
6.  GEOLOGICAL SETTING
6.1.  REGIONAL GEOLOGY OF THE KENIEBA AREA
The Kenieba region (see figure 2) is situated within the Kenieba-Kedougou inlier and lies on the northeast flank 
of  the  Archaean  Man  Shield.  Precambrian  rocks  dominate  the  region  and  consist  predominantly  of  Lower 
Proterozoic  Birimian  metamorphic  rocks,  bordered  to  the  east  and  southwest  by  Upper  Proterozoic,  largely 
unmetamorphosed clastic sedimentary rocks.
The Birimian sequence within the inlier comprises three principal northeast-trending linear belts that are a 
few  tens  of  km  wide  and  have  lengths  in  excess  of  several  hundred  km.  These  belts  comprise  volcano-
sedimentary sequences that have undergone moderately intense regional metamorphism, to greenschist facies 
and exhibit moderate to steep dips and strike northeast in the vicinity of the Merrex licences. The Birimian 
lithologies  range  from  volcanic-dominated  sequences  in  the  west  (Saboussire  Formation)  to  predominantly

turbidite  sediments  and  subordinate  volcanic  rocks  to  the  east  (Keniebandi,  and  Kofi  Formations).  The 
sedimentary sequences include fine- to medium-grained arenite, argillite, calc-silicates, meta-greywacke and 
meta-carbonates. The volcanic formations comprise mafic to felsic tuff and their metamorphic equivalents. 
Granitic or migmatised zones separate the belts, and represent pre-Birimian bedrock.  
 
The Upper Proterozoic rocks of the Wassangara and Souroukoto Groups unconformably overlie the Birimian 
units to the east and comprise subhorizontal orthoquartzites and conglomerates.  
 
Both  the  sedimentary  and  volcanic  sequences  were  intruded  by  irregular  calc-alkaline  granitic  plutons, 
comprising  diorite  and  granodiorite  stocks,  towards  the  end  of  the  Eburnean  Orogeny.  The  stocks  are 
generally  only  weakly  foliated. The  granites  have  produced  areas  of  amphibolite  facies  metamorphism  and 
hornfels, and abundant quartz-tourmaline is associated with a number of granitoids in the Kenieba-Kedougou 
Inlier. There is generally considered to be a close association between silica-tourmaline alteration and gold 
mineralisation. The well known Loulo gold deposit is hosted by a unit originally described as tourmalinised 
quartzites, though some workers consider that these could be volcanic exhalative in origin. This is of interest 
as the recent drilling on the Merrex property has intersected massive sulphide mineralisation that could also be 
exhalative in origin, associated with a fault controlled breccia. 
 
Proterozoic to Permian dykes also occur throughout the region. Late north-northeast-trending dolerite dykes 
and sills and numerous kimberlitic diatremes cut all of the Precambrian formations. Lamprophyric dykes cut 
all Birimian formations. They usually occupy northeast-trending structures and may carry gold mineralisation. 
 
Up to four periods of laterisation, dating from the Cretaceous to the Neogene, have been recognised across the 
region. Laterite/saprolite profiles extend to vertical depths of 30 to 50 metres.
In western Mali, the Birimian rocks are traversed by a major regional strike-slip fault termed the Senegalo-
Malian  fault.  It  extends  north  from  the  Faleme  River  to  the  Sadiola  gold  deposit  120  km  to  the  north  and 
swings from a north-northeast trend in the south to north-northwest in the north with an interpreted sinistral 
movement.  At  its  southern  extremity,  the  structure  comprises  a  zone  of  shearing  two  to  five  km  wide. 
Significant westerly-trending structures have been recognised close to the Loulo and Tabakoto gold deposits. 
Published reports suggest a significant relationship between this structure and gold mineralisation at Tabakoto 
and it is suggested that the east-west structures represent the margins of grabens basins.
The topographic development of the Kenieba area reflects underlying northeast-, southeast- and weaker north-
trending  fractures.  The  northeast-trending  structures  are  possibly  splays  off  the  Senegalo-Malian  fault.  The 
Loulo  gold  deposit  is  controlled  by  drag  folding  associated  with  sinistral  northeast  faults  and  intersecting 
westerly-trending structures (Hanssen, et al., 1997), reflecting the regional structural trends. A swarm of east-
west structures is interpreted to extend in a zone at least 20 km in width to the south of Loulo. The intervening 
area hosts the majority of known gold deposits in the Kenieba area. Similar east-west structures may also be 
interpreted  to  the  south  of  this  zone,  causing  the  easterly  deflection  of  the  Tambaoura  Escarpment,  and 
satellite imagery interpretation of the Merrex permits has identified strong westerly structures traversing the 
property. 
  
In summary, the simplified geological history of the area is as follows:
•  Lower Proterozoic: Deposition of clastic, pelitic, carbonate and volcano-sedimentary units 
•  Proterozoic  (Eburnean):  Burial  and  metamorphism  (green  schist  facies)  of  sediments  to  form
quartzites/schists/phyllites/greywacke and marbles etc.
•  Upper Proterozoic: Uplift, erosion and peneplanation of Birimian rocks. 
•  Upper Proterozoic to Carboniferous: Deposition of clastic sediments (mainly sandstones) of the
Taoudeni Basin.
•  Permian to Jurassic: Faulting and fracturing or rejuvenation of earlier structures and intrusion of
dolerite dykes and stocks etc.
ACA HOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED

•  Post Mesozoic: Uplift and erosion of the Taoudeni sandstones and eventual rejuvenation of the pre-
Taoudeni surface. (The timing of this erosional phase is difficult to ascertain on the Merrex permits 
as there are no young sediments or alluvium in the area, but there are Cenozoic sediments elsewhere 
in Mali).
•  Quaternary: Development of modern laterite.
The regional airborne geophysical survey (SYSMIN survey) conducted by the Malian government between 
2000  and  2004,  produced  a  series  of  maps  which  clearly  demonstrate  the  major  geological  features  of  the 
Birrimian window of Kenieba. The magnetic gradient survey (see figures 3a and 3b) shows esspecially well 
the relationship between the North-South Senegalo/Malian fault and the gold deposits of Yatela, Sadiola and 
Loulo; it also demonstrates that the gold deposits of Tabakoto and Segala are related to a subsidiary structure. 
Finally, the survey clearly indicates the regional Siribaya structure along which the principal gold occurrences 
located to date on the Siribaya project have been identified.
6.2.  LOCAL GEOLOGY
Some 70% of the Siribaya Gold Project area (see figure 4) is overlain by lateritic soil and hardpan, locally 
termed  cuirasse,  with  limited  outcrop.  Drilling  has  exposed  up  to  50metres  of  saprolitised  Birimian  meta-
sediments  beneath  the  lateritic  profile  comprising  intercalated  schist  and  metagreywacke,  and  interbedded 
flow-banded rhyodacite and rhyolite, and spherulitic rhyolites. This grades down into fresh rock. Aplitic and 
doleritic dykes occur. Tectonic breccias have been intersected in drill holes and more recently hydrothermal 
breccias  with associated  carbonatisation,  silicification  and  polymetallic  massive  and  disseminated  sulphides 
have been recognised, associated with a significant northeast-trending fault structure. 
 
The predominant strike is north-northeasterly and dips are generally steep towards the west. Fractures parallel 
to the north-northeast to northeast trending Birimian rocks have been interpreted from aeromagnetic data, and 
these  trends  correlate  with  the  broad  strike  of  anomalous  gold  zones  identified  from  geochemical  data.  In 
some areas these anomalous gold zones are parallel to structures identified from aeromagnetic interpretation 
and close to the intersection with faults identified from satellite imagery.  In addition these zones appear to 
cross the foliation trends in the Birimian, which may indicate that structural control is more important than 
lithology. 
 
Important structural trends that have been mapped in the Merrex permit areas are as follows:
•  Birimian foliation trends are north-northeast swinging to northeast in the eastern part of the area. 
•  Bedding  of  the  Taoudeni  sandstones  (Infra-Cambrian)  strike  northwest  to  southeast  and  they  dip
gently to the southwest indicating regional tilting to the southwest.
•  Dolerite dykes with trends to the north-northeast and east-west.
The main directions for faults and fractures mapped are as follows:
•  North-northeast 
•  Northwest  
•  East-northeast 
•  East-west and east-southeast.
The fault and fracture directions have been traced from the Taoudeni sandstones in the south where they can 
be easily observed, continuing through the lateratised area to the north. Important east-west to east-southeast 
fractures approximately parallel the edge of the sandstones in this area. There are no recent alluvial sediments 
in the river valleys in this area, but there appears to be an extensive lateritic surface which in part may be a 
rejuvenated surface which once existed beneath the Taoudeni basin. This surface breaks up to the north where 
it has been eroded in a pattern following the fracture directions, however the main drainages in the area appear 
to have been superimposed on this surface as they exhibit well developed meanders without alluvium.

Linear positive features, possibly dolerite dykes follow both of the main fracture trends indicating that there 
was movement and the fractures were open at some time during the Permian to the Jurassic. However, it is 
likely that both directions developed much earlier and they were rejuvenated during the Mesozoic. 
 
Major faults and linears are highlighted in Figure 4, which summarises the key structural features forming the 
framework for this area and emphasises the importance of the intersection of the east-northeast structures (also 
identified  from  the  aeromagnetics)  and  east-west  to  east-southeast  structures  cutting  across  the  area.  The 
locations of the anomalous gold zones have also been included in the structural synthesis to summarise the 
relationship between the structures and the anomalous zones.  
 
Results from  the  drilling  to  date  are  ambiguous,  with  some  suggestion  of  isoclinal  folding,  though  no  firm 
evidence has been obtained to date.
7.  DEPOSIT TYPES
7.1.  KENIEBA DISTRICT
Four principal types of gold deposits in Kenieba gold province have been identified Snell, et al. (1981).
1.  Silt and Laterite Gold Deposits: Recent accumulations of surface silt and some laterite contain a re-
concentration  of  fine  gold  with  localised  zones  with  small  nuggets.  Periodic  flooding  carries 
suspended  fine-grained  gold  onto  stream  terraces  where  it  is  deposited  with  silt  when  the  water 
recedes.  Elsewhere,  the  formation  of  laterite  by  weathering  of  gold-bearing  bedrock  may  leave 
particles  of  gold  in  the  laterite,  which  can  be  concentrated  during  subsequent  weathering  of  the 
laterite, ofter remote from the original source.
2.  Alluvial  Gold  Deposits:  Alluvial  deposits comprise  fine  to  coarse  gravel  with  silty  to  sandy  matrix
and erratic free gold. Bedrock is usually weathered to saprolite.
3.  Eluvial  Gold  Deposits:  Eluvial  gold  concentrations  occur  as  a  result  of  the  chemical  and  physical 
breakdown of bedrock during extensive periods of oxidation and water circulation. Gold deposits of this 
type are essentially formed in situ above the primary source; however, the primary rock is reduced in 
volume.  Particulate  gold  tends  to  migratel  downwards  through  fractures  and  fissures  created  by 
physical and chemical weathering.
4.  Primary Gold Deposits: The larger gold deposits in the Birimian rocks of Mali have been considered 
to  be  polygenetic  in  nature  (Sangaré,  1994).  Primary  syngenetic  mineralisation  in  volcano-
sedimentary  formations  has  been  mobilised  and  re-deposited  in  favourable  structurally  controlled 
zones during deformation and metamorphism. There is, however evidence on the Merrex property of 
volcanogenic  mineralisation  as  a  precursor  to  the  structurally  controlled  and  remobilised 
mineralisation episodes and recent interpretations of the Tabakoto and Segala deposits suggest active 
exhalative mineralisation associated with graben margins.
The main structural trends associated with primary mineralisation have a northwest or northeast trend, or may 
comprise  east-trending  shears,  at  their  intersection  with  north-trending  structures.  Both  small,  high-grade 
quartz vein zones and bulk-tonnage deposits related to larger shear zones occur. 
 
The primary gold deposits are also spatially related to felsic intrusives and volcanic rocks but the gold may be 
remobilised into structural traps from the surrounding host rocks. 
 
The distribution of gold in the weathering profile is complex and requires careful geological interpretation. 
Surface  soil  anomalies  may  reflect  the  distribution  of  gold  in  lateritised  horizons  where  the  gold  can  be 
concentrated in residual or transported deposits, or can be enhanced by physico-chemical processes. Deeper in 
the profile, the gold is fixed by saprolitic clay whilst in the upper ferruginous zones the gold and elements
ACA HOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
11
such as arsenic tend to be adsorbed on Fe oxyhydroxides such as goethite. Gold is transported laterally into 
the lower saprolite profile during weathering and retreat of older laterite cuirasse, with less occurring in the 
mottled and ferruginous parts of the profile. Mechanical mobilisation is dominant in these terrains (Bowell et 
al, 1996).
7.2.  SIRIBAYA PROJECT
Several  types  of  gold  deposits  have  been  encountered  to  date  at  the  Siribaya  Project.  The  first  type  is 
characterised  by  mineralised  lenses  developed in  brecciated  felsic  volcanic  rock  and  interbedded  sediments 
close  to  a  fault.  The  lenses  occur  in  an  en  echelon  pattern  along    a  N15-20°E  trend,  with  an  easterly  dip 
varying from 55° to sub-vertical, transgressive to stratigraphy.  
 
In  the  vicinity  of  diamond  drill  hole  SR-DD-07-55, termed  Zone  55  by  Merrex,  the  strongest  gold 
values intersected to date occur in hydrothermal breccia-style mineralisation with a polymetallic assemblage, 
comprising pyrite and arsenopyrite, with subordinate chalcopyrite, galena and sphalerite. This mineralisation 
resembles the feeder zone style for volcanogenic massive sulphide; a massive sulphide lens was intersected in 
nearby hole SR-DD-08-56 and the principal mineralisation is currently interpreted by the Merrex team to be 
exhalative, associated with a growth fault adjacent to a graben feature.  
 
Other styles of mineralisation encountered in the zone include stockworks, veins and disseminated sulphide 
hosted by quartz feldspar porphyry (QFP) and felsic dykes. The hydrothermal breccia appears to represent the 
earliest  mineralising  event.  A  second  mineralising  event  is  associated  with  a  major  fault  zone,  trending 
N15°E, slightly transgressive to stratigraphy, where brittle deformation in the form of tectonic breccias and 
stockworks have formed in adjacent felsic rocks including rhyodacite/rhyolite, QFP and felsic dykes.  
 
Tectonic breccia overprints the hydrothermal breccia in some holes in Zone 55, and associated sediments are 
silicified  and  carbonatised.  Merrex  geologists  consider  that  the  mineralising  fluids  percolated  the  fractured 
rock, depositing a second, lower grade phase of gold mineralisation, and remobilised the earlier hydrothermal 
breccia mineralisation into favourable structurally-prepared sites. The fault zone, which is at least 100metres 
wide,  has produced  an  extensive  mylonitised  zone  where  it  traverses  graphitic  sediments,  with  carbonated 
sediments occurring to the west in the footwall zone of the fault.
8.  MINERALISATION
Currently,  significant  gold  bearing  mineralisation  has  been  encountered  at  four  locations  on  the  Siribaya 
project area, namely Zones 1B, and 1A, the Timeta area, and the Bambadinka sector.(see figure 5) These 
zones are contained within the Siribaya structure, which has been traced for some ten kilometres along strike, 
over a width of two to three kilometres. The most detailed work by Merrex has been conducted on Zone 1B, 
which appears on current evidence to have significant gold potential. Additional work is planned elsewhere on 
the property, where extensive gold soil anomalies remain to be tested in detail. The individual soil anomalies 
are described in detail in section 11.1.
8.1.  ZONE 1B
Zone 1B is located in the northeast part of the Siribaya permit. Available data indicate the presence of several 
mineralised lenses in Zone 1B including the principal lens, termed Area 55, and several felsic dyke intrusions 
located 75-100 metres to its east. Area 55 has a known extension of around 350 metres on a north-northeast 
strike, with a sub-vertical eastern dip; the known vertical extent of the lens is around 150 metres, but it is open 
at depth, along strike to the north and in depth to the south. The felsic dyke horizon is traceable over a 350 
metres length along a N 015°E strike. This unit is trasgressive to stratigraphy, with an easterly dip ranging 
from 55 to 65°. The known vertical extend in the north half is 80 metres and open along strike to the north,

and in depth and to the south in the remaining section. The mineralisation in the principal lens is contained 
mainly within hydrothermal breccias, while that in the felsic dykes is hosted by sulphide rich stockworks.  
 
Typically,  the  gold  mineralisation  hosted  by  hydrothermal  breccias  is  characterised  by  angular  and  sub-
rounded polymictic fragments of rhyolite/rhyodacite, shale and quartz, in a fine grained matrix composed of 
quartz-albite-carbonate and sulphide. These fragments are often intruded by thin veinlets of quartz-sulphide 
along  fractures  that  suggest  a  tectonic  overprint  following  the  hydrothermal  activity.  Sulphide  content, 
predominantly  pyrite  and  arsenopyrite,  ranges  from  2  to  15%.  Magnetite  is  generally  present  within  the 
brecciated  lenses,  and  occurs as scattered  blebs  and fine  stringers.  A  1.1metre interval of  massive sulphide 
mineralisation comprising 70% pyrite with minor chalcopyrite was intersected in one drill hole.  
 
Quartz-albite-carbonate  stockworks  are  developed in the  wall  rock  of  breccia  zones  of  Area  55, and  in  the 
felsic rocks or carbonatised sediments of secondary lenses. Gold grades appear to be related to the intensity of 
quartz-albite-carbonate  injection  rather  than  the  sulphide  content  itself  in  both  felsic  volcanic  rock  and  the 
silicified-carbonatised sediments.  
 
Two  generations  of  pyrite  are  recognised  in  the  mineralised  breccia  type;  (Renou,  A-S,  2008).  The  first  is 
represented by automorphous to hypidiomorphous pyrite occurring as inclusions in the host rock, representing 
the earliest mineralised phase. The second generation, is characterised by framboidal texture blebs and fine 
stringers associated with quartz-carbonate veinlets. 
 
Alteration of host rock is chiefly represented by iron-carbonate (siderite) and albite in the felsic volcanic units, 
while silicification dominates the sedimentary horizons. Chloritisation occurs as selvages to quartz-carbonate 
veinlets  and  surrounding  the  sulphides.  Up  to  1%  tourmaline  and  associated  leucoxene  occur  as  accessory 
minerals. 
 
The most recent drilling suggests either a southerly plunge to the mineralisation, which remains open at depth 
to the south, possible faulting with a downthrow to the south, or an en-echelon lens at greater depth to the 
south. Further investigation is required to resolve this. True widths of the breccias and felsic dykes are shown 
in Table 10 Section 11.
8.2.  ZONE 1A
This  mineralised  zone  is  located  in  the  northwest  part  of  the  Taya-Malea  permit  and  is  coincident  with  a 
significant  gold  soil  anomaly.  Pitting  and  trenching,  followed  by  RAB  and  diamond  drill  holes  have 
demonstrated that the soil anomaly is related to a system of five gold bearing felsic dykes or rhyodacitic units 
with a north-south strike, and 50° dip to the east; the zone of felsic rocks is bordered to the east and west by 
metasediments. The main felsic unit has an apparent thickness at surface of around 30 m, and pinches to a 
width  of  around  6metres  true  width  at  a  vertical  depth  of  around  60  m.  Four  smaller  felsic  units  with  an 
apparent thickness at surface of 5-10 metres have been recognised parallel to the main felsic dyke; the vertical 
extension of these smaller units is still unknown. Because the mineralised intersections are located close to the 
surface in the saprolitic facies, the felsic host rocks are strongly altered and very few sulphides are reported in 
the drilling logs; but because many quartz fragments and veinlets have been observed in the core and in the 
trenches, the mineralisation of Zone 1A is believed to be of the same stockworks type as seen in Zone 1B.  
 
Exploration work on Zone 1A has been suspended for a few months by Merrex as early investigation of Zone 
1B returned strongly positive results, and the company has subsequently concentrated its recent exploration 
efforts  on  the  latter.  However,  the  potential  of  Zone  1A  remains  to  be  fully  tested.  The  north  and  south 
extensions of the zone have not been investigated, and geophysical and drilling data indicate significant sub-
parallel graphitic structures within fifty m east of the principal zone. The depth extent of the various zones 
remains untested and it appears possible that stacked en-echelon lenses could be present.

8.3.
TIMETA
The  mineralised  zone  of  Timeta  is  located  in  the  southern  part  of  the  Siribaya  structure,  three  kilometres 
south-southwest of the village of Berekegni. The zone includes an old site of artisanal mining, inactive for 
several  years. The Timeta workings  exploited  an  east-west  trending  anastomosing  quartz  vein swarm  some 
100metres long by up to 20metres wide. The main excavation is 100 metres long and exploited a vein some 
1.0-1.5 metres in true width, oriented east-west and dipping north at an angle of around 70°; this excavation 
has a depth of at least 30 m. Elsewhere, individual veins appeared to swell up to 2metres wide. It was noted 
that  the  workings  terminate  to  the  west  beneath  an  increasing  thickness of cuirasse,  and  to  the east against 
thickening alluvium associated with a significant, active stream. A second zone of quartz veining and flooding 
occurred about 100metres to the southwest but only minor pitting on the vein outcrop has occurred here.  
 
Drilling  data  (RAB  and  DDH),  and  field  observations  indicate  that  the  mineralisation  is  associated  with  a 
system  of  mesothermal  quartz  veins  with  coarse  pyrite  and  arsenopyrite  hosted  by  a  felsic  intrusive  or  a 
rhyodacitic unit, with local evidence of east-west shearing.  
 
Considering its position on the Siribaya structure and the size of the old artisanal workings, the zone warrants 
additional exploration work.
8.4.  BAMBADINKA
The Bambadinka gold bearing zone is up to 5 km long and 2km wide and lies to the west of the main Siribaya 
Structure.  Data  from  the  soil  sampling  and  from  more  than  150  pits  up  to  7  metres  in  depth  indicate  that 
significant gold values occur in the transported lateritic cap which covers the anomalous area (considerable 
amounts of of angular quartz fragments can be observed in the consolidated laterite). Below the lateritic cover 
(thickness of 2-3 metres), only four samples from the pits have returned values over 0.50 Au g /t from the 
underlying saprolite. Felsic dykes and stockworks of quartz veins occur in the basal sections of several pits. 
There  is  clear  potential  for  a  near-surface  laterite  hosted  gold  deposit,  in  addition,  although  the  gold 
mineralisation in the Bambadinka sector has been transported, it is clear from the nature of the laterite and 
sub-laterite  geology  that  the  source  of  this  mineralisation  should  be  relatively  close.  Bambadinka  is  a  high 
priority target for future follow up work.
8.5.  DISCUSSION
Narrow, steeply dipping mesothermal quartz veins with true widths up to 1.5metres traverse the main fault 
zone in an east-west direction and have been worked underground and at surface at Timeta (maximum gold 
grade at Timeta 20.71g/t over 1metre intersection width, true width approximately 0.8m) and Berekegni by 
the local  artisanal  miners. These  may  represent the  last  mineralising  event,  with  gold  remobilised  into  later 
fractures.  The  intersection  zones  of  these  veins  with  the  main  mineralised  trend  have  produced  broad 
swellings in the soil geochemical anomalies. This may suggest the presence of high grade shoots similar to 
those identified in similar structural setting, at a late stage in the exploration of the recently opened Tabakoto 
mine, which is situated about 100 km to the north of Siribaya.  
 
Drilling by Merrex at Timeta appears to have intersected a narrow, steeply plunging high  grade gold zone, 
possibly related to the intersection of east-west fractures with the main Siribaya structure.  
 
The  near-surface  mineralisation  adjacent  to  the  fault  in  Area  55  appears  to  flare  out  in  the  saprolite,  in 
common with other saprolite-hosted deposits in West Africa and there may be potential for a large, low grade 
deposit  proximal  to  the  fault.  There  are  also  indications  of  extensive  secondary  gold  accumulations  in  the 
laterite at Bambadinka and also evidence of proximal stockwork style quartz veining.
9.  EXPLORATION BY MERREX
The  most  important  previous  exploration  work  covering  the  various  Siribaya  permits  (see  figure  6a) 
consisted of regional geochemical surveys (EAG, 1996-97) that reported over 100 km of broad, linear gold 
anomalous zones associated with geological structures. This historic database included several soil samples

assaying over 1000 ppb and ranging as high as 4000 ppb. Merrex acquired and compiled the geochemical data 
to guide the earliest exploration. The soil sampling programmes of EAG were conducted in two sectors: 1,651 
samples  were  collected  in  the  Siribaya  /  Taya-Malea  sector  and  4,566  in  the  Babara  /  Kofia  sector. 
Methodology of the geochemical survey is described previously in the history of previous work (section 7). 
Sample locations and statistics for both sectors are shown in Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 6b and 6c.

BABARA / KOFIA SECTOR (EAG, 1996-97) 
 
Merrex’s 2005 to 2008 exploration programme consisted of prospecting, mapping, detailed and sub-regional 
soil geochemistry, pitting, trenching RAB drilling, geophysics, and diamond drilling. 100 by 40 metre grids 
were established over selected anomalous areas covering about 75% of the gold anomalous zones previously 
recognised by EAG; outside of the zones previously covered by EAG, soil sampling was conducted on 400 x 
100 metre grids, utilising GPS positioning (see figure 6d). From 2005 to 2008, the soil sampling programme 
produced a total of 23,011 soil samples (including 1,849 samples for which results are not yet available). In 
addition,  187  pits  totalling  1,534  linear  metres  in  depth  have  been  excavated  and  sampled,  and  9  trenches 
totalling  940  linear  metres  have  been  excavated,  mapped  and  partially  sampled  (this  includes  a  341metres 
trench on Bambadinka that was not sampled).  
 
The geophysical surveys have included 191 linear kilometres of gradiometric Induced Polarisation (IP) and 
6.4 linear kilometres of pole-dipole IP.  
 
The drilling includes 722 RAB holes totalling 30,283 m, and 84 diamond drill holes (DDH) totalling 14,500 
m. The detailed statistics are presented in Table 3.

MERREX EXPLORATION WORKS (2005-2008)
9.1.  SOIL SURVEYS AND ANALYSIS OF PREVIOUS DATA
The  geochemical  programme  confirmed  the  gold  zones  previously  outlined  by  EAG  and  defined  numerous 
more  focused  gold  anomalies  in  the  area  associated  with  mapped  structures  and  features  indicated  by 
geophysics and satellite imagery interpretation. It also indicated the essential accuracy of the Russian work, 
suggesting the presence of additional areas of potential gold mineralisation, particularly on the Babara permit, 
where  the  most  extensive  gold  anomalies  were  indicated  by  the  Russian  survey.  Howe  has  examined  the 
Russian data in some detail and finds that several important features may be distinguished. The detailed result 
of the data analysis will be presented as a separate report.
9.1.1.  ANALYSIS OF RUSSIAN DATA
The Russian soil sampling data was collected in two separate areas, namely Koulo, which covers the eastern 
part of the Kofia permit and the major part of the Babara permit, and the Siribaya area. In both of these areas 
the  lateritisation  has  helped  to  preserve  the  chemical  and  textural  signatures  of  the  parent  rocks  and 
mineralisation within ferruginous nodules and duricrusts and the resultant element patterns, although weak, 
are still usable for effective mineral exploration. Higher variance is present in the results due to incomplete 
sampling and analysis, though the sample station spacing is adequate at the reconnaissance scale. During the 
survey 38 elements were analyzed on the soil samples.  
 
In the Koulo area, several distinct trends are noted with consistent spatial patterns observed in the selected 
elements:
•  The  principal  linear  trend  is  a  prominent  northeast  to  southwest  line  of  positive  values  occurring
across the area.
•  A second trend occurs that reflects geological or stratigraphic controls and is interpreted to represent a
change in geology.
•  Two sub parallel linears are both major features of the Koulo area. 
•  Two geochemical features form circular anomalies possibly due to the presence of a buried reduced
body.
Several distinct trends are noted in the Siribaya area.

•  A significant northeast to southwest ridge linear very similar to the most significant one at Koulo.
•  A north-south ridge can be identified. 
•  An east-west ridge. 
•  Several  minor trends:  north-south;  north-northwest  to  south-southeast  and  north-northwest to  south-
southeast.
•  Several lows or negative anomalies occur. 
It is concluded that the low values of most elements and the anomaly patterns generated are very typical of 
laterite terrains. The sample station spacing of 100m and 400m line is acceptable for reconnaissance but does 
not provide sufficient contrast for more detailed investigation to define real targets. 
 
The  sampling  methods  employed  leave  some  degree  for  improvement  as  not  all  elements  and  indicator 
minerals were well estimated. The sampling method is not very efficiently matched to this terrain and could 
be significantly improved.  
 
There  is  a  distinct  spatial  association  of  gold  and  several  associated  pathfinders  with  a  number  of  linear 
geochemical  trends  which  transect  both  areas.  This  closely  reflects  the  structural  Landsat  interpretation. 
Additionally there are some easterly linears which appear to actually offset other linears in places, especially 
in the Koulo area. In the Siribaya area the northeasterly trending linears appear to intersect in the south of the 
area and appear to be Reidel shears with a sinistral movement. Reference to the structural map indicates that 
the predominant east-west structure bifurcates in the vicinity of Siribaya and possibly represents an important 
control on gold mineralisation. 
 
It is recommended that some trials be carried out to test the effectiveness of certain resistate minerals for Au 
exploration in this area of Mali.
9.2.  MERREX SURVEYS
Detailed geochemical surveys (2005-2008) on the Siribaya and Taya-Malea permits were conducted on grids 
with lines 100 metres apart (see figure 6d). Soil samples were collected every 40 metres along each line. The 
sieved  samples  were  then  shipped  for  gold  assaying  at  ALS  Chemex  Laboratory  in  Bamako.  Analysis  of 
samples was carried out using fire assay with atomic absorption finish on pulverised cuts of 50 gm, with a 
detection  limit  of  3  ppb.  The  results  of  the  geochemical  survey  were  plotted  with  a  colour  contour  system 
using a high value cut-off of 200 ppb. Background was less than 20 ppb. The same sampling method has been 
used for detailed geochemical surveys (2006-2007) on the Babara permit, where line spacing was of 200 m. 
Sub-regional geochemical surveys were conducted in 2006-2007 in the northern part of the Kofia permit and 
in  the  western  part  of  Siribaya  permit  on  400  by  100  metre  grids,  also  using  the  same  sampling  method. 
Figure 6d shows the areas which have been soil sampled or mapped by Merrex on established grids or using 
GPS positioning.
9.2.1.  SIRIBAYA ZONE
The Siribaya Zone contains a number of significant gold anomalous zones (Zone 1B, Zone 1A, Zone Timéta) 
distributed along a northeast-trending linear zone some 10 km long and up to 2 km wide (see figure 7). The 
zone  has  been  partly  delineated  by  soil  sampling  but  previous  work  indicates  that  it  extends  to  the  south 
beyond the currently surveyed area. The Siribaya Zone is coincident with a regional-scale structure visible on 
the government regional airborne magnetic gradient survey (SYSMIN) of 2000 (see figure 3a and b); this 
feature is termed the Siribaya Structure by Merrex.  
 
Within the surveyed part of the Siribaya Zone, artisanal workings have taken place at Berekegni, in the centre 
of the currently defined anomalous trend close to its western margin and at Timeta, at the southern end of the

trend.  At  Berekegni,  a  village  was  established  by  local  artisanal  miners  and  is  still  occupied,  though  local 
mining  activity  has  ceased.  The  Merrex  camp  is  adjacent  to  this  village,  which  provides  a  source  for 
exploration assistants and labourers.  
  
Zone 1B covers a discontinuous area some 1 km long in a north-northeast direction, some 250 metres wide, 
with  an  easterly  extension  at  the  southern  end  of  the  zone.  Values  range  from  20ppb  Au  to  in  excess  of 
200ppb.  The  anomaly  is  elongated  along  a  015-020°  trend,  concordant  with  the  regional  structural  strike 
interpreted from the Sysmin geophysical airborne survey. However, it appears that the southern limit of Zone 
1B  is  partly  a  function  of  alluvial  cover  and  subsequent  work  has  indicated  that  it  extends  farther  south, 
probably  into  the  Berekegni  area,  some  2  to  3  km  to  the  south.(see  figure  7)  Recent  soil  surveys  have 
extended  its  northern  limit  a  further  2  km,  though  numerous  isolated  anomalies  are  indicated,  probably  a 
function of the software used to interpret the data. The data are currently being re-interpreted with reference to 
topography, regolith and laterite distribution. 
 
Within the Siribaya Zone, anomaly Zone 1A measures approximately 400 by 700 metres and comprises a bi-
lobate  gold soil anomaly  some  300  by  500  metres in  area,  elongated  along  a  north-northeast  direction (see 
figure 7). Soil gold values within the principal eastern lobe range from 50 to in excess of 200 ppb along a 
500metres  by  100metres  trend.  The  zone  lies  about  1  km  east  of  Berekegni  and  a  discontinuous  zone  of 
focused anomalies extends about a kilometre to the north, where the anomaly appears to terminate against a 
northwest-trending structure that also coincides with the southern part of the Zone 1B anomaly. 
 
At Timeta the soil anomaly is a narrow elliptical surface some 400 by 150 m, with a long axis oriented north-
northeast-south-southwest  (see  figure  7),  with  several  discrete  zones  ranging  from  100  to  200ppb  Au 
contained within a more extensive zone with values from 30 to 50 ppb Au. Strongly anomalous zones occur 
coincident with and adjacent to the known workings and trials in the area.  Other focused anomalies occur, 
extending north and south of the artisanal operations. Anomalies west of the Timeta Zone may be related to 
the zone or may be associated with a splay structure that extends south into the Siribaya structure.
9.2.2.  BAMBADINKA ZONE
At Bambadinka Zone initial soil geochemistry outlined a gold anomalous zone 5 km long and 2 km wide 
(see figure 7). The survey returned over 30 samples with values in excess of 1000 ppb (1 g/t) including one 
sample of 25,190 ppb (25.2 g/t) in the northern part of the grid. The numerous individual values in excess of 1 
g/t at Bambadinka Zone are well supported by adjacent anomalous samples and, together with the extensive 
zone of anomalous gold values within which they are contained, suggest a significant regional gold-bearing 
structure  or  structures.  The  surface  gold  is  contained  in  a  transported  laterite  layer  and  an  initial  pitting 
programme  indicates  this  lateritic  layer  to  be  at  least  two  metres  thick  and  may  have  potential  to  host  a 
substantial,  near  surface  deposit.  The  data  are  to  be  reprocessed  to  determine  detailed  local  trends  and 
relationships with the regolith profile.  
  
A detailed programme of deep pitting and trenching comprising a 151 pits excavated to 7 metres depth, and 
one trench of 341 metres in length was conducted in 2007-2008 to examine the extent of this mineralisation.

On the Babara permit and a part of Kofia permit, approximately 15 km east of Siribaya permit, a significant 
gold-anomalous zone was identified by the EAG soil sampling campaign (1996-1997). This anomalous zone 
is larger in  area than  the  soil  anomaly  on the  Siribaya  structure  (see figure  6d).  In  2006  and  2007  Merrex 
conducted detailed soil sampling campaigns on Babara sector using grid spacings of 200 metres x 40 metres 
which covered the major part of this anomalous area (see figure 6d). The interpretation of the data is still in 
progress.  It is anticipated that the geochemistry will be followed by trenching and pitting and, if warranted, 
RAB drilling.

9.2.4.  SUB-REGIONAL GEOCHEMICAL SURVEYS
In 2006 and 2007, sub-regional soil sampling campaigns (400 m x 100 m) were conducted by Merrex on areas 
of Kofia and Siribaya permits (see figure 6d). The interpretation of this data is still in progress and will be 
followed by detailed sampling programmes if warranted.
9.2.5.  DISCUSSION
The  soil  geochemistry  utilised  by  Merrex  has  proven  effective  in  confirming  the  extensive  areas  of  gold 
anomalism  identified  by  the  earlier  Russian  surveys  and  has  successfully  located  significant  zones  of  gold 
mineralisation  associated  with  focused  anomalies  within  the  10km  long  Siribaya  structure.  However,  a 
somewhat simplistic analysis of the data using contouring software has tended to lose detail; this is currently 
being addressed in the light of the results from Area 55 and both the original Russian data and recent Merrex 
results are currently being re-interpreted to assist future exploration planning. The strongest anomalies have 
been  confirmed  by  pitting,  trenching,  RAB  drilling  and  diamond  drilling,  but  continuity  has  been 
problematical  in  some  areas  and  potential  cross-cutting  features  have  not  been  delineated.  Numerous  areas 
remain to be tested in detail. 
 
Several periods of lateritisation have been recognised, which also complicates the analysis of the geochemical 
results and Howe recommends that detailed regolith mapping should be conducted and tied to a digital terrain 
model.  
 
In addition, Merrex has assayed soil samples only for gold to date, and the polymetallic nature of the recently 
identified  mineralisation  indicates  that  analysis  for  other  metals  could  be  important  in  delineating  mineral 
zonation  and  potential  vents.  However,  study  of  the  gold  data  distribution  identifies  a  relatively  normal 
population  with  a  series  of  high  but  outlier  values.  Modeling  of  the  geochemical  background  using  both 
ranking  and  standardized  scores  confirms  the  pre-eminence  of  the  northerly  trending  structures,  but  also 
identifies  gold  vectors  with  a  marked  east  to  west  trend  which  could  be  a  later  episode  of  possible 
mineralization as they appear to offset the more northerly, earlier linears. The east to west features also have a 
wider spatial extent and might be reflecting a wider and therefore potentially larger Au host stratigraphy or 
vector. This trend needs further investigation to fully establish the Au resources in the Siribaya area. The fact 
that this trend has also been identified in the Landsat structural study lends support to this conclusion. 
 
All  new  drill  holes  will  be  analysed  for  a  multiple  element  suite  and  it  is  recommended  that  future  soil 
sampling should also utilise multi-element analysis. Howe also recommends that a partial leach method such 
as MMI (mobile metal ion) should be tested over the known mineralisation.
9.3.  TRENCHING AND PITTING
9.3.1.  TRENCHING
In  2006  and  2007  Merrex  excavated  nine  trenches  totalling  841  linear  metres  on  the  Siribaya  project. 
Significant  assay  results  (higher  than  0.5  Au  g/t)  are  presented  in  Table  4.  Eight  one-metre-wide  trenches 
were  dug  and sampled  on Zone  1A,  and  one  was  excavated  on the  Bambadinka  soil  anomaly,  but  was  not 
sampled (see figures 8a to 8d).

SIGNIFICANT TRENCH RESULTS
The  best  results  came  from  Trench  TY-T-06-02  completed  in  the  centre  of  the  geochemical  anomaly 
identified as Zone 1A; an interval was sampled that returned a value of 3.1 g/t Au over 35 metres, including a 
17-metre core section grading 5 g/t Au. This was in a 100-metre mineralised trench with all values well above 
background.  Individual  samples  were  one  metre  in  length  and  taken  horizontally  along  the  trench  wall  in 
saprolite at two meters depth.  
 
Other significant intervals (from a depth of 2 metres) include TY-T-07-08 (1.81 g/t Au over 11.0 metres, 1.80 
g/t Au over 9.0 metres and 1.76 g/t Au over 8.0 metres), TY-T-07-07 (1.97 g/t Au over 11.0 metres), and TY-
T-06-05 (0.98 g/t Au over 12.0 metres); TY-T-06-01 returned a significant interval of 0.93 g/t Au over 7.0 
metres at a depth of 7 metres.
9.3.2.  PITTING
A total of 173 pits have been excavated on Siribaya project, mainly in Zone 1A up to a depth of 5 metres, and 
up to 7 metres in depth in the Bambadinka anomaly (see figures 8a to 8b). All the pits had a square cross-
section  some  one  metre  by  one  metre.    In  all  pits  in  the  Bambadinka  sector,  and  many  of  the  pits  dug 
elsewhere,  two  small  galleries  were  excavated  at  the  base  of  the  pit  for  one  metre  oriented  east  and  west. 
Contiguous 1metre maximum vertical channel samples were collected from surface to the bottom of each pit, 
and when appropriate, horizontal channel samples totalling three metres was were collected from the base of

SIGNIFICANT PIT RESULTS
Pits TY-P-06-11, 16, 17, 18 and 19 are located in Zone 1A and were followed up by trenching and diamond 
drilling. Pit TY-P-06-05, just under 1 kilometre north of Zone 1A, was also followed up by trenching, but no 
diamond drilling has been done in this area. Pit SY-P-06-14, inside the limits of Berekegni village, and pit SR-

P-06-14, 1.5 kilometres south of Bambadinka area have yet to be followed up. Pits SY-P-08-43 to SY-P-08-
165 are all located on the Bambadinka soil anomaly; of his group, pits SY-P-08-43, 121, 144 and 165 are of 
particular interest as they returned significant results in saprolitic material at the bottom of the pits.
9.4.  PETROLOGICAL STUDY
Merrex commissioned a petrological study by Modelaur (A-S Renou, Val d’Or, Quebec) in June 2008. Seven 
samples from 5 selected drillholes were investigated to identify their lithological, alteration and mineralisation 
characteristics. The holes and sampled intervals are shown in Table 6 below:

The study concluded that the samples represent a suite of immature clastic sediments and igneous 
intrusives, which have undergone alteration and regional deformation. The sediments indicate an 
episode  of  high  temperature  carbonate  replacement  related  to  skarn  formation,  and  a  lower 
temperature  hydrothermal  carbonatisation  phase  related  to  an  episode  of  fracturing.  The  latter 
alteration forms selvages to quartz veins. The gold mineralisation indicates that the initial episode 
of  carbonatisation  prepared  the  ground  and  resulted  in  the  development  of  background  gold 
values  of  the  order  of  several  tens  of  ppb;  the  subsequent  hydrothermal  event  resulted  in  the 
emplacement of quartz veins in fracture zones and higher gold values, possibly by remobilisation 
of  the  protore.  Alteration  associated  with  the  second  phase  included  the  superposition  of  a 
chlorite-mica-tourmaline-sulphide phase on the earlier replacement carbonate.
9.5.  GEOPHYSICS
Merrex commissioned Sagax geophysics to conduct Induced Polarisation (IP) surveys over parts 
of the Siribaya and Taya-Malea areas in 2007. (Figure 9a to 9l) The results outlined a series of 
linear chargeability and resistivity zones, parallel to geological strike, which were interpreted to 
represent stratigraphic variations and strike parallel shearing. A number of offsets were identified 
which  indicate  faulting  along  northeast  and  northwest  trends.  Correlation  with  the  focused  soil 
anomalies was  generally  poor, though the survey did indicate broad structural  and stratigraphic 
continuity between the main areas of gold anomaly. A more detailed IP and magnetic survey was 
conducted  in  2008  in  an  attempt  to  trace  the  faulting  intersected  in  drill  holes  in  area  55,  but 
highly  conductive  lateritic  deposits  at  surface  strongly  attenuated  the  IP  signal;  a  frequency-
domain  electromagnetic  (EM)  orientation  survey  also  proved  ineffective,  producing  only  weak 
responses. Magnetic profiling was also badly affected by the lateritic cover. Howe recommends 
the use of a time-domain EM system. 
 
The ground geophysical campaign of 2007 was the described in a technical report produced by 
SAGAX  AFRIQUE  and  titled:  ‘’rapport  sur  un  levé  de  polarisation  provoquée  /  résistivité, 
novembre  2006’’.  A  Landsat  imagery  interpretation  (Figure  10)  was  also  been  conducted  by 
ACA Howe International Limited in 2007. The interpretation work is discussed in a report written 
by Howe and titled: ‘’Satellite image interpretation of the somageco, sirabaya, taya-malea, kofia 
& barbara permits: Mali’’. These reports can be obtained by contacting the head office of Merrex 
at Halifax, NS, Canada.
10.  DRILLING
The drilling operations have been conducted in three phases. From May to June 2006 an initial 
small  diamond  drill  orientation  campaign  of  five  holes,  totalling  435  metres,  was  completed 
directly under the old artisanal mining operations located close to the village of Berekegni (Zone 
Berekegni). This campaign had been conducted using a drilling rig run by the PDRM, a Malian 
government group; this poorly equipped rig encountered serious recovery problems in the sheared 
portions  of the  holes,  but  visible  gold  was  identified  in  sections  with  good  recoverythough  the 
assays returned few significant gold values. Because of the poor drilling production, and the poor 
recovery  in  potentially  significant  shear  zones,  the  drilling  with  the  PDRM  rig  was  halted  and 
negotiations were initiated with a new contractor. 
 
From November 2006 to March 2007, an aggressive programme of 30,283 metres (722 holes) of 
RAB  drilling  was  conducted  as  a  follow  up  of  the  previously  completed  soil  sampling 
programme. The work was carried out by West African Drilling Society (WADS), an Australian

From  2007  to  2008  the  RAB  programme  was  followed  up  by  a  diamond  drilling  programme 
executed  by  Boart  Longyear,  a  Canadian  company.  MERREX  considers  that  the  drilling  work 
was  well  executed,  and  this  programme  retuned  significant  results  (Table  8).  The  2007-2008 
DDH  drilling  programme  was  conducted in  four  phases: from  June  to July  2007,  a  total  of  25 
holes  were  drilled  including  5  holes  on  Zone  1A,  12  holes  on  Zone  1B  and  8  holes  on  Zone 
Timéta; during the second phase, from October to November 2007, 14 holes were drilled on Zone 
1B and 8 on Zone 1A, for a total of 22 holes; in 2008, during February and March months, a third 
phase of 15 holes was drilled exclusively on Zone 1B; finally, from May to July 2008, another 17 
holes weredrilled on Zone 1B. 
 
10.1.  ROTARY AIR BLAST (RAB) DRILLING
The RAB programme was designed to test the numerous geochemical anomalies identified within 
the 10 km long Siribaya Structure, especially Zones 1A, 1B and Timeta, and also few secondary 
anomalous areas between these first priority targets. The programme comprised 28 drilling lines 
oriented east-west, and four lines oriented from 0-15° North (Figure 11a to 11g). On a specific 
target  zone,  the  lines  were  spaced  100  to  200  metres  apart  with  spacing  of  10  to  30  metres 
between holes along the lines, but line spacing could be more than one kilometre in as outside the 
principal zones. All holes were scheduled to be drilled at -50° to a planned depth of 55-70 m. 722 
RAB  holes  totalling  30,283  m  were  completed.  The  cuttings  from  the  RAB  drill  holes  were 
logged  in detail and 16,247 samples  were collected and shipped to ALS Chemex assay labs in 
Bamako,  Mali  for  assay  (see  below  for  sampling  and  assay  methods).  Significant  results  (with 
assay  results  higher  than  1.00  g  Au  /  t)  are  shown  on  Table  7  below,  and  the positions  of the 
RAB lines are shown on Figure 11a to 11g. Appendix B presents an complete list of the drilling 
parameters and results of the RAB holes.

TABLE 7 SIGNIFICANT RESULTS OF RAB DRILLING
The drilling confirmed the presence of mineralisation in the areas of geochemical anomaly with a 
depth  extension  of  at  least  30  metres,  and  still  open  at  depth.  Numerous  RAB  holes  ended  in 
mineralisation  and  four  longitudinal  lines  along  the  anomalies,  with  significant  gold  grades, 
provide further evidence of the continuity of the mineralisation in a north-south trend.

10.2.  DIAMOND DRILLING
Merrex has conducted several diamond drill campaigns on theSiribaya project. Drill core samples 
were shipped for gold analysis to ALS Chemex ABILAB Laboratory in Bamako. The driller was 
the  African  division  of  Boart  Longyear  Canada,  of  North  Bay,  Ontario.  Table-8  displays  the 
rparameter of all the diamond drill holes completed on the Siribaya project since 2006, and a list 
of the significant drill results (all intersections greater than 0.05 gr Au/t ) is shown in Appendix 
C. 
 
In  2006,  an  orientation  drill  programme  of  five  holes  (see figure  12a)  was  conducted  close  to 
Berekegni village on, the western margin of the Siribaya Structure to test the geology of inactive, 
underground  artisanal  workings  and  yielded  gold  intersections  including  3.30  g/t  Au  over 
3.2metres and 2.40 g/t Au over 1.5m. These are drilled intersection lengths; there is insufficient 
evidence to estimate true widths. This programme confirmed that the gold mineralisation outlined 
in the geochemical anomalies continued at depth. However, poor recoveries occurred in saprolitic 
felsic rocks, fault zones and possible underground workings. 
 
Two diamond drilling campaigns were conducted in 2007. The initial programme comprised 25 
holes  totalling  3,666  metres  and  confirmed  that  the  gold  mineralization  within  the  Siribaya 
Structure  was  continuous  to  a  depth exceeding  100 metres.  Eight holes  were  drilled  to  test the 
east-west quartz vein mineralisation in the Timeta Zone, which had been worked underground by 
artisanal miners (see figure 12b). The results suggested the presence of a steep, easterly-plunging 
shoot, possibly controlled by the intersection of northerly and easterly-trending structures. 
 
Zone 1A (see figure 12c) returned gold assays up 2.69 g/t over drilled lengths of 15 metres and 
2.92 g/t over 34 m. A number of the holes were terminated in mineralisation. The geometry of the 
mineralisation in Zone 1A remains to be fully delineated as significant intersections in Zone 1B 
led to suspension of work on Zone 1A.  
 
In Zone 1B (see figure 12d), drilling in late 2007 and up to July 2008 was focused along a 1 km 
strike length, where two styles of mineralisation mineralisation type  appears to be controlled by a 
fault  zone  that  continues  beyond  the  southern  limit  of  the  anomaly  towards  Berekegni  village, 
some 2 km to the southwest. The felsic dyke mineralisation appears to be a subsidiary system of 
Breccia type, apparently structurally sub-concordant to it, but this secondary system is currently 
poorly understood. The drilling was concentred on two sectors, Area 53 and Area 55 (see Figure 
13). A typical cross section throughout Area 55 is presented in Figure 14.  
 
In Zone 1B, the Breccia type in Area 55 returned the most significant results: SR-DD-08- 56 with 
5.07 g Au / t over a true width of 25 metres, SR-DD-08-55 with 3.89 g Au / t over 25 metres true 
width, SR-DD-08-62 with 5.92 g Au / t over 13.5 metres true width, SR-DD-08-68 with 5.54 g 
Au / t over 20 metres true width, and finally SR-DD-08-73 with 3.05 g Au / t over 21 metres true 
width. In Area 53,the Breccia type returned an intersection of 4.65 g Au / t over 14 metres true 
width from hole SR-DD-08-53.  
 
The most significant felsic dyke mineralisation results occur in Area 55 and include SR-DD-08-
69 with 4.02 g Au / t over 20 metres true width, SR-DD-08-72 with 4.31 g Au / t over 14 metres 
true width, and SR-DD-08-05 with 2.25 g Au / t over 14 metres true width.   
 
The  Area  55  mineralisation  (Breccia  Lens  Type)  has  been  delineated  in  detail  along  a  strike 
length of 350 metres to a depth of 270 metres and remains open in all directions; also in Area 55, 
the  Felsic  Dyke  type  has  been  followed  for  essentially  the  same  strike  length,  but  only  to  a

Breccias have been delineated along a strike length of around 150 metres to a vertical depth of 
175 metres; the Felsic Dyke type has been recognised only locally in this area, at a vertical depth 
of around 70 metres. In both areas, the mineralisation is dipping East (60° to sub-vertical for the 
Breccias, and around 50° for the Felsic Dykes), and both mineralisation types appear to have a

BRECCIAS AND FELSIC DYKES IN ZONE 55
11.  SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH
11.1.  SOIL SAMPLING
Where soil is present, samples are collected at a depth of 40 cm and sieved on site until 500 gm of 
material less than 80 mesh has been accumulated; when a very hard lateritic cap is encountered, 
samples  are  collected  directly  from  the  surface.  The  sieved  samples  are  then  shipped  for  gold 
assaying at ALS Chemex Laboratory in Bamako which is accredited to ISO 9001:2000.
11.2.  TRENCH SAMPLING
Channel samples were collected at the bottom of the north wall of the trench. The samples had a 
maximum length of two metres and were collected from a groove of 10 by 10 cm. Each sample 
was then poured as a conical heap on a clean surface (a clean sample bag) and divided in four 
quarters; two opposite quarters were eliminated, and the two other ones mixed together and kept; 
this splitting operation was repeated until a sample of 2-3 kg was obtained. The split sample was 
then put in a plastic bag with a numbered tag inside, and the number of the tag written directly on 
the plastic bag. The sample bags were then taken to the Merrex camp, where they were prepared 
for transport to the ALS laboratory. In trenches, in lateritic cap material outside of the interpreted 
mineralised  zones  two  metres  samples  were  collected,  reducing  to  one  metre  samples  in  the 
mineralisation.  Where the trench  was  excavated in saprolite,  one  metre  samples  were  collected 
both inside and outside the interpreted mineralised zones. 
 
Howe notes that in several areas, structures were visible that were sub-parallel to the trench walls, 
but  the  sampling  method  could  not  assess  these  features,  which  are  known  elsewhere  on  the 
property  to  carry  significant  mineralisation.  This  should  be  addressed  in  future  trenching  by 
ensuring that, where these features are observed, trenches should be cut orthogonal to their strike.
11.3.  PIT SAMPLING
The  same  procedures  as  the  trench  sampling  were  followed,  though  the  pit  samples  were 
collected  along  a  vertical  channel  in  the  northern  face  of  the  pit.  In  the  pits  where  one  metre 
galleries  were  excavated  in  the  east  and  west  sides  at  the  bottom  of  the  pit,  three  horizontal, 
contiguous one metre channel samples were collected.  
 
Trench and pit sampling was always conducted under the supervision of a geologist. In both cases 
no duplicate or standard samples were inserted in the collected samples.
ACA HOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
42
11.4.  RAB DRILL SAMPLING
Samples were taken every one or two metres down the hole and the entire hole was sampled. The 
samples were collected at the exit of the drill cyclone with plastic buckets, resulting in 30-35 kg 
of  material.  The  cyclone was  blown  clean  by  the  drill  operator  between  samples.  Each  sample 
was  split  with a  high  capacity  splitter  until  a two to three  kg  sample  for  assay and  a  duplicate 
were obtained, and both samples were bagged and numbered. The excess material was poured as 
heaps of cuttings on the ground in a systematic down-hole line for photographing and logging by 
a  geologist.  Control  samples  were inserted  at approximately  every  25  samples, and  a duplicate 
sample and a blank sample were alternatively intercalated in the sampling sequence.
11.5.  DRILL CORE SAMPLING
Core recovery 
 
The sample recovery varies with rock type, with poor recovery through fault zones. The recovery 
is  generally  acceptable  in  the  laterite,  saprolite  and  in  the  sedimentary  sequence.  In  altered 
brecciated  rock,  the  principal  host  for  the  gold  mineralisation,  recovery  varies  from  60%-95% 
with lower recoveries from sand or clay-rich zones. Silicified breccias have high recoveries.  
 
Sampling procedures 
 
The sample intervals were generally 1 metre for the entire core, and geological boundaries could 
be  crossed  by  samples.  Howe  would  recommend  that  samples  should  terminate  at  significant 
geological  contacts.  The  core  was  logged  by  the  geologists,  then  samples  were  selected  and 
marked in the core box using two numbered sample tags placed in a small plastic bag between 
two pieces of core at the beginning of the sample. The core was then sawn with a diamond saw 
blade and placed with one sample tag in a 24cm x 40cm plastic bag.  The second tag remained in 
the core box. The saw was washed down between samples. Where poor recoveries occurred, solid 
core was sawn in the usual way and half of the fines from the interval were taken. The results 
were reported as representative of the recorded interval, and may thus overestimate the interval 
grades. 
 
The depths at the start and finish of each sample were recorded in the core log. One blank sample 
and one duplicate sample were included in each batch of 25 samples, though no standard samples 
have been included to date, and no samples have been sent out to other laboratories, which Howe 
considers to be a significant shortcoming in the Merrex QA/QC procedure that should be rectified 
in future programmes. 
  
Each  sample  was  given  a  unique  number,  derived  from  a  sample  book  supplied  by  the  assay 
laboratory. Sample numbers were recorded on the geological log and on a separate sheet. Sample 
number errors are not considered by Howe to present a significant risk. While there is a minor 
risk of recording the incorrect interval by transposing interval numbers or misreading the drillers’ 
metre tag, hole number or similar errors, this is minimised as the numerical input was checked by 
the geologists, by the geotechnicians recording the sample batch and again upon reception at the 
assay laboratory.
ACA HOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED

The  HQ  size  drill  core  samples  were  shipped  for  gold  analysis  to  ALS  Chemex  ABILAB 
Laboratory in Bamako.
11.6.  SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY
All  samples  were  prepared  at  the  laboratory  and  analysed  in  the  same  manner.  Samples  were 
pulverised to less than 200 mesh then a 50g fraction was assayed for gold by fire assay with an 
atomic absorption (AAS) finish, which has a detection limit of  3ppb. Howe observed the field 
and  sampling  procedures  and  is  satisfied  that  the  work  was  conducted  to  a  high  standard. 
Stringent sample security was in place at all times.
11.6.1.  SOIL SAMPLES
Analysis of samples was carried out using fire assay with atomic absorption finish on pulverised 
cuts of 50 gm, with a detection limit of 3 ppb. The results of the geochemical survey were plotted 
with a colour contour system using a high value cut-off of 200 ppb. Background was less than 20 
ppb. The same sampling method has been used for detailed geochemical surveys (2006-2007) on 
the  Babara  permit,  where  line  spacing  was  of  200  m.  Sub-regional  geochemical  surveys  were 
conducted  in  2006-2007  in  the  northern  part  of  the  Kofia  permit  and  in  the  western  part  of 
Siribaya permit, also using the same sampling method.
11.6.2.  TRENCH AND PIT SAMPLES
Analysis of trench and pit samples was carried out by using the same method as that used for the 
soil samples. The shipment of the samples to the laboratory was usually by truck, or occasionally 
by plane from Kenieba to Bamako.
11.6.3.  RAB DRILL SAMPLES
The samples were transported by truck to the exploration camp in Berekegni (less than four km) 
under  the  direction  and  supervision  of  Merrex’s  named  Qualified  Person,  J-M  Gagnon.  The 
secured samples were packed in rice bags and shipped directly by truck or plane to Bamako with 
a  sample  shipment  control  form.  Samples  were  recorded  upon  receipt  at  the  ALS  Chemex 
ABILAB Laboratory. The samples were then pulverised using a flying disk or a ring and puck 
style grinding mill so that at least 85% of the material was reduced to better than 75 micron (200 
Mesh).
11.6.4.  DIAMOND DRILL SAMPLES
Sample security 
 
Once the core had been split and bagged at the Merrex camp, six to eight samples were packed in 
a large rice bag, the outside of which was marked with the sample numbers and the weight of the 
sample. This information was also recorded on a separate sheet, a copy of which was sent with 
the samples and the originals kept on site.  
 
The  sealed  rice  bags  were  transported  by  company  truck  from  the  Siribaya  project  site  to  the 
airstrip  at  Kenieba  for  transport  by  plane  to  Bamako.  Merrex  has  a  small  secure  warehouse 
building in Kenieba, where the samples were stored until the next shipment. The weights of the
ACA HOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
44
two shipments observed by Howe were approximately 300 kg and 800 kg. All work to the point 
of handing the samples over to the airline for delivery was completed by Merrex personnel and 
consultants. 
 
At  Bamako  airport,  the  samples  were  picked  up  by  a  Merrex  employee  and,  along  with  the 
sample  manifest,  were  transported  to  the  ALS  Chemex  Anilabs  laboratory  in  Bamako.  This 
laboratory  is  currently  working  towards  ISO  17025  registration.  All  ALS  Chemex  laboratories 
participate in a number of international Round Robin proficiency tests, such as those managed by 
CANMET and Geostats. Both of these agencies circulate samples for analysis twice a year and 
evaluate the performance of participating laboratories.  
 
In Howe’s view, the sample security is adequate. 
 
Sample preparation and assaying 
 
In the reception area of the laboratory, samples were taken out of the rice bag and checked against 
the  manifest,  then  they  were  sorted,  weighed  and  a  bar  code  sample  number  and  unique  job 
number assigned to each sample. The sample information was entered into ALS System under the 
ALS job number.  
 
The sample was then placed in a drying tray. A tag with a unique sample number with the job 
number was placed in the sample tray with the sample. Samples were dried for 24 hours and then 
the samples were crushed to 75% minus 2mm and split. The crusher was cleaned by compressed 
air after each sample and after every 5 samples, barren rock was passed through the crusher and 
the crusher was cleaned again. 
 
A 1000 gm split of the crushed material was then pulverised in a “ring and puck” grinding mill to 
80% passing 200 mesh.  
 
To  ensure  that  adequate  pulverisation  is  maintained,  ALS  completes  a  sieve  size  analysis  after 
every 20 samples. After grinding, the sample was placed on a plastic sheet and a sample split of 
50 gm was taken for fire assay by cone and quartering the material. The ALS fire assay method 
used  by  Merrex  has  an  aqua  regia  digest  and  AAS  finish  and  has  a  lower  detection  limit  of 
0.001ppm  Au.  ALS  includes  two  international  standards  and  two  blanks  in  each  batch  of  24 
samples  andduplicates  are  routinely  assayed.  As  part  of  the  internal  laboratory  assessment  of 
every data set, results from the control samples are evaluated to ensure they meet set standards 
determined  by  the  precision  and  accuracy  requirements  of  the  method.  In  the  event  that  any 
reference material or duplicate result falls outside the established control limits, an Error Report 
is automatically generated. This ensures the person evaluating the sample set for data release is 
made aware that a problem may exist with the data set and investigation can be initiated. All data 
generated  from  quality  control  samples  is  automatically  captured  and  retained  in  a  separate 
database used for Quality Assessment. Quality control data for reference materials and duplicates 
are  routinely  issued  together  with  the  Certificates  of  Analysis.  QC  data  summaries  and 
customised QC reports are also available. 
 
Laboratory visit 
 
Howe visited the ALS laboratory and noted that the drying, crushing and assaying sections are in 
close  proximity,  so  there  is  some  possibility  of  cross-contamination.  Merrex  does  not  send 
samples to a second laboratory for QA/QC purposes and Howe recommends that this should be
ACA HOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
45
conducted in future on selected pulps and rejects from samples that have returned 1 g/t or more 
from ALS.  
 
In  the  writer's  opinion  the  ALS  Laboratory  procedures  could  be  improved  but  are  adequate  to 
provide a reasonable estimate of the amount of gold in the sample.
11.7.  DATA VERIFICATION
Following a review of the drill logs and cross sections a total of eight previously assayed intervals 
from  five  drill  holes  were  selected  by  Howe  for  check  assaying.  Quarter  sections  of  drill  core 
were cut on site under Howe’s supervision. Each core slice was bagged separately in a 24cm x 
40cm plastic bag, a sample tag was stapled in the bag and also written on the outside of the bag 
and the eight samples were sealed in a large rice bag which was marked with the sample numbers 
and weight of the sample.  
  
The rice bag remained in Howe’s custody and was taken to  the ALS laboratory in  Bamako  on 
July 7th, 2008.  
 
At the laboratory, the samples were subject to the same QA/QC protocols as the normal Merrex 
sampling  and  fire  assayed  using  the  same  methodologies  utilised  by  Merrex.  In  addition,  the 
samples were cyanide leached in a bottle roll test to determine if there is refractory gold in the 
sulphides. The results of the check sampling are shown below.

while  the  check  samples  have  generally  returned  higher  values  than  the  original  samples,  with 
one  highly  elevated  result  indicating  a  nugget  effect,  the  bottle  roll  total  leach  results  are 
reasonably  comparable,  though  slightly  lower  than  the  fire  assay  originals.  The  latter  may 
indicate a degree of encapsulation of the gold.
11.8.  PROBLEMS WITH SOURCE DATA
Howe’s  examination  of the data held on site and provided from Merrex head office revealed a 
number of problems that required addressing:
•  Soil  Geochemical  results:There  were  problems  with  the  positional  and  numbering 
information in several areas; these have now been addressed and Howe is confident that 
the soil sampling data is now accurate.
•  Drill Hole results:Howe examined the full drill data set and found several errors: assay 
values from drill logs SR-DD-08-71 to SR-DD-08-76 were either partially complete or
ACA HOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
49
missing, as were assay values from hole SR-DD-08-30. There were a few positional and 
typographical errors in the raw data. These have been attended to and Howe is satisfied 
with the current integrity of the database.

12.   ADJACENT PROPERTIES
No  relevant  information  concerning  adjacent  properties  has  been  located  in  the  public 
domain.
13.  MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING
No  mineral  processing  or  metallurgical  testing  has  been  conducted  on  mineralisation 
from the Merrex permits.
14.   MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES
15.  MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
During  September-November  2008,  ACA  Howe  International  Limited  (“Howe”)  carried  out  a 
resource  estimate  for  Zone  1B  of  the  Siribaya  deposit.  Merrex  was  responsible  for  all  of  the 
surface sampling and diamond drilling upon which the resource estimate was based. The resource 
estimate included holes up to Hole SR-DD-08-76.  
 
This resource estimate was prepared by Doug Roy, M.A.Sc., P.Eng., Associate Mining Engineer 
with Howe. Micromine software (Version 11.0.3) was used to facilitate the resource estimating 
process. 
 
The resource estimate was prepared in accordance with CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and 
Reserves2 where:
  A Measured Mineral Resource, as defined by the CIM Standing Committee is “that part 
of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical 
characteristics  are  so  well  established  that  they  can  be  estimated  with  confidence 
sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to 
support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The 
estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information 
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits,

geological  and  grade  continuity.  The  estimate  is  based  on  limited  information  and 
sampling  gathered  through  appropriate  techniques  from  locations  such  as  outcrops, 
trenches, pits, working and drill holes.”
Resource classification, or assigning a level of confidence to Mineral Resources, was undertaken 
in strict adherence to the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves. 
 
This report quotes estimates for mineral resources only. There are no mineral reserves prepared or 
reported in this technical report.
15.1.  DATA SOURCES 
For resource estimation, Merrex provided a digital drill hole database in Microsoft Excel format 
that contained collar surveys, down-hole surveys, geological logs and assays for holes up to, and 
including  Hole SR-DD-08-76.  Merrex  had  corrected  this  data  according  recommendations  that 
Patrick Hannon made during his site visit. 
 
Data was imported into the following data files:
Data Type 
Collar 
Downhole Survey 
Assays 
Geology
File 
northzone-collar.dat 
northzone-survey.dat 
northzone-samples.dat 
northzone-geology.dat
15.2.  GRID SHIFT 
For ease in modelling, the grid was shifted 260,000 metres west and 1,370,000 metres south.
15.3.  DATA REVIEW 
A review of hardcopy and digital data was undertaken and the assay data was interrogated and 
verified.  Digital  data  validation,  three  dimensional  visualization,  modelling  and  resource 
estimation was undertaken using Micromine software (Version 11.0.3). A few minor corrections 
were made. No major errors were detected. The author determined that the quality of the data was 
acceptable for the purpose of resource estimation.
15.4.  SAMPLE REGULARISATION 
To  provide  a  common  “support”  for  statistical  analysis  (Section 15.4)  and  grade  estimation 
(Section 15.10),  samples  were  regularised  over  a  1.0 metre  sample  interval  –  by  far  the  most 
common  sampling  interval.  The  results  were  stored  in  a  file  named  “northzone-samples-
comp1m.dat.”
15.5.  MINERALISED ZONE INTERPRETATION 
Mineralised  zones  were  outlined  to  enforce  geological  control  during  block  modelling.  The 
following guidelines were used when outlining zones. 
 
1.  A “loose” cut-off grade of 0.25 g/tonne of gold was used. Zones were allowed to extend
through lower grade areas if warranted by the geological interpretation.
ACA HOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
52
2.  Zones were extended up- and down-dip by approximately fifty metres beyond the last
intercept.
3.  Zones were extended halfway to adjacent, under-mineralised sections or on-section
intercepts.
4.  Zones were extended 50 metres along strike beyond the last section. 
5.  Outlines were refined using longitudinal sections of the zones. 
 
A  “polygonal  section  model”  (named  Model  “A”)  was  created  to  facilitate  the  zone  outlining 
process. Cross-sections were defined over the site grid. Cross-section definitions were included as 
Error! Reference source not found.2. The zone interpretation was carried out on hard (paper) 
copies of the cross-sections. The outlines were then digitised and refined. 
 
Mineralised zones (twenty of them) were outlined on fourteen cross-sections. These were stored 
in fourteen separate “outline” files (one for each cross-section) with the prefix “GEOLAX.DAT” 
where “X” represents the Section File Number (refer to Table 12 for Section File Numbers). 
 
Samples  that  were  within  the  interpreted  outlines  were  tagged.  Sample  statistics  (Section 15.6) 
were calculated using the tagged samples. 
 
The zones were numbered 1-21 excepting 17. They were presented graphically in Figure 15a. A 
complete set of cross-sections showing the interpreted mineralised zones was included as .

Figure 15a: Mineralised zones and diamond drill traces, facing north.
15.6.  SAMPLE STATISTICS 
Sample statistics were calculated for diamond drill samples within the mineralised zones. 
 
The histogram for all samples within the mineralised zones approximately showed a lognormal 
distribution (Figure 15b). Two spikes, occurring at 0.01 and 0.02 grams of gold per tonne, skewed 
the distribution.  
 
Figure 15c shows a histogram for samples with values greater than 0.02 g/tonne. The mean value 
was  1.42 g/tonne.  The  “mean  plus  two  standard  deviations”  value  occurred at  9 g/tonne. There 
were 45 samples greater than 9 g/tonne (2 % of the population). Half of those samples occurred in 
Zone  9  (a  main  zone  in  the  northern  half  of  the  deposit)  at  a  depth  of  125-175 metres  below 
surface.  
 
From  analysis  of  the  sample  statistics,  there  was  no  evidence  of  near-surface  supergene  gold 
enrichment – quite the opposite. The mean sample grade for the laterite zone was 0.39 g/tonne 
(Figure 15d). For the saprolite  zone, the mean grade was 1.10 g/tonne (Figure 15e) and for the 
hard  rock  zone,  the  mean  grade  increased  to  1.69 g/tonne  (Figure  15f).  In  other  words,  grades 
increased with depth.

15.7.  TOP-CUT VALUE 
A sample top-cut value of 9 g/tonne was selected for diamond drill samples. Samples that were 
greater than the top-cut value were cut back to 9 g/tonne prior to block grade estimation.
15.8.  VARIOGRAPHY 
The  mineralised  zone  wireframe  models  were  used  to  identify  which  samples  were  within  the 
zones. Variography was carried out on diamond drill samples within the mineralised domain.  
 
The  omni-directional  (directionless)  semi-variogram  showed  a  clear  trend  to  which  a  spherical 
model could readily be fit (Figure). The range was 42 metres.
ACA HOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
57
Figure 15g: Omni-directional semi-variogram. 
 
Directional  semi-variogram  data  was  also  calculated  (Figure  15h).  Notice  that  in  the  strike 
direction (black dots), there were very few sample pairs with a spacing or lag less than 35 metres, 
which  makes  sense  given  the  orientation  of  the  drill  holes  and  spacing  of  the  drilling  fences 
(typically 35-60 metres). The omni-directional model (yellow line from Figure 15g) was shown in 
Figure for reference.  
 
Directional  semi-variogram  data  were  calculated  for  several  directions  within  the  plane  of  the 
mineralisation to investigate whether there were trends or shoots within the plane. Unfortunately, 
with very few sample pairs in the strike direction, the results were poor. The dip (Figure 15i) and 
normal (to the mineralised plane, Figure 15j) directions both produced reasonably good results to 
which models were fit. No trends in the other directions were detected.

15.9.  BLOCK MODELLING

reported in Table 13.

15.10. BLOCK GRADE ESTIMATION 
The  ordinary  block  kriging  (“OBK”)  method  was  used  for  estimating  block  grades.  The  semi-
variogram model parameters were reported in Table 14. Because no meaningful parameters could 
be determined in the strike direction, for the purpose of grade estimation it was assumed that the 
strike direction parameters were equal to the dip direction parameters. 
 
During block kriging, each block was discretised into eight divisions – two in the north direction, 
two in the east direction and two in the elevation direction. No grade transformation was carried 
out. 
 
Only diamond drill samples were used because trench samples carried a different “support” than 
diamond drill samples. Trenching results aided the process of zone interpretation. 
 
A separate block model was created for each zone (1-21, except 17) and each resource category 
(Indicated and Inferred). The file names followed the pattern “Blocks-CAT-ZONE,” where CAT 
represented  the  resource  category  (“Ind”  for  Indicated  or  “Inf”  for  Inferred)  and  ZONE 
represented the zone name (1-21, except 17). For example, the Indicated model for Zone 1 had 
the filename “Blocks-Ind-01.dat.” Those forty files were compiled in a single file named “Blocks 
- Ind and Inf Compiled.dat.”

15.11. RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
Resource  classification  parameters  were  chosen  based  on  a  combination  of  variography  results 
and  the  author’s  judgement.  The  degree  of  confidence  in  the  reported  resources  was  classified 
based on the validity and robustness of input data and the proximity of resource blocks to sample 
locations. Resources were reported, as required by NI 43-101, according to the CIM Standards on 
Minerals Resources and Reserves. 
 
The search ellipse parameters that were used for estimating block grades were reported in Table 
15. The search radii for the Inferred resource category (dip and normal directions) were equal to 
the semi-variogram ranges. Because no range could be inferred from the strike direction data, the 
search radius in that direction was assumed to be equal to the dip direction radius.  
 
For  the  dip  and  normal  directions,  the  Indicated  radii  were  two-thirds  of  the  Inferred  radii. 
Because there was less certainty in the strike direction, one-half of the Inferred radius was used in 
the dip direction. 
 
For a block to be classified as Inferred, there needed to be at least two samples from at least one 
hole within the Inferred search ellipse. For an Indicated block, there needed to be at least three 
samples from at least two holes within the Indicated search ellipse. 
 
A maximum of 12 samples were used to estimate each block grade. Using more samples caused 
excessive grade smoothing.

15.12. SPECIFIC GRAVITY ESTIMATION 
Specific gravity (“SG”) values were quantitatively determined (through laboratory analysis) using 
four  samples  of  saprolite  rock  and  three  samples  of  hard  (non-weathered)  rock.  The  average 
values were 1.8 and 2.8, respectively.  
 
No SG analysis was carried out on the laterite cover, which averages 8-10 metres thick over the 
deposit. That material contains abundant iron oxide and has a higher SG than the hard rock. The 
SG may range anywhere from 3 to 5. A conservative value of 3 was used. 
 
From Figure 15k, it is evident that there is a laterite layer of 8-10 metres. With a few exceptions, 
saprolite  weathering  extends  down  to  a  total  depth  of  approximately  75 metres  before 
transitioning to hard rock.
ACA HOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
61
Figure 15k: SG values, facing west. 
 
Digital terrain models (“DTM”’s) were created to represent the bottom of laterite and the bottom 
of saprolite layers. Blocks were then assigned an SG value based on their positions relative to the 
layers. 
 
The  author  recommends  that  further  SG  test  work  be  carried  out,  both  on  existing  samples 
(particularly in the laterite zone) and on a representative portion of future sampling.
15.13. RESULTS 
Resources for Zone 1B were determined using a block cut-off grade of 0.5 g/tonne. 
 
Non-diluted  Indicated  Resources  totaled  2.12 million  tonnes  with  an  average  grade  of 
1.81 g/tonne for 123,000 ounces ( Table 16 and Table 17). 
 
Non-diluted Inferred Resources totaled 5.70 million tonnes with an average grade of 1.74 g/tonne 
for 319,000 ounces (Table 16 and Table 17). 
 
The  current  sample  spacing  provided  sufficient  confidence  to  justify  a  certain  proportion  of 
resources in the Indicated category. Closer spaced sampling, particularly in the strike direction, is 
needed to provide the required level of confidence for the Measured category.   
 
Mineral Reserves were not outlined because it was beyond the scope of this Report.

Resources were tallied by “bench” and reported in Table 18 and Table 19. Indicated Resources 
above the 100 metre bench (approximately 100 metres depth) totaled 1.1 million tonnes with an 
average grade of 1.33 g/tonne for 48,900 ounces. That represented 54 % of the Indicated tonnes 
and 40 % of the Indicated metal (ounces). 
 
Inferred  Resources  above  the  100 metre  bench  (approximately  100 metres  depth)  totaled 
2.4 million  tonnes  with  an  average  grade  of  1.45  g/tonne  for  110,000 ounces.  That  represented 
41 % of the Inferred tonnes and 35 % of the Indicated metal (ounces).  
 
From Table 19, one can see that below the 100 metre bench (approximately 100 metres depth), 
grades  generally  increased.  That  elevation  approximately  corresponded  to  the  transition  zone 
between  saprolite  and  hard  (non-weathered)  rock.  In  other  words,  block  grades  were  generally 
higher in the deeper hard rock. This observation agrees with those made in the Sample Statistics 
section (Section 15.6).
ACA HOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
63
Also  from  Table  19,  one  can  see  that  the  “ounces  per  vertical  metre”  value  approximately 
doubled  below  100 metres  depth.  For  the  Indicated blocks  in  the  50-100 metres  depth  interval, 
there  were  460 ounces  per  vertical  metre.  For  the  next  50 metre  interval  down,  that  value 
increased  to  1,060 ounces  per  vertical  metre.  Likewise,  for  the  Inferred  blocks,  the  ounces  per 
vertical metre increased from 1,100 to 2,400 over the same interval.

16.  OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION
Not Applicable
17.  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS
•  Merrex has acquired a significant land holding in the Kenieba gold district of West Mali, comprising 
four  contiguous  licences  totaling  574  km2,  a  fifth,  covering  127  km2,  contiguous  to  the  west  is 
currently in the process of registration. The company is also applying for additional ground which 
would increase the landholding to around 1000 km2.
•  The  licences  lie  within  an  established  gold  belt  where  a  number  of  important  deposits  have  been 
found in a variety of host rocks. They cover areas of historic artisanal gold mining, both alluvial and 
hard rock.
•  Prior  to  commencing  work  on  the  project  area,  Merrex  acquired  and  interpreted  regional  Russian 
geochemical surveys that identified linear, northerly-trending zones of gold anomaly totaling over 
100 km.
•  Work  by  Merrex  to  date  has  included  gridded  geochemical  soil  surveys,  pitting,  trenching,  RAB 
drilling  and  diamond  drilling.  Samples  are  routinely  assayed  at  the  ALS  Chemex  ABILAB 
Laboratory in Bamako.
•  The  Merrex  sample  quality  control  and  quality  assurance  programme  is  adequate  for this  stage  of 
exploration. The ALS Chemex ABILAB Laboratory treatment is adequate although there could be 
improvements in the laboratory. The ALS Chemex ABILAB Laboratory results should be checked 
in another laboratory. Pulps from samples with assays greater than 1 g/t should be identified and a 
portion (say 5%) should be sent to a second laboratory for fire assay.
•  Merrex’s exploration work has been largely confined to a 10km zone of gold anomalies coincident 
with  a  regional  aeromagnetic  anomaly  in  the  northern  part  of  the  licence  block.  The  latter  is 
interpreted as a regional-scale shear zone and has been termed the Siribaya Structure by Merrex.
•  Several distinct anomalies have been tested in detail within this trend. Recent work has concentrated 
on the 1B anomaly on the Siribaya Licence. Diamond drilling to date has identified quartz veining 
and stockwork gold and base metal mineralisation associated with felsic intrusives and shearing.
•  Based  on  the  integration  of  the  geology,  geochemistry,  geophysics,  RAB  drilling  and  diamond 
drilling completed in 2007 within Zone 1B, Merrex has generated a geological model and outlined a 
mineralised sub-zone which is approximately 350 metres long, 7 - 12 metres average true width, at 
least 270 metres deep with gold grades varying between 2 and 5 g/t gold. The gold is associated with 
fine grained sulphides including arsenopyrite and pyrite with subordinate chalcopyrite and sphalerite 
disseminated mainly in felsic rocks with occasional graphite. This zone is open along strike and at 
depth.
•  The  extensive  Bambadinka  zone  lies  to  the  west  of  the  Siribaya  structure  and  contains  numerous 
gold-in-soil anomalies. Pitting to date indicates that the gold is contained within the surface laterite, 
which may represent a significant, easily worked deposit. Limited evidence suggests a nearby hard 
rock  source; the  southern part of  the  anomaly  appears  to coincide  with  a  splay  from  the  Siribaya 
structure.
•  The Siribaya structure represents only a small percentage of the known anomalous areas. Merrex has 
commenced  the  systematic  testing  of  the  principal  anomalies  indicated  by  the  previous  Russian 
work elsewhere on the property.
•  Around 70% of the most extensive anomaly from previous work, which is situated on the Babara
licence in the east of the block, has currently been tested by Merrex .
•  Trenching, pitting and drilling of anomalies to date have usually yielded in-situ gold mineralization,
though the work has concentrated on the northerly-trending features.
ACA HOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
66
•  There  is  clear  evidence  of  east-west  mineralisation  that  has  been  worked  locally,  is  exposed  in 
trenching,  and  identified  by  detailed  analysis  of  soil  geochemistry  and  satellite  imagery.  The 
structural trends controlling this mineralisation should be delineated and tested in future work.
•  Satellite imagery interpretation has indicated a number of structurally controlled targets, including
east-west structures, the majority of which remain untested.
•  A detailed independent analysis of the Russian multielement geochemical data has indicated several 
important mineralisation trends and has identified potentially significant pathfinder elements which 
could  assist  future  exploration.  Unfortunately,  Merrex  has  only  assayed  soils  samples  for  gold  to 
date, though even with this limited data base, trends normal to the northerly Siribaya Structure have 
been identified.
•  Future  work  should  take  account  of  the  cross-cutting  features  indicated  by  the  independent  data 
analyses to date. Soil samples should be analysed for a suite of elements, including all pathfinders 
identified by the geochemical study. .
•  Howe recommends that the delineation drilling on the 1B mineralized zone should continue;. 
•  Reverse  Circulation  drilling  should  be  implemented  in  the  next  drilling  phase.  Significant  assay 
intervals can be followed up with diamond drilling. Drill hole spacing should be increased to have 
sections a minimum of 100m apart.
•  Mineral Resources were estimated. Using a block cut-off grade of 0.5 g/tonne, non-diluted Indicated 
Resources for Zone 1B totaled 2.12 million tonnes with an average grade of 1.81 g/tonne gold for 
123,000 ounces of gold.
•  Non-diluted  Inferred  Resources  totaled  5.70 million tonnes  with  an  average  grade  of  1.74 g/tonne
gold for 319,000 ounces of gold.
•  Sample values were higher in the deeper, hard rock zone than in the shallower, saprolite zone. The
“ounces of gold per vertical metre” value approximately doubled below 100 metres depth.
•  The deposit is “open” along strike in both directions and at depth.
18.  EXPLORATION PROGRAMME
Merrex  has  planned  a  comprehensive  programme  for  the  next  twelve  months,  to  further  delineate  the 
resources at Siribaya, extend the geochemical coverage to the remaining licence areas, test known anomalies 
elsewhere  by  closely  spaced  geochemical  grids,  pitting,  trenching  and  RAB  drilling.  An  aeromagnetic 
survey is also planned to cover all licences.
18.1.  DIAMOND DRILLING
A total of 6,600 m of diamond drilling is planned both to test the known mineralisation at depth and along 
strike,  leading  to  a  resource  estimate,  and  limited  testing  of  anomalous  or  poorly  defined  zones  on  the 
Siribaya  structure.  The  drill  campaign  will  also  include  downhole  geophysics  to  confirm  mineralisation 
trends and identify off-hole mineralised lenses.   
 
Closely spaced sampling along strike should be carried out to establish the variogram range along strike. A 
series  of  ten,  70 metre  deep  diamond  drill  holes  should  be  drilled. The collars  should  be  arranged in  two 
parallel  lines  along  strike  at  spacing  of  5-10  metres  and  a  plunge  of  -50 °  west.  Two  areas  would  be 
appropriate  for  this  work  –  the  area  around  Sections  2045-2080  (34+20 N  –  34+50 N)  or  2650-2700 
(41+00 N – 41+40 N). Either area would be appropriate.  
 
Eleven fences should be drilled to explore geochemical and geophysical targets in the area around Zone 1B. 
Fences  should  be  drilled  at  a  spacing  of  approximately  500 metres.  In  total,  6,600 metres  of  exploration 
drilling is recommended. 
 
Further specific gravity (“SG”) test work should be carried out. To start, existing drill core samples from the 
saprolite and hard rock zones can be tested on site using a dry weight versus submerged weight method. At 
least 25 representative samples from each zone (saprolite and hard rock) should be selected. To estimate the
ACA HOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED
67
laterite  material’s  SG,  sample  pits  should  be  carefully  dug  in  representative  areas.  The  SG  value  can  be 
calculated for each sample by dividing the dry weight of the excavated material by the pit volume. Ten such 
samples should be sufficient. The statistics from the SG test work should be examined to determine whether 
the sample size from each zone was large enough.
18.2.  SOIL AND TERMITE MOUND SAMPLING
The  current  soil  grids  will  be  extended  and  systematic  sampling  will  be  conducted  on  those  areas  of  the 
Russian  survey  that  are  currently  untested.  Termite  mound  sampling  will  be  applied  as  a  regional 
exploration  tool  and  will  be  followed  up,  where  necessary,  by  systematic  soil  sampling.  Multielement 
analysis will be conducted.
18.3.  PITTING AND TRENCHING
Geochemical anomalies identified by the soil sampling will be initially tested by pitting and trenching.
18.4.  RAB DRILLING
A programme of RAB drilling is planned to test known anomalous areas within the current grid areas and to 
test  strike  extensions  of  known  anomalous  zones.  Targets  and  trends  identified  by  the  analysis  of 
geochemical data, and the satellite imagery interpretation, described above, will also be investigated. RAB 
drilling can be followed up by diamond drilling in areas of interest. 
 
An aeromagnetic/radiometric survey will be flown over the licence block to provide greater structural detail, 
particularly  on  the  Siribaya  Structure  and  to  identify  cross-cutting  features  that  may  exert  control  on  the 
distribution of mineralisation.

Howe considers that the programme is well planned and should meet its objectives. Howe has examined the 
costings and finds that they are reasonable, inline with costs confirmed during the Howe visits to the project 
and are based on costs previously established over the several years during which Merrex and Touba have 
operated in Western Mali. .
