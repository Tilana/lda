EX-TEMPORE RULING

I am satisfied, after perusing the affidavits filed by the parties and the submissions from the Counsel, that the Applicant has sufficiently shown a prima facie and arguable case.

There are the questions raised on whether the Permanent Secretary of Labour had correctly directed himself on the relevant issues to be taken into consideration in making decisions under section 3 of the Trade Union (Recognition) Act (Cap 96A) as well as the issue of jurisdiction generally. Further, there is the issue of the exercise of discretion and in that regard, whether the Permanent Secretary for Labour and the Minister had properly exercised their discretions and taken relevant matters into account, before making their decisions which the applicant now attempts to have them reviewed. I am satisfied that the delay was not totally due to the Applicant.

Under these circumstances, leave is granted.

Cost in the cause.
