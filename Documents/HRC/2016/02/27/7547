<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its nineteenth session 
from 28 April to 9 May 2014. The review of Dominica was held at the 7th meeting, on 1 
May 2014. The delegation of Dominica was headed by Mr. Vince Henderson, Ambassador 
and Permanent Representative of the Commonwealth of Dominica to the United Nations in 
New York. At its 14th meeting, held on 6 May 2014, the Working Group adopted the report 
on Dominica. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Dominica: Mexico, Sierra Leone and 
Germany. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Dominica: 
</p>
<p>(a) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/19/DMA/2); 
</p>
<p>(b) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/19/DMA/3).  
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Liechtenstein, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to Dominica through the troika. Those questions are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation stated that although Dominica had faced challenges since 
gaining political independence in 1978, the Government had been able to bring about 
significant improvements in the lives of the people. There had been major strides in access 
to and delivery of quality education, health care and social services, as well as protection of 
the rights of persons with disabilities and support for indigenous people, women and the 
elderly. The Government was committed to human rights, social justice and equity, which 
were enshrined in the Constitution of Dominica, and continued to protect the right to access 
to basic services. Fundamental rights had become deeply rooted in the culture, traditions 
and way of life of the people of Dominica. Those who were elected were required to always 
respect the people&#8217;s wishes and, therefore, social changes must be driven by the people in a 
manner that reflected their collective acceptance. 
</p>
<p>6. Dominica recognized its international obligations; however, constraints on both 
technical and financial resources made it difficult for the country to meet some of those 
obligations. The absence of a national human rights institution did not indicate that his 
country was unwilling to protect the rights of individuals, as it had been able to guarantee 
them even with limited resources. Nevertheless, training and technical assistance were 
necessary. In that regard, he thanked OHCHR for the assistance it had provided in meeting 
the demands of reporting and of implementing United Nations treaty obligations. Dominica 
looked forward to the continued support of and collaboration with OHCHR. </p>


<p>7. Access to education had been increased at the pre-kindergarten, primary, secondary 
and tertiary levels. Almost all children had access to pre-kindergarten education, and access 
to primary and secondary education was universal. An unprecedented number of university 
scholarships had been granted to students from Dominica, including young people from the 
Carib Territory, to pursue studies throughout the world, especially in Venezuela. 
</p>
<p>8. The primary health-care system provided access to health services throughout the 
island. Additionally, access to secondary and tertiary health care continued to be subsidized 
by the State to ensure that everyone could benefit from health services, irrespective of their 
socioeconomic status. The &#8220;Yes We Care&#8221; programme provided support and free home care 
to the elderly. 
</p>
<p>9. With regard to the right to housing, the &#8220;Housing Revolution&#8221; initiative, 
implemented by the Government since 2005, had provided homes for hundreds of families, 
including single mothers and members of the indigenous population. Recently, the 
Government had announced the implementation of a new housing initiative that would 
make 1,000 houses available to families; that initiative would complement the national 
sanitation project, which aimed to provide families with modern, hygienic toilets and access 
to potable water. 
</p>
<p>10. The Government had appointed a special commission to implement national 
obligations under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which 
Dominica had ratified in 2012. The commission would begin work soon and would present 
recommendations on policies that would enhance the quality of life of persons with 
disabilities. The Government remained committed to the full inclusion of persons with 
disabilities. 
</p>
<p>11. Dominica had made significant strides in the protection of women and children, 
including by its ratification in 2013 of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. The Government was reviewing all 
legislation related to violence against women and children with a view to strengthening the 
relevant provisions. Resources were provided to protect women and children, in particular 
those who were victims of domestic violence. Since 2011, at-risk or abandoned children 
were provided with accommodation, care and support.  
</p>
<p>12. The national gender policy adopted in 2006 had been updated and the Government 
would make every effort to provide the necessary resources for its implementation. The aim 
of the policy was to achieve gender equality and to strengthen the implementation of the 
Protection against Domestic Violence Act, in order to reduce violence and discrimination 
against women. A national strategic plan on gender-based violence would also soon be 
submitted for approval, but additional resources would be necessary for its implementation. 
In 2011, a central registry on domestic violence had been established in the Bureau of 
Gender Affairs, in which a record of all reported cases of domestic violence was stored. 
</p>
<p>13. Efforts to continue to raise public awareness of gender-related issues were ongoing. 
Activities included &#8220;Blow the Horn&#8221;, a motorcade to end gender-based violence, and a 
silent protest against sexual violence, especially child sexual abuse, as well as workshops 
and seminars with police and community leaders on violence against women and children. 
</p>
<p>14. The Education Act (Act No. 11 of 1997) allowed for the administration of corporal 
punishment but it was illegal for an unauthorized teacher to administer such punishment. In 
cases where it was authorized, several guidelines must be followed. The Ministry of 
Education encouraged alternatives means of discipline, which were reducing the use of 
corporal punishment. </p>


<p>15. There had been a moratorium in Dominica on the death penalty since 1986. 
However, popular sentiment favoured the reintroduction of executions in cases of murder. 
Therefore, the Government had taken the position that the death penalty would remain 
within the jurisdiction of the judiciary and would continue to be guided by the existing law. 
The current law on the death penalty was based on the 2003 ruling of the Privy Council of 
England, which was the final court of appeal for Dominica. In Dominica, the death penalty 
was the maximum penalty for murder, although it was imposed only in the most serious 
killings. 
</p>
<p>16. Dominica promoted freedom of expression, but the views expressed by individuals 
and groups opposed to the Government must remain within the legal provisions on libel and 
slander. Journalists must be held responsible within a democracy. Nevertheless, since 
independence, no criminal charges had been brought for libel or slander. 
</p>
<p>17. Since 2000, the Government had placed special emphasis on the indigenous people, 
the Caribs. A Ministry of Carib Affairs had been created to facilitate the delivery of 
government services, programmes and projects. The residents of the Carib Territory had 
been the beneficiaries of actions in health care, education, housing, social services, 
agriculture and tourism development, and of small business support programmes. As a 
result, Carib people had equal access to government services and, in some cases greater 
access than the general population of Dominica. 
</p>
<p>18. Persons living in the Carib Territory had free access to health care, and recent 
investments had improved local health services. Likewise, the indigenous population 
throughout Dominica had equal access to education. In particular, Carib children had 
universal access to secondary education, and post-secondary education had also been 
provided to Carib students since 2000. 
</p>
<p>19. Moreover, the Government had constructed 73 houses for families in the Carib 
Territory over the past 10 years. However, communal ownership of land in that area made it 
difficult for residents to obtain normal commercial financing for the construction of homes 
since they had no individual title and land ownership. 
</p>
<p>20. The Government had invested in special facilities for the showcasing and sale of 
products from the Carib Territory. Farmers in that area benefited from agricultural 
assistance, and members of the indigenous population received assistance in the 
development of small businesses and with employment under the National Employment 
Programme, the Small Business Support Programme and the Dominica Youth Business 
Trust. 
</p>
<p>21. With regard to the participation of women in political life, women in Dominica had 
gained the right to vote and to contest elections in 1924 and had been serving as elected and 
appointed members in Parliament for more than 60 years, in opposition and in Government. 
Women had also served as Prime Minister, Minister, Attorney-General and Speaker of the 
House of Assembly. Since independence in 1978, 8 women had been elected and 12 
nominated to serve in Parliament. For 24 of the ensuing 35 years, women had occupied the 
position of Speaker of the House of Assembly. Currently, two elected women and one 
nominated woman were serving in Parliament on the Government side. Two elected women 
were also serving as senior ministers. The Government would continue to support women 
in political life.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Constitution of Dominica guaranteed all individuals protection from 
discrimination based on race, place of origin, political opinion, colour, creed or sex and, 
also, guaranteed the right of freedom of association. The Government had never used fear 
or intimidation to prevent defenders of any cause from exercising their rights, and there was 
no law requiring individuals to state their sexual preference or conscientious position when 
associating. The relevant legislation only criminalized specific sexual acts, and not what </p>


<p>might be considered as physical manifestations or association, and nobody had been 
arrested or prosecuted for such acts. Nevertheless, the Government was not prepared to 
introduce any legislation to Parliament decriminalizing sexual relations between adults of 
the same sex. 
</p>
<p>23. In 2012, the Government of Dominica had supported the United Nations General 
Assembly resolution on extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions (resolution 67/168), 
in solidarity with those who continued to be punished without due process of law. 
Therefore, there was no need for the Government to take any follow-up measures pursuant 
to that resolution. 
</p>
<p>24. Since the establishment of the national HIV/AIDS Prevention Unit in the Ministry of 
Health in 2003, a number of programmes bad been introduced with a view to creating 
greater awareness, care, understanding and tolerance for persons affected by AIDS. 
Counselling, medication and other treatment were provided to all people living with AIDS, 
irrespective of their sexual orientation. The challenge of removing the stigma and the taboo 
associated with HIV/AIDS had been extremely difficult, but efforts to educate the public 
continued. 
</p>
<p>25. The Government of Dominica remained committed to protecting the fundamental 
rights and freedoms guaranteed to all irrespective of race, place of origin, political opinions, 
colour, creed or sex. It also aspired to provide education, health care, housing, employment 
and access to water and sanitation. Over the past decade, Dominica had made significant 
strides towards achieving those goals, although much remained to be done. 
</p>
<p>26. As a small island developing State, Dominica continued to struggle to ensure that its 
people were provided with a decent quality of life. However, its limited human and 
financial resources made it difficult for Dominica to meet its international human rights 
commitments. The ratification of treaties brought with it the burden of drafting reports, 
developing implementation plans and allocating resources to give domestic effect to those 
treaties. Therefore, the head of delegation called on OHCHR to provide support and to 
develop an assistance programme that would provide Dominica with technical support and 
training so that it could meet its current and future obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>27. During the interactive dialogue, 48 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>28. Malaysia welcomed the update on progress made by Dominica in the 
implementation of recommendations arising from the first review and its efforts to combat 
violence against women and children, despite the challenges it had faced in preparing its 
report. It recognized that financial constraints represented an obstacle to the advancement 
of human rights in Dominica. It encouraged the country to continue implementing 
programmes on HIV/AIDS and to continue its efforts to improve human rights. 
</p>
<p>29. Maldives commended the progress made by Dominica in promoting human rights 
since the previous review, including by extending a standing invitation to all special 
procedures of the Human Rights Council, ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities and announcing the establishment of a National Disability Council. 
Moreover, it acknowledged the attention paid by Dominica to the rights of the child. In its 
view, small States such as Dominica required financial and technical assistance in order to 
strengthen their national human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>30. Mexico recognized the efforts made by Dominica to take part in the review, which 
demonstrated its commitment. Mexico valued the de facto moratorium on the death penalty </p>


<p>observed by Dominica since 1986 but expressed concern that the death penalty still formed 
part of the national legal framework. It trusted that the review would help Dominica to 
overcome challenges, and remained available to share its experiences. 
</p>
<p>31. Montenegro appreciated the fact that Dominica had extended a standing invitation to 
all special procedures and acknowledged efforts to implement the National Policy and 
Action Plan for Gender Equity and Equality. It asked about the activities envisaged by 
Dominica to change or amend legislation in order to ensure that hazardous work was 
prohibited for all persons under 18 years of age. 
</p>
<p>32. Morocco noted the difficulties that prevented Dominica from submitting a written 
report for review. However, the commitment of Dominica to the UPR process was evident 
in its participation in the review. Delays in the submission of reports to other human rights 
mechanisms were a consequence of prevailing challenges. It noted that Dominica did not 
have a national human rights institution because of a lack of resources. Morocco 
congratulated Dominica on its efforts regarding the right to education.     
</p>
<p>33. The Netherlands commended the progress made by Dominica with regard to the 
advancement and promotion of women&#8217;s rights, gender mainstreaming and the overall 
empowerment of women, and expressed the hope that that the progress achieved would be 
sustained and would lead to equal rights for women. It expressed concern about the 
situation of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons in Dominica, mainly in 
connection with the unsafe environment for human rights defenders advocating equal rights 
for members of that group. 
</p>
<p>34. Nicaragua noted that the second review had posed a challenge for Dominica. 
However, although there was no national report, it was aware of the progress achieved by 
Dominica, in particular with regard to women and the rights to education and health. While 
aware that Dominica had a small economy and faced a number of social and economic 
challenges, Nicaragua urged it to continue making efforts to strengthen its national policies 
to guarantee human rights.  
</p>
<p>35. Paraguay welcomed the decision of Dominica to reform the legal framework to 
address domestic violence and physical ill-treatment of children. It encouraged Dominica to 
document those and other challenges in a report to the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women. Paraguay took note of the ratification by Dominica of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its plans to establish a National 
Disability Council, and acknowledged improvements in the health sector. 
</p>
<p>36. Portugal welcomed the fact that since the previous review, Dominica had extended a 
standing invitation to the special procedures. It further welcomed the review of the legal 
framework to combat domestic violence and physical child abuse, as well as the 
achievement of universal access to primary and secondary education free of charge. 
</p>
<p>37. Singapore noted that despite the challenges faced by Dominica as a small island 
developing State, progress had been made in the promotion and protection of human rights. 
It took positive note of achievements in improving public health, of the emphasis placed on 
the promotion of gender equality and of efforts to combat gender-based violence, in 
particular the legislative framework in place to protect women against violence. 
</p>
<p>38. Slovenia commended Dominica for its efforts to address domestic violence and 
physical abuse of children, and for positive gains regarding gender equality and women&#8217;s 
empowerment. It encouraged Dominica to continue fighting discrimination and prejudice 
against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. While noting that the death 
penalty had not been applied since 1986, it expressed concern that Dominica retained the 
death penalty. </p>


<p>39. Spain recognized efforts made by Dominica, including its extension of an open and 
standing invitation to the special procedures. It commended Dominica on the adoption of 
policies to protect women, but noted the continuing prevalence of violence against women. 
It expressed concern at cases of corporal punishment in prisons and detention centres, as 
well as in educational centres. Lastly, it noted that unemployment rates and basic social 
indicators indicated a gap between the Kalinago population and other citizens.  
</p>
<p>40. Cuba acknowledged efforts made by Dominica to promote and protect human rights, 
in particular by the adoption of national policies on gender equality and women&#8217;s 
empowerment, as well as improvements in the health sector, which were reflected in a 
decrease in the under-5 child mortality rate. It highlighted the broad national cultural policy 
of Dominica, improvements in the right to education, which was universal and free of 
charge, and efforts to protect the rights of persons living with HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>41. The State of Palestine commended Dominica for its efforts to enhance the situation 
of human rights despite constraints, and its adoption of legislation and policies supporting 
gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment. It also commended Dominica for efforts to 
integrate information and communication technologies into the education system.  
</p>
<p>42. Thailand noted that Dominica had become a party to a number of international 
human rights instruments and encouraged it to accede to other such instruments. It 
acknowledged the social and safety net programmes that had been introduced, and 
encouraged the Government to integrate all such programmes in order to maximize their 
potential impact. Thailand expressed appreciation for the efforts of Dominica to improve 
the rights of children, and its willingness to share experiences on the protection of human 
rights. It encouraged the international community to provide assistance and technical 
cooperation, upon request.  
</p>
<p>43. Trinidad and Tobago empathized with the challenges faced by Dominica in seeking 
to safeguard its ecological integrity while improving the living standards of its citizens 
within the framework of equitable and sustainable development. It noted the continuing 
steps being taken to maintain the autonomy and rights of the Kalinago people. 
</p>
<p>44. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed the progress 
achieved in the advancement of women&#8217;s rights, gender mainstreaming and women&#8217;s 
empowerment, as well as efforts to fight poverty and the ratification by Dominica of a 
number of conventions. It expressed concern that Dominica had undertaken to ratify other 
treaties but had not done so, perhaps owing to capacity constraints. It encouraged Dominica 
to establish a formal moratorium on executions with a view to the eventual abolition of the 
death penalty. 
</p>
<p>45. The United States of America said that despite efforts, domestic violence remained a 
serious problem, with support systems for survivors and resources for enforcement agencies 
being insufficient. A critical gap existed in the legal framework to keep children away from 
the worst forms of child labour. The United States expressed concern about the 
criminalization of consensual same-sex activity between adults and noted that lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender victims of violence and harassment often avoided reporting abuse. 
</p>
<p>46. Uruguay appreciated the efforts made by Dominica to participate in the review, 
which were a clear indication of its commitment to the UPR process. Uruguay highlighted 
progress made in the national agenda for the promotion and protection of human rights 
since the previous review, noting in particular the open invitation extended by Dominica to 
special procedures.  
</p>
<p>47. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela welcomed the efforts made by Dominica to 
implement the recommendations made during the first review, despite the challenges. It 
highlighted the ratification by Dominica of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with </p>


<p>Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto, as well as the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, supplementing the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. It acknowledged the 
achievements of Dominica in reducing unemployment, ensuring free and universal access 
to education and combating sexual abuse against children. 
</p>
<p>48. Algeria said that it understood why Dominica had not submitted a national report, 
and asked about the support that the international community and OHCHR could provide in 
order to enable it to fulfil its obligations, in particular with regard to the submission of 
reports. It welcomed the ratification by Dominica of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto, as well as its accession to the 
Trafficking in Persons Protocol. It expressed the view that Dominica could benefit from 
international capacity-building assistance. 
</p>
<p>49. Argentina congratulated Dominica for its ratification of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto, as well as the 
Trafficking in Persons Protocol. It encouraged Dominica to ratify other international human 
rights instruments to which it was not yet a party, and urged it to continue adopting 
measures to address domestic violence and physical ill-treatment of children. 
</p>
<p>50. Armenia noted that Dominica had not ratified a number of core international human 
rights instruments and emphasized the importance of ratifying the Convention on the 
Prevention and Punishment of Genocide. It commended the efforts expended by Dominica 
to realize the right to education and called for the introduction of human rights education in 
school and university curricula. It welcomed improvements to the right to health and also 
valued the efforts of Dominica to promote the rights of persons with disabilities and of 
women. 
</p>
<p>51. Australia remained concerned by the legal provisions criminalizing sexual relations 
between lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. It commended Dominica for its 
ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Trafficking 
in Persons Protocol. It welcomed the de facto moratorium on executions but remained 
concerned that the current legislation allowed for the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>52. The Bahamas expressed appreciation for the challenges facing Dominica in 
connection with financial and human resource constraints, climate change and natural 
disasters. Dominica had sustained a strong parliamentary democracy, promoting and 
protecting human rights within the context of respect for the rule of law. The Bahamas 
commended Dominica on its review of the legal framework, particularly with regard to 
combating domestic violence and physical abuse of children. It noted the multimedia 
awareness-raising campaign conducted to raise awareness of sexual abuse of children, and 
applauded the adoption of legislation supporting gender equality. The Bahamas was ready 
to support Dominica in the promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>53. Barbados commended Dominica for its efforts to strengthen its legal framework and 
to protect human rights, to review legislation relating to domestic violence and physical 
abuse of children, to reduce under-5 mortality rates, and to improve school enrolment rates. 
Dominica was committed to enhancing the social and economic rights of its citizens, but 
considerable resources were required in order for it to do so. Barbados called on the donor 
community to demonstrate greater sensitivity to the unique financing difficulties faced by 
small States. It recognized the challenges that Dominica faced in integrating its 
international obligations into national legislation. 
</p>
<p>54. Benin welcomed the progress made by Dominica in implementing recommendations 
from the first review. In particular, it noted the adoption by Dominica of laws and policies 
promoting equality and the empowerment of women, its creation of national committees to </p>


<p>monitor the rights of the child, and its ratification of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto.  
</p>
<p>55. The Plurinational State of Bolivia commended Dominica for its detailed presentation 
and highlighted the progress made since the previous review. It commended Dominica for 
its ratification of a number of important international human rights instruments, including 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>56. The head of delegation thanked States for their contributions and acknowledged that 
a national report would have responded to most of the concerns expressed. In particular, he 
recognized the contribution and support of members of the Caribbean Community 
(CARICOM), the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), and the 
Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS).  
</p><p>57. Dominica was a small island developing State that faced severe challenges brought 
about by the hostile global economy and other institutional pressures. The country no 
longer received preferential treatment for the agricultural sector and was struggling with 
development. Those were the harsh realities that faced small island developing States. 
Dominica was also vulnerable to natural disasters, and had to deal with damage caused by 
severe weather every year. However, it had provided support to its people in order to ensure 
them a better quality of life.  
</p>
<p>58. Although much had been achieved, much remained to be done in terms of 
development. Some communities in Dominica still did not have access to safe drinking 
water and it had not been possible to make the necessary investments to ensure that potable 
water was available, particularly to small and rural communities. However, with assistance 
from the European Union and other development partners such as Venezuela and Cuba, 
every community in Dominica would have access to potable water by 2015. 
</p>
<p>59. The country continued to struggle to provide opportunities for children. However, 
significant progress in that regard had been made with the assistance of partners such as 
Morocco and Mexico. 
</p>
<p>60. Significant work had been undertaken to improve the lives of the people in the Carib 
Territory, in particular with regard to education. Dominica had done everything possible to 
ensure that indigenous people received the kind of attention that could improve their lives. 
</p>
<p>61. The Government was paying particular attention to violence against women. 
Although much remained to be done, the Government had provided protection through the 
Protection against Domestic Violence Act, passed in 2001, and through the provision of 
services, despite resource constraints.  
</p>
<p>62. Child labour was another area in which everything possible should be done to ensure 
that children were not forced to work. Dominica would definitely pay attention to the need 
to review the laws in order to protect children from hazardous work. 
</p>
<p>63. Although the use of corporal punishment had decreased, several associations in 
Dominica continued to criticize the Government for its rigorous guidelines on that matter. 
The Government&#8217;s view was that the country should move away from the use of corporal 
punishment as far as possible, and it would continue to work towards that goal.  
</p>
<p>64. Dominica provided support to persons with disabilities, although much remained to 
be done. The provision of such support was a work in progress, and was costly.  
</p>
<p>65. At times, the efforts made by small island developing States were greeted with 
hostility. The trade sector was one of the country&#8217;s biggest concerns since it had ceased to 
receive preferential treatment, especially in the European market. Under such 
circumstances, it was not easy to achieve economic development. Likewise, since 2008 the 
global economic crisis had affected Dominica and resulted in severe financial constraints. </p>


<p>In view of the fact that most of the commitments under the UPR process required some 
financial investment, Dominica called on the international community to assist it in its 
endeavours. 
</p>
<p>66. Brazil said it was pleased to learn that Dominica had undertaken a review of its legal 
framework and administrative practices and policies with a view to strengthening action 
against domestic violence and physical abuse, particularly against women and children, as 
recommended during the previous review. In addition, it noted that a number of 
improvements had been made in the education sector. However, the right to life required 
greater attention and respect for sexual orientation required urgent attention.  
</p>
<p>67. Canada noted that in 2010, Dominica had agreed to establish greater support systems 
in the form of more secure housing for women seeking shelter from domestic abuse. It 
therefore asked the delegation to provide information on progress achieved so far in that 
regard. Canada welcomed the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, as well as the Trafficking in Persons Protocol. 
</p>
<p>68. Chile took note of the various programmes that had been implemented for the 
promotion and protection of human rights. It urged Dominica to continue with that process 
with a view to guaranteeing the full enjoyment of human rights, with the support of the 
international community and relevant technical assistance. 
</p>
<p>69. China was pleased with the efforts made by Dominica to eliminate poverty and 
noted its commitment to protecting the rights of vulnerable groups, such as women and 
children. Dominica had promoted gender equality and improved health and education; the 
infant mortality rate had declined, most of the population had access to safe drinking water, 
and the school enrolment rate had increased. It understood the challenges faced by 
Dominica as a small island State, and called on the international community to provide 
assistance in the areas of finance, technology and capacity-building. 
</p>
<p>70. Costa Rica regretted the absence of a national report from Dominica in view of the 
importance of such documents for the UPR process. However, it congratulated Dominica 
on measures taken to improve the situation of children, such as the awareness-raising 
campaign on sexual abuse of children, and on the review of the legal framework to 
strengthen action against domestic violence and ill-treatment of children. It recognized 
improvements in the areas of health and education, urged Dominica to prohibit corporal 
punishment and expressed the hope that it would abolish the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>71. Sri Lanka welcomed the efforts of Dominica to promote human rights despite the 
challenges that it faced, and took note of its commitment to reform its legal framework and 
administrative measures in order to combat domestic violence and physical abuse of 
children. It acknowledged the initiatives introduced to achieve gender equality and efforts 
to implement the national gender policy. It encouraged Dominica to facilitate further access 
to education for all by allocating adequate resources and reinforcing teacher training. 
</p>
<p>72. The Democratic Republic of the Congo noted that Dominica had undertaken a 
review of its legislative framework, had taken steps to strengthen the framework for 
combating domestic violence and child abuse, had ratified the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities, and had issued a standing invitation to special procedures. 
However, it noted that there had been delays in the submission of reports to treaty bodies. It 
asked Dominica to provide further information on measures adopted to promote the 
harmonious social integration of ethnic minorities. 
</p>
<p>73. Denmark commended Dominica for engaging with the UPR process by accepting a 
large number of recommendations at the first review. However, it noted that little progress 
had been reported in some areas. In particular, it noted the lack of progress in the fight 
against torture, observing that Dominica had not ratified the Convention against Torture </p>


<p>and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Denmark highlighted an 
initiative launched by several countries to help Governments overcome obstacles to 
ratifying that Convention. 
</p>
<p>74. Ecuador acknowledged the efforts made by Dominica to implement previous 
recommendations, in particular those promoting the right to health. It highlighted the 
common fund for basic needs that aimed to provide communities with resources in order to 
improve their access to basic services, to increase employment and to reduce poverty. It 
commended Dominica for its ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and offered to share best practices in that connection. 
</p>
<p>75. Ethiopia commended Dominica for measures taken to ensure access to education 
and welcomed its efforts to ensure primary health care.  
</p>
<p>76. France welcomed the ratification by Dominica of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and its issuance of a standing invitation to special procedures 
mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>77. Germany asked to know the reason why Dominica had not submitted a national 
report. It acknowledged the progress made by the country towards the full realization of the 
human rights of its citizens in the areas of action against domestic violence and physical 
abuse of children. It called for the abolition of corporal punishment and noted that lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons were exposed to prejudice and violence 
because consensual same-sex activity was criminalized. 
</p>
<p>78. Ghana welcomed the cooperation of Dominica with special procedures mandate 
holders and commended it for steps taken to implement some of the recommendations 
accepted during the first review, including the ratification of the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto. It expressed the hope that 
Dominica would accede to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime 
of Genocide. 
</p>
<p>79. Indonesia noted that Dominica had faced challenges in implementing a number of 
commitments made during the first review and observed that there was a need to take 
substantive action in order to implement them. Establishing a national human rights 
institution should be a matter of priority, and addressing the right to education was 
fundamental to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  
</p>
<p>80. Iraq said that it appreciated the fact that a human rights plan had been drafted, as 
well as the efforts made by Dominica to review its legislation, in particular that relating to 
domestic violence, child abuse and gender equality. It expressed support for the continued 
efforts of Dominica in that regard.  
</p>
<p>81. Ireland encouraged Dominica to continue to improve action against domestic 
violence and physical abuse of children and to promote gender equality and women&#8217;s 
empowerment, and commended it for issuing a standing invitation to special procedures 
mandate-holders. It urged Dominica to consider ratifying the Second Optional Protocol to 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death 
penalty, and to consider abolishing the death penalty. It expressed concern about the 
criminalization of consensual same-sex activity and of defamation, and expressed regret 
that recommendations made during the first cycle regarding the Sexual Offences Act had 
not enjoyed the support of Dominica.  
</p><p>82. Italy welcomed progress achieved in the promotion of human rights. It noted that 
Dominica was not a party to some core international treaties and asked whether it envisaged 
acceding to those instruments. It expressed appreciation for the long-standing moratorium 
on capital punishment and for the ongoing debate on the death penalty. </p>


<p>83. Jamaica stated that despite the absence of a national report, the commitment of 
Dominica to the UPR mechanism must be recognized. Capacity constraints and the 
resources challenges faced by small island developing States could prevent their timely and 
effective compliance with their reporting obligations. Jamaica strongly supported efforts to 
strengthen technical assistance and capacity-building, in particular from OHCHR, on how 
to meet reporting and implementation obligations. It welcomed measures taken by 
Dominica, such as the review of the national legal framework, and efforts to combat 
domestic violence and child abuse and to support gender equality and women&#8217;s 
empowerment. It was pleased that Dominica had acceded to the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>84. Kenya acknowledged that Dominica had upgraded its legal and administrative 
frameworks to reform laws, policies and practices, noting in particular its strengthening of 
the framework to combat domestic violence and physical abuse of children. It 
acknowledged the challenges that would require the attention of Dominica in the future. 
</p>
<p>85. Sierra Leone said that it understood the difficulties faced by a small island nation in 
the preparation of national reports but encouraged Dominica to submit its overdue reports 
to the relevant treaty bodies and to provide further information on progress achieved in the 
implementation of the UPR recommendations. It commended Dominica on conducting an 
extensive review of the legal framework and administrative measures with a view to 
reforming national laws, and urged it to implement an inclusive health plan, to combat 
gender-based violence and to harmonize a protection framework for stateless persons.  
</p>
<p>86. The head of delegation said that the extensive recommendations of all delegations 
concerning matters that would continue to be the focus of his country&#8217;s efforts had been 
noted. While much had been accomplished, much remained to be done. Dominica remained 
committed to the UPR process and to fulfilling its obligations. 
</p>
<p>87. With respect to the ratification of conventions, the constraints encountered by 
Dominica in its efforts to fulfil its obligations under the conventions it had already ratified 
had caused it to reflect deeply before undertaking further such obligations. However, the 
assistance of OHCHR in that regard was welcome. Dominica would like to have a 
meaningful dialogue on the issue of capacity to see how to fulfil its current obligations and 
would provide adequate information for the conventions that it had ratified.  
</p>
<p>88. The Government was elected to represent the people, and it was the people who 
were required to determine how to transform society. The transformation was a process that 
would take time, effort and education, in addition to public awareness. It was more 
beneficial to have engagement from the ground up and to include the people in the process, 
as that would ensure that some of the values that the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review wished to transfer were widely accepted. Although several countries had 
taken centuries to rid themselves of some of the issues that the Working Group was asking 
Dominica to tackle, his country remained open to dialogue and invited United Nations 
agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations and other 
States to engage with it.  
</p>
<p>89. All children from Dominica had access to primary and secondary education. More 
specifically, while the Government had the will to ensure education for children with 
disabilities, the limited resources available represented a real challenge. It was hoped that 
those countries that had raised concerns in connection with that issue would engage with 
Dominica bilaterally so that they could work towards achieving that goal. 
</p>
<p>90. The Working Group might consider revisiting the concern about the unsafe 
environment of human rights defenders, because there was no form of violence against 
them in Dominica, nor was there any environment of fear and intimidation for any group. </p>


<p>91. The efforts made by NGOs on the ground, in particular to end violence against 
women, should be acknowledged. With strong advocacy from the Dominica National 
Council of Women and other groups, Dominica had been able to draft the Protection 
against Domestic Violence Act, which protected the rights of women. 
</p>
<p>92. Dominica had to continue to make efforts to improve its system of governance and 
to provide the people with opportunities and equal rights. Small island developing States 
faced tremendous challenges. In order to overcome those challenges, it was important to 
cooperate to ensure that interventions were made in the areas where they were needed. In 
that spirit, Dominica welcomed all States, United Nations agencies and NGOs that wished 
to work closely with its Government and people. 
</p>
