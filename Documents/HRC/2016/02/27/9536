<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health (&#8220;right to the highest attainable standard of 
health&#8221; or &#8220;right to health&#8221;) visited Sweden from 10 to 18 January 2006.  The key objectives of 
the mission were to understand how the Government of Sweden endeavours to implement the 
right to the highest attainable standard of health at the national and international levels. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur held meetings with government representatives, civil society 
organizations and health professionals in Stockholm, Jokkmokk and Malm&#246;. 
</p>
<p> The standard of living, health status and quality of health care in Sweden are among the 
best in the world.  As well as its commitment to guaranteeing good health at the national level, 
the Government makes important contributions through its foreign policies to realizing the right 
to health and the health-related Millennium Development Goals in developing countries. 
</p>
<p> Following the Introduction, section II of this report signals Sweden&#8217;s obligations 
regarding the right to health under international human rights law.  Section III considers how 
these international obligations are given effect at the national level through domestic legal, 
policy and institutional frameworks.  While Sweden has ratified many international treaties 
recognizing the right to health, this human right is less firmly entrenched in Sweden&#8217;s 
domestic laws and policies.  A major challenge is to integrate the right to health into domestic 
policymaking processes. 
</p>
<p> Section IV gives attention to some key domestic issues with a bearing on the right 
to health, including: access to appropriate health care; mental health; the Sami; an integrated 
harm-reduction policy for drug users; human rights education for health professionals; 
asylum-seekers and undocumented foreign nationals; and foreign nationals with life-threatening 
conditions. 
</p>
<p> Section V focuses on Sweden&#8217;s foreign policies and their relationship to the right to 
health in developing countries.  To its credit, Sweden has committed to mainstreaming human 
rights in its foreign policies.  The Special Rapporteur begins to consider the degree to which 
human rights have been brought to bear upon all aspects of Sweden&#8217;s foreign policy, and to what 
degree they are taken into account in practice. 
</p>
<p> Section VI encourages the introduction of a human rights-based approach to health 
indicators, the disaggregation of health data on various grounds of discrimination, and the 
integration of the right to health into impact assessments. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur visited Sweden from 10 
to 18 January 2006.  The purpose of the mission was to assess, in a spirit of cooperation and 
dialogue, how Sweden seeks to realize the right to the highest attainable standard of health at the 
domestic and international levels. 
</p>
<p>2. The key themes of the mission were the impact of poverty and discrimination, including 
inequalities, on the enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of health in Sweden.  
The Special Rapporteur also addressed Sweden&#8217;s foreign policies, in particular its international 
development assistance, and their impact on the right to the highest attainable standard of health 
in developing countries.  He considered the implementation of the right to health with a view to 
assisting the Government - and other relevant actors - in their efforts to address the challenges 
and obstacles to its realization. 
</p>
<p>3. The agenda for the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit was arranged in close cooperation with the 
Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Throughout the 
mission, all levels of Government - central, regional and local - were constructive and open.  The 
Special Rapporteur is grateful for the valuable cooperation and assistance he received before, 
during and after the mission. 
</p>
<p>4. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur met with representatives from the 
Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, including the Minister for Health, Ms. Ylva Johansson; 
representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including the Minister for International 
Development, Ms. Karin Jamtin, and the Minister for Migration and Asylum Policies, 
Ms. Barbro Holmberg; and representatives of the Ministry of Justice and the Swedish 
International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida).  He further met representatives of the 
Swedish National Institute for Public Health and the National Board of Health and Social 
Welfare.  The Special Rapporteur held discussions with the Ombudsman against ethnic 
discrimination, Ms. Katri Linna, and the Ombudsman on disability, Mr. Lars L&#246;&#246;w. 
</p>
<p>5. In Malm&#246;, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with representatives of the University 
Hospital, local government and civil society, as well as with health professionals.  In Jokkmokk, 
he met the President of the Sami Parliament in Sweden, Mr. Lars-Anders Baer, representatives of 
the Norwegian Sami Parliament and representatives of local authorities and civil society. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to meet with representatives of numerous 
civil society organizations, including non-governmental organizations and national medical 
associations, working on issues related to the right to health in Sweden.  He also met with 
organizations working on issues related to Sweden&#8217;s international development and trade 
policies. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur expresses his sincere thanks to all those whom he met for their 
excellent cooperation. </p>

</p>
<p><b>An overview of health status in Sweden and introduction to the issues covered by  
this report 
</b></p>
<p>8. Swedes tend to enjoy a standard of living, life expectancy and health status that is among 
the best in the world.  In 2003, life expectancy was 82.4 years for women and 77.9 years for 
men.<b>1</b>  Sweden&#8217;s health system attracts considerable resources and is recognized as one the 
nation&#8217;s vital social institutions.  To its credit, the Government also attaches a high priority to 
human rights, such as the right to the highest attainable standard of health, in its international 
policies. 
</p>
<p>9. Moreover, there have been significant improvements in many health outcomes in 
Sweden.  Between 1970 and 2002, infant mortality fell from 11 to 3 deaths per 1,000 live births.  
Deaths on account of traffic accidents, work-related deaths and injuries, and the number of daily 
smokers have also fallen significantly in recent years.  Recently, cardiovascular diseases have 
also become less prevalent.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>10. This is the impressive general context within which this report has to be understood.  The 
following paragraphs also signal some of the specific, commendable health policies and practices 
that are a credit to the Government of Sweden. 
</p>
<p>11. However, there is no room for complacency.  There are some worrying health trends in 
Sweden.  Rates of mental health problems, for example, have increased significantly in recent 
years, as has obesity.  Since the 1990s, reported cases of chlamydia have significantly 
increased, and there have been increasing rates of infection of other sexually transmitted 
infections - particularly among youth - including gonorrhoea and syphilis.  Cases of HIV are also 
increasing.<b>3</b>  Examined through the prism of the right to health, some health policies are a cause 
for genuine concern. 
</p>
<p>12. This report focuses on a selection of key national and international issues arising from the 
right to the highest attainable standard of health, especially those associated with poverty and 
discrimination.  At the national level, the selected issues include:  key legislative, policy and 
institutional frameworks; the challenge of mainstreaming the right to health across all 
health-related policies; access to health care, including for marginalized groups; the right to 
health of Sami, asylum-seekers and undocumented foreign nationals; mental health; human 
rights education for health professionals; and the need for an integrated and comprehensive 
harm-reduction policy for intravenous drug users. 
</p>
<p>

</b>  However, cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality, accounting for nearly 
</p>
<p>half the deaths in 2001.  Cancer is the second leading cause of death.

</p>
<p>13. The report also considers how Sweden endeavours to give effect, at the international 
level, to the right to the highest attainable standard of health.  Thus, it considers the 
mainstreaming of the right to health across Sweden&#8217;s international policies and how the right is 
operationalized in Swedish international development cooperation. 
</p>
<p>14. Importantly, while remaining within the 10,700-word limit for reports, it is impossible to 
give attention to all the important national and international issues arising from Sweden&#8217;s right to 
health obligations, such as the special issues concerning the ageing population, alcohol abuse, 
obesity, domestic violence,<b>4</b> sick leave, and health care for the prison population. 
</p>
<p><b>II.</b> <b>INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS 
FOR THE RIGHT TO HEALTH 
</b></p>
<p>15. Sweden has ratified a range of international human right treaties recognizing the right to 
health and other health-related rights, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR), the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms Discrimination Against Women, and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child.  It has also ratified regional human rights treaties such 
as the Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (European Convention on 
Human Rights), the revised European Social Charter and the European Convention on Social and 
Medical Assistance. 
</p>
<p>16. Further, Sweden has ratified the second Additional Protocol to the European Social 
Charter Providing for a System of Collective Complaints (1995).  While the Government 
recognizes the right of national and international employers and trade unions, and other 
international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), to make collective complaints under this 
protocol, it has not yet recognized the right of other NGOs within Sweden to do so.<b>5</b>  <b>The 
Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to recognize the competence of NGOs 
within Sweden other than trade unions and employers&#8217; organizations to make such 
complaints.  This will help enhance accountability for the right to health in Sweden.  He 
also encourages the Government to support the drafting of an optional protocol to ICESCR 
which will enhance accountability for this human right both in Sweden and in other 
jurisdictions.</b> 
17. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that Sweden is examining the possibility 
of ratifying the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169).  <b>He encourages 
the Government to ratify this Convention as soon as possible.  The Special Rapporteur also 
</b></p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  The Special Rapporteur notes that the Special Rapporteur on violence against women also 
</p>
<p>undertook a mission to Sweden in 2006.  The Special Rapporteur on the right to health has sent 
his findings on the right to health implications of violence against women in Sweden to the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women for her consideration. 
<b>5
</b>  Additional Protocol to the European Social Charter Providing for a System of Collective 
</p>
<p>Complaints (1995), art. 2. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/28/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p><b>encourages the Government to consider ratifying the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.</b> 
</p>
<p>18. The ratification of international and regional human rights treaties gives rise to 
obligations which are binding under international law.  However, an international treaty 
obligation has the force of law in Sweden only when it is incorporated into national law.  At 
present, besides Regulations which are issued by EU institutions and immediately applicable in 
Sweden, only the European Convention on Human Rights has been incorporated into Swedish 
law.  <b>With a view to improving protection of the right to health in Sweden, the Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government to incorporate international and regional treaties 
protecting the right to health into domestic law.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>III. DOMESTIC LEGAL, POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL 
FRAMEWORKS FOR THE REALIZATION OF THE 
RIGHT TO HEALTH AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Domestic legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>19. Chapter II of the Instrument of Government (<i>Regeringsformen</i>), which forms part of 
Sweden&#8217;s Constitution, is entitled Fundamental Rights and Freedoms.  Regrettably, it does not 
enshrine the right to health.  However, chapter I of the Instrument, &#8220;Principles for Public Life&#8221;, 
recognizes that &#8220;The personal, economic and cultural welfare of the private person shall be 
fundamental aims of public activity.  In particular, it shall be incumbent upon the public 
institutions to secure the right to health, employment, housing and education, and to promote 
social care and social security.&#8221;<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>20. A number of domestic laws set out health-care related responsibilities of various 
authorities.  Of central relevance is the Health and Medical Services Act, which establishes that 
the goals of health and medical services are to assure the entire population good health on equal 
terms, and that care should be prioritized according to need.<b>7</b>  The Act stipulates that county 
councils have responsibility for providing health care, health promotion and disease prevention.<b>8</b>  
The Act also establishes that municipalities have health-related responsibilities for particular 
groups, for example they have responsibilities for providing habilitation, rehabilitation and 
assistive devices for persons with disabilities, care for the elderly, childcare, and support for 
persons in sheltered accommodation.  <b>The Special Rapporteur was concerned about reports 
of unsatisfactory coordination between the counties and municipalities with respect to 
health care and related support services.  He urges central, county and municipal 
authorities to take steps to improve coordination, with a view to the better protection of the 
right to health and implementation of the goals of the Health and Medical Services Act.</b> 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  Sects. 3 and 4. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/28/Add.2 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>21. Many other laws in Sweden have relevance to the realization of the right to health.  To 
take just one example, the Prohibition of Discrimination Act (SFS 2003:307) states that 
discrimination due to ethnic origin, religion or other beliefs is forbidden in connection with 
health and medical care. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Public health policy in Sweden 
</b></p>
<p>22. The main goal of Sweden&#8217;s public health policy is to achieve good social conditions with 
a view to ensuring good health on equal terms for the entire population.  The Public Health 
Objectives Bill<b>9</b> sets out 11 objectives for good public health, including: economic and social 
security; a better health and working life; healthy, safe environments and products; healthy 
eating; reduced tobacco consumption; secure and safe sexuality and reproductive health; and 
effective prevention of the spread of diseases.  These objectives are among the key determinants 
of the right to the highest attainable standard of health.  During his mission, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed on several occasions that the Government did not devote adequate 
resources to public health policies and programmes.  <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
Government&#8217;s enhanced commitment to the realization of the determinants of the right to 
health, and encourages it to devote more resources for the achievement of these vital 
objectives.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C. The need to strengthen understanding of 
the right to health at the national level 
</b></p>
<p>23. During his mission, it became apparent to the Special Rapporteur that, at the domestic 
level, there is a weak understanding of the right to the highest attainable standard of health.  
Indeed, even the existence of the right to health appeared to be unknown in some quarters where 
the Special Rapporteur might reasonably have expected otherwise.  For the most part, explicit 
reference to the right to health remains absent from Sweden&#8217;s domestic health policies.  The 
Special Rapporteur was not referred to a single legal case that relied upon the right to health.  All 
of this is surprising because, as already observed, Sweden has chosen to ratify a range of 
international treaties that impose upon all relevant State bodies responsibilities in relation to the 
right to health.  While Swedish civil society organizations are doing invaluable work on health, 
the right to health rarely enjoys a prominent place in their activities, with a few notable 
exceptions. 
</p>
<p>24. What makes this unfamiliarity with the right to health at the national level especially 
puzzling is that Sweden has a commendable policy of actively mainstreaming human rights, 
including the right to health, into its international policies.  To its credit, Sweden also encourages 
developing countries to integrate human rights into their national policies.  Yet its explicit 
integration of the right to health into its own national policies appears to be at a rudimentary 
level.  Some might be driven to the conclusion that, at the domestic level, Sweden does not 
practise what it preaches. 
</p>
<p>

</b>  2002/03:25. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/28/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>25. Human rights-related principles, such as equity and access, exert a strong and beneficial 
influence on Sweden&#8217;s domestic health laws and policies.  This, however, makes the domestic 
unfamiliarity with the right to the highest attainable standard of health even more curious.  The 
integration of the right to health into Swedish health policy would not signal a radical new policy 
departure.  On the contrary, it would reinforce and strengthen much that is already being done.  
Of course, no method of analysis - whether based on equity, economics, utilitarianism, human 
rights or anything else - provides neat solutions to complex policy dilemmas.  While a right to 
health approach does not offer neat solutions, it has a constructive contribution to make to health 
policymaking. 
</p>
<p>26. A policy that is animated by the right to health is likely to be equitable, inclusive, 
non-discriminatory, participatory, evidence-based, sustainable and robust.  Thus, a failure to 
integrate, explicitly and consistently, the right to health, and other human rights, into Swedish 
health policymaking, represents a missed opportunity of significant dimensions, as well as being 
inconsistent with Sweden&#8217;s international obligations.  <b>Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur 
strongly recommends that the Government take measures to integrate the right to health, 
and other human rights, into all domestic health-related policymaking processes.10</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  A national human rights plan of action 
</b></p>
<p>27. The World Conference on Human Rights (1993) recommended that States draw up 
national human rights action plans with a view to identifying how to better promote and protect 
human rights.  Properly resourced, such plans can serve many useful purposes.  Not least, they 
can promote the integration of human rights, including the right to health, in all relevant 
policymaking processes. 
</p>
<p>28. In 2002, Sweden adopted its first national human rights action plan (2002-2004).<b>11</b>  The 
purposes of the plan included promoting coordination on, and raising awareness about, human 
rights.  Regrettably, this first plan included neither a focus on the right to health, nor other 
economic, social and cultural rights.   
</p>
<p>29. In March 2006 a new national human rights action plan (2006-2009) was presented to the 
Riksdag.<b>12</b>  This second plan represents a very considerable improvement on its predecessor as it 
includes a chapter on economic, social and cultural rights, as well as a section on the right to the 
highest attainable standard of health.  The right to health section has a welcome focus on

</b>  For the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comment on Sweden&#8217;s policy coherence and human rights

<p>mainstreaming at the international level, see paras. 92-115.  He has also addressed these issues in 
several of his reports, e.g. the report of the Special Rapporteur on his mission to the World Trade 
Organization (2004) (E/CN.4/2004/49/Add.1), especially from paragraph 9.

</p>
<p>discrimination, inequalities and health.  The plan proposes governmental measures, in the health 
context, to combat discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, religion or other belief, sexual 
orientation, and disability.<b>13</b> </p>
<p>30. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Sweden&#8217;s second national human rights 
action plan lead to human rights training, including on the right to health, for staff at the 
Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, as well as other national, county and municipal 
bodies dealing with health-related matters.14  Such training is a precondition for the 
mainstreaming of human rights, including the right to health, in all relevant policymaking 
processes.  If the plan is to be effective, it is imperative that it enjoy high-level political 
leadership and be adequately staffed and resourced.</b> </p>
<p><b>2.  A national human rights institution 
</b></p>
<p>31. Sweden is rightly famous for, and proud of, the ombudsman institution.  It has a number 
of ombudsmen undertaking very important work on various aspects of human rights, including 
the Ombudsman on disability and the Ombudsman against ethnic discrimination<i>.  </i>Although these 
institutions are carrying out indispensable work, their responsibilities do not extend to all aspects 
of all human rights.  The right to the highest attainable standard of health, for example, is not 
fully encompassed within their various mandates. 
</p>
<p>32. Many States, including some in Scandinavia, have already established national human 
rights institutions that promote and protect the whole spectrum of civil, political, economic, 
social and cultural rights, and not only those human rights elements presently covered by 
Sweden&#8217;s ombudsmen. 
</p>
<p>33. Properly resourced, a Swedish national human rights institution could deepen the 
domestic understanding of the right to health among policymakers, the judiciary, health 
professionals, civil society and the population at large.  Like Sweden&#8217;s second human rights 
action plan, a national human rights institution could help to mainstream human rights, including 
the right to health, in all relevant policymaking processes.  Given appropriate powers, it could 
also provide a way of enhancing the accountability of the State, and others, in relation to their 
right to health responsibilities.  <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that steps be 
taken urgently to establish a Swedish national human rights institution, consistent with the 
Paris Principles (1991), in a manner that does not jeopardize the vital work of Sweden&#8217;s 
existing ombudsmen.  Such an initiative will help to ensure that Sweden remains abreast of 
contemporary developments in the field of national and international human rights.</b>

<p><b>IV. THE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT TO HEALTH  
AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL:  SOME ISSUES OF  
PARTICULAR CONCERN 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Is appropriate health care accessible to all? 
</b></p>
<p>34. The right to health includes an entitlement to health-care goods, services and facilities 
which are available in adequate supply within a State; accessible geographically, financially and 
on the basis of non-discrimination; culturally acceptable, including to minorities, indigenous 
populations and women; and of good quality.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>35. To the credit of the Government, health care is generally available and of a high quality 
in Sweden.  Even so, particular services related to health, such as harm-reduction programmes, 
are not available in adequate numbers across the jurisdiction (see paragraphs 60-62). 
</p><p>36. A high-cost protection scheme means that patients pay a maximum of SKr 900 over 
a 12-month period for outpatient care.  However, costs have adversely affected the financial 
accessibility of health care for some population groups.  Under the Dental Care Act (1999), for 
example, patients bear some of the costs for many dental procedures.  The cost of dental care has 
risen significantly since 1999.  Although there are exemptions for children and youth up to 
19 years of age and for persons over 65 years of age, and despite the maximum payment of 
SKr 900 over a one-year period, the Special Rapporteur was informed that fees have adversely 
affected the take-up of dental services, especially for people living in poverty. 
</p>
<p>37. In contrast to Swedish residents and citizens, undocumented foreign nationals have to pay 
full fees for health care, including for emergency procedures (see paragraphs 67-75).  The costs 
of such services are unaffordable for many undocumented foreign nationals. 
</p>
<p>38. In addition to problems of financial accessibility, some services are inaccessible to 
vulnerable populations for other reasons.  For example, the Special Rapporteur was informed 
that homeless persons have difficulty in accessing mental health-care services because they lack 
a permanent address. 
</p>
<p>39. In terms of acceptability, the Special Rapporteur was concerned that health care was not 
entirely sensitive to the culture of some groups, such as the Sami (see paragraphs 51-59). 
</p>
<p>40. Under ICESCR and other treaties, it is incumbent on the Government to guarantee the 
availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of health-care facilities, goods and services.  
The Special Rapporteur commends the Government on its overall performance.  However, he is 
concerned at the problems that a range of marginalized communities face in accessing 
health-care services on account of discrimination, costs of services, or because services do not 
respond adequately to cultural considerations.  These inequities are prima facie incompatible 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>with fundamental right to health principles, including equality and non-discrimination.  They 
would also appear to be inconsistent with the guiding objective of the Swedish Health and 
Medical Services Act to guarantee the entire population good health on equal terms. 
</p>
<p>41. The Ombudsmen on disability, ethnic discrimination and sexual orientation are currently 
undertaking a study on the impact of discrimination on health.  The Swedish National Institute of 
Public Health (SNIPH:  Folkh&#228;lsoinstitut) is also charged with undertaking surveys on 
discrimination and health.  Sweden&#8217;s national human rights action plan (2006-2009) proposes 
governmental measures to combat discrimination on grounds of gender, ethnicity, religion or 
other belief, sexual orientation and disability, and its impact on access to, and quality of, health 
care.  <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes these studies, surveys and proposals.  He 
recommends that the Government take measures to combat inequalities in health status 
and access to care.  These measures should focus not only on discrimination, but also on 
other closely-related obstacles, such as the costs of care which render health care 
inaccessible for some population groups.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Mental health 
</b></p>
<p>42. Mental health is deteriorating in Sweden.<b>16</b>  Sleeping disorders, depression, anxiety and 
other types of nervous problems are increasing, and sales of anti-depressant drugs increased 
fivefold between 1992 and 2003.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur was informed of a range of problems regarding access to, and 
coordination within, mental health care and related support services.  Unless the situation is 
urgent, waiting times for mental health care are lengthy.  The number of psychiatric hospital 
beds decreased from 14,533 in 1990 to 4,606 in 2003:<b>18</b>  the current number of beds is reportedly 
not commensurate with need.  There is also inadequate coordination between services provided 
by counties (e.g. psychiatric services, which are integrated within the health-care system) and 
related services provided by municipalities (e.g. counselling and support services to persons with 
psychosocial disabilities, persons in sheltered accommodation and support for the elderly).  
Crucially, in the last decade there has been a decrease in the percentage of the overall health 
budget spent on mental health care.<b>19 
</b></p>
<p>44. There is a high incidence of psychosocial disabilities among specific population groups, 
including homeless persons.<b>20</b>  Up to a quarter of refugees and asylum-seekers are affected by

</p>
<p>post-traumatic stress disorder.<b>21</b>  Refugees, asylum-seekers and homeless persons all reportedly 
have difficulty accessing mental health care.  Among children and young people, suicide, 
bulimia and anorexia are increasing.  However, there are few mental health programmes focused 
on children and young persons.  Discrimination and stigma have reportedly created a high 
incidence of psychosocial disabilities among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons.  The 
Special Rapporteur was informed that psychosocial disabilities are the leading cause of ill-health 
among women in Sweden:  violence and discrimination against women have contributed to this 
situation. 
</p>
<p>45. Recently, the Government has commendably made mental health policies and 
programmes a higher priority.  In 1995, the Government adopted a mental health reform which 
had the objective of improving the quality of life of users of mental health care.  The Public 
Health Objectives Bill<b>22</b> sets out several objectives connected to preventing psychosocial 
disabilities, including creating a healthier working life, and secure and favourable conditions 
during childhood.  The Special Rapporteur welcomes these commitments. 
</p>
<p>46. Following the murder in 2003 of the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Anna Lindh, by a 
man with a psychosocial disability, the Government appointed a National Coordinator for 
Psychiatry, with the objective of improving the quality of care for people with psychosocial 
disabilities.  In 2006, the Coordinator released recommendations for two new laws to 
complement the Compulsory and Forensic Mental Care Acts.<b>23</b>  The proposals include a 
provision whereby, instead of the contemporary law and practice of providing compulsory care 
in institutions, some individuals who have serious disabilities should be able to live in the 
community, providing they are subject to, and comply with, compulsory treatment orders.  While 
the Special Rapporteur supports the proposed extension of community-based care, he is 
concerned that the proposals do not give adequate weight to the participation of persons with 
psychosocial disabilities in decisions about their treatment and medication.  Participation in 
decisions about treatment is an important feature of the right to health. 
</p>
<p>47. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to ensure the full realization of the 
rights of persons with psychosocial disabilities, as expressed in international and regional 
human rights treaties, and the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for 
Persons with Disabilities.</b> 
</p>
<p>48. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the focus in the Public Health Objectives Bill on 
addressing the causes of psychosocial disabilities among the population, and urges the 
Government to ensure adequate funding for these measures.  The Special Rapporteur 
urges the Government to ensure that it takes measures to address causes of psychosocial

<p><b>disabilities among vulnerable and marginalized groups, including children,</b>24<b> adolescents, 
homeless persons, women, asylum-seekers, and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
persons.</b> 
</p>
<p>49. <b>He urges the Government to ensure that mental health care, including psychiatric 
care and other therapies, is made more accessible for marginalized groups.  He also 
suggests that central Government, counties and municipalities should devote more 
attention to ensuring coordination between services, and the provision of more services and 
programmes for children and adolescents.</b> 
</p>
<p>50. <b>The Special Rapporteur supports the provision of mental health care in 
deinstitutionalized, community-based settings.  However, he recommends that the 
Government also ensure that the number of available psychiatric hospital beds is sustained 
at a level commensurate with need.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The Sami 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Sami, the indigenous people of northern Scandinavia, live in the polar region 
extending from Norway, Sweden and Finland to the Kola Peninsula in the Russian Federation.  
The population is estimated at 70,000-100,000, of which 17,000-20,000 live in Sweden.<b>25</b>  
About 15 per cent of Swedish Sami are involved in the traditional economy, which includes 
reindeer herding and fishing. 
</p>
<p>52. Like the Swedish population as a whole, the Sami tend to enjoy a standard of living, life 
expectancy and health status that are among the best in the world.  However, they face notable 
health problems, some of which are common to the entire Swedish population and some of 
which are distinctive:  psychosocial disabilities, alcohol and substance abuse, violence, and 
occupational injuries arising from reindeer herding. 
</p><p>53. As the indigenous people of Sweden, the Sami enjoy a special status in both national and 
international human rights law.  To its credit, Sweden has taken a number of steps to turn this 
special status into meaningful measures.  In 1977, the Swedish Parliament recognized the 
indigenous status of the Sami.  In 1993, the Government established the Sami Parliament.  
In 2000, the Sami Language Act gave the Sami the right to use their own language in legal and 
administrative proceedings.  The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for adopting 
these important measures that are reflective of the Sami&#8217;s special status. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>24
</b>  In 2005, the Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that the Government of 
</p>
<p>Sweden should &#8220;strengthen mental health programmes for children, both preventative and 
interventional&#8221; (CRC/C/15/Add.248, para. 32 (e)).  The Special Rapporteur endorses this 
recommendation. 
<b>25
</b></p>
<p>  <i>The Sami, an Indigenous People in Sweden</i>, Sami Parliament and Ministry of Agriculture, 
Food and Consumer Affairs, 2005. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/28/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>54. In this context, the Special Rapporteur is especially interested in two questions.  One, has 
the Government carefully and systematically considered the Sami&#8217;s special status in the context 
of health?  Two, if so, has this consideration translated into the identification and implementation 
of meaningful, practical measures relating to health?  Here, the focus is on the second of these 
questions. 
</p>
<p>55. Given the special status of the Sami, the Special Rapporteur was surprised to find that 
Sweden does not have a Sami health research centre.  This omission tends to explain what he 
was told by some while on mission:  there is a shortage of research and knowledge focusing on 
the health of the Swedish Sami.  As it was put in 2004:  &#8220;Over the last decades, only a few 
studies have been published addressing health and disease in the Swedish Sami population.&#8221;<b>26</b>  
<b>Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government support the 
establishment of a Sami health research centre, along the lines of the Centre for Sami 
Health Research based at the University of Troms&#248;, Norway.</b> 
</p>
<p>56. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur was also informed that there are no 
operational units - at the national, county or municipal levels of government - focusing on the 
promotion of Sami health.  For example, he was advised that no county councils, not even in 
Norrbotten, which has the highest density (nearly 50 per cent of the Sami population in the 
country), have a discrete unit to ensure that Sami health issues are given the attention they 
deserve.  <b>Given the special status of the Sami, he also finds this omission surprising, and he 
recommends that it be subject to urgent review.  For example, presently the Ministry of 
Agriculture has executive responsibility for all issues relating to the Sami.  The Special 
Rapporteur suggests that the Government consider establishing a body within the Ministry 
of Health with national responsibility for oversight of Sami health.</b> 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to hear that the Sami Parliament has held 
discussions on a Sami dimension to Swedish health policy.  However, he was surprised to learn 
that Sweden lacks a national health policy for the Sami.  Also, Sweden lacks an occupational 
health policy designed for the distinctive health hazards of reindeer herders.  Moreover, he was 
informed that some Sami reindeer herders have sometimes met with a lack of understanding in 
health-care facilities in relation to their occupational injuries.  Whether or not such complaints 
are systemic or exceptional, Sweden is vulnerable to criticism in the absence of an occupational 
health policy catering for the particular hazards of reindeer herders.  Further, the Sami language 
is not used in the health-care context.  Of course, it would be absurd to suggest that all health 
services throughout Sweden should be available in Sami.  Nobody is making such a suggestion.  
However, Sami representatives informed the Special Rapporteur that they wish, so far as 
practical, to develop capacity for the delivery of health care and health information in the Sami 
language.  Such an aspiration would appear to be entirely reasonable, as well as consistent with 
the special status of the Sami.

</p>
<p>58. <b>If the Sami Parliament confirms that it would welcome a Sami national health 
policy, the Special Rapporteur urges the development and adoption of such an 
evidence-based policy, by way of an inclusive, participatory process that is respectful of 
Sami custom and practice.27  Serious consideration should also be given to the adoption of 
an occupational health policy designed to respond to the distinctive hazards confronting 
reindeer herders.  The Government should develop an action plan to enhance capacity for 
the delivery of health care and information in the Sami language.  Health professionals 
should be provided with training in Sami culture.</b> 
</p>
<p>59. <b>The Special Rapporteur now returns to the second question posed in paragraph 54.  
He regrets that he found little, if any, evidence that Sweden has translated the special status 
of the Sami into meaningful, practical measures in the health context.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D. Needle exchange for intravenous drug users:  the need for an integrated, 
comprehensive harm-reduction policy 
</b></p>
<p>60. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to visit Malm&#246;, where he 
met with individuals involved in an important harm-reduction programme for intravenous drug 
users.  This project provides intravenous drug users with comprehensive and integrated treatment 
and counselling, and with clean needles and syringes.  A midwife engaged in the project also 
dispenses contraception and offers contraceptive advice and pregnancy counselling, including 
with respect to prevention of vertical transmission of hepatitis and HIV.  Not only has this 
project proven to be highly effective in terms of public health objectives (i.e. it prevents the 
spread of disease), but it also enhances the realization of the right to health, including sexual and 
reproductive health, for intravenous drug users. 
</p>
<p>61. These results are in line with the worldwide experience that harm-reduction programmes, 
including needle exchange programmes and associated health care, promote and protect the 
health of drug users and reduce transmission of communicable diseases such as hepatitis B and C 
and HIV, including vertical transmission to newborn children from pregnant intravenous drug 
users or their partners.  These programmes are highly cost-effective.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>62. Harm-reduction programmes are endorsed by the World Health Organization,<b>29</b> the 
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Joint United Nations Programme on 
HIV/AIDS.  The Special Rapporteur was very surprised to learn that the Malm&#246; project is one of 
only a very small number of its kind in Sweden.  He is encouraged that, in 2006, a reform was 
adopted allowing health and social services across the country to introduce needle exchange

<p>programmes coupled with treatment and counselling programmes.  However, such an important 
human rights issue cannot be left to the discretion of local government.  <b>The Special 
Rapporteur emphasizes that the Government has a responsibility to ensure the 
implementation, throughout Sweden and as a matter of priority, of a comprehensive 
harm-reduction policy, including counselling, advice on sexual and reproductive health, 
and clean needles and syringes.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Human rights education for health professionals 
</b></p>
<p>63. Health professionals are often witness to the effects of torture and violence, substandard 
living and work environments, and gender-, ethnicity- and disability-based discrimination.  They 
can play a key role in monitoring, documenting and achieving redress for human rights abuses.   
</p>
<p>64. The practice of health professionals has a bearing on the various aspects of the right to 
health, including medical confidentiality, privacy and equitable access to treatment.  During his 
mission, the Special Rapporteur was concerned about reports that health professionals in Sweden 
did not always know about, and sometimes acted contrary to, their patients&#8217; human rights. 
</p>
<p>65. In addition to clinical responsibilities, health professionals have a duty to promote and 
protect the right to health, as well as other human rights.<b>30</b>  Knowledge of human rights is 
integral to their ability to perform this role.  The World Medical Association has recommended 
that medical schools integrate ethics and human rights as an obligatory course in curricula.<b>31</b>  
</p>
<p>66. Regrettably, human rights training has not traditionally been part of the obligatory 
curricula for health professionals in Sweden.  However, in 2006, the Government introduced 
amendments to the Higher Education Ordinance (1993:100), requiring students enrolled in the 
majority of professional degree courses to be able to make judgements, and have a professional 
approach, that takes account of human rights.  <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes this 
development.  He encourages the Government, and other bodies regulating medical and 
nursing school curricula, to introduce in practice human rights education - including on 
economic, social and cultural rights - into health professional curricula.32  He also 
recommends that the Government ensures that health professionals who have already 
qualified are offered adequate opportunities to undergo human rights training.33</b>

<p><b>F.  Asylum-seekers and undocumented foreign nationals 
</b></p>
<p>67. Sweden has an honourable tradition of receiving asylum-seekers and other categories of 
foreign nationals.  In 2004 there were approximately 20,000 asylum-seekers in Sweden.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>68. Applications for asylum are examined by the Swedish Migration Board.  Recently, the 
duration of the asylum process was on average 18 months, but in some cases it was longer.  Until 
this year, appeals against decisions taken by the Swedish Migration Board were made to the 
Aliens Appeal Board, an administrative agency and a final-decision-making body.  In order to 
improve the asylum process and reduce delays, the Government established a new procedure and 
system in March 2006.  The Special Rapporteur welcomes this development.<b>35</b>  
</p>
<p>69. Asylum-seeking children have access to the same health care on the same basis as 
children domiciled in Sweden.  However, asylum-seeking adults do not have access to the same 
health care as adults domiciled in Sweden.  In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s opinion, such differential 
treatment constitutes discrimination under international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>70. The very difficult situation of undocumented people living in Sweden (<i>g&#246;mda</i>) has 
been brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur.  They represent one of the most 
vulnerable groups in society, consisting predominantly of rejected asylum-seekers, as well 
as immigrants who have never claimed asylum but overstayed in Sweden.  There are an 
estimated 15,000 undocumented people living in Sweden. 
</p>
<p>71. Undocumented children receive health care on the same basis as resident children.  
Undocumented adults may receive immediate health care, but at their own expense.  
Undocumented people who seek medical care in a public health-care facility will receive the 
treatment required.<b>36</b>  However, they will have to pay the full cost of the treatment and 
medication.<b>37</b>  A further problem is that undocumented people fear being reported to authorities 
by medical staff and thus they often refrain from seeking medical assistance even in the most 
serious cases.<b>38</b> 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>34
</b>  Migrationsverket, <i>Facts and Figures</i>, 2004. 
</p>
<p><b>35
</b>  The Special Rapporteur was informed that lengthy asylum processes can have negative effects 
</p>
<p>on the health of asylum-seekers.  From the point of view of the right to health, reducing the 
length of the processes is an important step.   
<b>36
</b></p>
<p>  Under Swedish law, no health institution can turn away a person in need of immediate care, 
regardless of his or her legal status, financial situation, etc. 
<b>37
</b></p>
<p>  A consultation with a doctor at a primary health-care clinic is SKr 140 for Swedish 
nationals and SKr 1,400 for <i>g&#246;mda</i>.  See M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res, <i>Experiences of G&#246;mda

are, as a general rule, prohibited from divulging information of individuals. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/28/Add.2 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that Swedish law and practice regarding the health 
care accessible to asylum-seekers and undocumented foreign nationals is not consistent with 
international human rights law.  In 2000, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, which monitors and interprets ICESCR, advised:  &#8220;States are under an obligation to 
respect the right to health by refraining from denying or limiting equal access for all persons, 
including &#8230; asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants, to preventive, curative and palliative health 
services.<b>39</b>  In 2004, another United Nations committee of independent human rights experts took 
the same position.<b>40</b>  The Special Rapporteur sees no reason to take a different view.  The Special 
Rapporteur notes that under international human rights law, some rights, notably the right to 
participate in elections, to vote and to stand for election, may be confined to citizens.  However, 
human rights are, in principle, to be enjoyed by all persons.<b>41</b> 
73. A fundamental human right, the right to the highest attainable standard of health is to be 
enjoyed by all without discrimination.  It is especially important for vulnerable individuals and 
groups.  Asylum-seekers and undocumented people are among the most vulnerable in Sweden.  
They are precisely the sort of disadvantaged group that international human rights law is 
designed to protect.   
</p>
<p>74. As well as human rights and humanitarian reasons, there are also compelling public 
health grounds for treating all asylum-seekers and undocumented people on the same basis as 
Swedish residents.  While on mission, it was not suggested to the Special Rapporteur that the 
estimated cost of extending the same medical services on the same basis to residents, 
asylum-seekers and undocumented individuals would be prohibitively expensive.  The issue does 
not appear to be primarily one of cost.  Indeed, relatively speaking, the costs of including 
asylum-seekers and undocumented individuals are unlikely to be significant. 
</p>
<p>75. <b>Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to reconsider its 
position with a view to offering all asylum-seekers and undocumented persons the same 
health care, on the same basis, as Swedish residents.  By doing so, Sweden will bring itself 
into conformity with its international human rights obligations.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Asylum-seeking children with severe withdrawal behaviour 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur notes with particular concern the high incidence of severe 
withdrawal behaviour among asylum-seeking children in Sweden (the so-called &#8220;apathetic 
children&#8221;).  These children appear to have become severely withdrawn, with some refusing to eat

<p>(2005), para. 36.  The Special Rapporteur notes that the protections of international human rights 
law are more extensive in their scope than Council Directive 2003/9/EC (27 January 2003).

<p>and/or communicate.  The most difficult and severe cases present symptoms akin to a 
psychological condition known as Pervasive Refusal Syndrome:  those affected often require 
tube-feeding to stay alive. 
</p>
<p>77. Acknowledging the need to address the problem, in 2004 the Government appointed a 
National Coordinator for children with severe withdrawal behaviour in the asylum process.  
The National Coordinator was tasked with providing an overview and analysing the incidence 
of this problem, which mostly affects children of rejected asylum-seekers.  According to the 
results of the National Coordinator&#8217;s survey, Sweden has the largest number of registered cases 
(424 children).  In 2006, the National Coordinator published another report on the situation of 
children with severe withdrawal behaviour.<b>42</b>  The Special Rapporteur commends the 
Government for its commitment to investigating the nature and scale of the problem. 
</p>
<p>78. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to discuss severe 
withdrawal behaviour with clinical psychologists, sociologists, representatives of NGOs and the 
National Coordinator.  He visited a child suffering from severe withdrawal behaviour, and had 
the opportunity to discuss his situation with his father, the treating psychiatrist, a nurse and the 
head of the paediatrics department. 
</p>
<p>79. Severe withdrawal behaviour is a complex medical issue.  To date, there appears to be 
inadequate medical research on this condition.  This has given rise to varying - and sometimes 
conflicting - medical opinions about causes and treatment. 
</p>
<p>80. Some experts argue that the anxiety of traumatized children arising from the uncertain 
outcome of their asylum application may be a cause, and call for granting asylum to these sick 
children.  Other experts, including the National Coordinator, emphasize the high incidence of the 
syndrome in Sweden in comparison with other countries, and that the behaviour primarily occurs 
among children of certain ethnic backgrounds, suggesting that psychosocial mechanisms fuel the 
syndrome.  Others have highlighted the existence of similar syndromes in other countries 
(Finland, Norway and Austria), albeit on a much smaller scale,<b>43</b> and the existence of pervasive 
withdrawal syndrome beyond Sweden.<b>44</b>  The health professionals with whom the Special 
Rapporteur met stated categorically that there was no possibility that children with acute 
symptoms of severe withdrawal behaviour could be faking. 
</p>
<p>81. While the Special Rapporteur, for a number of compelling reasons, is unable to make 
assessments of a clinical nature about these children, he wishes to emphasize the following 
remarks.

</p>
<p>82. <b>First, while the debates about the condition partly reflect the inadequate medical 
understanding of the problem, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that these debates may 
sometimes have been caught up in highly politicized public discussion about asylum and 
immigration in Sweden.  Crucially, the plight of these children must be understood as a 
health and human rights issue, not as a political or immigration issue.</b> 
</p>
<p>83. <b>Second, the right to health demands evidence-based health policies and 
interventions.  The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government actively and 
urgently support more research into the medical, environmental and psychosocial causes of 
severe withdrawal behaviour, as well as its most appropriate medical treatment.</b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>Third, the Special Rapporteur is aware that human rights have not been absent 
from discussions about children with severe withdrawal behaviour.  Nonetheless, in his 
view the human rights dimensions of the issue should receive more attention.  In addition 
to the necessity of greater medical research, he wishes to emphasize that all relevant 
policies and interventions must be guided by human rights.  In particular, all parties 
concerned should ensure that the best interests of the child,45 and the right of the child to 
the highest attainable standard of health, &#8220;including to necessary medical assistance and 
health care&#8221;,46 guide policies and interventions, without discrimination.</b> 
</p>
<p>85. <b>Fourth, as a way of ensuring that the human rights dimensions of the problem 
receive more systematic and considered attention than hitherto, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Ombudsman on children be given the formal and important role of 
closely monitoring this problem in general, as well as individual cases, from the perspective 
of the rights of the child.  The Ombudsman should make recommendations and report 
publicly, regularly and officially on her findings.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Expulsion of foreign nationals with life-threatening conditions 
</b></p>
<p>86. As is the case in other European countries, health problems generally do not entitle a 
foreign national to a residence permit in Sweden.  Sweden&#8217;s revised Aliens Act, which entered 
into force in March 2006, recognizes that health considerations amounting to &#8220;particularly 
distressing circumstances&#8221; may constitute grounds for a residence permit.<b>47</b> 
</p>
<p>87. The term &#8220;particularly distressing circumstances&#8221; replaces the term &#8220;humanitarian 
grounds&#8221; included in the old Aliens Act.<b>48</b>  Under the old Aliens Act, it was recognized that 
life-threatening illness for which no treatment could be provided in an alien&#8217;s home country 
could sometimes constitute &#8220;humanitarian grounds for a residence permit&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>

<p> A/HRC/4/28/Add.2 
 page 23 
 
</p>
<p>88. While welcoming inclusion of health considerations in the legislation, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that decisions under the old Aliens Act only took into account the 
availability of a required treatment in the applicant&#8217;s home country, but not the accessibility of 
the treatment to the particular individual in question.<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p>89. The European Court of Human Rights has made several decisions about whether the 
deportation of an alien with a life-threatening illness would constitute inhuman or degrading 
treatment<b>50</b> in the event that treatment was unavailable in the country of destination.  The Court 
has found a violation only in the most exceptional of circumstances<i>, </i>such as imminent death or 
severe physical and mental suffering.<b>51</b>  In 2000, the Court gave an admissibility decision in 
<i>S.C.C. v. Sweden, </i>a case involving the potential return to Zambia of a woman living with HIV.  
The Court found the case inadmissible.  The Court declined to take into consideration the 
applicant&#8217;s claim that she did not have the financial means to access in Zambia the drugs that she 
needed to maintain her health and prolong her life.<b>52</b> 
</p>
<p>90. While the facts in the <i>S.C.C.</i> case may not have reached the threshold to be considered a 
violation of the prohibition against inhuman and degrading treatment, the Special Rapporteur 
has no doubt that they have major right to health implications.  Returning an individual with a 
life-threatening condition to a country where life-saving treatment is inaccessible to the 
individual in question is prima facie inconsistent with the individual&#8217;s right to the highest 
attainable standard of health.  <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that in their assessment 
of &#8220;particularly distressing circumstances&#8221; under the new Aliens Act, migration courts 
consider whether or not the individual, in practice, would be able to access life-saving 
treatment.</b> 
</p>
<p>91. In cases under the Aliens Act, the Swedish Embassy in the country in question is often 
requested to provide an assessment of whether an alien may be able to receive treatment in his or 
her home country.  These reports are one of several sources available to the Swedish migration 
authorities for assessing the situation in a particular country.  The Special Rapporteur was 
concerned at reports that the Embassy assessments drew on limited sources, were of poor 
quality, and limited to the question of availability.  <b>He recommends that efforts be made to 
improve the quality of, and integrate considerations about the accessibility of drugs into, 
these assessments.  After all, how helpful is an assessment that finds a treatment is 
available in the home country, when it is well known that the treatment lies beyond the 
reach of all but the country&#8217;s rich elite?</b>

<p><b>V. SWEDEN&#8217;S FOREIGN POLICY:  REALIZING THE RIGHT TO  
HEALTH AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Integration of the right to health into Sweden&#8217;s foreign policies 
</b></p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work is guided by the fundamental principle that national and 
international human rights law, including the right to the highest standard of health, should be 
consistently and coherently applied across all relevant national and international policymaking 
processes.<b>53</b>  This fundamental principle is reflected in Sweden&#8217;s foreign policy.  In <i>Human 
Rights in Swedish Foreign Policy</i>, the Government pledges to integrate human rights into all 
areas of foreign policy and to mainstream human rights into the work of global and regional 
organizations.<b>54</b>  The realization of the right to health in developing countries is affected not just 
by their own Governments&#8217; actions, but also by rich countries&#8217; international policies relating to 
aid, finance, trade, the environment and security, as well as the actions of international 
organizations.  Therefore, the Special Rapporteur warmly endorses the commitment of the 
Swedish Government to integrate human rights, including the right to health, across all its 
foreign affairs. 
</p>
<p>93. The Government&#8217;s commendable policy, however, gives rise to two major questions.  
First, to what degree has this policy actually been brought to bear upon all aspects of Sweden&#8217;s 
foreign policy?  For example, while the policy has been given careful consideration by Sida, has 
it also been given due attention in relation to Sweden&#8217;s policies regarding the World Bank, 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and international trade?  Second, to what degree has the 
policy actually been operationalized?  Has Sida, for example, managed to operationalize the 
policy on the ground in developing countries? 
</p>
<p>94. While on mission, the Special Rapporteur asked these challenging questions and he is 
very grateful to all those in Government and beyond who answered them in an open and frank 
manner.  It soon became clear, however, that if these questions are to be subject to close 
examination, they should not only be put to public officials in Stockholm, but also to some of 
those working overseas. 
</p>
<p>95. Thus, the Special Rapporteur is very pleased that the Government agreed that he may 
pursue these important matters by meeting with those executive directors who represent 
Sweden&#8217;s interests in the World Bank and IMF.  The Government has also agreed that the 
Special Rapporteur may visit the Swedish Embassies, including relevant projects, in one or two 
developing countries where Sida is supporting health-related activities.  In early 2007, the 
Special Rapporteur will visit Uganda with a view to considering Sida&#8217;s integration of the right to

</p>
<p>health into its activities in this country, obstacles encountered and good practices.<b>55</b>  The Special 
Rapporteur is very grateful to the Governments of Sweden and Uganda for acceding to his 
request. 
</p>
<p>96. In these circumstances, the present report only serves as a brief introduction to these 
issues because it is anticipated that some of them will be examined in more detail in a subsequent 
report.<b>56</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  International development policies and Sida 
</b></p>
<p>97. Sweden&#8217;s policies and programmes in relation to international development, poverty 
reduction, health and human rights are among the best in the world.  In general, they make a very 
positive contribution towards the realization of the right to health in developing countries.  They 
deserve applause, support and study. 
</p>
<p>98. In 2002, in Shared Responsibility:  Sweden&#8217;s Policy for Global Development, the 
Government confirmed that the human rights perspective would be mainstreamed across all 
areas of policy related to international development.<b>57</b>  Subsequently, human rights have been 
integrated into many of Sweden&#8217;s international development and health-related policies. </p>
<p>99. For example, human rights are one of four key strategies guiding Sweden&#8217;s international 
health and development policy.<b>58</b>  In 2006, the Government adopted its International Policy on 
Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights, an important and pioneering policy that will 
contribute to a more rational and human rights-based approach to these extremely important 
issues.  To its credit, Sida has drawn up a guide for country-level analysis from the human rights 
perspective.<b>59</b> </p>
<p>100. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to considering how these, and other relevant 
policies and guides, have been operationalized when he undertakes his follow-up to the mission 
of January 2006.<b>60</b>  In the meantime, he makes the following preliminary remarks. </p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>55
</b>  The subsequent report on this visit will not focus on the policies and practices of Uganda, 
</p>
<p>save to the extent that they bear upon Sida&#8217;s work. 
<b>56
</b></p>
<p>  It is anticipated that the Special Rapporteur will prepare, and submit to the Human Rights 
Council, an additional report on his visits to Washington DC and the relevant developing country 
or countries.

</p>
<p>101. The Special Rapporteur congratulates the Government of Sweden for surpassing the 
commitment by developed States to devote 0.7 per cent of GNP to official development 
assistance (ODA), and for moving towards committing 1 per cent of GDP to ODA by 2006.  
This level of aid can play a vital role in helping to operationalize the right to health.  Of course, 
aid quality remains a vital consideration. </p>
<p>102. Within the governmental administration, the Department for Global Development has a 
particular responsibility to promote the mainstreaming of human rights across Sweden&#8217;s 
international development activities, in line with Shared Responsibility:  Sweden&#8217;s Policy for 
Global Development.  At the time of his visit to Sweden, while 12 staff were assigned to this 
Department, only 5 were actually appointed and in post.  <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly 
recommends that the Department&#8217;s staffing capacity be significantly increased as a matter 
of urgency</b>. </p>
<p><b>2.  World Health Organization 
</b></p>
<p>103. The right to the highest attainable standard of health is recognized in the Constitution 
of the World Health Organization (WHO).  In its eleventh General Programme of Work 
(2006-2015), WHO recognizes that health-related human rights are a core value and principle 
guiding its work. 
</p>
<p>104. Sweden is a member of the World Health Assembly, the Organization&#8217;s supreme 
decision-making body.  Sweden also provides support to WHO through its voluntary 
contributions to the Organization.  In addition to core (i.e. unearmarked) support, Sweden 
provides important thematic support for WHO on some important right to health issues, notably 
sexual and reproductive health and rights. 
</p>
<p>105. Sweden is also currently supporting the employment of an Associate Professional Officer 
as a Health and Human Rights Officer in the WHO country office in Uganda.  The Special 
Rapporteur commends this initiative and notes the excellent collaboration he had with the WHO 
office in Uganda when he undertook a formal mission to this country in 2005.<b>61</b> 
</p>
<p>106. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the Government of Sweden for its general 
support of WHO.  He urges the Government to ensure that its contributions to WHO 
continue to support sexual and reproductive health and rights.  However, he also urges the 
Government to broaden and deepen its support to other vital areas of the Organization&#8217;s 
work.  The Special Rapporteur encourages Sweden to further support the mainstreaming 
of human rights throughout WHO, such as by supporting the development and adoption of 
a WHO strategy/policy on human rights in relation to its mandate.

</p>
<p><b>World Bank and International Monetary Fund 
</b></p>
<p>107. The Special Rapporteur commends Sweden and other Nordic countries for setting up a 
World Bank trust fund, called the Justice and Human Rights Trust Fund, to promote the 
integration of human rights considerations into the activities of the Bank and to allow the Bank 
to respond positively to requests from its client States on these important issues. 
</p>
<p>108. <b>In 2001, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights encouraged 
Sweden, as a member of international financial institutions, in particular IMF and the 
World Bank, to &#8220;do all it can to ensure that the policies and decisions of those 
organizations are in conformity with the obligations of States parties to the Covenant, in 
particular the obligations contained in articles 2.1, 22 and 23 concerning international 
assistance and cooperation&#8221;.62  The Special Rapporteur endorses this recommendation.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  World Trade Organization 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>In line with the preceding paragraph, the Special Rapporteur recommends that, in 
light of Sweden&#8217;s various policies on foreign affairs, including international development, 
as well as its responsibilities under ICESCR and other human rights treaties, the right to 
health should inform Sweden&#8217;s policies and actions in relation to international trade 
agreements with a bearing upon health, including the Agreement on Trade-related 
Intellectual Property Rights.63</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B. Sweden&#8217;s human rights responsibility of international  
assistance and cooperation </b></p>
<p>110. Throughout his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has taken the position that a rich State&#8217;s 
human rights responsibility to provide international assistance and cooperation is underpinned by 
a legal obligation.  The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and others, adopt 
the same position.<b>64</b>  It is accepted that the parameters and content of this legal obligation are not 
yet clearly defined, but the same can be said for a number of human rights.  In brief, the legal 
obligation can be traced from the Charter of the United Nations,<b>65</b> through to the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights,<b>66</b> and binding human rights treaties, such as the International 
</p>

Development</i> (Sida, 2005).

No. 14, op. cit., paras. 38-42.

</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights<b>67</b> and the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child.<b>68</b>  It is also reflected in compelling world conference outcomes, such as the 
United Nations Millennium Declaration.  This human rights responsibility of international 
assistance and cooperation extends to health. </p>
<p>111. Space does not permit here a detailed consideration of these sensitive and important 
issues.  Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur confines himself to the following points. </p>
<p>112. First, the human rights responsibility of international assistance and cooperation should 
not be understood as only encompassing financial assistance from North to South.  It also 
includes, for example, a procedural responsibility on rich States not to withdraw critical aid 
without first giving the recipient a reasonable opportunity to make alternative arrangements.<b>69</b> 
</p>
<p>113. Second, if there is no legal obligation underpinning the human rights responsibility of 
international assistance and cooperation, inescapably all international assistance and cooperation 
is based fundamentally upon charity.  While such a position might have been tenable 100 years 
ago, it is unacceptable in the twenty-first century. </p>
<p>114. Third, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that Sweden, like other rich States, does not 
accept that it has a legal obligation of international assistance and cooperation.  He wishes to 
emphasize, however, that since Sweden&#8217;s international policies in general provide very 
significant support for developing States, recognition of a legal obligation underpinning its 
human rights responsibility of international assistance and cooperation would primarily serve to 
reinforce Sweden&#8217;s existing international policies and practices.  In short, for a country with 
Sweden&#8217;s commendable record, recognition of a legal obligation would not in practice mark a 
significant departure.  <b>Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur encourages Sweden to play a 
leading role in exploring the contours, content and legal nature of the human rights 
responsibility of international assistance and cooperation.</b> 
</p>
<p>115. <b>He also recommends that the Government routinely include, in its State party 
reports to relevant human rights treaty bodies, information on actions it has taken at the 
international level towards realization of the right to health, as well as other economic, 
social and cultural rights, in developing countries</b>.

<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>Throughout this report, the Special Rapporteur identifies a number of conclusions 
and recommendations and he will not repeat them.  Here, he wishes to draw attention to 
two practical developments that bear upon a number of the themes that recur in this 
report.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  A human rights-based approach to health indicators 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>The international right to the highest attainable standard of health is subject to 
progressive realization.  Inescapably, this means that what is expected of a State will vary 
over time.  With a view to monitoring progress, a State needs a device to measure this 
variable dimension of the right to health.  The most appropriate device is the combined 
application of indicators and benchmarks.  Thus, a State selects appropriate indicators that 
will help to monitor different dimensions of the right to health.  Most indicators will 
require disaggregation, such as on the grounds of sex, race, ethnicity, rural/urban and 
socio-economic status.  Then the State sets appropriate national targets or benchmarks in 
relation to each disaggregated indicator.  In this way, indicators and benchmarks fulfil 
some important functions.  Not least, they can help the State to monitor its progressive 
realization of the right to health, enabling the authorities to recognize when policy 
adjustments are required.</b> 
118. <b>Because of the crucial importance of finding a way to monitor the progressive 
realization of the right to health, the Special Rapporteur has devoted three reports to 
indicators and benchmarks.70  His last report to the Commission on Human Rights sets out 
a methodology for a human rights-based approach to health indicators.71  While this 
methodology remains work in progress, the Special Rapporteur encourages Sweden to 
examine and adopt this human rights-based approach to health indicators, or an approach 
similar to it.</b> 
</p>
<p>119. <b>The methodology addresses the difficult issue of the disaggregation of data.  Human 
rights have a particular preoccupation with disadvantaged individuals and groups.  While 
a &#8220;regular&#8221; health indicator might or might not be disaggregated, from the human rights 
perspective, it is imperative that all relevant indicators be disaggregated.  From the human 
rights perspective, the goal is to disaggregate in relation to as many of the internationally 
prohibited grounds of discrimination as possible, such as sex, race, ethnicity, rural/urban 
and socio-economic status.</b> 
</p>
<p>120. <b>Sweden has a long tradition of collecting health data.  While it is commonplace in 
Sweden to collect disaggregated data on various grounds, including sex and age, 
disaggregation on other grounds, such as race and ethnicity, is not routine.  This is very 
significant, because the Special Rapporteur was informed that it is widely understood that

<p><b>racial and ethnic minorities in Sweden have comparatively poor health status.  Without 
data disaggregated on the grounds of race and ethnicity, how do the authorities know the 
scale and nature of this problem?  If they do not know the scale and nature of the problem, 
how can they devise the most appropriate interventions?  If an intervention were 
introduced, how would they know whether or not it was effective?</b> 
</p>
<p>121. <b>There are understandable sensitivities associated with the collection of some 
disaggregated data, such as on race and ethnicity.  Such data can be misused.  Appropriate 
ways need to be found, as they have in other countries, to address this issue.  Nonetheless, 
with a view to gaining a clear picture of the enjoyment of the right to health across all 
groups in Sweden, the Special Rapporteur recommends that those responsible for data 
collection routinely disaggregate on a wide range of grounds, including race, ethnicity and 
national origin.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The crucial role of impact assessments 
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>In 2003, the Commission on Human Rights requested the Special Rapporteur to 
explore the role of health impact assessments.72  Since then, he has looked at the issue on a 
number of occasions, most fully in a UNESCO-funded study of May 2006.73  This study 
focuses on how the right to health can be integrated into environmental, social and other 
existing impact assessments.  While on mission to Sweden, the Special Rapporteur was very 
interested to learn that in 2005 the Swedish National Institute of Public Health published a 
<i>Guide to Health Impact Assessments </i>and that the Government had recently commissioned 
the Institute to undertake more work in this important area.  While the <i>Guide</i> is highly 
commendable, it does not integrate the right to health into its approach.</b> 
</p>
<p>123. <b>A recurrent theme in the present report is the need to integrate, in a coherent 
and consistent manner, the right to health across Sweden&#8217;s national and international 
policymaking processes.  Health impact assessments reflective of the right to health can 
contribute to such mainstreaming and policy coherence.  The Special Rapporteur warmly 
commends all those in Sweden for their work on health impact assessments; encourages the 
Institute to integrate the right to health into its impact assessments; urges the Government 
to support such pioneering work; and encourages all parties both to use impact 
assessments and to ensure that these assessments take due account of the right to the 
highest attainable standard of health.</b>
