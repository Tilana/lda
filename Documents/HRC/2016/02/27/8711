<p><b>  Mission to Colombia</b>** 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The challenges faced by the Government of Colombia in providing peace, justice, 
security and economic opportunity to its citizens cannot be underestimated. Colombia has 
endured decades of armed conflict and gross human rights violations that have caused a 
protracted humanitarian crisis, social and political polarization and uneven economic 
growth. By the same token, Colombia has made significant progress since 2002. 
</p>
<p> The Government has increased security in many parts of Colombia and reduced the 
overall number of killings. Other improvements include: disruption of the <i>Fuerzas 
Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia</i> (FARC) and <i>Ej&#233;rcito de Liberaci&#243;n Nacional</i> 
(ELN) guerrillas groups&#8217; command and communications structures and their ability to 
conduct hostilities and recruit members; reduction in drug trafficking and associated 
revenues; and initiation of the demobilization of paramilitaries. 
</p>
<p> Despite these important gains, very serious problems remain. Security forces have 
carried out a significant number of premeditated civilian murders and fraudulently 
presented the civilians as &#8220;killed in combat&#8221;. Although it appears that these so-called <i>falsos 
positivos</i> (false positives) were not carried out as a matter of State policy, they were also

</p>
<p>not isolated occurrences. The killings were committed around the country and by a large 
number of military units. They occurred because military units felt pressure to show 
success against the guerrillas through &#8220;kill counts&#8221;. There were incentives: an informal 
incentive system for soldiers to kill and a formal one for civilians who provided 
information leading to the capture or killing of guerrillas. The latter system lacked 
oversight and transparency. Overall, there was a crucial failure of accountability, with 
problems at all stages of the investigatory and disciplinary processes. 
</p>
<p> Guerrilla forces continue to kill civilians, especially those caught in an impossible 
middle-ground between the guerrillas and State Armed Forces. Civilians are also killed by 
the guerrillas&#8217; indiscriminate use of force and illegal use of landmines. The Government&#8217;s 
security strategy may contribute &#8212; even unintentionally &#8212; to the precarious situation of 
civilians when the Armed Forces adopt a &#8220;you&#8217;re either for us or against us&#8221; approach to 
civilians, seeing them as potential enemies to be stigmatized as opposed to neutral 
individuals or victims. 
</p>
<p> Other non-State armed actors, including groups composed of formerly demobilized 
paramilitaries, have also carried out many killings and the numbers are rising. The groups&#8217; 
existence and growth are largely due to demobilization and transitional justice processes 
that have resulted in impunity for paramilitaries&#8217; human rights violations. Neither victims 
nor the nation at large have seen justice done. The truth of why tens of thousands died and 
who was responsible remains hidden, and victims and their loved ones have been deprived 
of reparations. 
</p>
<p> My recommendations focus on four broad areas: 
</p>
<p> First, the Government should scrutinize and reform aspects of its security policies 
that have undermined the very goals it seeks to achieve. The Government&#8217;s legitimacy will 
be enhanced, rather than undermined, if it acknowledges that, despite the successes of its 
security policies, there have been some drawbacks and failures. In fact, State institutions, 
and specifically the military, will be among the primary beneficiaries of reforms. As the 
Government itself notes, the Armed Forces&#8217; &#8220;most prized asset&#8221; is their legitimacy. 
Increases in transparency, respect for the rule of law and accountability will promote 
respect for the military and enable it to carry out its critically important security function 
more effectively. 
</p>
<p> Second, the Government should devote more resources to and bolster the ability of 
State institutions to provide accountability for human rights and humanitarian law 
violations committed by all actors &#8211; State forces, guerrillas and illegal armed groups alike. 
In some instances, this will require the removal of institutional barriers to cooperation 
among entities responsible for investigation, prosecution and adjudication of violations. In 
others, it will require greater accountability on the part of State institutions &#8211; for example, 
military courts that have failed to transfer cases of unlawful killings to the civilian justice 
system, as required by the Supreme Court. In still others, it will require rethinking entire 
processes, such as the Justice and Peace Law, which has not achieved the transitional 
justice intended for paramilitary crimes. 
 Third, although there is no substitute for the prosecution of human rights abuses, the 
Government should consider the establishment of a truth commission to conduct an 
independent and systematic investigation of the history of, and responsibility for, killings 
and other crimes committed by the paramilitaries, guerrillas and State forces during 
Colombia&#8217;s conflict. 
</p>
<p> Finally, the Government should ensure that its policies do not directly or indirectly 
contribute to the further victimization of groups that have been disproportionately targeted 
by all sides throughout the years of Colombia&#8217;s conflict: human rights defenders, including 
trade unionists and women&#8217;s, minority and lesbian, gay and transgender rights activists; </p>

<p>Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities; and people who suffer a physical or mental 
disability. 
</p>
<p> During my mission to Colombia, I received a high level of cooperation from 
Government officials, who repeatedly expressed their openness to suggestions for reform. 
Colombia must be commended for its all-too-rare attitude, which is founded on its 
recognition of the benefits that accrue from international scrutiny, both to the country&#8217;s 
citizens and to its State institutions.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. I visited Colombia from 8 to 18 June 2009 to investigate extrajudicial executions. 
The Government of Colombia provided full and sustained cooperation with my mission. In 
addition, civil society representatives, victims&#8217; family members and those who witnessed 
human rights violations were extremely helpful. Lastly, I am most grateful to the superb 
staff of the Colombia Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
especially its director. 
</p>
<p>2. As an independent expert reporting to the Human Rights Council, my mandate is: to 
investigate killings committed in violation of international human rights or humanitarian 
law; to determine the extent and causes of impunity for such killings; and to propose 
specific and constructive reforms to reduce killings and promote accountability. The 
mandate thus encompasses more than the statutory definition of &#8220;extrajudicial executions&#8221; 
under Colombian law, which includes only killings committed by State forces. In 
Colombia, I focused on killings by the security forces, guerrillas, paramilitaries and other 
armed non-State actors and examined the effectiveness of the criminal, civil and military 
justice systems in relation to those killings. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>3. The conflict in Colombia has lasted for almost 50 years, the longest endured by any 
country in modern times. State forces have fought against left-wing guerrilla groups, 
primarily the <i>Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia</i> (FARC) and the <i>Ej&#233;rcito de 
Liberaci&#243;n Nacional</i> (ELN). By the mid-1980s, the conflict had grown to include right-
wing paramilitaries aligned with the State against the guerrillas. All sides committed gross 
human rights and humanitarian law violations. The guerrillas and the paramilitaries (who 
often acted with the cooperation or acquiescence of State forces) engaged in killings, 
kidnappings, land grabs and other criminal conduct, the effects of which continue today.1 
The challenges presented by the guerrillas and paramilitaries were exacerbated by their 
involvement in drug trafficking. In order to control land and production for those purposes, 
traffickers systematically intimidated the civilian population and corrupted public officials.2 
</p>
<p>4. Beginning in 2002, the present Government sought to address the conflict and 
causes of state instability. Its strategy was set forth in its June 2003 Democratic Security 
Policy, which defined &#8220;terrorism&#8221; as the central threat to peace in Colombia, together with 
drug and arms trafficking, kidnapping, extortion, and homicide.3 The policy sought to: 
defeat the FARC and ELN and regain territory taken by them; eliminate drug trafficking; 
demobilize paramilitaries and reintegrate former members into society; and increase 
security by strengthening, integrating and expanding the armed forces. In 2007, the 
Government developed and refined the policy with the Security Consolidation Policy,

 According to Acci&#243;n Social, a total of 3,046,031 people were internally displaced between 1997 and

<p>2008. In 2008 alone, the number of internally displaced was 281,676.

<p>which sought to improve coordination among State security institutions and to further 
expand security force presence in remote areas of the country.4 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>5. Colombia is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
American Convention on Human Rights, the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols 
thereto, and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.5 In the context of armed 
conflict, customary and conventional international humanitarian law (IHL) also applies. 
Article 93 of the Constitution of Colombia gives the status of domestic constitutional law to 
applicable international treaties.6 
</p>
<p>6. The existence of an armed conflict in Colombia is the subject of some controversy. 
The Government&#8217;s position is that Colombia is not engaged in an armed conflict and that 
the FARC and ELN are terrorists, not belligerents under IHL. Some officials were 
concerned that admitting the existence of an armed conflict would signal a failure of 
Colombian security policies and negate their successes. 
</p>
<p>7. It cannot be said as a categorical matter that an armed conflict does not exist in 
Colombia. As a matter of practice, Colombia does apply IHL, for example, in its operations 
against the guerrillas. Members of the military receive extensive IHL training. Ministry of 
Defence officials have engaged in sophisticated analysis of IHL rules, formulated detailed 
guidelines for their application and demonstrated a determination to grapple with the 
complexities that arise from the facts on the ground. The Government&#8217;s application of the 
correct legal framework signals its willingness to abide by the rule of law and to act for the 
benefit of its citizens, especially those who have been displaced and are at risk of being 
caught in the midst of hostilities. 
</p>
<p>8. As a matter of law, application of IHL is not discretionary; it applies when the 
defining objective elements of a non-international armed conflict are met. Common article 
3 of the Geneva Conventions, therefore, would apply when internal hostilities in Colombia 
reach a minimum level of intensity and duration and when the opposing armed group is 
organized and itself has the capacity to engage in military operations. Protocol II to the 
Geneva Conventions, which Colombia ratified in 1996, supplements common article 3; it 
applies when opposing forces are under a responsible command, exercise enough control 
over territory to mount sustained and coordinated military actions and are able to 
implement Protocol II. This will often mean that IHL will apply in the context of military 
operations against the FARC or ELN.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5
 When Colombia ratified the Rome Statute in 2002, it declared, pursuant to article 124 of the Statute, 
</p>
<p>that it did not accept the Court&#8217;s jurisdiction for seven years. That limitation expired on 1 November 
</p><p>2009. The International Criminal Court&#8217;s Chief Prosecutor has visited Colombia twice and Court 
prosecutors have repeatedly announced their willingness to investigate and prosecute war crimes by 
the guerrillas, former paramilitaries and State forces.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6
 &#8220;International treaties and agreements ratified by Congress that recognize human rights and prohibit 
</p>
<p>their limitation in states of emergency prevail in the national law&#8221;.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-13235 
</p>
<p>9. Whether or not IHL applies in the context of actions against other armed non-State 
actors will also depend on whether the objective criteria are met. Generally, operations 
against such groups should be undertaken by the police, in accordance with human rights 
law.7 
</p>
<p><b> IV. &#8220;Falsos positivos&#8221; and killings by security forces 
</b></p>
<p>10. The phenomenon of so-called &#8220;false positives&#8221; (<i>falsos positivos</i>) &#8212; unlawful 
killings of civilians, staged by the security forces to look like lawful killings in combat of 
guerrillas or criminals &#8212; are well known to Colombians.8 While there are examples of such 
cases going back to the 1980s, the evidence indicates that they began occurring with a 
disturbing frequency across Colombia from 2004. 
</p>
<p>11. The factual dynamics of these cases are well-documented, and it is necessary here 
only to outline the general patterns common throughout the country&#8217;s departments. In some 
cases, civilian victims are lured under false pretences &#8212; usually with the promise of a job 
&#8212; by a paid &#8220;recruiter&#8221; (a civilian, demobilized armed group member or former soldier) to 
a remote location. Once there, victims are killed by members of the military, often within a 
matter of hours or days of when they were last seen by family members. In other cases, the 
security forces remove victims from their homes or pick them up on patrol or at a 
roadblock. Victims may also be identified to military members as guerrillas or criminals by 
&#8220;informers&#8221;, often in exchange for a monetary reward. Once these victims are killed, the 
military, with varying degrees of sophistication, then sets up the scene to make it appear 
like a lawful combat killing. This can involve: placing weapons in the hands of victims; 
firing weapons from victims&#8217; hands; changing their clothes to combat fatigues or other 
clothing associated with guerrillas; and putting combat boots on victims&#8217; feet. The victims 
are reported by the military and in the press as guerrillas or criminals killed in combat. 
Victims are often buried without first being identified (<i>nombre desconocido</i>) and some are 
buried in communal graves. Meanwhile, victims&#8217; families search desperately &#8212; sometimes 
for many months &#8212; for their loved ones. When family members discover what happened 
and take steps to seek justice, such as reporting a case to officials or discussing the case 
with the press, they often face intimidation and threats. Some have been killed. 
</p>
<p>12. That there have been such cases in Colombia is not in dispute. At issue is the 
number killed, the continuing nature of the phenomenon, the extent to which the State has 
sanctioned the killings, the motivations and causes, and whether the Government is taking 
sufficient steps in response. 
</p>
<p><b> A. State policy? 
</b></p>
<p>13. Some critics have accused the Government of having a &#8220;State policy&#8221; of killing 
civilians. Government officials have contended that many false allegations of <i>falsos 
positivos </i>have been made, and that many of the purported civilian victims were in fact 
guerrillas or criminals. When questioned, some senior Government officials told me that 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7
 IHL and human rights law are coextensive in an armed conflict; both impose a duty on States to 
</p>
<p>investigate alleged violations of the right to life &#8220;promptly, thoroughly and effectively through 
independent and impartial bodies&#8221;. See E/CN.4/2006/53, paras. 33&#8211;43; A/61/311, paras. 33&#8211;45 (law 
enforcement officers may only apply lethal force to protect life and if it meets the requirements of 
necessity and proportionality).  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8
 Members of the military also often refer to false positives as &#8220;legalizations&#8221; (<i>legalizaci&#243;nes)</i>, denoting 
</p>
<p>a killing that has been made to appear lawful.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13235 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>while there may have been &#8220;some errors&#8221;, to the extent that, where unlawful killings were 
committed by the military, they were isolated cases and not part of a pattern or widespread 
practice. 
</p>
<p>14. Neither of these claims is accurate. I have seen no evidence to suggest that these 
killings were committed as part of an official policy or that they were ordered by senior 
Government officials. However, I did receive detailed and credible reports of such killings 
from across the country, committed in numerous departments and by a large number of 
different military units. It is clear from my investigations that members of Colombia&#8217;s 
security forces have committed a significant number of unlawful killings and that the <i>falsos 
positivos </i>pattern has been repeated around the country. There have been too many killings 
of a similar nature to characterize them as isolated incidents carried out by individual rogue 
soldiers or units, or &#8220;bad apples&#8221;. The Soacha cases are only the most well-known set of 
such killings.9 I interviewed many of the families of the numerous Soacha victims. But I 
also spoke with witnesses and family members of victims &#8212; who described the horrors of 
these killings &#8212; from the departments I visited (including Antioquia, Meta and Santander), 
and with those who travelled from departments around the country to explain the details of 
their cases to me (including from Arauca, Cali, Casanare, Cesar, Cordoba, Guaviare, Huila, 
Norte de Santander, Putumayo, Sucre and Vichada). In most of the cases I reviewed, I was 
provided with evidence that strongly supports the claims of the victims&#8217; families that the 
killings were unlawful. The forms of evidence received included ballistics and forensics 
reports, video and photographic evidence, eyewitness testimony and the testimony of 
soldiers and &#8220;recruiters&#8221; themselves. 
</p>
<p>15. It is not yet precisely clear how many killings have taken place. One civil society 
group has recorded at least 995 allegations of unlawful killings by the security forces from 
July 2002 to June 2007.10 Another recorded 2,276 victims of extrajudicial executions and 
forced disappearances by State agents from July 1996 to June 2008 (1,486 between July 
2002 and June 2008).11 The Ministry of Defence stated that there were 1,391 cases of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9
 During 2008, young men began disappearing from Soacha and Bogota. When some of the bodies of 
</p>
<p>the missing were found in Santander and Norte de Santander, their families began publicly to allege 
forced disappearances and extrajudicial executions. Press reports initially reported 11 victims; over 
subsequent months, this increased to 23 victims. The men had been reported by the military as killed 
in combat, but the families strongly contested this, and evidence strongly suggested that the &#8220;combat&#8221; 
was fabricated. As of June 2009, there had been nine hearings for 54 accused soldiers. See MINGA,

 The Information and Statistics Group of the Ministry of Defence keeps detailed information on 
</p>
<p>killings committed by members of the security forces. The General Command of the Military Forces 
and of the National Police provides information monthly to the Group. Each unit in the military and 
the police provides to its command&#8217;s operational divisions daily information on operation results 
(date, place, unit, result of operation, e.g. seizures, captures, demobilizations and deaths). The 
Government informed me that a total of 17,364 guerrillas and criminals had been killed in combat or 
self-defence by the National Security Forces between 2002 and May 2009 and provided the following

<p>that there may also be additional complaints recorded by the Office of the Attorney-General 
(<i>Fiscal&#237;a</i>) or the Office of the Inspector General (<i>Procuradur&#237;a</i>).14 The <i>Fiscal&#237;a </i>reported to 
me that, in May 2009, its National Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Unit 
was pursuing 1,708 homicides allegedly committed by State agents.15 The <i>Fiscal&#237;a </i>National 
Prosecution Unit was pursuing an additional 317 cases. The <i>Procuradur&#237;a</i> reported 639 
preliminary enquiries since 2000. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Reduction in killings since late 2008? 
</b></p>
<p>16. From at least as early as 2007, the Government began to take a number of steps to 
confront the issue of these killings. After the publicity surrounding the Soacha killings, 
additional significant and specific steps were taken. Measures (analysed further below) 
have included: disciplinary sanctions, including the dismissal of 3 generals and 24 other 
soldiers; increased cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the 
United Nations with respect to monitoring; the installation of operational legal advisors in 
military units to advise on specific military operations; increased oversight of payments to 
informers; the creation of a temporary special commission to investigate operations (the 
&#8220;Suarez report&#8221;); appointment of delegated inspectors to army divisions; the introduction of 
the requirement that deaths in combat be investigated first by judicial police (Directive No. 
19); modifying award criteria (Directive No. 142) and military unit performance criteria 
(Directive No. 300-28); the creation of a specialized unit in the <i>Fiscal&#237;a </i>to deal with alleged 
extrajudicial executions; and the requirement that military criminal judges transfer cases to 
the civilian justice system.16 In 2009, the Ministry of Defence also issued Directive No. 
208, which lays out 15 measures intended to implement the Ministry&#8217;s human rights and 
humanitarian law policies throughout the Armed Forces and strengthen internal command, 
control, training and evaluation systems. 
</p>
<p>17. These steps appear to have led to a significant reduction in the allegations made of 
extrajudicial executions committed by the military since the Soacha scandal in late 2008. 
The Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Observatory had received no 
allegations of unlawful killings in 2009 at the time of my visit in June 2009. The <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i> 
received denunciations of six cases of alleged unlawful killings by the security forces after 
the Soacha killings, each of which was still under investigation at the time of my visit. Non-
governmental organizations reported fewer than 10 new allegations. It is important to stress 
that it is still too early to confirm the extent or nature of a drop in allegations. Past 
experience in Colombia shows that many cases remain unreported for long periods of time 
due to witness fear, lack of knowledge about how to make complaints and navigate the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>2008 46 
</p>
<p>  The departments with the highest numbers of complaints were: Antioquia (187), Meta (40), Arauca 
(33), Cesar (33), Caquet&#225; (27), Casanare (26), Norte de Santander (21), Cauca (20), Bol&#237;var (20) and 
Putamayo (19).

<p> 
</p>

 See paragraph 30.

 Victims included 1,545 men, 110 women and 53 children. Most cases were from: Antioquia (322), 
</p>
<p>Meta (120), Norte de Santander (70), Casanare (53), Cesar (47), Caqueta (42), Cordoba (41) and 
Guajira (40). The numbers of such cases have spiked dramatically since 2002. From 1985&#8211;2001, there 
were between 0 and 8 cases per year. In 2002, there were 12; 2003, 37; 2004, 93; 2005, 125; 2006, 
223; 2007, 397; and 2008, 112 (from Government response).

<p>justice system, and significant communication and geographic impediments to making 
complaints. 
</p>
<p>18. Furthermore, despite these good faith efforts by the Government to reduce killings, 
there are real gaps between the policies as they exist on paper and the practice on the 
ground, especially with respect to impunity for past killings. As explained below, the 
situation in the regions I visited is significantly less positive than the formal steps alone 
would indicate. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Causes of killings 
</b></p>
<p>19. Unlawful killings by the military are the result of a set of complex factors, which 
have both motivated individuals to commit killings, and fostered an environment in which 
such killings have been able to occur with general impunity. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Pressure to &#8220;show results&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>20. Many expert and experienced interlocutors &#8212; including those in the military &#8212; 
confirmed to me that there was pressure in military units to &#8220;show results&#8221; and demonstrate 
that the military was continuing to gain ground against guerrillas and criminals. While 
senior Government officials disputed this and emphasized that killing civilians does not 
increase security, it is clear that within the military, success was often equated with enemy 
&#8220;kill counts&#8221; &#8211; the number of FARC members and others killed in combat. 
</p>
<p>21. As security in Colombia began to improve from 2002, and as guerrillas retreated 
from populated areas, some military units found it more difficult to engage in combat. In 
such areas, some units were motivated to falsify combat kills. In other areas, the guerrillas 
were perceived by soldiers to be particularly dangerous and soldiers were reluctant to 
engage them in combat. It was &#8220;easier&#8221; to murder civilians. In still other areas, there are 
links between the military and drug traffickers and other organized criminal groups. Local 
military units do not want to engage in combat with the illegal groups with which they are 
cooperating, so killing civilians falsely alleged to be part of these groups make military 
units appear to be taking action.17 
</p>
<p>22. Within this general culture, it has been very difficult for individual soldiers who 
wanted to speak out against abuses to do so. Some who spoke out have been forced to 
relocate for their own safety. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Rewards and incentives for killings 
</b></p>
<p>23. There is much public confusion about rewards and incentives for killings by military 
forces. It is difficult to obtain clear and accurate information, including from the 
Government. Some critics have argued that members of the military receive monetary 
rewards for killing guerrillas and other personal benefits (holidays, medals and 
promotions). Critics also attack the payment by the Government of money to informers 
who provide information leading to the killing or capturing of guerrillas. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>17
 A number of killings also appear to be efforts at &#8220;social cleansing&#8221; &#8211; killings of suspected criminals, 
</p>
<p>drug users and other &#8220;undesirables&#8221;. In such cases, victims are presented as killed in combat; the 
social cleansing motive overlaps with pressure to produce results. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13235 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><i> (i) Rewards to civilians for information 
</i>24. The Government does provide rewards to those who provide information on 
guerrilla and criminal activity. The rewards policy is set out in Directive No. 29 (2005) (no 
longer in effect), Directive No. 02 (2008) and Directive No. 01 (2009), each of which is 
confidential, although copies of Directive No. 29 have been widely circulated.18 Although 
these rewards have been heavily criticized in Colombia, monetary rewards to civilians for 
providing information leading to, for example, the capture of wanted criminals, are 
common in many countries and are not problematic per se. What should be at issue is 
whether there is sufficient oversight and transparency with respect to payments. It is of 
significant concern that the rewards may provide a ready source of money for members of 
the military to pay &#8220;recruiters&#8221; to assist with the commission of <i>falsos positivos</i>. 
25. The Government informed me that the directives are all essentially similar, although 
the newer ones make the system of controls more explicit.19 According to information 
provided by the Government, rewards cannot be paid to public servants (such as soldiers) 
and can only be paid for information leading to clear operational results and following 
approval by a technical follow-up or central committee.20 The new directives set out 
controls and checks that would make it difficult for money to be paid to recruiters for <i>falsos 
positivos.</i> 
</p>
<p>26. However, other sources of payment in the form of &#8220;confidential expenses&#8221; (<i>gastos 
reservados</i>)21 and commanders&#8217; discretionary funds are of serious concern. In fact, in its 
written comments to me, the Government conceded that there is more discretion for officers 
in distributing confidential expenses and that there &#8220;could be problems there&#8221;.22 One 
military commander told me that he has a US$ 2,000 monthly fund, a discretionary fund 
which he could use to, for example, pay small rewards to informers. Such funds, along with 
informal funds gained through criminal activity, are the more likely source of payments to 
recruiters (who are generally paid small amounts of a few hundred dollars or less). 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>18
 Ministry of Defence, Permanent Ministerial Directive No. 29 (2005) provides for payment of rewards 
</p>
<p>to those who provide &#8220;timely and truthful information &#8230; [that leads to, for example] the capture of 
overthrow in combat of leaders of Illegal Armed Groups&#8221;; provides up to 5,000 million pesos for 
information about top leaders. I could not obtain copies of the new Directive No. 1 (2009), which the 
Government told me was restricted. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>19
 The Government provided information on each of the directives. Directive No. 29 provides for 
</p>
<p>rewards for information leading to the capture or death of leaders of illegal organizations or drug 
trafficking groups. It specifies precise amounts, creates a technical committee for follow-up on 
payments and creates a payment procedure. For payment to be made, supporting documents must be 
provided to the committee. Directive No. 2 strengthens the control system, makes clear that payments 
cannot be made to Government officials, increases the requirements for documents that must be 
provided to obtain payment and provides that in certain cases money cannot be offered without prior 
intelligence department approval. Directive No. 1 further reduces the discretion of the military units, 
creates rewards for demobilization and rescuing kidnapped victims and provides that unit 
commanders cannot offer rewards at any level without prior coordination with their intelligence 
department. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>20
 The Technical Follow-up Committee is composed of the Minister of Defence or his delegate, the 
</p>
<p>intelligence chiefs of the Armed Forces and the National Police, and the <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i>&#8217;s Technical 
Investigation Unit. The Central Committee is composed of the intelligence chiefs, analysts and 
administrative officials. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>21
 According to the Government, confidential expenses are intended to finance intelligence activities, 
</p>
<p>counter-intelligence, criminal investigations and the protection of witnesses and informants. 
 
</p>
<p>22
 I asked for, but was not provided, information on the amounts, nature, or purpose of funds paid out to 
</p>
<p>informants under the confidential expenses or other funds. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.10-13235 
</p>
<p><i> (ii) Rewards to military for killings 
</i>27. Significantly, members of the military have also been provided various incentives to 
kill, including vacation time, medals and promotions. I asked the Government for 
information on the type and quantity of incentives provided to members of the security 
forces since 2002, but was not given that information. My investigations did reveal that 
some incentives are relatively informal and unregulated and differ from unit to unit. One 
soldier, for example, explained how a killing by his unit would be rewarded with 15 days&#8217; 
vacation. When important holidays approached, he stated, soldiers would attempt to &#8220;earn&#8221; 
vacation time. However, a commander from another unit said he would not reward his 
soldiers with time off, because he believed this could potentially distort their professional 
judgement. 
28. The Government has taken some steps to address these possible distortions. It 
informed me that demobilizations and captures were now &#8220;worth more&#8221; than combat 
killings in evaluating the performance of a military unit.23 In addition, since Directive No. 
142 (2008), demobilizations and captures have been incorporated as part of the criteria for 
the award of a bravery medal (<i>medalla Al Valor</i>) or a public order medal (<i>medalla de 
Orden P&#250;blico</i>). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>29. Lack of sufficient accountability has been a key factor in the continuation of <i>falsos 
positivos</i>. Estimates of the current rate of impunity for alleged killings by the security 
forces are as high as 98.5 per cent.24 Soldiers simply knew that they could get away with 
murder. Recently, delays caused in part by defence counsel in the Soacha cases threaten to 
result in impunity.25 More generally, other problems, discussed below, occur at each stage 
of the investigation and disciplinary or criminal justice process. 
30. Colombia has a complex and sophisticated government structure and responsibility 
for responding to citizens&#8217; complaints about killings is shared by a number of different 
institutions, including the Offices of the Attorney-General (<i>Fiscal&#237;a</i>), the Inspector-General 
(<i>Procuradur&#237;a</i>), and the Ombudsman (<i>Defensor&#237;a</i>). Each of these institutions has an 
important role under the 1991 Constitution&#8217;s system of checks and balances. The <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i>, 
part of the judicial branch, is the civilian prosecutorial authority with prosecutors (<i>fiscales</i>) 
assigned both at the national level, sometimes in specialized units, and to local offices. The 
<i>Procuradur&#237;a</i> is a civilian entity that has jurisdiction over disciplinary matters related to 
public servants (including the military) and can conduct investigations and impose 
administrative sanctions, such as suspension or dismissal. The <i>Defensor&#237;a</i> is the national 
public defender service and also incorporates a nationwide system of regional ombudsmen 
(<i>personeros</i>) to whom citizens can complain of abuses.

<p><i> (i) Forensics and the Technical Investigation Unit 
</i>31. When a military unit reports a killing in combat, the initial inspection of the scene 
and the corpse is now generally undertaken by the <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i>&#8217;s Technical Investigation Unit 
(<i>Cuerpo Tecnico de Investigacion</i>, <i>CTI</i>).26 To the Government&#8217;s credit, it ensures a CTI 
presence at combat death sites in most cases, even at considerable expense and practical 
difficulty.27 Within 36 hours, CTI officials must report to the relevant prosecutor on their 
investigation.28 However, as of July 2009, CTI had 1,800 cases that it had held for more 
than six months without turning them over to the <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i>, resulting in significant case 
delays.29 
</p>
<p>32. The presence of external investigators reduces opportunities for the military to cover 
up unlawful killings, and promotes transparency. It does not, however, prevent members of 
the military from interfering with the scene before CTI arrives. 
</p>
<p><i> (ii) Disciplinary investigations 
</i>33. Disciplinary investigations are opened by the Commanders of relevant units,30 but 
jurisdiction can be taken by the <i>Procuradur&#237;a </i>upon request of the Commander or of the 
<i>Procuradur&#237;a</i>. 
</p>
<p>34. I was provided limited information on the disciplinary measures imposed by the 
Armed Forces on its members. From 2004&#8211;2009, a total of 75 members of the army were 
dismissed from service, though the Government did not provide information on how many 
of these were dismissed for having committed unlawful killings. 
</p>
<p>35. The <i>Procuradur&#237;a</i>&#8217;s office reported 639 preliminary inquiries relating to unlawful 
killings by security forces since 2000; 506 disciplinary investigations have been opened, 
and there have been indictments in 78 cases, judgement in 18 cases, and 33 cases were 
closed. While this indicates some limited progress, most cases remain at the preliminary 
stage only. 
</p>
<p><i> (iii) Defensor&#237;a 
</i>36. The <i>Defensor&#237;a</i> received and processed 169 complaints of unlawful killings by 
security forces in 2008 and 22 in the first six months of 2009.31 While the <i>Defensor&#237;a</i>&#8217;s 
<i>personeros</i> can play an important role in local communities, they generally lack any real

 Under the Military Criminal Code, the military prosecutor has the duty to examine the corpse. Law

<i>Fiscal&#237;a </i>dated 14 June 2006, deaths in combat must first be inspected by CTI. A standing directive 
also requires commanding officers of military units to &#8220;exhaust all available resources&#8221; to ensure that 
CTI can carry out its investigations. See Ministry of Defence, Standing Directive No. 19 (2007), 
instruction No. 5; see also Ministry of Defence, Standing Directive No. 10 (2007), instruction No. 5.

<p> 
</p>
<p>27
 The Ministry of Defence informed me that, while it does not have records on operations that CTI 
</p>
<p>inspected, CTI attends the &#8220;great majority&#8221;. CTI officials stated they were able to attend 95 per cent 
of crime scenes. CTI was unable to attend the other 5 per cent because of a lack of transportation, 
danger (e.g., ongoing conflict) or difficulty in reaching the site because of terrain and geography. 
According to the military, its facilitation of CTI investigations can cost US$ 8,000 per case.

threats and intimidation. 
</p>
<p><i> (iv) Military and civilian criminal investigations 
</i>37. Criminal investigations can take place either in the military or civilian criminal 
justice system. The most significant obstacle to effective prosecution of extrajudicial 
executions by members of the security forces are the continuing jurisdictional conflicts 
between these two systems and the failure of military judges to transfer cases to the civilian 
justice system. 
38. The <i>Fiscal&#237;a </i>has and should have primary responsibility for prosecution of military 
personnel accused of human rights violations. The Constitution provides (art. 221) that 
&#8220;crimes committed by members of the National Security Forces on active service, and 
related to that same service&#8221; are within the jurisdiction of the <i>military</i> criminal justice 
system. However, the Constitutional Court and the Superior Council of the Judicature have 
clarified that the military courts do not have jurisdiction when force members engage in 
conduct contrary to the constitutional functions of the forces (such as unlawful killings) and 
that where there is doubt, civilian jurisdiction should apply.32 
39. Despite these clear judicial rulings, directives to the same effect from the Minister of 
Defence and a memorandum of agreement (2006) between the Ministry of Defence and the 
<i>Fiscal&#237;a</i>, it remains the case that jurisdiction over far too many cases is contested. There 
have been some improvements in recent years &#8211; a total of 526 cases have now been 
voluntarily sent by the military criminal courts to civilian courts.33 Another 75 cases have 
been transferred following orders from the Superior Judicial Council. However, as of May 
2009, there were still 221 cases of conflict between the military and civilian jurisdictions. 
One cause of delay can be the Supreme Judicial Council&#8217;s failure to decide jurisdictional 
challenges on a timely basis. These decisions should be made more expeditiously. 
</p>
<p>40. In some of the areas visited, including Medell&#237;n and Villavicencio, there appears to 
be a conscious attempt by military judges to frustrate the efforts of the civilian justice 
system. This also creates incredible delays &#8212; often of months or years &#8212; in the 
investigation and prosecution of alleged extrajudicial executions, during which time alleged 
perpetrators are often at large and the value of testimony and evidence can be lost. Military 
judges who do assist the civilian justice system may be subject to harassment, threats or 
transfer to other jurisdictions. 
41. Resource constraints also inhibit effective prosecutions. The <i>Fiscal&#237;a </i>has a 
specialized human rights unit, including a sub-unit for extrajudicial executions (established 
in 2007). In 2008, the numbers of prosecutors focusing on executions more than doubled 
(from 8 to 20). However, the <i>Fiscal&#237;a </i>continues to suffer from a lack of staff and funding, 
which prevents it from investigating and prosecuting all of the cases reported to it. I met, 
for example, with families of victims who were told that they would have to wait for the 
Soacha cases to finish before their own cases could be examined. Of the 1,056 cases of 
killings by Armed Forces that were assigned to the <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i>&#8217;s Human Rights Unit through 
to the end of April 2009, only 16 have resulted in convictions.34

<p><b> D. Killings by police 
</b></p>
<p>42. The police have killed civilians, although there appears to be little information on, 
let alone scrutiny of, the legality of these killings.35 The Ministry of Defence stated that it 
had &#8220;no information &#8230; in relation to unlawful killings by Police&#8221;.36 However, I did receive 
some complaints of killings by police during my mission, and given that a number of the 
alleged extrajudicial killings reported since Soacha were carried out by members of the 
police, it is essential that the Government prioritize the investigation and prosecution of 
such killings. Civil society should also devote more attention to such killings. 
</p>

<p>aimed at instilling fear in civilian populations, such as in Antioquia. The goal is to exert 
control over territory through fear for drug-trafficking and other illegal purposes, including 
extortion and kidnapping for ransom. 
</p>
<p>44. In some parts of the country (such as Meta and Cauca), guerrilla groups are fighting 
the military. In other areas, even within the same department, a guerrilla group may be 
allied with a criminal band against another guerrilla group or the military. In all these 
settings, civilians have been placed in an untenable position. One group forces them to 
cooperate or provide support in the form of food or labour; as a result, the civilians risk 
being accused of collaboration and killed when the territory is taken over by another group. 
</p>
<p>45. Those killed or threatened by the FARC and ELN in the last two years include: 
farmers and labourers; communal leaders and human rights defenders who speak out 
against guerrilla activity; municipal and State government officials and candidates for 
office; soldiers on leave; family members of soldiers; and demobilized former FARC or 
ELN members. Victims may also be killed at roadblocks for violating so-called guerrilla 
&#8220;travel orders&#8221; that seek to limit civilian mobility or for refusal to pay bribes or guerrilla-
imposed &#8220;taxes&#8221;. Others are killed in retaliation for publicizing complaints against guerrilla 
forces for looting or other property damage. 
</p>
<p>46. Guerrilla activity has had an especially negative impact on indigenous communities 
and Afro-Colombian communities that are caught in the conflict between the Government 
and guerrilla groups. For example, in February 2009, the Awa indigenous community 
reported that 27 of its members had been massacred by the FARC in Narino; 8 bodies were 
later recovered. The killings are an example of the disregard shown by the FARC for 
civilians and the right to life. They also raise concerns about Government responsibility for 
preventing abuses and protecting civilians. Before the massacre, the <i>Defensor&#237;a</i>&#8217;s Early 
Warning System39 issued two risk reports, in 2007 and again in January 2009, warning that 
illegal armed groups, the FARC and ELN had moved into the Awa&#8217;s territory and that the 
resulting combat operations placed the community at risk. The 2009 report specifically 
warned that the FARC was likely to retaliate against civilians it accused of collaborating 
with the military. Government authorities failed to respond and the killings occurred a 
month later. 
</p>
<p>47. Both the FARC and ELN continue to recruit and use child soldiers, subjecting them 
to violence and death, including in combat.40 Both groups, but especially the FARC, rely 
heavily on the use of weapons forbidden by international humanitarian law, including anti-
personnel mines and unexploded munitions, causing indiscriminate killings of civilians as 
well as security forces.41 
</p>
<p>48. Although the number of killings by guerrillas declined in 2008, it rose again in 2009. 
Although still weaker than in past decades, the FARC and ELN are increasingly active.42 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>38
 Although their ideological roots differ, both the FARC and ELN claim to represent the interests of the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s rural poor and oppose privatization of natural resources and the United States&#8217; role in 
Colombia.

<p>They continue to be a major cause of instability in many parts of the country. The 
Government must ensure that its anti-guerrilla strategy includes resources to protect civilian 
populations placed at risk as a result of hostilities. While the Government has until now 
focused on a military solution, it should also consider humanitarian accords and negotiation 
as part of its strategy. The United Nations and humanitarian actors also need to be able to 
have contact with guerrillas in order to further civilian protection activities. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Killings by illegal armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Demobilization and implementation of the Justice and Peace Law 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Government has taken important steps to reduce paramilitary killings and 
violence. It disbanded the paramilitaries&#8217; umbrella organization, <i>Autodefensas Unidas de 
Colombia</i> (AUC)43 and began a programme of demobilization, reintegration and transitional 
justice. Paramilitaries started to demobilize in November 2003 and the majority had 
demobilized by the time the Justice and Peace Law (JPL) was passed in 2005. 
50. The JPL was intended by the Government to achieve justice, truth and reparations in 
response to the paramilitaries&#8217; decades-long record of killings and other abuses.44 Under the 
law, candidates who meet eligibility conditions45 undergo a confession and investigative 
process conducted by the <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i>&#8217;s Justice and Peace Unit (JPU).46 The Unit can bring 
charges under a JPL-established system of trial and punishment. If paramilitaries &#8220;accept&#8221; 
the charges, they can escape trial and receive an aggregate reduced sentence (i.e., for all 
charges) of up to eight years, regardless of the seriousness of the offences.47 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Truth and justice 
</b>51. The Government considers demobilization and the JPL to have been successful. In 
part, this is true. According to Government data, 48,616 members of illegal armed groups 
demobilized from August 2002 to March 2009.48 The JPL process has resulted in the 
identification of thousands of crimes, disclosure of mass graves and the recovery of 2,666 
bodies. Numerous families whose loved ones were registered only as &#8220;disappeared&#8221; now at 
least have some solace in the recovery and burial of their remains. 
</p>
<p>52. However, the full picture of the demobilization programme and the JPL shows an 
alarming level of impunity for former paramilitaries. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>43
 The AUC was formed in 1997 as an umbrella organization for what had been disparate paramilitary 
</p>
<p>groups. Under the leadership of Carlos Castano, the AUC rapidly expanded, became increasingly 
involved in the drug trade and expelled the FARC and ELN from significant areas. By 2003, when the 
Government signed a peace deal with the AUC, it was estimated to have penetrated over 700 of 
Colombia&#8217;s roughly 1,100 municipalities. The history and consequences of paramilitary conduct and 
killings in Colombia are well documented and do not require repetition here. However, some 
paramilitary characteristics contextualize current failures in accountability, and the causes and 
patterns of killings by IAGs; these are briefly described in appendix B.

</p>
<p>53. The vast majority of paramilitaries were demobilized without investigation.49 Those 
who had not been convicted of human rights crimes or, critically, were not then under 
investigation for such crimes &#8212; and most were not &#8212; were effectively granted 
amnesties.50  
</p>
<p>54. The JPL has not been an effective tool for justice or truth. Although paramilitaries 
have confessed to over 30,000 crimes, including 20,675 homicides, only 136 cases have 
been referred for trial51 and not a single person has been sentenced. There has been no 
account given of how such massive numbers of crimes came to be perpetrated, by whom or 
under whose command. Few paramilitaries have even been through the JPL process fully. 
As of June 2009, there had been 3,751 candidates for the process; of these, 1,210 candidates 
had withdrawn before making any disclosure statements.52 According to some interlocutors, 
participants leave the process if they find no investigations are pending or charges likely to 
be brought. Many of the most senior paramilitary leaders were extradited to the United 
States of America for drug crime prosecutions in May 2008.53 The ranks of those 
participating in the JPL process are unknown despite a request to the Government for the 
information. 
</p>
<p>55. The process as a whole has been plagued by a lack of resources, planning and clarity 
and by procedural problems, and the JPU lacks both resources and personnel. A staff of 295 
was initially authorized, with an increase to 1,048 in 2008.54 But, given the magnitude of 
the task, this remains inadequate. Senior members of the <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i> also admitted that the 
JPU lacks the capacity and resources to conduct the strategic and complex investigations 
and prosecutions necessary to prevent the structure of paramilitary groups from surviving 
and being replicated. 
</p>
<p>56. Before it can bring charges, the law requires the JPU to prove the truth of all 
confessions by each individual regardless of the relative seriousness of crimes.55 <i>Fiscales</i> 
consider this standard to be impossibly burdensome. Efforts to expedite the process through 
indictments on only some of the possible charges have been successfully challenged. 
Clarity and strategic thinking about how the Government would identify and recommend 
candidates for the JPL process and prosecution has also been lacking.56 The <i>Fiscal&#237;a&#8217;s</i>

<p> 
</p>
<p>49
 The vast majority of demobilizations were conducted under a set of laws and decrees that allowed 
</p>
<p>pardons for political crimes, but not for atrocities, and regulated financial and other support to 
demobilized personnel. They did not include an investigatory component or peace or transitional 
justice processes. See Law No. 418 (1997); Law No. 782 (2002); Decree No. 128 (2003); Decree No.

<p>unfettered discretion in applying the principle of opportunity to paramilitaries seriously 
heightens impunity concerns.57 
</p>
<p>57. Even those who eventually go through the JPL process will benefit from reduced 
accountability. The maximum sentence of eight years for crimes against humanity and war 
crimes is excessively lenient, especially when compared to the life sentences prescribed by 
ordinary criminal law in Colombia and the relevant sentencing requirements of the Rome 
Statute of the International Criminal Court.58 
</p>
<p>58. I do not underestimate the challenges of achieving justice and truth for the human 
rights violations committed by paramilitaries in recent decades. Nevertheless, significant 
substantive and procedural changes are required before the JPL satisfies the Government&#8217;s 
obligation to provide accountability. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Victims&#8217; rights 
</b></p>
<p>59. Victims have also been denied the right to restitution and reparation. Approximately 
70 former paramilitaries have turned over about US$ 13 million in assets,59 far less than the 
fruits of illegal conduct accrued by many more paramilitaries over decades. In April 2008, 
the Government created a programme (under Decree No. 1290) for victims of abuses by 
illegal armed groups to receive monetary reparations from the State. As of April 2009, 
approximately US$ 247 million had been allocated for payment.60 While this is a 
noteworthy development, it should not be seen as a replacement for restitution from former 
paramilitaries of illegally-acquired land and other assets. The programme also fails to 
include reparations for victims of rights violations by security forces and State agents.61 
Indeed, in 2009, the Government had the opportunity to adopt a law providing reparations 
for all victims of Colombia&#8217;s conflict.62 That law could have rectified the failures of the JPL 
and Decree No. 1290, but it failed to pass because of Government opposition. As a matter 
of urgency, the Government should ensure passage of such a law. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Truth Commission 
</b></p>
<p>60. Given the record so far, focusing on the JPL as a means of achieving truth for 
paramilitaries&#8217; decades-long human rights violations is perhaps misplaced. However, the 
JPL does not have to be the exclusive transitional justice mechanism. The Government, in 
consultation with domestic and international civil society groups, should consider 
establishing an independent truth commission that would systematically investigate the 
history of, and responsibility for, killings and other crimes committed during Colombia&#8217;s 
armed conflict by the paramilitaries, and by State forces and guerrillas. The commission 
could build upon the work of the National Commission of Reparation and Reconciliation63 
and the information gathered by the JPU to date.

<p><b> B. Killings by new illegal armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>61. The seriousness of the flaws in the demobilization and JPL processes is 
demonstrated by the rise in killings by new illegal armed groups (IAGs). Based on 
information from the Government, civil society and witnesses, these are composed of: 
paramilitaries, especially mid-level members, who did not demobilize; formerly 
demobilized paramilitaries who have returned to criminal conduct; and common criminals 
who have organized to fight for a share of the drug trade.64 Information from the Colombian 
Commission of Jurists indicates that between December 2002 (when AUC declared a 
ceasefire) and June 2008, 4,261 people, including 350 women and 181 children, were killed 
by paramilitaries or former paramilitaries. 
</p>
<p>62. There is much debate about whether these new groups are the next generation of 
paramilitaries or whether they are criminal gangs (<i>bandas criminals </i>or <i>BACRIM</i>): however 
they are categorized, they share certain characteristics. 
</p>
<p>63. Unlike the original paramilitaries, they generally lack a common ideology. Some 
wear uniforms of sorts (e.g., camouflage), or other identifying insignia and have informal 
(and sometimes formal) command structures. Witnesses from some areas (including 
Cordoba and Meta) described armed patrols carried out openly by what appear to be sub-
units of IAGs. These groups may have spread across Colombia65 and, in the aggregate, their 
members may number in the thousands.66 Most individual groups&#8217; membership is in the low 
hundreds. Weapons seized in police operations against the IAGs show they have access to a 
range of weapons: from January to May 2009, the Government &#8220;seized 326 long-range 
weapons, 543 side arms and 18 support weapons, including machine guns and mortar 
tubes&#8221;.67 
</p>
<p>64. The relationship between the new IAGs and other armed groups differs substantially 
across the country. In some areas, guerrillas and IAGs cooperate closely, in others they are 
in violent conflict. Violence among the IAGs seems to a large extent to be competitive &#8211; 
relating to &#8220;turf wars&#8221;. Most IAGs engage in and are financially sustained by drug 
trafficking; many also engage in extortion from local businesses and landowners, 
kidnapping, money-laundering and other criminal behaviour. When local populations resist

<p> 
</p>
<p>64
 Rearmed groups of formerly demobilized paramilitaries emerged soon after demobilization. See 
</p>
<p>MAPP/OAS, Sixth Quarterly Report, document CP/doc.4075/06, 16 February 2006. According to the 
Government, of 959 IAG members arrested as of 6 June 2009, 181 were formerly demobilized 
paramilitary. MAPP/OAS, Thirteenth Quarterly Report, 21 October 2009. The economic and 
command and control structures of paramilitaries (especially at the mid-level ranks) do not appear to 
have been effectively dismantled. See appendix D; see also MAPP/OAS, Tenth Report, document 
CP/doc.4249/07, 31 October 2007 (raising concern about continued existence of chains of command 
within demobilized groups).

 As of February 2009, 14 per cent of total municipalities in Colombia were &#8220;negatively impacted&#8221; by

<p>corruption or participation in illegal conduct, they are threatened with death and, all too 
often, killed.68 
</p>
<p>65. IAG killings and violence towards civilians follow some of the patterns of 
paramilitaries. 
</p>
<p>66. First, IAGs have targeted human rights defenders, leaders and members of 
indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities and of victims&#8217; groups, and local government 
officials who speak out against IAG activities.69 In Meta, a local community leader who had 
criticized the IAGs in his region, including for three killings of community members, told 
me that he had received anonymous death threats. He had to cease community work and 
stay home for fear of being killed. Also worrisome are threats against and killings of those 
seeking to assert their rights under the JPL, or demobilized paramilitaries who refuse to join 
IAGs. 
</p>
<p>67. Second, the IAGs have killed or threatened civilians as a means of terrorizing local 
populations in order to exert control over areas important for the growth, production or 
transport of drugs or for other criminal purposes. In Meta, I met family members whose 
loved ones had been killed in order to intimidate local communities. In a deeply troubling 
development, an Organization of American States monitoring mission has noted &#8220;the 
reappearance of massacres&#8221; as an intimidation tool, especially in rural areas including in 
Narino, Cauca and Cordoba.70 
</p>
<p>68. Third, IAGs have threatened and sometimes killed alleged prostitutes, drug addicts 
and small-time criminals, as &#8220;social cleansing&#8221;.71 
</p>
<p>69. The widespread fear in the regions in which the IAGs operate may be exacerbated 
by corrupt and cooperative local authorities, the absence or ineffectiveness of the National 
Police and the scarcity of victim support organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Prosecution challenges 
</b></p>
<p>70. Investigations of IAGs are largely conducted by the local office of the National 
Police, with prosecutions conducted by the local <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i>. While many do commendable 
work under difficult circumstances, senior <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i> officials expressed scepticism about the 
likelihood of successful prosecution in some parts of Colombia because, in the words of 
one, IAGs &#8220;are very economically powerful and they have infiltrated the military and 
political establishment who help them by providing cover&#8221; for their activities and &#8220;a lot of 
money changes hands to prevent justice&#8221;. 
71. Institutional barriers also compromise the Government&#8217;s ability to shut down IAGs 
or prosecute their leaders. The <i>fiscales</i> are separate from the police, who do the 
investigation and arrest and both are separate from the National Reparation Fund, which 
manages seized assets. <i>Fiscales</i> indicated that this often results in failures to cooperate and 
coordinate. 
</p>
<p>72. Another institutional weakness is that local <i>fiscales</i> generally approach the 
prosecution of each defendant as an individual case. They may not have the sophistication 
or resources to oversee the kind of complex investigation and multiple prosecutions

<p>necessary to target the leadership of an IAG and economic structure and the sources of its 
support among local elites. 
</p>
<p>73. To address these problems the <i>Fiscal General</i> should create a national unit dedicated 
to complex prosecutions that would seek to shut down all the major actors in and sources of 
support for particular IAGs (which could be prioritized by the extent of their organization 
and illegal activity). Teams of prosecutors from the unit could be assigned to cover 
different parts of the country, thus avoiding the pressures to which local<i> fiscales</i> can be 
subjected. Donor country agencies with experience in such complex litigation could 
provide training and support. In addition, the Government should consider seconding 
police, investigators, and asset confiscation and management experts to such a unit so that 
all investigation and prosecution activities are strategically coordinated. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Especially vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>74. Important targets of unlawful killings by both Colombian State forces and IAGs 
have historically included human rights defenders, trade unionists, proponents of women&#8217;s, 
victims&#8217; and minority rights, lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender individuals or people 
with physical or mental disabilities. Statistics about the number of unlawful killings of 
people in each of these categories differ,72 but the incontrovertible reality remains that they 
continue to be disproportionately killed or threatened and are especially vulnerable. 
Government efforts to hold perpetrators accountable are weak. For example, of 877 trade 
unionists killed between 1984 and 2008, only 106 cases have reached the sentencing stage, 
while the vast majority (621) remain at the initial investigative stage. Impunity for killings 
by State forces and by paramilitaries and IAGs continues.73 
</p>
<p>75. From time to time, Government officials have accused human rights defenders of 
undermining security policies and even of terrorism. Such accusations were made, for 
example, when defenders raised concerns about <i>falsos positivos</i> killings.74 I spoke with 
<i>fiscales</i>, judges and other State officials who were similarly accused when they sought to 
investigate, prosecute or adjudicate cases in which members of the Government or armed 
forces were defendants.75 Accusations have been made by high-level officials, both military 
and civilian. Unfounded accusations of this type put individuals at great risk and are 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>72
 According to the Government, 470 trade unionists were killed between 2000 and May 2009. The vast 
</p>
<p>majority of the deaths (331) were categorized as committed by unknown perpetrators, with 107 
(through 2006) by paramilitaries and 2 by &#8220;public servants&#8221; (Government response). According to 
CCJ, between 1986 and 2008, there were 41 cases of extrajudicial executions of trade unionists 
directly attributable to State forces. The International Trade Union Confederation states that 27 trade 
unionists were murdered in Colombia between January and September 2009 (see http://www.ituc-
csi.org/colombia-trade-unions-in-mourning.html). In addition, based on information provided by CCJ, 
at least 49 human rights defenders were killed in 2008 and, between January 2008 and May 2009, at 
least 25 human rights defenders had been murdered or disappeared. The Government did not provide 
statistics on human rights defenders

 In reports beginning in February 2009, Colombian media revealed that the Administrative Security 
</p>
<p>Department (<i>Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad</i>, DAS), the President&#8217;s intelligence agency, 
conducted an illegal wiretapping and surveillance campaign against Supreme Court justices, lawyers, 
politicians, human rights defenders, and journalists. The campaign took place from approximately 
2003 to 2008, and may have continued into 2009. See, e.g., <i>Semana</i>, &#8220;El DAS sigue grabando&#8221;, 21

<p>unworthy of a democratic Government. The Government can address the concerns of its 
critics without recklessly endangering them. 
</p>
<p>76. Indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities have been victimized by all parties to 
Colombia&#8217;s conflicts. According to the Government, 1,039 indigenous persons were 
unlawfully killed between 2000 and May 2009. Figures compiled by indigenous groups 
show 1,007 community members killed in that period; 115 were allegedly killed by State 
forces, 402 by paramilitaries or other IAGs and 223 by guerrillas. Many of these deaths 
relate to militarily or economically significant locations. Historically, paramilitaries, 
sometimes in collusion with State forces, appropriated land from the indigenous or Afro-
Colombians and committed massacres to intimidate local populations or overcome their 
resistance. More recently, IAGs and guerrilla forces fighting for control of land and the 
drug trade have killed or displaced community members. Indigenous and Afro-Colombian 
communities are often caught in an impossible bind in the conflict &#8211; between the demands 
of cooperation from State forces and those from illegal armed groups. Instead of providing 
protection, State forces often view efforts by the indigenous population to protect their 
rights as a form of subversiveness or collaboration with guerrillas. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Institutional capacity and reform 
</b></p>
<p>77. In addition to various constraints on the Government&#8217;s ability to investigate and 
prosecute unlawful killings by State forces or illegal groups, various overarching 
institutional issues must be addressed if the Government is to fulfil its obligation to prevent 
and to provide accountability and redress for unlawful killings. In particular, institutional 
barriers to cooperation and information-sharing need to be broken down. Both structural 
and cultural changes are necessary and Colombia will need the support of its donor 
community to ensure that training and funding helps eliminate institutional barriers. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Allocation and effective use of resources &#8211; <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i> 
</b></p>
<p>78. The need for additional resources and funding for the <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i> is addressed above.76 
Various interlocutors, including within the <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i>, also identified the need for better 
internal management of the <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i> in order to maximize the effective use and deployment 
of attorneys and investigators. Technical assistance from donor countries may be helpful in 
this regard. 
</p>
<p>79. As an example, the <i>Fiscal General</i> should establish more control mechanisms over 
<i>fiscales</i> in the different jurisdictions. An internal audit could identify cases in each office 
that have stalled, identify the reason (such as security concerns or lack of resources) and 
take appropriate action to address them. The <i>Fiscal General</i> should also impose time limits 
for cases to be assigned to a prosecutor and investigations to be opened. Statistics on the 
number of cases pending investigation, under investigation, at the preliminary hearings 
stage and at trial stage, broken down by each regional or thematic office of the <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i>, 
should be made publicly available and updated on a frequent and regular basis. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Early Warning System 
</b></p>
<p>80. The <i>Defensor&#237;a&#8217;s</i> Early Warning System (<i>Sistema de Alertas Tempranas</i>, SAT) 
monitors, analyses and reports on risks to civilians and possible violations of international 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>76
 See paragraphs 41 and 55. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.2

<p><b>26</b> GE.10-13235 
</p>
<p>law. The reports describe the local dynamics of armed conflict, the sources of threats, the 
individuals and populations at risk, an evaluation of the risk and recommendations to 
reduce or eliminate threats.77 SAT reports are full of detailed facts and sophisticated 
analysis.78 SAT is one of the best tools the Government has for preventing killings and 
other abuses in Colombia. 
</p>
<p>81. It is critically important that the Government provide SAT with more staff and 
resources. At the time of my visit, it had only 6 national analysts and 22 regional analysts, 
which is not enough to cover the country&#8217;s geographical expanse or the complexity of its 
conflict dynamics. Direct access to local communities is integral to the accuracy and 
usefulness of the SAT monitoring and reporting function. Yet, because of its limited 
budget, SAT analysts are sometimes unable to travel to the areas they are responsible for 
covering. Analysts should be able to report on risks posed by the presence or movement of 
all armed actors, including State forces. 
</p>
<p>82. It is also crucial that the Government acts upon SAT reports, and that neither the 
SAT analysis nor the decision by the Inter-Agency Early Warning Committee (<i>Comit&#233; 
Interinstitucional de Alertas Tempranas</i>, CIAT) whether to issue an early warning are 
influenced by political pressures. 
</p>
<p>83. I was given information about several instances in which killings had occurred after 
the Government had failed to respond to the SAT warnings. One example is the Awa 
massacre discussed above.79 Another death took place in March 2008, after SAT had issued 
a risk report for municipalities in Caqueta where the conflict against the FARC had 
intensified. The FARC threatened municipal officials to intimidate them into not supporting 
the Government&#8217;s Domestic Security Policy. CIAT determined that no early warning 
should be issued and a week after the SAT report, the FARC killed a local official. Killings 
may occur despite early warnings and the Government&#8217;s best prevention efforts, but the 
Government&#8217;s failure to act after notice from one of its own agencies is a stark dereliction 
of its responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>84. I was told by some Government officials that political pressure may be a factor in 
the decision of CIAT not to issue an early warning. Military and civilian officials at the 
regional and departmental level may be concerned that a warning signals security failures 
and deters investment and development and press for a warning not to be issued or to be 
prematurely withdrawn. Given the importance of the SAT function, it is also foreseeable 
that other Government or civilian actors may try to influence its analysis or 
recommendations. To reduce such illegitimate pressures and to fulfil its obligation to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>77
 In 2007, SAT issued reports describing 90 risk situations covering 85 municipalities in 18 
</p>
<p>departments. In 2008, SAT reports described 71 risk situations in 145 municipalities of 29 
departments. From January to May 2009, it had issued reports on 20 risk situations covering 49 
municipalities in 12 departments. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>78
 SAT provides the reports to the Inter-Agency Early Warning Committee (<i>Comit&#233; Interinstitucional de 
</i></p>
<p><i>Alertas Tempranas</i>, CIAT), led by the Minister of Interior and Justice and tasked with coordinating 
the Government&#8217;s response to SAT warnings of possible rights violations. CIAT includes the vice-
president, the high counsellor for Acci&#243;n Social, the defence minister and the DAS director, or their 
representatives. While SAT may participate in meetings, it does not have a vote. 
</p>
<p>  If CIAT decides an early warning should be issued, it alerts the governor of the affected department, 
other regional officials, the Armed Forces, the National Police and the Acci&#243;n Social agency. The 
early warning triggers the duty of these officials to prevent human rights and humanitarian law 
violations (Law No. 1106 of 2006, art. 5). If an early warning is not issued, CIAT may informally 
notify departmental or municipal authorities of risks and provide recommendations for preventing 
harm and protecting civilians. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>prevent and protect, the Government must ensure that the independence of CIAT and SAT 
is maintained. It should make SAT reports public (subject to security needs) after an 
appropriate period, such as three months after the decision of CIAT. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Victims&#8217; access to information 
</b></p>
<p>85. Coordinating and tracking the results of investigations by the various institutions is 
problematic and victims&#8217; family members justifiably complained about the difficulty of 
obtaining information about the status of cases. A relatively easy and inexpensive solution 
would be a centralized database system through which each institution reports its activity 
and progress on each individual case. Information from this system should be available 
through institutional representatives at the regional, municipal and community level, so that 
families would not need to travel long distances to obtain it. Responsibility for maintaining 
the system and ensuring that all institutions comply with reporting obligations could be 
assigned to the Office of the Vice-President or another Government unit; the key is that it 
be an institutional actor with the stature to enforce reporting obligations.  
</p>
<p>86. Given the influence of IAGs or guerrillas on officials in some local communities, the 
database should not include sensitive information that could expose witnesses and victims&#8217; 
families to greater security risks. Nor should it include genuinely confidential information 
related to ongoing investigations or prosecutions (family members could be directed to the 
local <i>fiscal</i> for that information). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Witness protection 
</b></p>
<p>87. Witness fear is a major cause of impunity for unlawful killings. I spoke with 
witnesses who had previously refused to report the details of their cases to any other 
officials because they did not believe the information would be secure. Significant numbers 
of witnesses never report their cases at all because of a well-justified fear of retaliation. 
Some who have filed or discussed cases publicly &#8212; including relatives of the Soacha 
victims &#8212; have received death threats or been killed. Witnesses&#8217; fear extends not just to 
alleged perpetrators but, especially in more rural and remote areas, to Government actors 
such as the local <i>fiscal</i> or <i>procurador</i>, whom witnesses believe may be cooperating with or 
under the influence of alleged perpetrators. In some instances, the fear may be justified, but 
in others Government agents are themselves under threat as they seek to prosecute unlawful 
killings.80 In all such circumstances, it is difficult for cases to proceed. 
</p>
<p>88. Presently, multiple sources can provide protection: the police, the Interior and 
Justice Ministry or, for victims or witnesses participating in criminal proceedings, the 
<i>Fiscal&#237;a</i>. Efforts have been made by the Government to improve protection. The budget for 
the Ministry&#8217;s protection programme grew 187 per cent between 2002 and 2007, and the 
United States has worked with the <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i> to improve its protection programme. 
Nevertheless, current protection is insufficient to meet witness needs and stronger 
protection efforts need to be made. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>80
 In local jurisdictions, <i>fiscales</i> may also have fewer resources and investigatory personnel, resulting in 
</p>
<p>slower development and prosecution of cases, which may give rise to suspicion that the <i>fiscal</i> is not 
proceeding for more nefarious reasons. </p>

<p><b> A. Killings by security forces 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>In all cases of alleged killings by security forces, the civilian criminal justice 
system should have jurisdiction. Within two months after publication of this report, 
the head of the military justice system should conduct an audit of all cases of alleged 
extrajudicial executions still pending before military courts and should then ensure 
that such cases are transferred within a short time period. Judges who fail to effect 
such transfers should be disciplined.</b> 
</p>
<p>90. <b>The Supreme Judicial Council should adhere to time limits for the resolution of 
jurisdictional conflicts between the military and civilian justice systems. The Council 
should publish regularly &#8212; and at least biannually &#8212; the list of such cases before 
each judge and the amount of time any such case has been pending before the Council.</b> 
91. <b>The Government should prohibit all incentives given to members of the Armed 
Forces for combat killings. It should not permit any rewards for information to 
civilians without oversight and should audit discretionary funds for such rewards.</b> 
</p>
<p>92. <b>The Government should ensure that Technical Investigation Unit (<i>Cuerpo 
Tecnico de Investigacion</i>, CTI) is provided the resources and personnel necessary to 
carry out, and report on, investigations on a timely basis. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Service members suspected of involvement in killings should be suspended for 
the duration of the investigation and prosecution.</b> 
</p>
<p>94. <b>The Government should ensure that the specific measures of the Ministry of 
Defence&#8217;s Directive No. 208 to implement international human rights and 
humanitarian law standards are put effectively into practice. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Government should prioritize the investigation and prosecution of police 
killings. Civil society groups should place increased emphasis on researching and 
reporting such killings. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Killings by guerrilla groups 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The FARC, ELN and all illegal armed groups should immediately cease their 
harassment, abuse and murder of Colombians.</b> 
</p>
<p>97. <b>The FARC and ELN should immediately cease the use of landmines and the 
recruitment of child soldiers. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Government should ensure that respect for international humanitarian 
and human rights law are at the forefront of its strategic plans and military 
operations. It should be open to dialogue and humanitarian negotiations with guerrilla 
groups. The United Nations and humanitarian actors must be able to have contact 
with guerrillas in order to further civilian protection activities.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> C. Killings by former paramilitaries and illegal armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Government should ensure that perpetrators of human rights violations do

at all levels to cease making statements or engaging in acts of intimidation of human 
rights defenders, members of the judiciary, the <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i> and the <i>Procuradur&#237;a</i>, and

specifically prohibit Government officials and State forces from calling into question 
the legitimacy of the work done by each of the foregoing groups or equating the work 
of any group or member with the strategy or tactics of guerrillas or other illegal 
groups.

<p>109.<b> The Government should provide additional staff and resources to the Early 
Warning System (<i>Sistema de Alertas Tempranas</i>, SAT). It should implement measures 
ensuring that SAT reports are acted upon, and that SAT analysis and Inter-Agency 
Early Warning Committee (<i>Comit&#233; Interinstitucional de Alertas Tempranas</i>, CIAT) 
decision-making processes are not influenced by political pressures. SAT reports 
should be made public, subject to security requirements.

activity and progress on each individual case. Information from this system should be 
available through institutional representatives at the regional, municipal and

<p><b>  Programme of the mission 
</b></p>
<p>1. I visited Colombia at the invitation of the Government from 8&#8211;18 June 2009. I 
travelled to Bogot&#225;, Antioquia (Medell&#237;n), Santander (Bucaramanga) and Meta 
(Villavicencio).  
2. I met with the President, Vice-President, Acting Minister of Defence, Vice-Minister 
of Defence, Vice-Minister of Multilateral Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Relations, 
Vice-Minister of Interior and Justice and Director of the Presidential Programme for 
Human Rights. I also met with a range of officials responsible for human rights and IHL 
issues at the Ministries of Foreign Relations, Defence, and Interior and Justice. I also had 
meetings with representatives of the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court, Supreme 
Judicial Council, Inspector-General, Public Prosecutor, Ombudsman, and National 
Commission on Reparation and Reconciliation. In the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, I met 
with the heads of the Units for Justice and Peace and the Human Rights Programme and 
with officials responsible for the investigation and prosecution of unlawful killings and the 
protection of victims and witnesses. I also met with the Director of the Early Warning 
System of the Ombudsman&#8217;s office, officials and attorneys from the offices of the 
Inspector-General, the Public Prosecutor and the Ombudsman, at the regional and 
departmental level, and with regional ombudsmen (<i>personeros</i>) throughout the country. 
From the military, I met the Commander of the Army, the Commander of the Air Force, the 
Inspector-General of the Armed Forces, the Inspectors of the Army, Naval Forces, and 
Police, the Interim Director of Military Justice, the Commanders of the Seventh, Fourth, 
and Second Divisions and military legal advisers and judges. In addition, I met the 
Governor of Antioquia and a number of senators and representatives. I am deeply grateful 
to the Government of Colombia for the full cooperation I received.

<p>3. I met with a large number of members of the diplomatic community.  
</p>
<p>4. I spoke with many representatives from international, national, and local civil 
society organizations, and from the <i>Secretariado Nacional de Pastoral Social</i>.   
</p>
<p>5. My team and I conducted over 100 individual interviews with witnesses, victims, 
survivors, and family members of victims of unlawful killings by the security forces, the 
guerrillas and paramilitaries and illegal armed groups. 
</p>
<p>6. Before visiting Colombia, I was able to analyse in detail the many reports prepared 
on human rights and humanitarian law issues in Colombia, including Government data and 
publications, reports by intergovernmental organizations, and reports by international, 
national and local civil society organizations.   
</p>
<p>7. I also met with officials from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (UNHCR) in Colombia and representatives from many United Nations 
and other intergovernmental institutions and agencies, including the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the UNHCR, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs and the Department of Safety and Security. I am indebted to the UNHCR office in 
Colombia for facilitating my mission and for their superb professionalism. </p>

<p><b>  Paramilitaries &#8211; brief background 
</b></p>
<p>1. From their inception in the 1960s to their more formalized unification under the 
<i>Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia</i> (AUC), the paramilitaries combined the interests of drug 
lords, local political and economic elites and organized criminals, and sought to protect 
these interests, which were mainly to obtain and retain land, businesses, and political office. 
Although they were purportedly established to protect Colombian society from left-wing 
guerrilla groups, the paramilitaries instead victimized ordinary Colombians and caused 
massive internal displacement, in particular of indigenous communities, and massacred and 
abused civilians.   
</p>
<p>2. Paramilitaries targeted Government critics, in particular human rights defenders, 
trade unionists and journalists, for perceived &#8220;leftist&#8221; sympathies with guerrillas. The State, 
with which paramilitaries were aligned, saw criticism as a threat to social order and 
contributed to the stigmatization of such persons. Paramilitaries also engaged in &#8220;social 
cleansing&#8221; of the socially marginalized, such as gay and lesbian persons.   
</p>
<p>3. Paramilitaries were used by the Colombian military as auxiliaries in its fight against 
the guerrillas and by civilian and military elites to increase their political and economic 
power. Indeed, a success of the JPL process is the information that has come to light about 
the extent to which paramilitaries infiltrated the highest levels of Colombian politics. 
According to the Government, as of June 2009, there were a total of 80 investigations, 41 
by the Supreme Court and 39 by the <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i> into collusion between paramilitary 
commanders and members of Congress.81

<p><b>Appendix C  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Justice and Peace Law  
</b>1. The Justice and Peace Law (Law No. 975) (JPL) was passed in 2005. From its 
inception, the law was controversial and Colombian human rights groups challenged the 
JPL before the Constitutional Court for, among other reasons: allowing the possibility that 
those who committed serious crimes could escape prosecution and not guaranteeing 
victims&#8217; rights to reparations and truth.82  
</p>
<p>2. In May 2006, the Constitutional Court of Colombia upheld the JPL, but struck down 
some of its most controversial provisions and amended others to provide that: victims could 
participate in all stages of legal proceedings; prosecutors did not have to abide by time 
frames restricting their investigations; recidivists or those who did not cooperate with the 
full process could not receive the benefits of the JPL and would instead be transferred to the 
regular criminal justice system; candidates had to confess fully to their crimes to benefit 
from the law; paramilitaries had to turn over not only illegally obtained assets for victim 
reparation, but also legally obtained ones if necessary for reparation.83 
</p>
<p>3. In essence, the law provided that those who fully confessed to their crimes and 
participated in the JPL process could receive a single reduced sentence of five&#8211;eight years 
for all crimes committed during paramilitary membership, regardless of the seriousness of 
the crime.84   
</p>
<p>4. To participate in the JPL process, candidates must meet these requirements: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Provide all illegally obtained assets, including land, to a national reparation fund 
established for that purpose 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Disclose fully involvement in crimes and knowledge of paramilitary structures and 
financing sources 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Dismantlement of the paramilitary unit and criminal networks to which they 
belonged; candidates must show that they contributed to the dismantlement of the 
illegal group of which they were a member 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Stop all conduct that would interfere with the free exercise of political and public 
rights by others  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Liberation of all kidnapping victims and identification of the burial sites of 
disappeared persons 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Handover of all underage fighters to the Colombian Institute for Family Welfare 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Assurances that there are no drug traffickers among the JPL-prosecuted individuals; 
under the JPL, paramilitaries organized for drug trafficking are not eligible for the 
law&#8217;s benefits85

<p>5. Demobilization may be collective or individual under the JPL and demobilization 
petitions must be approved by the Ministry of Justice and Interior, which then sends cases 
to the Justice and Peace Unit of the <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i> for investigation and prosecution.   
</p>
<p>6. There are three phases to the JPL process. First, candidates are advised of their 
rights and obligations, asked whether they meet the JPL eligibility requirements, and 
required to make a list of actions to which they intend to confess (<i>versi&#243;n libre</i>). In the 
second phase, candidates provide a detailed account of the actions to which they wish to 
confess. The required details include circumstances, date, place, motive, participants, and 
the identity of victims. The assigned <i>fiscal</i> will investigate the admissions and question 
each candidate about each confessed action, as can representatives of the <i>Procuradur&#237;a </i>and 
victims. Questioning on each confessed action must be completed before the parties move 
to the next one. This process can last a maximum of six months. At the third phase, the 
<i>fiscal</i> questions candidates about actions they may have committed based on information 
supplied by victims, or obtained from other cases or investigations.   
</p>
<p>7. The JPL also created new institutions. The Justice and Peace Unit (JPU) of the 
<i>Fiscal&#237;a</i> was established in early 2006.86 It is charged with investigating all individuals 
whose names are submitted by the executive as potential beneficiaries of reduced sentences, 
dismantling paramilitary leadership and financial networks, collecting voluntary statements 
from demobilized paramilitaries (both as part of the investigatory function and for 
determination of demobilized paramilitaries&#8217; compliance with the JPL), and collecting 
victims&#8217; statements, setting reparations, and identifying and searching for missing persons.   
</p>
<p>8. The National Commission of Reparation and Reconciliation (CNRR) was created to 
help guarantee victims&#8217; rights and promote reconciliation.87 It is charged with informing 
victims of their rights under the JPL process; registering them as victims; returning land 
through regional land commissions; guiding victims to legal and psychosocial counselling; 
promoting reconciliation projects; and guiding State agencies to fulfil responsibilities to 
victims. It is also charged under the JPL with drafting a public report &#8220;regarding the reasons 
why illegal armed groups started up and evolved&#8221;. This is not intended to be a 
comprehensive report and was still in progress during my mission.   
</p>
<p>9. CNRR also monitors the national reparation funds, which manage assets seized from 
paramilitaries pending forfeiture proceedings.

members of civil society appointed by the President and two civil society members selected by the

<p><b>Appendix D  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Medell&#237;n case study 
</b>1. The situation in Medell&#237;n dramatically illustrates the consequences of a failure to 
properly demobilize and reintegrate paramilitaries, the risks presented by IAGs, and the 
challenges the Government will face as it seeks to investigate and prosecute IAGs.  
</p>
<p>2. According to Government data provided, Medell&#237;n witnessed 756 homicides in 
2007, 1,045 in 2008, and 721 in 2009 between 1 January and 30 May 2010. Human rights 
officials explained that the steep increase is due to the fighting among and illegal activities 
of approximately 150&#8211;200 IAGs composed of up to 4,000 members. Many of these IAG 
members were (and continue to be) members of the <i>Oficina de Envigado</i>, an organized 
crime group that has dominated drug-trafficking in Medell&#237;n since the cartel era under 
Pablo Escobar. The <i>Oficina de Envigado</i> came to encompass two paramilitary blocs, 
<i>Bloque Cacique Nutibara</i> and <i>Bloque Heroes de Granada</i>. It also entered into criminal 
partnerships with members of local political and economic elites, including senior members 
of the military, according to human rights officials.  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Oficina de Envigado</i> was controlled by Diego Murillo Bejarano (&#8220;Don Berna&#8221;), who 
became the third in command of the AUC after its formation. He was one of the negotiators 
with the Government during demobilization talks. Bejarano was arrested in May 2005 and 
charged with the murder of a congressman. He was extradited to the United States in May 
2008 (together with 13 other paramilitary leaders who were being processed under the 
JPL). In Bejarano&#8217;s absence, members of <i>Oficina de Envigado</i> jostled for power, and 
demobilized. According to Medell&#237;n officials, 868 members of the <i>Bloque Cacique 
Nutibara</i> demobilized in November 2003, and approximately 2,000 members of the <i>Bloque 
Heroes de Granada</i> demobilized in August 2005. Only a fraction of each bloc has been 
through the JPL process. According to the Government, as of June 2009, 24 members of the 
<i>Bloque Cacique Nutibara</i> and 79 members of the <i>Bloque Heroes de Granada</i> were 
candidates for benefits under the JPL law. This effectively means that the vast majority of 
the demobilized paramilitaries in Medell&#237;n have never had to confess to crimes, or to be 
held accountable for them.  
</p>
<p>4. Despite the demobilization, the former <i>Oficina de Envigado</i> members &#8212; especially 
those at the mid-level of the organization &#8212; maintained its drug-trafficking business and 
began to expand into and corrupt other parts of the city&#8217;s economy. They did so largely 
through violence and intimidation. The <i>Oficina de Envigado</i> is now a complex mix of legal 
and illegal businesses.88 According to Medell&#237;n&#8217;s human rights officials, the <i>Oficina de 
Envigado</i> not only escaped accountability under the justice and peace process, its members 
were able to take advantage of demobilization to strengthen the group&#8217;s criminal activities. 
Impunity for former paramilitaries demobilized under the JPL has directly resulted in 
killings and increased instability.  
</p>
<p>5. Medell&#237;n has a long history of murders of and assaults and threats against human 
rights defenders. Unsurprisingly, defenders who speak out against abuses by paramilitaries 
and IAGs are subject to particular danger. The city&#8217;s human rights officials emphasized the 
continuing insecurity of the environment: defenders and local government officials who 
oppose IAGs have been threatened by telephone and e-mail, and some have had their names 
on posted or circulated lists of &#8220;targets&#8221;.

</p>
<p>6. The head of the National Police has visited Medell&#237;n to emphasize the Government&#8217;s 
concerns about the law and order situation. While this emphasis is positive, if Medell&#237;n&#8217;s 
descent into killings and criminality is to be turned around, it is imperative for the 
Government to address a key long-term cause: failures in accountability for former 
demobilized paramilitaries. It will need to expend significant resources to investigate and 
prosecute the many arms of the new Medell&#237;n IAGs. As a priority, the Government should 
also ensure adequate protection for human rights defenders and ensure that local officials 
do nothing to call their work into question or delegitimize it.
