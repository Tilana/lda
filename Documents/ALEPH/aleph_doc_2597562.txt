An updated waste management plan;  
A significant improvement in water quality supported by the latest fish inventory report; and  
A description of the water management improvements.
Orivesi Permit Extension 
 
On 8 December 2015, the Western and Inland Finland Regional State Administrative Office (“AVI”) rejected 
the  Orivesi  Environmental  Permit  application  that  had  been  submitted  in 2010.   On 7 January  2016,  the 
Company commenced proceedings through the Vaasa Administrative Court (“Court”) to appeal against the 
decision.  The mine can remain in operation under the terms of the existing permit until the appeal process 
is completed.  The Company has the right to appeal both in the lower and the upper courts.  The appeal was 
made on the basis that the Company has made significant improvements to the mine environment at Orivesi.  
The Company’s appeal is supported by:  
 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
 
The AVI’s decision to not renew the permit has also been appealed by the Centre for Economic Development, 
Transport and the Environment (“ELY Centre”) whose appeal supports the continued operation of the mine. 
 
During May 2016, the Court asked the Company to provide its responses to one statement and seven opinions 
received as a result of the appeal.  The contents of the statement and opinions vary, however a slight majority 
consider that the permit should be granted, at least for a fixed period.  The Company submitted its responses 
on 13 May 2016. 
 
Refer to Section 6 Significant Events after Period End for updates to the appeal. 
 
Fäboliden Gold Project Update 
 
On 3 June 2016, the Company submitted its Environmental Permit Application for a test mining operation at 
its  Fäboliden  Gold  Project  (“Fäboliden”)  to  the  County  Administration  Board  (“CAB”).    Test  mining  is 
anticipated to commence in 2017.  The CAB plan to commence review of the Environmental Permit Application 
in mid-August with a referral time set for 30 September 2016. 
 
The Company will continue to progress work on a new Environmental Permit Application for a full scale mining 
operation at Fäboliden.  The mining operation will have a significantly smaller environmental footprint than 
had been proposed by the previous owners.   
 
Sale of Fäboliden Land and Timber 
 
On 30 June 2016, the Company finalised the tender process to sell what equated to 32% of the land and 
41% of the timber at Fäboliden for approximately A$1.8 million.  The Company held no mining or exploration 
tenure over the areas subject to the sale, the areas located well away from the Fäboliden Gold Deposit and 
its strike extensions.   
 
Hong Kong listing 
 
As has been previously mentioned, the Company believes there is a disconnect between a listing on the ASX 
and the Company’s operations being all in the Nordic region.  The Company considers that Hong Kong may 
be an appropriate jurisdiction and continues to pursue the prospect of a Hong Kong listing.   
 
Hanhimaa Earn-In Agreement 
 
Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (“Agnico Eagle”) has continued to advance the Hanhimaa Gold Project advising 
the Company that work during the half year consisted of detailed planning for the 2016 field season, the 
main target being the Titan24 anomalies in the Kiimakuusikko area.  Agnico Eagle is earning up to a 70% 
interest in the Hanhimaa Gold Project in northern Finland with staged expenditure of €9.0 million over 9 
years.  Agnico Eagle is the manager during the earn-in period and can now withdraw at any time, having 
achieved the minimum expenditure level of €1.5 million.

DRAGON MINING LIMITED | Consolidated Interim Financial Report | Six Months Ended 30 June 2016 | Directors Report
5.  Review of Activities  
 
Operations 
 
Overview 
 
Vammala and Svartliden recorded one Lost Time Injury each during the period.  Positive safety initiatives 
introduced  at  the  Company’s  Finnish  operations  included  an  update  of  the  Crisis  Management  Protocols 
resulting in the formation of the Crisis Management Team.  The Orivesi mine also commenced use of the 
underground seismic  monitoring  system which  continuously records  micro  seismic  events  caused  by rock 
stresses.   
 
Stronger  USD  gold  prices  have  prevailed  during  the  first  half  of  2016  where,  after  opening  around 
US$1061/oz, prices traded to a half year high of US$1,310/oz.  In spite of lower gold production, the higher 
gold prices combined with managements continued effort to drive cost efficiencies across its operations have 
resulted in positive operating cashflows from activities of $4.8 million during the period (30 June 2015: $10.0 
million) which does not include proceeds from the sale of the land and timber at Fäboliden or the sale of the 
Aurion shares.
Location of Projects and Production Centres
Gold production for the half year was 18,424 ounces (30 June 2015: 26,595 ounces), comprising 14,485 
ounces (30 June 2015: 18,542 ounces) from the Vammala Production Centre (“Vammala”) and 3,939 ounces 
(30 June 2015: 8,053 ounces) from Svartliden.  Gold production was lower due to a change in mix of ores 
being processed in the Vammala production centre.  To compensate for the decrease in higher grade ore 
tonnes from the Orivesi mine while access to new stopes are being developed, production has been increased, 
but at a lower grade, from the Jokisivu mine.   
 
Total ore mined from Jokisivu was 126,753 tonnes, the highest tonnage mined from Jokisivu in a six month 
period to date.  Mining at Orivesi was hampered by difficult mining conditions restricting total ore mined to 
49,964  tonnes.  The  improvements  made  to  the  Vammala  plant  in  2015  continue  to  yield  recovery 
improvements and cost savings.  Metallurgical test work has also identified a quantity of high grade tailings 
from historical Orivesi production that can be reprocessed at Vammala.  The Company has commenced a 
study to estimate the Mineral Resource and determine the economics.  No additional permitting would be 
required.   
 
The Svartliden plant successfully processed 100% of the internal concentrate from Jokisivu and an increased 
amount of concentrate tonnes from Orivesi.  Svartliden also processed 1,352 tonnes of external concentrate 
to produce 3,939 ounces of gold.  In late May 2016, Svartliden experienced a sudden increase in copper 
levels in the Clear Water Pond and had to take measures to avoid breaching the permitted copper level in 
the effluent water.  In June 2016, the Company decided to cease processing external concentrates due to
5
DRAGON MINING LIMITED | Consolidated Interim Financial Report | Six Months Ended 30 June 2016 | Directors Report
the high leachable copper content of the concentrate and to ensure environmental compliance.   Svartliden 
will continue to process internal concentrates but the reduced volumes being processed has impacted on the 
economics of the Svartliden plant.   
 
Nevertheless, a strategic decision has been made to keep the Svartliden plant operating at below breakeven 
to ensure operational readiness for the development of Fäboliden.    
 
Advanced Projects and Exploration 
 
The Company continued to advance activities at its key projects in Finland and Sweden during the half-year 
ending  30  June  2016.    This  work  is  providing  support  for  project  evaluation,  mine  planning  and  mine 
development. 
 
Updates to the Company’s Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves were completed and announced to ASX on 
29 February 2016  and 30  March  2016 respectively.    With  Resources  and Reserves  at  all-time  highs,  the 
Company is well positioned for further growth as it enters its second decade of gold production in the Nordic 
Region.      
 
The  updates  noted  above  yielded  increases  to  the  Group’s  Measured,  Indicated  and  Inferred  Mineral 
Resources and Proved and Probable Ore Reserves.  These increases are largely attributable to the inclusion 
of the maiden estimates for the Fäboliden Gold Project, which constitutes 46% of the ounces in the total 
group Mineral Resource base and 60% of the ounces in the total group Ore Reserve base. 
 
Diamond core drilling has continued at both Orivesi and Jokisivu during the half year.  The Company drilled 
12,486.90 metres (2015 HY: 18,549.95 metres) from both surface and underground positions, yielding a 
number of significant intercepts that continue to underline the encouraging nature of the Company’s projects.    
 
During the half year period, drilling at Orivesi has been directed toward the extensions of Kutema Pipe 5 
between the 1200m and 1280m levels, with the objective of further deepening the Orivesi mine.  The initial 
results have been encouraging, see ASX Announcement 22 July 2016.  Further drilling to define the extent 
and geometry of mineralisation between these levels is in progress.  
 
At Jokisivu, results from the drilling of the Arpola deposit continue to support the existence of the depth 
extensions of this deposit.  Drilling of the Kujankallio deposit has provided additional information to improve 
confidence in the geological model, with drilling now underway to evaluate the extensions of the Kujankallio 
Hinge Zone. 
 
The  Company  evaluated  the viability  of  establishing  a  third  gold  mine  in  the southern Finland  region.   A 
positive outcome was achieved from the Pre-Feasibility level study into the development of the Kaapelinkulma 
Gold Project.  The study was based on the establishment of an open pit mining operation and the haulage of 
ore to the operational Vammala Plant to produce a high grade gold concentrate and the processing of this 
concentrate at the Svartliden Production Centre in Sweden.   
 
The  Company  also  continued  to  evaluate  developing  the  Fäboliden  Gold  Project  in  Northern  Sweden.    A 
positive  outcome  was  achieved  from  the  Pre-Feasibility  level  study  into  the  development  of  the  project, 
demonstrating a base case operation, which the Company expects to be able to further enhance through the 
refinement of operating cost estimates and improvement in process recovery. 
 
A second phase of bench scale metallurgical test work on representative material from the Fäboliden deposit, 
focused on recovery improvements has been completed.  The test work returned gold recoveries of 83%, 
higher than that obtained in earlier test work programs.  Gravity regrind tests yielded a further 3% increase 
in recovery, lifting overall recoveries to 86%.   
 
An application for an Environmental Permit to undertake a test mining campaign at Fäboliden was submitted 
during the half year, whilst preparation of an application for a new Environmental Permit for full scale mining 
at Fäboliden progressed.

DRAGON MINING LIMITED | Consolidated Interim Financial Report | Six Months Ended 30 June 2016
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
1.  Corporate Information 
 
The interim financial report of Dragon Mining Limited and its controlled entities (“consolidated entity” or the “Group”) 
for the half year ended 30 June 2016 was authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 31 
August 2016. 
 
Dragon Mining Limited is a company limited by shares that is incorporated and domiciled in Australia and whose shares 
are publicly listed on Australian Securities Exchange.  
 
2.  Basis of Preparation and Accounting Policies 
 
(a) Basis of Preparation 
 
These  general  purpose  condensed  interim  financial  statements  for  the  half  year  ended  30  June  2016  have  been 
prepared in accordance with AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Act 2001. 
 
The half year financial report does not include all notes of the type normally included within the annual financial report 
and therefore cannot be expected to provide as full an understanding of the financial performance, financial position 
and financing and investing activities of the consolidated entity as the full financial report. 
 
The half year financial report should be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 31 December 
2015 and considered together with any public announcements made by Dragon Mining Limited during the half year 
ended 30 June 2016 in accordance with the continuous disclosure requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the 
ASX Listing Rules.   
 
(b) Changes in Accounting Policy 
 
Except  as  disclosed  below,  the  accounting  policies  adopted  in  the  preparation of  the  half  year  financial  report  are 
consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 
2015. 
 
All relevant new and amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations which became applicable on 1 January 2016 
have been adopted by the Group.  These included:
AASB 2014-4 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (Amendments to AASB 
116 and AASB 138) 
AASB 1057 Application of Australian Accounting Standards 
AASB  2015-1  Amendments  to  Australian  Accounting  Standards-Annual  Improvements  to  Australian 
Accounting Standards 2012-2014 Cycle 
AASB 2015-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards-Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to AASB 
101 
AASB 2015-9 Amendments to Accounting Standards-Scope and Application Paragraphs [AASB 8, AASB 133 
& AASB 1057]
As  a  result  of  this review,  the Directors  have determined that  there  is  no  material  impact  of  the  new  and revised 
accounting  standards  and  interpretations  on  the  Company  and,  therefore,  no  material  change  is  necessary  to  the 
Company’s accounting policies.

1The Company has identified the following events which have had a significant impact on the present obligation and 
the timing of the associated economic outflows: 
 
•
In  March  2016,  the  Company  released  the  maiden  Ore  Reserve  estimate  for  Fäboliden  representing  an  initial 
mining  life  of  approximately  four  years.    The  mining  operations  at  Fäboliden  will  extend  the  operating  life  of 
Svartliden and enable ongoing rehabilitation to coincide with operating activities; and  
 
In June 2016, the County Administration Board granted the Company a permit to fill the open pit with tailings up 
to the +415 metre level.  This provides ample capacity for the development of the Fäboliden project.
Based on the probable outflow of economic resources required to settle the obligation, the Company has reversed its 
rehabilitation provision for Svartliden by A$4.5 million (net of NPV adjustments). 
 
 
10. Dividends Paid or Provided For 
 
There were no dividends paid or provided for during the period.

DRAGON MINING LIMITED | Consolidated Interim Financial Report | Six Months Ended 30 June 2016
11. Segment Reporting 
 
The  Group  has  identified  its operating segments  to  be Sweden  and  Finland,  on  the basis  of  geographical  location,

Dragon Mining Oy in Finland produced gold concentrate from the Orivesi and Jokisivu Gold Mines. During the period, 
100% of the Jokisivu concentrate was purchased by Dragon Mining (Sweden) AB.

13. Expenditure Commitments 
 
An update to the commitments disclosed in the financial report for the year ended 31 December 2015 is detailed below. 
 
Exploration commitments 
 
Due to the nature of the consolidated entity’s operations in exploring and evaluating areas of interest, it is very difficult 
to accurately forecast the nature or amount of future expenditure, although it will be necessary to incur expenditure 
in  order  to  retain  present  interests  in  mineral  tenements.    Expenditure  commitments  on  mineral  tenure  for  the 
consolidated  entity  can  be  reduced  by  selective  relinquishment  of  exploration  tenure  or  by  the  renegotiation  of 
expenditure commitments.  The approximate minimum level of exploration requirements to retain current tenements 
is detailed below.

Independent review report to the members of Dragon Mining Limited
Report on the half-year financial report
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of Dragon Mining Limited, which comprises
the statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the statement of comprehensive income,
statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the half-year ended on that date, notes
comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the
directors’ declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the company and the entities it controlled at
the half-year end or from time to time during the half-year.
Directors’ responsibility for the half-year financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the half-year financial report that
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act
2001 and for such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of
the half-year financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. We
conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review
of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether, on the
basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe that the
financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving a true and fair view
of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and its performance for the half-year
ended on that date; and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and
the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of Dragon Mining Limited and the entities it controlled
during the half-year, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the
audit of the annual financial report.
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards and
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act
2001. We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a
copy of which is included in the directors’ report.

Conclusion
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us believe
that the half-year financial report of Dragon Mining Limited is not in accordance with the Corporations Act
2001, including:
a) giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and of its
performance for the half-year ended on that date
b) complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations
Regulations 2001.
