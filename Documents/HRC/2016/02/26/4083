Strategy, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and practices 
of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomever 
committed, regardless of their motivation, as criminal and unjustifiable, and 
renewing its commitment to strengthen international cooperation to prevent and 
combat terrorism,   
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>that acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms 
and manifestations are activities aimed at the destruction of human rights,

<p><i> Reaffirming further </i>that the promotion and protection of human rights for all 
and the rule of law are essential to the fight against terrorism, and recognizing that 
effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not 
conflicting goals but are complementary and mutually reinforcing,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any 
religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group, 
</p>
<p><i> Deploring </i>the suffering caused by terrorism to the victims and their families, 
expressing its profound solidarity with them, and stressing the importance of 
providing them with assistance,

Victims of Terrorism of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, 
including its workshop of Siracusa, Italy, held on 2 and 3 December 2010, on best
