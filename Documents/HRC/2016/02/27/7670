<p><b> III. Civilian impact of remotely piloted aircraft 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>21. In January 2013, the Special Rapporteur began an inquiry into the use of remotely 
piloted aircraft, or drones, in extraterritorial lethal counter-terrorism operations, including 
in the context of asymmetrical armed conflict. The principal aims of the inquiry were: (a) to 
evaluate allegations that such operations have resulted in disproportionate levels of civilian 
casualties; (b) make recommendations concerning the duty of States to conduct independent 
and impartial investigations and to make public the results; and (c) identify the disputed 
issues of international law relevant to such operations, and to make recommendations 
aimed at promoting international consensus.  
</p>
<p>22. On 25 October, the Special Rapporteur presented an interim report to the General 
Assembly (A/68/389, hereinafter &#8220;the interim report&#8221;) which sets out a framework for 
examining the factual and legal issues relevant to his inquiry, by reference to the principles 
laid down in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.3 The present report 
should be read in conjunction with the interim report and the report to the General 
Assembly by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
(A/68/382). 
</p><p>23. On 18 December, following the presentation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interim 
report, the General Assembly adopted by consensus resolution 68/178 on the protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism. In paragraph 6 (s) of 
the resolution, States are urged to ensure that any measures taken or means employed to 
counter terrorism, including the use of remotely piloted aircraft, comply with their 
obligations under international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, human 
rights law and international humanitarian law, in particular the principles of distinction and 
proportionality.  
</p>
<p>24. In furtherance of that objective, the present report summarizes developments since 
the presentation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interim report to the General Assembly, 
including recent trends in civilian casualty rates resulting from the use of remotely piloted 
aircraft and other significant developments (sect. B below); it presents the conclusions of 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s review of 37 strikes in which civilian casualties were reportedly 
sustained (sect. C below);4 and, in it, the Special Rapporteur makes recommendations to the 
Council aimed at clarifying and promoting compliance with the relevant principles of 
international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law. The sample 
strike analysis in section C below is intended to provide a clear opportunity for the relevant 
States to fulfil their international legal obligations of transparency and accountability (as 
described in the interim report) by making public the results of their own inquiries into the 
sample strikes identified. In order to provide an up-to-date source of information on his 
continuing inquiries, the Special Rapporteur has set up a dedicated website, which reflects 
and supplements the content of his reports on remotely piloted aircraft to the General 
Assembly and the Council: unsrct-drones.com. The Special Rapporteur will continue to 
seek additional information from States on the legal justifications for the use of deadly 
force in counter-terrorism operations, as well as the justification for individual attacks. 
Subject to the consent of the State concerned, the responses received will be posted on the 
official web page of the mandate.

 See General Assembly resolution 60/288, annex, sect. IV, para. 2. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 The Special Rapporteur uses the legal standards set out in the interim report as the benchmark for the 
</p>
<p>inclusion of each strike in the present report: see paras. 32&#8211;36 below. </p>


<p><b> B. Recent developments 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Civilian casualty rates 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p>25. In the interim report the Special Rapporteur noted the assessment by the United 
Nations Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) that, up to the end of 2012, confirmed drone 
strikes appeared to have inflicted significantly lower levels of civilian casualties than aerial 
attacks carried out by other air platforms (para. 30).5 This is no longer the case. Figures for 
2013 indicate that drone strikes accounted for almost 40 per cent of the total number of 
civilian fatalities inflicted as the result of aerial attacks by pro-Government forces. In its 
2013 report, <i>Afghanistan Annual Report on Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict</i>,6 
UNAMA records 59 civilian casualties during 2013 as the result of 19 confirmed drone 
strikes (comprising 45 fatalities and 14 non-fatal injuries).7 As compared with 2012, this 
represents a threefold increase in the number of recorded civilian casualties from the use of 
drones by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). It also represents a 
significant increase in the number of civilian casualties from drone strikes as a percentage 
of the overall number of civilian casualties from aerial operations (including attacks by 
manned fixed and rotary blade aircraft).8  
</p>
<p><b>  Pakistan 
</b></p>
<p>26. In his interim report, the Special Rapporteur noted that there had been a marked 
drop in reported civilian casualties from attacks by remotely piloted aircraft in the Federally 
Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan during 2012 (both in absolute terms and as a 
percentage of overall fatalities), a trend that appeared to have continued during the first half 
of 2013 (para. 33). He welcomed, in that context, the August 2013 statement of the 
Secretary of State of the United States to the effect that there was a clearly defined timeline 
for ending drone strikes in Pakistan (para. 54).9 Figures to the end of 2013 confirm that 
there has been a significant de-escalation in the number of recorded drone strikes in 
Pakistan. The total number of reported strikes for the year was 27, down from a peak of 128 
in 2010. For the first time in nine years, there were no reports of civilian casualties during 
</p><p>2013. At the time of writing, there have been no reported drone strikes during 2014, the 
longest period without drone strikes since President Obama took office. The cessation in 
strikes coincides with peace initiatives being pursued between the Government of Pakistan 
and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5
 According to UNAMA, figures for 2012 showed that 16 civilians had been killed and 5 injured owing 
</p>
<p>to confirmed remotely piloted aircraft strikes during the course of the year.

</p>
<p>7
 In the UNAMA report, it is pointed out, in footnote 195, that &#8220;the number of civilian casualties from 
</p>
<p>drone strikes may be higher as UNAMA is not always able to confirm which type of platform was 
used during an aerial operation (fixed-wing, rotary or remotely-controlled) that resulted in civilian 
casualties&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8
 UNAMA documented 182 civilian casualties (118 deaths and 64 injured) during 2013, from a total 
</p>
<p>54 aerial operations conducted by international military forces. Putting these figures in context, aerial 
operations as a whole caused 19 per cent of civilian deaths attributed to pro-Government forces, and 2 
per cent of all civilian casualties. Of the civilians killed in aerial operations in Afghanistan, 45 per 
cent were women and children.

<p><b>  Yemen 
</b></p>
<p>27. By contrast, the frequency of reported drone strikes in Yemen has increased since 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interim report, resulting in a significant number of reported 
civilian casualties in the final weeks of 2013 (see paras. 59 and 60 below). Recent estimates 
provided by Human Rights Watch allege that, since 2009, the United States has conducted 
at least 86 lethal counter-terrorism operations, using remotely piloted aircraft and other 
means, killing up to 500 people.10 The majority of those killed is believed to have been 
individuals with a &#8220;continuous combat function&#8221; in Yemeni internal armed conflicts, and 
therefore to have been legitimate military targets under the principles of international 
humanitarian law. However, media monitoring organizations allege that between 24 and 71 
civilians have been killed in confirmed drone strikes between 2009 and 2013.11  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Other significant developments 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Yemen 
</b></p>
<p>28. During the universal periodic review of Yemen in January 2014, the Government 
delegation informed the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review that the National 
Dialogue Conference in Yemen had demanded the cessation of the use of armed drones 
(see A/HRC/26/8). The Working Group was also informed of a non-binding resolution 
passed by the Yemeni House of Representatives on 14 December 2013 calling for a ban on 
the use of armed drones in Yemen, and insisting that measures to fight terrorism should not 
harm civilians and should be based on human rights standards (ibid.).12  
</p><p>29. The Government of Yemen has informed the Special Rapporteur that the United 
States routinely seeks prior consent, on a case-by-case basis, for lethal remotely piloted 
aircraft operations on its territory through recognized channels, and that where consent is 
withheld, a strike will not go ahead. However, according to a recent report by Human 
Rights Watch, President Hadi told that organization during a meeting on 28 January 2014 
that specific drone strikes were not pre-approved, but instead such strikes were &#8220;generally 
permitted&#8221; pursuant to an agreement concluded between the United States and former 
President Abdullah Saleh, which remains binding.13 The Special Rapporteur invites the 
Government of Yemen to clarify its position in that regard. Finally, the Special Rapporteur 
thanks the Government of Yemen for agreeing in principle to receive a country visit from 
his mandate. Initially the visit was postponed at the Government&#8217;s request pending the 
conclusion of the National Dialogue Conference in 2013. Since that time, logistical and 
other concerns have prevented the planned visit from taking place. The Special Rapporteur 
takes this opportunity to affirm his commitment to visiting Yemen as soon as possible.  
</p>
<p><b>  Israel 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur attended a meeting with representatives of Israel on 
26 January 2014 in London. The meeting was convened at the request of Israel in the 
context of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s inquiries into targeted killing through the use of drones 
in counter-terrorism operations. The Government was represented by the Ambassador of

<p>Israel to the United Kingdom and the Deputy Attorney-General for International Affairs. 
During the course of an extended and informative exchange, the Special Rapporteur was 
briefed on, among other matters, the efforts made by the Israeli Air Force to avoid inflicting 
civilian loss of life, and was shown video recordings of operational measures taken for that 
purpose. The Government stressed the efforts taken by its forces in all aerial operations to 
give advanced warnings of attacks whenever possible. Referring to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s interim report (paras. 75 and 76), the Government emphasized that a standard 
of zero anticipated civilian casualties goes beyond the mandatory requirements of 
international humanitarian law and would remain unattainable whilst legitimate military 
targets, particularly in Gaza, used civilian institutions as a base for military operations. The 
Special Rapporteur has identified a number of examples of strikes in which there are 
credible allegations that civilians were killed or injured as the result of Israeli drone strikes 
in Gaza. These are set out in chapter III, section C, below. During the course of the 
meeting, the Special Rapporteur requested certain additional information from the 
Government. That information had not been received at the time of writing of the present 
report. 
</p>
<p><b>  European Union 
</b></p>
<p>31. On 25 February 2014, the European Parliament passed a resolution, by 534 votes to 
49, calling for the adoption of a common position for the European Union on the use of 
armed drones. In the resolution, the European Parliament: 
</p>
<p>(a) Concluded that &#8220;drone strikes outside a declared war by a State on the 
territory of another State without the consent of the latter or of the Security Council 
constitute a violation of international law and of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of 
that country&#8221;; expressed its &#8220;grave concern over the use of armed drones outside the 
international legal framework&#8221;; and urged the European Union &#8220;to develop an appropriate 
policy response at both European and global level which upholds human rights and 
international humanitarian law&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(b) Called upon the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, 
the member States and the Council of the European Union to &#8220;oppose and ban the practice 
of extrajudicial targeted killings&#8221;; to &#8220;ensure that member States, in conformity with their 
legal obligations, do not perpetrate unlawful targeted killings or facilitate such killings by 
other States&#8221;; and to &#8220;include armed drones in relevant European and international 
disarmament and arms control regimes&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (c) Urged the Council to adopt an European Union common position on the use 
of armed drones; 
</p>
<p>(d) Called upon the European Union &#8220;to promote greater transparency and 
accountability on the part of third countries in the use of armed drones with regard to the 
legal basis for their use and to operational responsibility, to allow for judicial review of 
drone strikes and to ensure that victims of unlawful strikes have effective access to 
remedies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Sample strike analysis 
</b></p>
<p>32. In his interim report to the General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur made specific 
recommendations aimed at strengthening compliance with the applicable legal standards on 
accountability and transparency (paras. 41&#8211;50, 78 and 80). Having regard to the duty of 
States to protect civilians in armed conflict, the Special Rapporteur concluded that, in any 
case in which there have been, or appear to have been, civilian casualties that were not 
anticipated when the attack was planned, the State responsible is under an obligation to </p>


<p>conduct a prompt, independent and impartial fact-finding inquiry and to provide a detailed 
public explanation of the results (para. 78). This obligation is triggered whenever there is a 
plausible indication from any apparently reliable source that unintended civilian casualties 
may have been sustained, including where the facts are unclear or the information is partial 
or circumstantial (whether the attack was initiated by remotely piloted aircraft or other 
means, and whether it occurred within or outside an area of active hostilities) (paras. 41&#8211;50, 
78 and 80).14 In a modest extension of the approach adopted in the Turkel Commission 
report,15 the Special Rapporteur concluded that the international human rights law principle 
of transparency applies not only to those cases in which a full criminal investigation is 
launched, but also to preliminary fact-finding inquiries. Subject to redactions on grounds of 
legitimate national security, he recommended that a full explanation should be made public 
in each case, and that this obligation ought to be viewed as an inherent part of a State&#8217;s 
legal duties of accountability under international humanitarian law and international human 
rights law.16 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur has adopted and applied this standard to a sample of 
individual strikes in which remotely piloted aircraft are alleged to have been implicated in 
the infliction of civilian casualties. Having considered the available sources, the Special 
Rapporteur has identified 30 strikes (out of a total of 37 strikes initially brought to his 
attention) in which there is a plausible indication that civilians were killed or sustained life-
threatening injuries, or in which civilian lives were put at immediate risk. With the 
assistance of a team of researchers he has sifted the available evidence to determine 
whether there is a plausible and credible allegation of civilian casualties, from apparently 
reliable sources, such as to trigger the duties of investigation and transparency. 
</p>
<p>34. The list below is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive. The criteria 
adopted for including a strike in the list are: (a) that there is an allegation emanating from 
an apparently reliable source, or from multiple independent sources, that civilians have 
been killed, seriously injured or had their lives put at immediate risk in an operation in 
which remotely piloted aircraft are alleged to have been involved; (b) that, in the absence of 
any official public explanation from the State(s) responsible, the number and/or proportion 
of civilians harmed arguably raises a reasonable suspicion that the action taken may have 
been unlawful; and (c) that there is sufficient information to identify the location, the date 
and approximate time of the incident. In those cases where it has not been possible to 
identity the victim(s) and inquire into their backgrounds, the Special Rapporteur has 
required other credible indications that the victims were, or included, civilians.  
</p>
<p>35. It is important to emphasize that the mere existence of credible allegations that 
civilians were killed or injured in these incidents does not necessarily establish any 
violation of international humanitarian law or international human rights law. Still less does 
it provide clear evidence of the commission of a war crime. Indeed, most of the relevant 
evidence which could confirm or dispel such a suspicion remains in the exclusive 
possession of the alleged perpetrator States. However, in each of the cases identified, the 
Special Rapporteur has evaluated the available sources, looking for indicia of reliability, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14
 Similarly, the European Parliament resolution on the use of armed drones of 25 February 2014 states 
</p>
<p>that, in the event of allegations of civilian deaths as a result of drone strikes, States are under the

<p>and has judged the information and evidence he has seen to be sufficient to cross the 
threshold identified in his interim report as imposing a duty on the relevant States to 
provide a public explanation of the circumstances and the justification for the use of deadly 
force. 
</p>
<p>36. In the opinion of the Special Rapporteur, the States responsible are under a present 
and continuing obligation to make public, in as much detail as possible, and subject only to 
such redactions as are strictly necessary to meet legitimate national security concerns, the 
results of any fact-finding investigations that have been conducted into the incidents 
identified in the present section of the report. If no fact-finding investigation has so far 
taken place, the Special Rapporteur considers that the States concerned are under an 
obligation to indicate this publicly, and provide an explanation. 
</p>
<p>37. By way of illustration, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to the one instance in 
which the United States has previously made public significant parts of an investigation 
report into a strike in which civilian casualties were sustained in Afghanistan. On 
21 February 2010, precision-guided munitions were discharged from a United States 
military helicopter aimed at three pick-up trucks travelling near Khotal Chowzar, a 
mountain pass that connects Daikundi with Oruzgan. The attack occurred 12 km from the 
village of Khod in the Shahidi Hassas district. Remotely piloted aircraft under the control 
of the United States were involved in assessing and determining the target of the operation. 
Up to 23 civilians were reportedly killed and 12 civilians were injured. The victims 
included eight men, one woman and three children under the age of 14. The findings of an 
investigation conducted by ISAF were partially declassified. The investigation concluded 
that the Predator drone crew involved had provided misleading situational information, that 
there was evidence of inaccurate and unprofessional reporting, and a propensity to &#8220;kinetic 
activity&#8221; (the discharge of precision-guided munitions). It recommended administrative and 
disciplinary sanctions.17 The publication of the investigation report is a model of 
accountability and transparency and sets a benchmark to be followed in other cases. In the 
opinion of the Special Rapporteur, the States implicated in the incidents set out below are 
under a duty to release the substance of all investigation reports in a level of detail 
comparable to that adopted in the case in question. 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur therefore calls on relevant States to respond to the 
allegations set out below. He has written separately to them inviting their comments. Any 
responses that are received will, subject to the consent of the State concerned, be posted on 
the official web page of the mandate.

<p>39. On 25 March 2011, precision-guided munitions were discharged at two vehicles 
travelling in the Now Zad district of Helmand province. Both vehicles were destroyed; six 
people were killed and two injured. Remotely piloted aircraft under the control of ISAF 
(United Kingdom) were involved in the operation. The United Kingdom has confirmed 
that, in addition to killing two men believed to be combatants (who were the targets of the 
attack), the operation resulted in the deaths of four non-combatants and the infliction of 
serious injuries on two further non-combatants. Contemporaneous reports suggest that the 
two identified targets were travelling in the first vehicle, and that the dead included two 
women and two children who were travelling in the following vehicle. The incident was 
investigated by the Joint Incident Assessment Team at ISAF, which concluded that the 
operation had been directed at two pick-up trucks believed to be carrying explosives and

infliction of civilian casualties through the use of remotely piloted aircraft by the United 
Kingdom in Afghanistan). 
</p><p>40. On 23 September 2012, precision-guided munitions were reportedly discharged in 
the Marawara district of Kunar province, reportedly injuring a teenage girl who was 
working in a nearby agricultural field. Remotely piloted aircraft under the control of ISAF 
(United States) are alleged to have been involved in the operation. UNAMA has reported 
that the victim later died on the way to the Asadabad public health hospital. 
</p>
<p>41. On 20 October 2012, precision-guided munitions were reportedly discharged in the 
Baraki Barak district of Logar province. Remotely piloted aircraft under the control of 
ISAF (United States) are alleged to have been involved in the operation. Four children, 
aged between 11 and 13 years were reportedly killed whilst tending livestock. Three died 
immediately and the fourth is reported to have died en route to a hospital in Kabul. ISAF 
later issued a statement indicating that it was aware of possible civilian casualties resulting 
from the operation.19 
</p>
<p>42. On 12 November 2012, precision-guided munitions were reportedly discharged in 
the Shaqti Qala area of Baraki Barak district of Logar province. Remotely piloted aircraft 
under the control of ISAF (United States) are alleged to have been involved in the 
operation. Three children, all under the age of 16, were reportedly killed whilst working in 
a field. Reports concerning the affiliations and activities of the victims suggest that all three 
were civilians. 
</p>
<p>43. On 5 December 2012, precision-guided munitions were reportedly discharged in the 
Waygal district of Nuristan province. Remotely piloted aircraft under the control of ISAF 
(United States) are alleged to have been involved in the operation. At least three non-
combatant civilians are alleged to have been killed (two adult male teachers and a child, all 
members of the same family). It has since been reported that two other children may have 
been killed in the attack. Inquiries concerning the affiliations and activities of the two adult 
victims suggest that they were civilians. 
</p>
<p>44. On 24 February 2013, precision-guided munitions reportedly struck the village of 
Meya Saheeb in the Hisarak district of Nangarhar province. Remotely piloted aircraft under 
the control of ISAF (United States) are alleged to have been involved in the operation. Five 
adult males were killed, and inquiries concerning their affiliations and activities suggest 
that at least three of them were civilians. 
</p>
<p>45. On 15 June 2013, precision-guided munitions were reportedly fired on a house in the 
Dara-i-Pech area of Nangham district in Kunar province. Remotely piloted aircraft under 
the control of ISAF (United States) are alleged to have been involved in the operation. 
Three civilians, including one woman, are reported to have been killed and at least six 
civilians, including one woman, are reported to have been injured. All the victims were 
members of the same family.

<p>combatants and ten civilians were reportedly killed in the attack, and one civilian (a 4-year-
old girl) was injured. The incident was investigated by UNAMA and is detailed in its 2013 
annual report on civilian casualties.20 According to the report, ISAF initially denied the 
possibility of civilian casualties. However, after being pressed by UNAMA to investigate 
further, ISAF officials confirmed that one woman and one child had been killed, and was 
unable to rule out the possibility of at least one further woman civilian having been killed.21 
ISAF informed UNAMA that approval of the strike was obtained from all required levels of 
ISAF and Afghan national security forces&#8217; chain of command. ISAF has not published the 
results of its investigations. The UNAMA report concludes (p. 47): 
</p>
<p>In the case of the 7 September UAV/RPA [unmanned aerial vehicle or remotely 
piloted aircraft] strike in Watapur, UNAMA raises concern about possible 
negligence of international military forces and a possible failure to take sufficient 
precautionary measures. The advanced surveillance technology, equipment and 
extensive intelligence networks used by international military forces, combined with 
operational policies oriented towards reducing harm, should provide a sufficiently 
robust framework to ensure the degree and kind of care that limits, if not eliminates, 
disproportionate collateral damage. 
</p>
<p>The apparent failure, however, of international forces to identify the presence of a 
group of women and children in a vehicle prior to engaging the vehicle with a 
UAV/RPA strike could suggest negligence. Of further concern was the apparent 
failure of international military forces to confirm the identity and/or status of the 
men accompanying the fighter targeted by international military forces.

<p>47. On 30 October 2006, precision-guided munitions were reportedly fired at a religious 
seminary in Chenagai in the Bajaur tribal region. Remotely piloted aircraft under the 
control of the United States are alleged to have been involved in the operation. Up to 80 
people were reportedly killed instantly during the attack; two more victims reportedly died 
in hospital shortly afterwards as the result of injuries sustained. It is alleged that as many as 
69 of the dead were children under 18 years of age, and that 16 of those killed were under 
the age of 13. Eyewitnesses allege that the majority of those killed had been pupils at the 
seminary and were non-combatant civilians. The identities of some of the deceased can be 
found at: unsrct-drones.com/. 
</p>
<p>48. On 23 June 2009, precision-guided munitions were reportedly discharged at a large 
funeral ceremony in Lattaka, South Waziristan, following the death of Khwaz Wali, a local 
Taliban leader, who had been killed earlier that day. Remotely piloted aircraft under the 
control of the United States are alleged to have been involved in the attack on the funeral. 
Eyewitnesses have confirmed that, whilst the mourners included active members of the 
Tehrik-i-Taliban, there were significant numbers of civilians present. Reports suggest that 
up to 83 people were killed. The estimated number of non-combatant fatalities varies 
between 18 and 50. However, credible reports indicate that 10 children and 4 tribal elders 
were reportedly among the dead. In addition, 27 people, including a number of children, 
were reportedly treated for injuries at a local hospital in Miranshah.  
</p><p>49. On 4 October 2010, precision-guided munitions reportedly struck a group of men 
who were gathered in a courtyard of a house on the outskirts of Mir Ali, North Waziristan, 
killing all of the intended targets. Two of the dead were identified as B&#252;nyamin Erdogan, a 
German national, and Dashti Shabab, a dual Iranian-German national. According to a

<p>German federal investigation, both men were engaged in paramilitary activity and had a 
&#8220;continuous combat function&#8221;22 rendering them legitimate military targets. The identity of 
the other three fatalities is unconfirmed but they are reported to have been local Pashtun 
tribesmen. Remotely piloted aircraft under the control of the United States are alleged to 
have been involved in the operation. Three other men, including Emrah Erdogan, a German 
national, survived the attack. Two women, both of whom were pregnant, and a 5-year-old 
boy, also survived. Emrah Erdogan has since been charged with terrorism offences in 
Germany. The Special Rapporteur considers a number of those present at the time of the 
attack to have enjoyed protected civilian status. A detailed account of the strike, together 
with a forensic reconstruction provided to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s inquiry by one of the 
eyewitnesses, is available at: unsrct-drones.com/. The Special Rapporteur notes that the 
targeted individuals reportedly had affiliations with non-State armed groups. He also notes 
the precision nature of the strike. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur considers that, since 
the lives of apparent non-combatant civilians were lost or put at serious risk, the strike 
satisfies the criteria identified in paragraph 34 above. 
</p>
<p>50. On 17 March 2011, precision-guided munitions were reportedly fired at a tribal 
council meeting (jirga) taking place in an open space adjacent to the Nomada bus depot in 
Datta Khel, North Waziristan. Remotely piloted aircraft under the control of the United 
States are alleged to have been involved in the operation. The meeting had reportedly been 
convened for the purpose of resolving disputed claims concerning the rights to a chromite 
mine. The local authorities had been notified in advance of the meeting, which had begun 
the previous day. According to custom, tribal elders (maliks) were seated in two circular 
formations. Witness reports and satellite imagery analysis suggest that at least two strikes 
were conducted in very short succession, targeting both groups of men. The most reliable 
estimates suggest that 43 people were killed in the attack and 14 injured. The 
overwhelming majority of those killed or injured were reportedly civilians, and included 
tribal elders and government officials. The confirmed identities of some of the dead, 
together with a forensic reconstruction of the attack, are available at: unsrct-drones.com/. 
</p>
<p>51. On 15 June 2011, precision-guided munitions were reportedly fired at a car 
travelling along the main road between Miranshah and Sirkot in North Waziristan. The 
strike occurred six miles east of Miranshah. Remotely piloted aircraft under the control of 
the United States are alleged to have been involved in the operation. Five of the dead were 
confirmed to be Akram Shah, Atiq-ur-Rehman, Irshad Khan, Sherzada and Umar Khan. 
They were reportedly travelling in a vehicle belonging to Akram Shah, who was employed 
as a driver by the Pakistani Water and Power Development Authority. Inquiries into the 
affiliations and activities of the victims suggest that all of them were civilians.  
</p>
<p>52. On 31 October 2011, precision-guided munitions reportedly struck a car and a house 
in the Norak area of North Waziristan, killing four people. Remotely piloted aircraft under 
the control of the United States are alleged to have been involved in the operation. Two of 
the dead were confirmed to be Tariq Aziz and Waheed Ullah, two teenagers who were 
travelling in the vehicle to collect other members of the local football team with whom they 
played. Inquiries into the affiliations and activities of the two boys strongly suggest that 
they were both civilians. The affiliations of the other two victims are unknown.

<p>53. On 6 July 2012, precision-guided munitions were reportedly discharged in Zowi 
Sidgi village in North Waziristan. Remotely piloted aircraft under the control of the United 
States are alleged to have been involved in the operation. The first missiles reportedly 
struck a tent in which a group of labourers had gathered at the end of their working day, 
killing eight of the occupants. A second strike reportedly occurred shortly afterwards,

<p>54. On 24 October 2012, precision-guided munitions reportedly struck an area of 
agricultural land in Ghundi Khala village in North Waziristan. Remotely piloted aircraft 
under the control of the United States are alleged to have been involved in the operation. 
The sole victim, a 68-year-old woman named Manama Bibi, was killed instantly. 
Eyewitness reports from members of her family indicate that at the time of the attack the 
victim was picking vegetables, and was in an isolated position in the middle of a field, 
some distance away from the nearest road or building. Inquiries into her affiliations and 
activities suggest that she was a civilian. In October 2013, Amnesty International reported 
the results of field research into this incident.24

<p>55. On 14 July 2011, munitions were reportedly launched at a police station in the town 
of Al-Wade&#8217;a in Abyan province. Aircraft under the control of either the United States or 
Yemen are alleged to have been involved in the operation. The evidence is currently 
equivocal as to whether the air platforms used were manned or unmanned. Reports suggest 
that the police station had been taken over by members of Al-Qaida, but that there were 
also significant numbers of civilians present at the location. Unconfirmed estimates put the 
total number of people killed at up to 50, of whom approximately 30 are alleged to have 
been civilians. The Special Rapporteur notes that the targeted individuals were reportedly 
engaged in military activities. Nonetheless, he considers that since the lives of apparent 
non-combatant civilians were lost in the attack it satisfies the criteria identified in paragraph 
34 above. 
</p>
<p>56. On 14 October 2011, precision-guided munitions were launched at an outdoor 
location in Azzan in Shawba province. Remotely piloted aircraft under the control of the 
United States were involved in the operation. At least six, and possibly up to nine, people 
were killed in the attack, including Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, a 16-year-old United States 
citizen and a number of his cousins. Inquiries suggest that some, if not all, of those killed 
were civilians. On 22 May 2013, the United States Attorney General, in a letter to the 
Chairman of the United States Senate Judiciary Committee,25 formally acknowledged that 
Abdulrahman al-Awlaki had been killed in a United States counter-terrorism operation, 
indicating that he had not been a specific target of the attack, but not otherwise explaining 
his death or specifying any other legitimate military target for the operation.

<p>57. On 15 May 2012, munitions reportedly struck two buildings in the town of Ja&#8217;ar in 
Abyan province. Aircraft under the control of either the United States or Yemen are alleged 
to have been involved in the operation. The evidence is currently equivocal as to whether 
the air platforms used were manned or unmanned. The first strike reportedly hit and 
destroyed the houses of Nuweir al-Arshani and his neighbour Muhammed Salih Abdullah 
al-Amri. Nuweir al-Arshani is said to have been killed instantly and there were a number of 
other reported casualties as a result of the initial attack. Shortly afterwards, a second strike 
is alleged to have occurred, killing and injuring civilians who had gathered in the street 
nearby. Estimates suggest that at least 14 named civilians were killed in the attack,

</p><p>58. On 29 August 2012, precision-guided munitions were reportedly targeted at and 
killed a group of five men gathered in open space behind a mosque in the village of 
Khashamir in Hadramout province. Remotely piloted aircraft under the control of the 
United States are alleged to have been involved in the operation. Three of the deceased 
were reportedly members of Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. The evidence, however, 
strongly suggests that the other two men were civilians. One of the men killed in the attack 
was Salem Ben Ahmed Ben Salim Ali Jaber, an imam of the al-Mutadharirin mosque and 
an outspoken opponent of Al-Qaida in the Arab Peninsula. The other was Walid Abhallah 
Abdelhamud Ben Ali Jaber, a relative of the imam and a local traffic policeman. Inquiries 
into the affiliations and activities of these two victims strongly suggest that both men were 
civilians. In October 2013, Human Rights Watch reported the results of field research into 
this incident.26 The Special Rapporteur notes that the targeted individuals who were with 
Salem Ben Ahmed Ben Salim Ali Jaber and Walid Abhallah Abdelhamud Ben Ali Jaber 
were reportedly engaged in military activities, and he notes the precision nature of the 
attack. Nonetheless, he considers that, since two civilians were also killed in the attack, it 
merits investigation and satisfies the criteria identified in paragraph 34 above. 
</p>
<p>59. On 2 September 2012, precision-guided munitions were fired at a vehicle that was 
being used as a civilian shuttle bus in the vicinity of Rad&#8217;a in the Walad Rabi&#8217; district of 
Al-Bayda province. The attack reportedly occurred whilst the vehicle was stationary at the 
intersection of two roads leading to the villages of Sabool and Manasseh. Aircraft under the 
control of the United States are alleged to have been involved in the operation. The 
evidence is currently equivocal as to whether the air platforms used were manned or 
unmanned. Eleven civilians, including three children and a pregnant woman, were reported 
to have been killed instantly, and a twelfth is reported to have died as the result of his 
injuries shortly after the attack. Inquiries into the affiliations and activities of the victims 
suggest that all of those killed were civilians. In October 2013, Human Rights Watch 
reported the results of field research into this incident.27

<p>60. On 12 December 2013, precision-guided munitions were reportedly fired at a 
convoy of vehicles making their way to a wedding celebration outside the city of Rad&#8217;a in 
Al-Bayda province. Remotely piloted aircraft under the control of the United States are 
alleged to have been involved in the operation. At least 12, and possibly as many as 15, 
individuals were reportedly killed, and at least 10 other individuals sustained non-fatal 
injuries, including the bride. Initial reports suggest that the majority of the victims may 
have been civilians, although there are indications that members of Al-Qaida in the Arabian 
Peninsula may have been the targets and were among the dead. The attacks were 
condemned in a joint statement issued on 26 December 2013 by the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.28 In February 2014, Human

<p><b>  Somalia 
</b></p>
<p>61. The information that was provided to the Special Rapporteur concerning the use of 
remotely piloted aircraft in Somalia was sparse. This appears to be due, at least in part, to 
the security situation on the ground, which has severely limited access to certain parts of 
the country by the media and has imposed significant constraints on reliable independent 
reporting. The Special Rapporteur has examined information concerning a number of 
specific strikes, but has concluded that only one of the incidents examined met the criteria 
set out in paragraph 34 above. That is not to be taken to imply that the level of civilian 
deaths in Somalia as the result of the use of remotely piloted aircraft is lower or higher than 
elsewhere. It merely confirms that there was very little reliable independent evidence of 
civilian casualties in the limited number of strikes in Somalia that have been brought to the 
attention of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>62. On 24 February 2012, precision-guided munitions hit a convoy of vehicles in an area 
in the Lower Shabelle region, approximately 60 km south of Mogadishu. Remotely piloted 
aircraft under the control of the United States are alleged to have been involved in the 
operation. Reports indicate between four and seven fatalities in the strike, including 
Mohamed Sakr, a dual Egyptian-British national whose British citizenship had been 
revoked in 2010 on suspicion of his involvement in terrorism associated with Al Shabaab. 
Sources conflict on the number and identity of the deceased. However, one witness has 
identified Maxamed Abdullahi, a local tribesman, camel-herdsman and mediator, as having 
been among the dead. Inquiries suggest that he was a civilian.

<p>63. On 27 December 2008, precision-guided munitions reportedly struck an outdoor 
location on a street opposite the Gaza Technical College in Gaza City. Remotely piloted 
aircraft under the control of Israel are alleged to have been involved in the operation. 
Twelve people were confirmed to have been killed in the strike.30 The confirmed identities 
of the deceased can be found at: unsrct-drones.com/. Reports concerning the affiliations and 
activities of the victims suggest that all but one were civilians. Nine of those killed were 
reportedly students at the college. Human Rights Watch and B&#8217;Tselem have published the 
results of field research into this incident.31 The Special Rapporteur understands that the 
competent Israeli authorities investigated the incident, but concluded that there was no 
evidence warranting criminal charges. The details of the investigation, and the reason for its 
conclusion, have not been made public.

<p>64. On 4 January 2009, precision-guided munitions reportedly struck a house in Gaza 
City killing two young people. Remotely piloted aircraft under the control of Israel are 
alleged to have been involved in the operation. The deceased were named as Mahmud 
Khaled &#8216;Alayyan al-Masharawi (aged 12) and Ahmad Khader Diyab Subayh (aged 17).

<p>people. Remotely piloted aircraft under the control of Israel are alleged to have been 
involved in the operation. The deceased were a father, his 12-year-old daughter, and his 19-
year-old son. All three were reportedly picking spearmint at the time of the attack. 
Investigations conducted by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights indicate that all three victims were civilians; that no warnings were issued to 
residents prior to the attack; and that no militant activities were being carried out in the 
location (A/HRC/22/35/Add.1, para. 13). 
</p><p>69. On 21 November 2012, precision-guided munitions struck an olive farm east of 
Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, killing two people and injuring a third. Remotely 
piloted aircraft under the control of Israel are alleged to have been involved in the 
operation. The deceased were named as Ibrahim Abu Nasser (84 years old) and Amira Abu 
Nasser (his 14-year-old granddaughter). Mohamed Abu Nasser (aged 42) sustained non-
fatal injuries in the attack. In February 2013, Human Rights Watch published the results of 
field research into this incident.36 Investigations conducted by the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights indicate that all three victims were civilians; 
that they were working on the farm at the time of the attack; that no warnings were issued 
to residents prior to the attack; and that no militant activities were being carried out in the 
location (ibid.).

<p><b> D. Achieving a consensus on the applicable legal principles 
</b></p>
<p>70. In his interim report to the General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur identified a 
number of legal issues on which there is currently no clear international consensus, or 
where current practices and interpretations appear to challenge established legal norms 
(paras. 51&#8211;76). Legal uncertainty in relation to the interpretation and application of the core 
principles of international law governing the use of deadly force in counter-terrorism 
operations leaves dangerous latitude for differences of practice by States. This runs counter 
to the obligation identified in paragraph 6 (s) of General Assembly resolution 68/178  (see 
para. 23 above); fails to provide adequate protection for the right to life; poses a threat to 
the international legal order; and runs the risk of undermining international peace and 
security. 
</p>
<p>71. There is thus an urgent and imperative need to reach a consensus between States on, 
inter alia, the following issues: 
</p>
<p>(a) Does the international law principle of self-defence entitle a State to engage 
in non-consensual lethal counter-terrorism operations on the territory of another State 
against a non-State armed group that poses a direct and immediate threat of attack, even 
when the armed group concerned has no operational connection to its host State? If so, 
under what conditions does such a right of self-defence arise? Does such a right arise where 
the territorial State is judged to be unable or unwilling to prevent the threat from 
materializing? If so, what are the criteria for determining &#8220;unwillingness&#8221; or &#8220;inability&#8221; to 
act?37 
</p>
<p>(b) Is the international law principle of self-defence confined to situations in 
which an armed attack has already taken place, or does it entitle a State to carry out pre-
emptive military operations against a non-State armed group on the territory of another 
</p>
<p>

<p>at www.hrw.org/news/2012/02/12/israel-gaza-airstrikes-violated-laws-war. 
 
</p>
<p>37
 For a discussion of the issues, see the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interim report to the General Assembly, 
</p>
<p>A/68/389, paras. 55 and 56; and the report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, A/68/382, paras. 88&#8211;92. </p>


<p>State, without the territorial State&#8217;s consent, where it judges that there is an imminent risk 
of attack to its own interests? If so, how is imminence to be defined?38 
</p>
<p>(c) Does the international humanitarian law test of intensity of hostilities (which 
is one of the criteria determining whether a non-international armed conflict exists) require 
an assessment of the severity and frequency of armed attacks occurring within defined 
geographical boundaries? In applying the intensity test to a non-State armed group 
operating transnationally, is it legitimate to aggregate armed attacks occurring in 
geographically diverse locations in order to determine whether, taken as a whole, they cross 
the intensity threshold so as to amount to a non-international armed conflict? If it is 
possible for a State to be engaged in a non-international armed conflict with a non-State 
armed group operating transnationally, does this imply that a non-international armed 
conflict can exist which has no finite territorial boundaries?39 
</p>
<p>(d) Does international humanitarian law permit the targeting of persons directly 
participating in hostilities who are located in a non-belligerent State and, if so, in what 
circumstances?40 
</p>
<p>(e) Do the pattern and frequency of the armed attacks currently being perpetrated 
by Al-Qaida, and the various affiliate organizations in different parts of the world that claim 
allegiance to Al-Qaida, satisfy (or continue to satisfy) the criteria of organization and 
intensity required under international humanitarian law to qualify as a state of armed 
conflict?41 
</p>
<p>(f) Assuming that a non-international armed conflict exists, does the test of 
&#8220;continuous combat function&#8221;, as elaborated by the International Committee of the Red 
Cross for determining whether a person is a &#8220;member&#8221; of an armed group (such that that 
person may be targeted with lethal force at any time) reflect customary international law? If 
not, what is the correct test?42 
</p>
<p>(g) Does the guidance promulgated by the International Committee of the Red 
Cross for &#8220;direct participation in hostilities&#8221; reflect customary international law? In 
particular, does an individual who has participated in hostilities cease to be targetable 
during a pause in his or her active involvement? Does providing accommodation, food, 
financing, recruitment or logistical support amount to &#8220;direct participation in hostilities&#8221; for 
targeting purposes?43 
</p>
<p>(h) In the context of non-international armed conflict, when (and under what 
circumstances) does international humanitarian law impose an obligation to capture rather 
than kill a legitimate military target where this is feasible?44 
</p><p>72. The Special Rapporteur invites Member States to express their views on these 
questions prior to the twenty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council and (subject to

</p><p>73. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Council take effective steps, by means 
of an appropriate resolution aimed at: </p>
<p>&#8226; Urging all States to ensure that any measures taken to counter terrorism, including 
the use of remotely piloted aircraft, comply with their obligations under international 
law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, in 
particular the principles of precaution, distinction and proportionality; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Urging all States to ensure that, in any case in which there is a plausible indication 
from any apparently reliable source that civilians have been killed or injured in a 
counter-terrorism operation, including through the use of remotely piloted aircraft, 
the relevant authorities conduct a prompt, independent and impartial fact-finding 
inquiry, and provide a detailed public explanation; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Urging all States that use remotely piloted aircraft for lethal counter-terrorism 
operations, and all States on whose territory such operations occur, to clarify their 
position on the legal and factual issues raised in the present report and the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s interim report to the General Assembly (A/68/389); to declassify, to 
the maximum extent possible, information relevant to lethal extraterritorial counter-
terrorism operations; to make public the results of all fact-finding investigations into 
alleged civilian casualties resulting from such operations; and to release their own 
data on the level of civilian casualties inflicted through the use of remotely piloted 
aircraft, together with information on the evaluation methodology used. 
</p>
<p>74. Further, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Council convene an interactive 
panel discussion of experts at its twenty-seventh session to further deliberate on the issues 
raised in the present report; and mandate the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to submit a summary of the deliberations of the panel 
discussion to the Council at its twenty-eighth session. </p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur: </b></p>
<p><b>(a) Calls upon the States identified in chapter III, section C, of the present 
report to disclose the results of any fact-finding inquiries into the alleged incidents 
listed therein, or to explain why no such inquiries have been made; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Calls upon the States on whose territory those strikes reportedly took 
place to provide as much information as possible in connection with those strikes; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Encourages all States to respond to his requests for clarification of their 
position in relation to the questions raised in paragraph 71 of the present report. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Recommends that the Council adopt a resolution phrased in the terms 
outlined in paragraphs 73 and 74 of the present report.
