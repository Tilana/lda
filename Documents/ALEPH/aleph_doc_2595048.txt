Notes to Condensed Financial Statements
(unaudited)
Note 1 – Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies
Unaudited Interim Financial Information
Infinity Energy Resources, Inc. (collectively, “we,” “ours,” “us,” “Infinity” or the “Company”) has
prepared the accompanying financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for interim financial reporting. These financial
statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments consisting of normal
recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our balance sheets,
statements of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. Operating results for the
periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2016 due
to various factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States (“GAAP”) have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
and accompanying notes in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC.
Nature of Operations
The Company is engaged in the exploration of potential oil and gas resources in the Perlas and
Tyra concession blocks offshore Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea (the “Nicaraguan
Concessions” or “Concessions”), which contain a total of approximately 1.4 million acres. The
Company sold its wholly-owned subsidiary Infinity Oil and Gas of Texas, Inc. in 2012 and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Infinity Oil and Gas of Wyoming, Inc., was administratively dissolved in
2009.
The Company has been pursuing exploration and development of the Nicaraguan Concessions,
which represents its principal asset and only exploration and development project. On March 5,
2009 Infinity signed the contracts relating to its Nicaraguan Concessions. Infinity has conducted
activities to develop geological information from the processing and evaluation of newly acquired
and existing 2-D seismic data that was acquired for the Nicaraguan Concessions. Infinity has
conducted activities to develop geological information from the processing and evaluation of 2-D
seismic data that was acquired for the Nicaraguan Concessions. The Company has identified
multiple sites for exploratory drilling and is planning the initial exploratory well on the Perlas
Block in order to determine the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves, subject to receipt
from the Nicaraguan government of authorizations for the drilling of up to five wells, financing and
satisfaction of other conditions. In order to meet its obligations under the Perlas Block of the
Nicaraguan Concession, the Company has to drill its initial exploratory well during 2016 or risk
being in default and losing its rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions. The work plan on the
Tyra block now requires the Company to shoot additional seismic prior to the commencement of
exploratory drilling. The Company is seeking a waiver of the additional seismic mapping on the
Tyra Block and extension of time to complete its initial well from the Nicaraguan government.
There can be no assurance whether it will be able to obtain such waiver of the requirements. The
current environment for oil and gas development projects, especially discoveries in otherwise
undeveloped regions of the world, is very challenging given the depressed commodity prices for
oil and gas products and the resulting industry-wide reduction in capital expenditure budgets for
exploration and development projects. There can be no assurance whether the Company will be
able to obtain adequate financing to fund the exploration and development of its Nicaraguan
projects.
On May 7, 2015 the Company completed the private placement (the “May 2015 Private
Placement”) of a $12.0 million principal amount Secured Convertible Note (the “Note”) and a
common stock purchase warrant to purchase 1,800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock
(the “Warrant”) with an institutional investor (the “Investor”). At the closing, the Investor acquired
the Note by paying $450,000 in cash and issuing a promissory note, secured by cash, with a
principal amount of $9,550,000 (the “Investor Note”). Assuming all amounts payable to the
Company under the Investor Note are paid, the May 2015 Private Placement will result in gross
proceeds of $10.0 million before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the
transaction, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Company will receive the
remaining cash proceeds upon each voluntary or mandatory prepayment of the Investor Note.
The Investor may, at its option and at any time, voluntarily prepay the Investor Note, in whole or in
part. As of June 30, 2016 an additional $60,000 was funded under the Investor Note for a total of
$510,000 advanced to the Company.
7
The Investor must prepay the Investor Note, in whole or in part, upon the occurrence of one or
more mandatory prepayment events. These include (i) the Investor’s conversion of the Note into
shares of common stock upon which the Investor will be required to prepay the Investor Note, on
a dollar-for-dollar basis, for each subsequent conversion of the Note and (ii) the Company’s
delivering a mandatory prepayment notice to the Investor after it has received governmental
authorizations from the Nicaraguan authorities necessary to commence drilling on at least five
sites within the Concessions and the receipt of forbearance or similar agreements relative to its
general creditors, among other conditions.
The Note matures on the three-year anniversary of its issuance, bears interest at 8% per annum,
and is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into shares of the Company’s common
stock at $5.00 per share (the “Conversion Price”). As a part of the May 2015 Private Placement,
the Company issued a Warrant to the Investor giving it the right to purchase up to an aggregate of
1,800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share. The
Warrant is exercisable commencing six months from the date of issuance for a period of seven
years from the date of issuance. The Note ranks senior to the Company’s existing and future
indebtedness and is secured by all of the assets of the Company, excluding the Concessions.
In addition, the Company continues to seek offers from industry operators and other third parties
for interests in the acreage in the Nicaraguan Concessions in exchange for cash and a carried
interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement.
Going Concern
As reflected in the accompanying statements of operations, the Company has had a history of
losses. In addition, the Company has a significant working capital deficit and is currently
experiencing substantial liquidity issues.
The Company has relied on raising debt and equity capital in recent years in order to fund its
ongoing maintenance/expenditure obligations under the Nicaraguan Concession, for its day-to-
day operations and its corporate overhead since it has generated no operating revenues or cash
flows in recent history. The $1.0 million December 2013 Note (See Note 3) matured in April 2016
and is currently in technical default. The Company is seeking an extension of the maturity date;
however there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such extension or what the final
terms will be if the lender agrees to such extension.
The Company is in Sub-Period 3 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concession for both
Perlas and Tyra as of June 30, 2016. Sub-Period 3 of the Nicaraguan Concessions requires the
drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 and the shooting of
additional seismic on the Tyra Block. The Company is in process of identifying at least one
potential drilling site on the Perlas Block as required in Sub-Period 3 and will have to perform
supplemental EIA work prior to requesting and receiving the permit to drill from the Nicaraguan
government. The work plan on the Tyra block for Sub-Period 3 requires the Company to shoot
additional seismic, which is estimated to cost approximately $2,500,000 prior to the
commencement of exploratory drilling. The Company is seeking a waiver of the additional
seismic mapping on the Tyra Block and extension of time to complete its initial well from the
Nicaraguan government. There can be no assurance whether it will be able to obtain a waiver of
the requirements.
In accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company has previously
provided the Ministry of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for
Perlas (expired March 2014) and $408,450 for Tyra (expired September 2014). The Company
has also made all required expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training
programs and as “area fees,” for each respective year for 2010 through 2015. In accordance with
the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company must provide the Ministry of Energy with
the required letters of credit in the amounts which total $1,356,227 for the Perlas block and
$278,450 for the Tyra block for exploration requirements on the leases as required by the
Nicaraguan Concessions, to replace the expired letters of credit. The minimum cash
requirements to maintain and comply with the minimum work program as defined in the
Nicaraguan Concessions for the next twelve-month period will be approximately $5,500,000 for
the Perlas Block, which includes all costs to prepare for and drill the initial exploratory well, and
$280,000 for the Tyra Block, assuming the waiver is granted regarding the seismic mapping. If
such waiver is not granted, the Company estimates it will require approximately $2,500,000 for
the seismic mapping. Finally, the Company estimates it will need approximately $300,000 to
prepare and submit an environmental supplement to the Nicaraguan government to identify and
receive authorization to drill up to five wells in the Concessions.
8
If the Company does not receive the funding anticipated under its May 2015 Private Placement, it
must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital from other sources in the immediate
future in order to fund: (1) the required letters of credit to the Nicaraguan Government; (2) the
drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions
during 2016; (3) the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block of the Nicaraguan
Concessions should it be unable to negotiate a waiver of such requirement from the Nicaraguan
government; (4) the payment of normal day-to-day operations and corporate overhead; and (5)
the payment of outstanding debt and other financial obligations as they become due including
the $1.0 million December 2013 Note which currently is in technical default. These are
substantial operational and financial issues that must be successfully addressed during 2016 or
the Company’s ability to satisfy the conditions necessary to maintain its Nicaragua Concessions
will be in significant doubt. The Company is actively seeking new outside sources of debt and
equity capital in addition to the May 2015 Private Placement in order to fund the substantial
needs enumerated above; however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such
capital or obtain it on favorable terms or within the timeframe necessary to cure the technical
defaults existing on the Nicaraguan Concessions or to meet its ongoing requirements relative to
drilling the exploratory wells. The current environment for oil and gas development projects,
especially discoveries in otherwise undeveloped regions of the world, is very challenging given
the depressed commodity prices for oil and gas products, and the resulting industry-wide
reduction in capital expenditure budgets for exploration and development projects. These may
provide substantial impediments for the Company and its ability to obtain adequate financing to
fund the exploration and development of its Nicaraguan projects.
Due to the uncertainties related to these matters, there exists substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the
amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.
Management Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant
estimates with regard to the financial statements include the estimated carrying value of
unproved properties, the estimated fair value of derivative liabilities, secured convertible note
payable, stock-based awards and overriding royalty interests, and the realization of deferred tax
assets.
Oil and Gas Properties
Unproved properties are assessed periodically (at least annually) to ascertain whether
impairment has occurred. Unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are
assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties, the holding period
of the properties, geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties, and estimated
discounted future net cash flows from the properties. Estimated discounted future net cash flows
are based on discounted future net revenues associated with probable and possible reserves,
risk adjusted as appropriate. Where it is not practicable to assess individually the amount of
impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant, such properties are
grouped for purposes of assessing impairment. The amount of impairment assessed is deducted
from the costs to be amortized, and reported as a period expense when the impairment is
recognized. All unproved property costs as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 relate to
the Nicaraguan Concessions. In assessing the unproved property costs for impairment, the
Company takes into consideration various information including: i) the terms of the Concessions,
ii) the status of the Company’s compliance with the Nicaraguan Concessions’ requirements, iii)
the ongoing evaluation of the seismic data, iv) the commodity prices for oil and gas products, v)
the overall environment related to oil and gas exploration and development projects for unproven
targets in unproven regions of the world, vi) the availability of financing for financial and strategic
partners, and vii) other factors that would impact the viability of a significant long-term oil and gas
exploration and development project.
9
The current environment for oil and gas development projects, especially discoveries in
otherwise undeveloped regions of the world, is very challenging given the depressed commodity
prices for oil and gas products and the resulting industry-wide reduction in capital expenditure
budgets for exploration and development projects. These may provide substantial impediments
for the Company and its ability to obtain adequate financing to fund the exploration and
development of its Nicaraguan projects. The Company has performed its impairment tests as of
December 31, 2015 and has concluded that a full impairment reserve should be provided on the
costs capitalized for the Nicaraguan Concessions oil and gas properties. All costs related to the
Nicaraguan Concessions from December 31, 2015 through June 30, 2016 have been charged to
operating expenses as incurred.
Concentrations
The Company’s business plan consists of developing the Nicaraguan Concessions and it
expects to be active in Nicaragua for the foreseeable future, given sufficient capital. The political
climate in Nicaragua could become unstable and subject to radical change over a short period of
time. In the event of a significant negative change in political and economic stability in the vicinity
of the Nicaraguan Concessions or of the inability of the Company to obtain sufficient financing,
the Company might be forced to abandon or suspend its efforts and its rights under its
Nicaraguan Concessions.
Derivative Instruments
The Company accounts for derivative instruments or hedging activities under the provisions of
ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging. ASC 815 requires the Company to record derivative
instruments at their fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in
the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions
of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss)
and are recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings.
Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges, if any, are recognized in
earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment are
recognized in earnings.
The purpose of hedging is to provide a measure of stability to the Company’s cash flows in an
environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage the exposure to commodity price risk.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and during the periods then ended, the Company
had no oil and natural gas derivative arrangements outstanding.
As a result of certain terms, conditions and features included in certain common stock purchase
warrants issued by the Company (Notes 2, 3 and 6), those warrants are required to be accounted
for as derivatives at estimated fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in operations.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method
requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between financial accounting bases and tax bases of
assets and liabilities. The tax benefits of tax loss carryforwards and other deferred taxes are
recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses the utilization of such assets to be
more likely than not. Management routinely assesses the realizability of the Company’s deferred
income tax assets, and a valuation allowance is recognized if it is determined that deferred
income tax assets may not be fully utilized in future periods. Management considers future
taxable earnings in making such assessments. Numerous judgments and assumptions are
inherent in the determination of future taxable earnings, including such factors as future operating
conditions. When the future utilization of some portion of the deferred tax asset is determined not
to be more likely than not, a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the recorded deferred tax
asset. When the Company can project that a portion of the deferred tax asset can be realized
through application of a portion of tax loss carryforward, the Company will record that utilization
as a deferred tax benefit and recognize a deferred tax asset in the same amount. There can be
no assurance that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the Company
to adjust its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance in a future period. The Company
recognized a deferred tax asset, net of valuation allowance, of $-0- at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015.
10
The Company is potentially subject to taxation in many jurisdictions, and the calculation of
income tax liabilities (if any) involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex
income tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. It recognizes certain income tax
positions that meet a more-likely-than not recognition threshold. If the Company ultimately
determines that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary, it will reverse the liability and
recognize an income tax benefit. No liability for unrecognized tax benefit was recorded as of
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company records estimated future asset retirement obligations pursuant to the provisions of
ASC 410. ASC 410 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation in the period in which it is incurred with a corresponding increase in the carrying
amount of the related long-lived asset. Subsequent to initial measurement, the asset retirement
liability is required to be accreted each period. The Company’s asset retirement obligations
consist of costs related to the plugging of wells, the removal of facilities and equipment, and site
restoration on oil and gas properties. Capitalized costs are depleted as a component of the full
cost pool using the units of production method. Although the Company had divested all of its
domestic oil properties that contain operating and abandoned wells as of June 30, 2016, the
Company may have obligations related to the divestiture of certain abandoned non-producing
domestic leasehold properties should the new owner not perform its obligations to reclaim
abandoned wells in a timely manner. Management believes the Company has been relieved
from asset retirement obligation related to Infinity-Texas because of the sale of its Texas oil and
gas properties in 2011 and its sale of 100% of the stock in Infinity-Texas in 2012. The Company
has recognized an additional liability of $734,897 related to its former Texas oil and gas
producing properties (included in asset retirement obligations) to recognize the potential
personal liability of the Company and its officers for the Infinity-Texas oil and gas properties
should the new owner not perform its obligations to reclaim abandoned wells in a timely manner.
In addition, management believes the Company has been relieved from asset retirement
obligations related to Infinity-Wyoming because of the sale of its Wyoming and Colorado oil and
gas properties in 2008; however, the Company has recognized an additional liability of $981,106
related to its former Wyoming and Colorado oil and gas producing properties (included in asset
retirement obligations) to recognize the potential liability of the Company and its officers should
the new owner not perform its obligations to reclaim abandoned wells in a timely manner.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities and short term notes represent the estimated fair value due to the short-term nature of
the accounts.
The carrying value of the Company’s debt under its line-of-credit with related party represents its
estimated fair value due to its short-term nature, its rate of interest, associated fees and expenses
and initially recorded discount.
In accordance with ASC Topic 820 — Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”),
the Company utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets and
liabilities. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable assets, liabilities or a group of assets or liabilities,
such as a business.
ASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to
measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three
levels:
●Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
    
 ●Level 2 — Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices in active markets for
similar assets or liabilities).
    
 ●Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in
determining the fair value.
11
The estimated fair value of the Company’s Note and various derivative liabilities, which are
related to detachable warrants issued in connection with various notes payable, were estimated
using a closed-ended option pricing model utilizing assumptions related to the contractual term of
the instruments, estimated volatility of the price of the Company’s common stock, interest rates,
the probability of both the downward adjustment of the exercise price and the upward adjustment
to the number of warrants as provided by the warrant agreement terms and non-performance risk
factors, among other items. The fair values for the warrant derivatives as of and June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 were classified under the fair value hierarchy as Level 3.
The following table represents the Company’s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

There were no changes in valuation techniques or reclassifications of fair value measurements
between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the periods ended June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Net Income (Loss) per Share
Pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, basic net income (loss) per share is
computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the
net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common share
equivalents included in the diluted computation represent shares issuable upon assumed
exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock and “if converted” method. For
periods in which net losses are incurred, weighted average shares outstanding is the same for
basic and diluted loss per share calculations, as the inclusion of common share equivalents
would have an anti-dilutive effect.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the prior period were reclassified to conform to the current period’s financial
statement presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net loss or
accumulated deficit.

On May 7, 2015, the Company completed the May 2015 Private Placement of a $12.0 million
principal amount secured convertible note (the “Note”) and Warrant to purchase 1,800,000
shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value. The placement agent for the
Company in the transaction will receive a fee of 6% of cash proceeds, or $600,000, if and when
the Company receives the full cash proceeds. It received $27,000 of such amount at the closing.
In addition, the placement agent was granted a warrant to purchase 240,000 shares of common
stock at $5.00 per share, which warrant is immediately exercisable.
The Note and Warrant were issued pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated May 7,
2015, by and between the Company and the Investor. The May 2015 Private Placement was
made pursuant to an exemption from registration under such Act. At the closing, the Investor
acquired the secured convertible note by paying $450,000 in cash and issuing a secured
promissory note, secured by cash, with an aggregate initial principal amount of $9,550,000 (the
“Investor Note”). Assuming all amounts payable to the Company under the Investor Note are paid
without any offset or default, the May 2015 Private Placement will result in gross proceeds of
$10.0 million before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction,
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Company used the proceeds from this
offering to retire certain outstanding obligations, including the 2015 area and training fees
relating to its Nicaraguan Concessions, and to provide working capital. As of June 30, 2016, an
additional $60,000 was funded under the Investor Note for a total of $510,000 advanced to the
Company prior to any repayments.
The Company is to receive the remaining cash proceeds upon each voluntary or mandatory
prepayment of the Investor Note. An Investor may, at its option and at any time, voluntarily prepay
the Investor Note, in whole or in part. The Investor Note is also subject to mandatory prepayment,
in whole or in part, upon the occurrence of one or more of the following mandatory prepayment
events:
(1) Mandatory Prepayment upon Conversion – At any time the Investor has converted more than
$2.0 million principal amount of the Note, representing the original issue discount of the Note, the
Investor will be required to prepay the Investor Note, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, for each
subsequent conversion of the Note.
(2) Mandatory Prepayment upon Mandatory Prepayment Notices – The Company may require
the Investor to prepay the Investor Note by delivering a mandatory prepayment notice to the
Investor, subject to (i) the satisfaction of certain equity conditions, (ii) the Company’s receipt of all
Governmental Authorizations, as defined in the Purchase Agreement, necessary to commence
drilling on at least five Properties, also as defined in the Purchase Agreement, within the
Nicaraguan Concessions, and (iii) the Company obtaining forbearance agreements from certain
third parties to whom the Company owes obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company may not request a mandatory prepayment if after giving effect to such proposed
mandatory prepayment, the Company would hold more than $4.0 million in cash or if prepayment
under the Investor Note for the preceding sixty calendar day period would exceed $2.0 million.
13
The Investor Note also contains certain offset rights, which if executed, would reduce the amount
outstanding under the Note and the Investor Note and the cash proceeds received by the
Company.
Description of the Secured Convertible Note
The Note is secured to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness and is secured by all of
the assets of the Company, excluding the Nicaraguan Concessions, and to the extent and as
provided in the related security documents.
The Note is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into shares of the Company’s
common stock at $5.00 per share (the “Conversion Price”). The Note matures on the three-year
anniversary of the issuance date thereof. If the Company issues or sells shares of its common
stock, rights to purchase shares of its common stock, or securities convertible into shares of its
common stock for a price per share that is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, the then
current Conversion Price will be decreased to equal such lower price. The foregoing adjustments
to the Conversion Price for future stock issues will not apply to certain exempt issuances,
including issuances pursuant to certain employee benefit plans. In addition, the Conversion Price
is subject to adjustment upon stock splits, reverse stock splits, and similar capital changes.
On the first business day of each month beginning on the earlier of the (i) effectiveness of a
registration statement the Company files to register the shares of common stock issuable upon
conversion of the Note or exercise of the Warrant, as defined below, or (ii) sixth month following
the date of the Note through and including the maturity date (the “Installment Dates”), the
Company will pay to the Note holder an amount equal to (i) one-thirtieth (1/30th) of the original
principal amount of the Note (or the principal outstanding on the Installment Date, if less) plus (ii)
the accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such principal plus (iii) the accrued and unpaid
late charges (if any) with respect to such principal and interest. The Investor has the ability to
defer or accelerate such monthly payments in its sole discretion.
Prior to the maturity date, the Note will bear interest at 8% per annum (or 18% per annum during
an event of default) with interest payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock monthly in
arrears on the first business day of each calendar month following the issuance date.
Each monthly payment may be made in cash, in shares of the Company’s common stock, or in a
combination of cash and shares of its common stock. The Company’s ability to make such
payments with shares of its common stock will be subject to various equity conditions, including
the existence of an effective registration statement covering the resale of the shares issued in
payment (or, in the alternative, the eligibility of the shares issuable pursuant to the Note and the
Warrant, as defined below, for sale without restriction under Rule 144 and without the need for
the Company to remain current with its public filing obligations) and certain minimum trading
price and trading volume. Such shares will be valued, as of the date on which notice is given by
the Company that payment will be made in shares, at the lower of (1) the then applicable
Conversion Price and (2) a price that is 80.0% of the arithmetic average of the three lowest
weighted average prices of the Company’s common stock during the twenty-trading day period
ending two trading days before the applicable determination date (the “Measurement Period”). If
the Company elects to pay such monthly payment in shares of the Company’s stock it is required
to pre-deliver shares of the Company’s common stock and is required to deliver additional
shares, if any, to a true-up such number of shares to the number of shares required to be
delivered on the applicable Installment Date pursuant to the calculation above.
At any time after the issuance date, the Company will have the right to redeem all or any portion
of the outstanding principal balance of the Note plus all accrued but unpaid interest and any
other charges at a price equal to 125% of such amount provided that (i) the arithmetic average of
the closing sale price of the common stock for any twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days equals
or exceeds 200% of the Conversion Price and (ii) among other conditions, there is an effective
registration statement covering the resale of the shares issued in payment or, in the alternative,
the eligibility of the shares issuable pursuant to the Note and the Warrant for sale without
restriction under Rule 144 and without the need for the Company to remain current with its public
filing obligations. The Investor has the right to convert any or all of the amount to be redeemed
into common stock prior to redemption.
14
Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Note, the Investor may, so long as the event
of default is continuing, require the Company to redeem all or a portion of its Note. Each portion
of the Note subject to such redemption must be redeemed by the Company, in cash, at a price
equal to the greater of (1) 125% of the amount being redeemed, including principal, accrued and
unpaid interest, and accrued and unpaid late charges, and (2) the product of (I) the amount being
redeemed and (II) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the greatest closing sale price of the
shares of common stock during the period beginning on the date immediately preceding the
event of default and ending on the date the holder delivers a redemption notice to the Company,
by (B) the lowest Conversion Price in effect during such period.
Subject to certain conditions, the Investor may also require the Company to redeem all or a
portion of its Note in connection with a transaction that results in a Change of Control, as defined
in the Note. The Company must redeem each portion of the Note subject to such redemption in
cash at a price equal to the greater of (1) 125% of the amount being redeemed (including
principal, accrued and unpaid interest, and accrued and unpaid late charges), and (2) the product
of (I) the amount being redeemed and (II) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the greatest
closing sale price of the shares of common stock during the period beginning on the date
immediately preceding the earlier to occur of (i) the consummation of the Change of Control and
(ii) the public announcement of such Change of Control and ending on the date the holder
delivers a redemption notice to the Company, by (B) the lowest Conversion Price in effect during
such period.
Description of the Warrant.
As a part of the May 2015 Private Placement, the Company issued a Warrant to the Investor
giving it the right to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,800,000 shares of the Company’s common
stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share. The Warrant is exercisable commencing six months
from the date of issuance and the exercise prices for the Warrant is subject to adjustment for
certain events, such as stock splits and stock dividends. If the Company issues or sells shares of
its common stock, rights to purchase shares of its common stock, or securities convertible into
shares of its common stock for a price per share that is less than the exercise price then in effect,
the exercise price of the Warrant will be decreased to equal such lesser price. Upon each such
adjustment, the number of the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon exercise of
the Warrant will increase proportionately. The foregoing adjustments to the exercise price for
future stock issues will not apply to certain exempt issuances, including issuances pursuant to
certain employee benefit plans. In addition, the Conversion Price is subject to adjustment upon
stock splits, reverse stock splits, and similar capital changes. The Warrant will expire on the
seventh (7th) anniversary of the date of issuance.
9.99% Restriction on Conversion of Note and Exercise of Warrant
The Investor has no right to convert the Note or exercise the Warrant to the extent that such
conversion or exercise would result in the Investor being the beneficial owner in excess of 9.99%
of the Company’s common stock. The Company was required to hold a meeting of its
shareholders to approve increase the number of its authorized shares to meet its obligations
under the Purchase Agreement to have reserved 200% of the shares issuable upon conversion
of the Note and exercise of the Warrant. The Company held its Annual Meeting of Shareholders
on September 25, 2015 and the shareholders approved the reverse split of the Company’s
common stock issued and outstanding shares, which satisfied this requirement.
Registration Rights Agreement
In connection with the May 2015 Private Placement, the Company and the Investor entered into a
Registration Rights Agreement under which the Company is required, on or before 45 days after
the closing of the May 2015 Private Placement, to file a registration statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) covering the resale of 130% of the shares of the
Company’s common stock issuable pursuant to the Note and Warrant and to use its best efforts
to have the registration declared effective as soon as practicable. The Company will be subject to
certain monetary penalties, as set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, if the registration
statement is not filed or does not remain available for the resale (subject to certain allowable
grace periods) of the Registrable Securities, as such term is defined in the Registration Rights
Agreement. The Company filed the required registration statement on Form S-1 on June 19,
2015 and the Securities and Exchange Commission declared the Form S-1 effective on October
9, 2015 and has thereby satisfied this requirement.
15
Participation Rights
If, during the period beginning on the closing date and ending on the four (4) year anniversary of
the closing date, the Company offers, sells, grants any option to purchase, or otherwise disposes
of any of its or its subsidiaries’ equity or equity equivalent securities (a “Subsequent Placement”),
the Investor will have the right to participate for 50% of any such future Subsequent Placement.
Description of the Financial Accounting and Reporting
The Company elected to account for the Note on its fair value basis, therefore, the fair value of
the Note, including its embedded conversion feature, were estimated together utilizing a binomial
lattice model on its origination date and the Black-Sholes model at June 30, 2016. Such
assumptions included the following:

The Company received $450,000 of proceeds at the date of issuance and after repayments and
additional funding the net principal balance was $129,960 as of June 30, 2016. The fair market
value of the Note was estimated to be $682,400 as of the issuance date, $265,929 at December
31, 2015 and $145,673 as of June 30, 2016. The net $67,784 change in fair market value of the
Note is included in change in fair value of secured notes payable in the accompanying statement
of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
The Warrant issued to purchase 1,800,000 common shares in connection with the Note was
treated as a derivative liability for accounting purposes due to its ratchet and anti-dilution
provisions. Accordingly, the Company has estimated the fair value of the warrant derivative as of
the issuance date of the Note was issued at $8,034,007, which has been charged to non-
operating expense during the year ended December 31, 2015. The estimated fair value of the
warrant derivative as of June 30, 2016 was $79,898, representing a change of $102,619 from
December 31, 2015 which is included in changes in derivative fair value in the accompanying
statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016. See Note 6.
The warrant issued to purchase 240,000 shares issued as part of the placement fee in
connection with the Note was treated as a derivative liability for accounting purposes due to its
ratchet and anti-dilution provisions. Changes in the fair value of the warrant derivative liability
totaled $13,683 (reduction in the derivative liability) through June 30, 2016, which is included in
changes in derivative fair value in the accompanying statement of operations for the six months
ended June 30, 2016. The warrant derivative liability balance related to such warrants was
$10,653 and $24,336 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. See Note 6.
The Company is required to make monthly installment payments in the form of cash, common
stock or a combination of both. The Company elected to make such monthly payments in the
form of common stock and has delivered a total of 4,248,068 shares of common stock
representing required principal repayments ($220,040 principal balances) and 174,262
representing interest payments ($9,146 interest payments) during the six months ended June 30,
2016. A total of 317,154 common shares were issued to “true-up” previous installments which
were included in the shares delivered during the six months ended June 30, 2016.

Line-of-Credit with Related Party
The Company entered into a line-of-credit facility on September 23, 2013 that provides it with
borrowing capacity on a revolving basis up to a maximum of $50,000, which was increased to
$75,000 at August 28, 2015 and an initial maturity of November 28, 2013. The line of credit is
convertible to common stock at a rate of $5.00 per share. The entity providing the credit facility is
owned by an officer of another corporation for which Infinity’s president and chairman of the
board serves as president and chairman of the board. The facility is unsecured, bears interest at
8% per annum, and was renewed at its maturity several times with its current maturity date as
May 28, 2016. In consideration for the origination of the line of credit facility and the various
renewals, the Company granted the lender common stock purchase warrants. On February 28,
2016 the Company extended the line-of-credit expiration date to May 28, 2016 and issued a
warrant to purchase 10,000 common shares at an exercise price of $5.00 per share, which
warrants were immediately exercisable and expire on February 28, 2021. The Company
estimated the fair value of the warrants at $774 as of the grant date, which amount was recorded
as debt issuance costs and will be amortized to interest expense over the extended term of the
line-of-credit. On May 28, 2016 the Company extended the line-of-credit expiration date to August
28, 2016 and issued a warrant to purchase 10,000 common shares at an exercise price of $5.00
per share, which warrants were immediately exercisable and expire on May 28, 2021. The
Company estimated the fair value of the warrants at $130 as of the grant date, which amount was
recorded as debt issuance costs and will be amortized to interest expense over the extended
term of the line-of-credit.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, $1,240 and $243,787 of debt
issuance costs amortized (including amounts immediately expensed) to interest expense,
respectively and the remaining unamortized balance was $84 as of June 30, 2016, which is
included in prepaid expenses.
Note Payable – Short-term
On December 27, 2013 the Company borrowed $1,050,000 under an unsecured credit facility
with a private, third-party lender. The facility is represented by a promissory note (the “December
2013 Note”) with an original maturity date of March 12, 2014.
In connection with the December 2013 Note, the Company granted the lender a warrant (the
“Warrant”) exercisable to purchase 100,000 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of
$15.00 per share. In connection with an extension to April 2015, the parties amended the date for
exercise of the Warrant to be a period commencing April 7, 2015 and expiring on the third
anniversary of such date. The Company issued no additional warrants to the lender in
connection with the extension of the Note to the New Maturity Date. If the Company fails to pay
the Note on or before its New Maturity Date, the number of shares issuable under the Warrant
increases to 1,333,333 and the exercise price drops to $0.75 per share. All other terms of the
Warrant remain the same. The Warrant has been treated as a derivative liability whereby the
value of Warrant is estimated at the date of grant and recorded as a derivative liability and as a
discount on the note payable. The warrant liability is revalued to fair value at each reporting date
with the corresponding income (loss) reflected in the statement of operations as change in
derivative liability. The discount is amortized ratably through the original maturity date and each
of the extended maturity dates.
17
In connection with an extension of the December 2013 Note to April 7, 2016, the Company
agreed to enter into a definitive revenue sharing agreement with the lender to grant the lender
under the revenue sharing agreement an irrevocable right to receive a monthly payment equal to
one half of one percent (1/2%) of the gross revenue derived from the share of all hydrocarbons
produced at the wellhead from the Nicaraguan Concessions and any other oil and gas
concessions that the Company and its affiliates may acquire in the future. This percent increased
to one percent (1%) when the Company did not pay the December 2013 Note in full by August 7,
2014. Therefore, the revenue sharing agreement is fixed at one percent (1%). The value of the
one percent (1.0%) definitive revenue sharing agreement granted to the lender as consideration
for the extension of the maturity date to December 7, 2014 was estimated to be $964,738. Such
amount was recorded as a reduction of oil and gas properties and as a discount on the renewed
note payable and amortized ratably over the extended term of the note.
In connection with the extension of the maturity date of the December 2013 Note to April 7, 2016,
the Company also (i) issued the lender 20,000 shares of restricted common stock; (ii) decreased
the exercise price of the warrant to $5.00 per share and extended the term of the warrant to a
period commencing on the New Maturity Date and expiring on the third anniversary of such date;
and (iii) paid $50,000 toward amounts due under the December 2013 Note. The Company
issued no additional warrants to the lender in connection with the extension of the Note to the
New Maturity Date. If the Company fails to pay the December 2013 Note on or before its New
Maturity Date, the number of shares issuable under the Warrant increases to 1,333,333 and the
exercise price drops to $0.75 per share. All other terms of the warrant remain the same. The
December 2013 Note may be prepaid without penalty at any time. The Note is subordinated to all
existing and future senior indebtedness, as such terms are defined in the Note. The December
2013 Note is in technical default and the Company is seeking an extension of the maturity date of
this Note (See Note 11) from the holder. however there can be no assurances such efforts will be
successful.
The Warrant has been treated as a derivative liability whereby the value of Warrant is estimated
at the date of grant and recorded as a derivative liability and as a discount on the note payable.
The warrant liability is revalued to fair value at each reporting date with the corresponding
income (loss) reflected in the statement of operations as change in derivative liability. The
discount is amortized ratably through the original maturity date and each of the extended maturity
dates. The Company recognized the value of the 20,000 shares of common stock issued
($104,000) and the increased value of the outstanding warrants due to the decrease in their
exercise price ($68,716) as an additional discount on the note payable to be amortized ratably
over the extended term of the underlying note.
The discount recorded as of the December 27, 2013 origination date of the note and as a result of
the amendments to the Note terms and extensions of the maturity date has been amortized
ratably over the term and extended terms of the note. Discount amortization expense aggregated
$50,526 and $68,336 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the
remaining unamortized discount was $-0- as of June 30, 2016. The related warrant derivative
liability balance was $1,694 at fair value as of June 30, 2016. See Note 6.
Other than the Note described above, during the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company
had short-term notes outstanding with entities or individuals as follows:
●
On July 7, 2015 the Company borrowed a total of $50,000 from an individual under a
convertible note payable with the conversion rate of $5.60 per share. The term of the note was
for a period of 90 days and bears interest at 8% per annum. In connection with the loan, the
Company issued the entity a warrant for the purchase of 5,000 shares of common stock at
$5.60 per share for a period of five years from the date of the note. The terms of the note and
warrant provide that should the note and interest not be paid in full by its maturity date, the
number of warrants automatically increases to 10,000 shares and the exercise price remains at
$5.60 per share. The ratchet provision in the stock purchase warrant requires that the warrant
be accounted for as derivative liability. The Company recorded the estimated fair value of the
warrant totaling $22,314 as a discount on note payable and as a derivative liability in the same
amount, as of the origination date. On October 7, 2015, the note was extended for an additional
90 days or until January 7, 2016 and later to May 7, 2016 and ultimately to October 7, 2016. In
consideration, the Company granted the lender common stock purchase warrants exercisable
to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock on each extension date at an exercise price of
$5.60 per share, which warrants were immediately exercisable and expire in five years. The
value of the 5,000 newly issued warrants issued on January 7, 2016 totaled $379, and $131 on
May 7, 2016 both of which are being amortized over the extension period (through October 7,
2016). Discount amortization totaled $687 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and the
remaining unamortized discount was $85 as of June 30, 2016. The related warrant derivative
liability balance was $718 at fair value as of June 30, 2016. See Note 6.
18
On July 15, 2015 the Company borrowed a total of $35,000 from an individual under a
convertible note payable with the conversion rate of $5.60 per share. The term of the note was
for a period of 90 days and bears interest at 8% per annum. In connection with the loan, the
Company issued the entity a warrant for the purchase of 3,500 shares of common stock at
$5.60 per share for a period of five years from the date of the note. The terms of the note and
warrant provide that should the note and interest not be paid in full by its maturity date, the
number of warrants automatically increases to 7,000 shares and the exercise price remains at
$5.60 per share. The ratchet provision in the stock purchase warrant requires that the warrant
be accounted for as a derivative liability. The Company recorded the estimated fair value of the
warrant totaling $11,827 as a discount on note payable and as a derivative liability in the same
amount, as of the origination date. On October 15, 2015, the note was extended for an
additional 90 days or until January 15, 2016 and later to May 15, 2016. In consideration, the
Company granted the lender common stock purchase warrants exercisable to purchase an
aggregate of 3,500 shares of common stock on each extension date at an exercise price of
$5.60 per share, which warrants were immediately exercisable and expire in five years. The
value of the 3,500 newly issued warrants on January 15, 2016 totaled $267 and $74 on May
15, 2016, both of which are being amortized over the extension period (through October 15,
2016). Discount amortization totaled $527 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and the
remaining unamortized discount was $52 as of June 30, 2016. The related warrant derivative
liability balance was $503 at fair value as of June 30, 2016. See Note 6.
●
Note 4 – Common Stock
The Company has delivered a total of 4,248,068 shares of common stock representing required
principal repayments ($220,040 principal balances) and 174,262 representing interest payments
($9,146 interest payments) during the six months ended June 30, 2016. A total of 317,154
common shares were issued to “true-up” previous installments which were included in the shares
delivered during the six months ended June 30, 2016. See Note 2 – Secured Convertible Note
Payable.
Note 5 – Stock Options
The Company applies ASC 718, Stock Compensation, which requires companies to recognize
compensation expense for share-based payments based on the estimated fair value of the
awards. ASC 718 also requires tax benefits relating to the deductibility of increases in the value
of equity instruments issued under share-based compensation arrangements to be presented as
financing cash inflows in the statement of cash flows. Compensation cost is recognized based on
the grant-date fair value for all share-based payments granted, and is estimated in accordance
with the provisions of ASC 718.
In May 2006, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006
Plan”), under which both incentive and non-statutory stock options may be granted to employees,
officers, non-employee directors and consultants. An aggregate of 47,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2006 Plan. In June 2005, the
Company’s stockholders approved the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”), under which
both incentive and non-statutory stock options may be granted to employees, officers, non-
employee directors and consultants. An aggregate of 47,500 shares of the Company’s common
stock were reserved for issuance under the 2005 Plan however such 2005 Plan has now expired
and no further issuances can be made. Options granted under the 2005 Plan and 2006 Plan
allow for the purchase of common stock at prices not less than the fair market value of such stock
at the date of grant, become exercisable immediately or as directed by the Company’s Board of
Directors and generally expire ten years after the date of grant. The Company also has issued
other stock options not pursuant to a formal plan with terms similar to the 2005 and 2006 Plans.
19
The Annual Meeting of Stockholders was held on September 25, 2015 and the stockholders
approved the Infinity Energy Resources, Inc. 2015 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the
“2015 Plan”) and reserved 500,000 shares for issuance under the Plan.
As of June 30, 2016, 515,650 shares were available for future grants under all plans.
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected
term of the option award, expected stock price volatility and expected dividends. These estimates
involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. For purposes of
estimating the expected term of options granted, the Company aggregates option recipients into
groups that have similar option exercise behavioral traits. Expected volatilities used in the
valuation model are based on the expected volatility that would be used by an independent
market participant in the valuation of certain of the Company’s warrants. The risk-free rate for the
expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
The Company’s forfeiture rate assumption used in determining its stock-based compensation
expense is estimated based on historical data. The actual forfeiture rate could differ from these
estimates. There were no stock options granted during the six months ended June 30, 2016.

and 2015, respectively.
The unrecognized compensation cost as of June 30, 2016 related to the unvested stock options
as of that date was $-0-.
Note 6 – Derivative Instruments
Derivatives – Warrants Issued Relative to Note Payables
The estimated fair value of the Company’s derivative liabilities, all of which are related to the
detachable warrants issued in connection with various notes payable and the secured
convertible note, were estimated using a closed-ended option pricing model utilizing
assumptions related to the contractual term of the instruments, estimated volatility of the price of
the Company’s common stock, interest rates, the probability of both the downward adjustment of
the exercise price and the upward adjustment to the number of warrants as provided by the note
payable and warrant agreement terms (Note 2 and 3) and non-performance risk factors, among
other items (ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820”) fair value hierarchy Level 3). The
detachable warrants issued in connection with the secured convertible note (See Note 2), the
December 2013 Note (See Note 3) and the two other short-term notes payable (See Note 3)
contain ratchet and anti-dilution provisions that remain in effect during the term of the warrant
while the ratchet and anti-dilution provisions of the other notes payable cease when the related
note payable is extinguished. When the note payable containing such ratchet and anti-dilution
provisions is extinguished, the derivative liability will be adjusted to fair value and the resulting
derivative liability will be transitioned from a liability to equity as of such date. The derivative
liability associated with the warrants issued in connection with the secured convertible note
payable will remain effect until such time as the underlying warrant is exercised or terminated
and the resulting derivative liability will be transitioned from a liability to equity as of such date.
20
The Company has issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,174,000 common shares in
connection with various outstanding debt instruments which require derivative accounting
treatment as of June 30, 2016. A comparison of the assumptions used in calculating estimated
fair value of such derivative liabilities as of June 30, 2016 is as follows:

intrinsic value of all vested common stock purchase warrants was zero as of June 30, 2016.
Note 8 – Income Taxes
For income tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
$67,415,000 as of December 31, 2015, which expire from 2025 through 2030. The Company has
provided a 100% valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefits from its
net deferred tax asset.
The Company has not completed the filing of tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 2015.
Therefore, all such tax returns are open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.
The Internal Revenue Code contains provisions under Section 382 which limit a company’s
ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards in the event that it has experienced a more than
50% change in ownership over a three-year period. Current estimates prepared by the Company
on a preliminary basis indicate that no ownership changes have occurred, and are currently not
subject to an annual limitation, but may be further limited by additional ownership changes which
may occur in the future.
Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies
The Company has not maintained insurance coverage on its U.S domestic oil and gas properties
for several years. The Company is not in compliance with Federal and State laws regarding the
U.S. domestic oil and gas properties. The Company’s known compliance issues relate to the
Texas Railroad Commission regarding administrative filings and renewal permits relative to its
Texas oil and gas properties that were sold in 2012. The ultimate resolution of these compliance
issues could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Nicaraguan Concessions
In April 2011, we filed with the Nicaraguan government an Environmental Impact Assessment
(“EIA”) covering proposed seismic activities on our Nicaraguan Concessions. The filing of the
EIA was followed by a comment period during which there was interaction between us the
Ministerio del Ambiente y los Recursos Naturales de Nicaragua, an agency of the Nicaraguan
government; and the autonomous regions of Nicaragua that are nearest to the Nicaraguan
Concessions. In April 2013 the EIA was formally approved by the Nicaraguan government and
we were cleared to commence 2-D and 3-D seismic mapping activities in the area. In late 2013
and early 2014, we contracted with a fully integrated Geoscience company that provides
geological, geophysical and reservoir services to the global oil and gas industry, to conduct 2-D
and 3-D seismic data covering selected areas within the boundaries of the Nicaraguan
Concessions.
The final approval of the EIA by the Nicaraguan government of our environment impact study on
April 13, 2013, began Sub-Period 2 for both the Tyra and Perlas Blocks as defined in the
Nicaraguan Concessions. The Company believes it has satisfied the acquisition, processing and
interpretation of Seismic data required in Sub-Period 2 for both the Perlas and Tyra Blocks.
Therefore, it is now in Sub-Period 3 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concession for both
Perlas and Tyra as of June 30, 2015. Sub-Period 3 of the Nicaraguan Concessions requires the
drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 and the shooting of
additional seismic on the Tyra Block. The Company is in process of identifying at least one
potential drilling site on the Perlas block as required in Sub-Period 3 and will have to perform
supplemental EIA work prior to requesting and receiving the permit to drill from the Nicaraguan
government. The work plan on the Tyra block for Sub-Period 3 requires the Company to shoot
additional seismic, which is estimated to cost approximately $2,500,000 prior to the
commencement of exploratory drilling. The Company is seeking a waiver of the additional
seismic mapping on the Tyra Block and extension of time to complete its initial well from the
Nicaraguan government. There can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such waiver of
the requirements.
22
During late December 2013, we completed the 2-D seismic survey activities in the area as
required under both of the Nicaraguan Concessions at that point. We believe that the newly
acquired 2-D seismic data, together with the previously acquired reprocessed 2-D seismic, has
helped us further evaluate the structures that were previously identified with 2-D seismic in the
Eocene Zone. Our geological consultants have estimated that these Eocene structures may
contain recoverable hydrocarbons (principally oil) in place. In addition, the new 2-D seismic
acquired in 2013 provided our first geological information regarding the potential for oil resources
in the Cretaceous Zone, which we could not evaluate using less precise older 2-D seismic
mapping. We have identified multiple promising sites on the Perlas Block for exploratory drilling
and are planning the drilling of initial exploratory wells in order to determine the existence of
commercial hydrocarbon reserves, given sufficient financing. We believe that we have performed
all work necessary as of June 30, 2015 to proceed to Sub-Period 3 for the Perlas Block as
defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions, which requires the drilling of at least one exploratory
well on the Perlas Block within the following one-year period. We must first prepare and submit a
supplemental EIA to the Nicaraguan government before the drilling permit can be issued on the
Perlas Block, which had not been completed as of June 30, 2016.
The Company has not yet submitted the EIA supplement to the Nicaraguan Government and
therefore has not received a drilling permit; however, assuming that Government does accept the
supplemental EIA and grant the drilling permit, the Company will be required to drill at least one
exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 or risk being in default and losing its rights
under the Nicaraguan Concessions.
The Company is in technical default of the Nicaraguan Concession because it has not provided
the required letters of credit to the Nicaraguan Government. In accordance with the Nicaraguan
Concession agreements, the Company had previously provided the Ministry of Energy with the
required letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for Perlas (expired March 2014) and
$408,450 for Tyra (expired September 2014). The Company had also made all required
expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training programs and as “area fees,” for
each respective year for 2010 through 2015. The Company is attempting to negotiate the renewal
and increase of the required letters of credit, which total $1,356,227 for the Perlas block and
$278,450 for the Tyra block with the Nicaraguan Government and its lenders; however, there can
be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the regard. The Company considers it is
fully in compliance with the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions agreements, except for the
renewal of the expired letters of credit.
The Company must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital in the immediate future
in order to fund: (1) the required letters of credit to the Nicaraguan Government; (2) the drilling of
at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016; (3)
the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions if it is unable
to negotiate a waiver of such requirement from the Nicaraguan government; (4) the payment of
normal day-to-day operations and corporate overhead; and (5) the payment of outstanding debt
and financial obligations as they become due. These are substantial operational and financial
issues that must be successfully mitigated during 2016 or the Company’s ability to satisfy the
conditions necessary to maintain its Nicaragua Concessions will be in significant doubt. The
Company completed the May 2015 Private Placement in May 2015 in an effort to obtain its
required capital. See Note 2 to the Financial Statements.
The Company is also seeking offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in
the acreage in the Nicaraguan Concessions in exchange for cash and a carried interest in
exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement. Accordingly, it
intends to finance its business strategy through external financing, which may include debt and
equity capital raised in public and private offerings, joint ventures, sale of working or other
interests, employment of working capital and cash flow from operations, if any, and net proceeds
from the sales of assets.
The following charts set forth the minimum work programs required under for the Perlas and Tyra
blocks comprising the Concessions in order for the Company to retain them.

Revenue Sharing Commitments
On March 23, 2009, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated effective
as of March 23, 2009, with Off-Shore, an accredited investor, to issue a subordinated promissory
note in the aggregate principal amount of up to $1,275,000 and a one percent (1%) revenue
sharing interest in the Nicaraguan Concessions. Off-Shore funded a total of $1,275,000 and
subsequently converted the subordinated promissory note to common stock.
Under the Revenue Sharing Agreement (the “Revenue Agreement”), Infinity assigned to Off-
Shore a monthly payment (the “RSP”) equal to the revenue derived from one percent (1%) of
Infinity’s share of the hydrocarbons produced at the wellhead from the Nicaraguan Concessions.
The RSP will bear its proportionate share of all costs incurred to deliver the hydrocarbons to the
point of sale to an unaffiliated purchaser, including its share of production, severance and similar
taxes, and certain additional costs. The RSP will be paid to Off-Shore by the last day of each
month based on the revenue received by Infinity from the purchaser of the production during the
previous month from the Nicaraguan Concessions. The Revenue Agreement does not create any
obligation for Infinity to maintain or develop the Nicaraguan Concessions, and does not create
any rights in the Nicaraguan Concessions for Off-Shore. In connection with its dissolution Off-
Shore assigned its RSP to its individual members.
On June 6, 2009 the Company entered into a Revenue Sharing Agreement with the officers and
directors for services provided. Infinity assigned to officers and directors a monthly payment
equal to the revenue derived from one percent (1%) of Infinity’s share of the hydrocarbons
produced at the wellhead from the Nicaraguan Concessions. The RSP will bear its proportionate
share of all costs incurred to deliver the hydrocarbons to the point of sale to an unaffiliated
purchaser, including its share of production, severance and similar taxes, and certain additional
costs.
The RSP shall be paid by the last day of each month based on the revenue received by Infinity
from the purchaser of the production during the previous month from the Nicaraguan
Concessions. The Revenue Agreement does not create any obligation for Infinity to maintain or
develop the Nicaraguan Concessions, and does not create any rights in the Nicaraguan
Concessions for officers and directors.
The Company intends to seek joint venture or working interest partners (the “Farmout”) prior to
the commencement of any exploratory drilling operations on the Nicaraguan Concessions. On
September 8, 2009 the Company entered into a Revenue Sharing Agreement with Jeff Roberts
to assist the Company with its technical studies of gas and oil holdings in Nicaragua and
managing and assisting in the Farmout. Infinity assigned to Jeff Roberts a monthly payment
equal to the revenue derived from one percent (1%) of Infinity’s share of the hydrocarbons
produced at the wellhead from the Nicaraguan Concessions. The RSP will bear its proportionate
share of all costs incurred to deliver the hydrocarbons to the point of sale to an unaffiliated
purchaser, including its share of production, severance and similar taxes, and certain additional
costs. The RSP shall be paid to Jeff Roberts by the last day of each month based on the revenue
received by Infinity from the purchaser of the production during the previous month from the
Nicaraguan Concessions. The Revenue Agreement does not create any obligation for Infinity to
maintain or develop the Nicaraguan Concessions, and does not create any rights in the
Nicaraguan Concessions for Jeff Roberts.
In connection with the extension of the December 2013 Note with a $1,050,000 principal balance
issued in December 2013, the Company entered into a Revenue Sharing Agreement in May
2014. Infinity assigned to the note holder a monthly payment equal to the revenue derived from
one percent (1%) of 8/8ths of Infinity’s share of the hydrocarbons produced at the wellhead from
the Nicaraguan Concessions and any other oil and gas concessions that the Company and its
affiliates may acquire in the future. The RSP will bear its proportionate share of all costs incurred
to deliver the hydrocarbons to the point of sale to an unaffiliated purchaser, including its share of
production, severance and similar taxes, and certain additional costs. The RSP shall be paid by
the last day of each month based on the revenue received by Infinity from the purchaser of the
production during the previous month from the Nicaraguan Concessions. The Revenue Sharing
Agreement does not create any obligation for Infinity to maintain or develop the Nicaraguan
Concessions.
25
Letter of Intent to enter Exploration Services Agreement
On October 13, 2014 the Company announced that it had entered into a Letter of Intent (“LOI”)
with Granada Exploration, LLC, which has agreed to join with the Company to explore for
potential hydrocarbons beneath Infinity’s 1.4 million-acre oil and gas concessions in the
Caribbean Sea offshore Nicaragua. Under the terms of the LOI, Granada Exploration will provide
its services in exchange for a working interest in the Nicaraguan Concessions. The scope of
such services will be more specifically described in a mutually acceptable Exploration Services
Agreement (“ESA”), which is currently being negotiated. The ESA is anticipated to provide that
Granada will earn an assignment from Infinity of an undivided 30% working interest in the
Concessions, based on an 80% net revenue interest. Granada and Infinity are also anticipated to
enter into a Joint Operating Agreement. Granada may, at its discretion, participate in an initial
exploratory well for up to an additional undivided 20% working interest, on a prospect-by-
prospect basis, with such additional interest to be based on an 80% net revenue interest.
The LOI is subject to Granada’s normal and customary due diligence, including the evaluation of
the Company’s Form 10-K and 10-Q filings, documents showing that the Company is in good
standing regarding the Nicaraguan Concessions and with the Nicaraguan government;
negotiation and approval of mutually acceptable formal agreements; and final approval by a
majority of the partners that comprise Granada Exploration, LLC. The parties continue to
negotiate the terms of the ESA, but have not entered into definitive agreements. Granada has not
completed its normal and customary due diligence with progress being delayed due to the
current environment affecting oil and gas exploration projects and uncertainties involving the
status of the Nicaraguan Concessions.
Lack of Compliance with Law Regarding Domestic Properties
Infinity has not been in compliance with existing federal, state and local laws, rules and
regulations for its previously owned domestic oil and gas properties and this could have a
material or significantly adverse effect upon the liquidity, capital expenditures, earnings or
competitive position of Infinity. All domestic oil and gas properties held by Infinity – Wyoming and
Infinity-Texas were disposed of prior to June 30, 2016; however, the Company may remain liable
for certain asset retirement costs should the new owners not complete their obligations.
Management believes the total asset retirement obligations recorded of $1,716,003 as of June
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are sufficient to cover any potential noncompliance liabilities
relative to the to the plugging of abandoned wells, the removal of facilities and equipment, and
site restoration on oil and gas properties for its former oil and gas properties. The Company has
not maintained insurance on the domestic properties for a number of years nor has it
owned/produced any oil & gas properties for a number of years.
Gain on Derecognition of Liabilities
The Company has been generally unable to pay trade payables for several years as a result of
its financial condition and lack of financial resources. Many trade payables have aged beyond
their respective Statute of Limitations with respect to the creditors’ ability to enforce collection
though legal proceedings. Management has reviewed the status of its trade payables and have
written-off the remaining balances for those that have aged beyond the expiration date of their
applicable statute of limitation. The gain from derecognition of liabilities was $1,134,082 and
$174,457 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Litigation
The Company is subject to numerous claims and legal actions in which vendors are claiming
breach of contract due to the Company’s failure to pay amounts due. The Company believes that
it has made adequate provision for these claims in the accompanying financial statements.
The Company is currently involved in litigation as follows:
●
In October 2012 the State of Texas filed a lawsuit naming Infinity-Texas, the Company and the
corporate officers of Infinity-Texas, seeking $30,000 of reclamation costs associated with a
single well, in addition to administrative expenses and penalties. The Company engaged in
negotiations with the State of Texas in late 2012 and early 2013 and reached a settlement
agreement that would reduce the aggregate liability, in this action and any extension of this to
other Texas wells, to $45,103, which amount has been paid. Certain performance obligations
remain which must be satisfied in order to finally settle and dismiss the matter.
Pending satisfactory performance of the performance obligations and their acceptance by the
State of Texas, the officers have potential liability regarding the above matter, and the officers
are held personally harmless by indemnification provisions of the Company. Therefore, to the
extent they might actually occur, these liabilities are the obligations of the Company.
Management estimates that the liabilities associated with this matter will not exceed $780,000,
calculated as $30,000 for each of the 26 Infinity-Texas operated wells. This related liability, less
the payment made to the State of Texas in 2012 in the amount of $45,103, is included in the
asset retirement obligation on the accompanying balance sheets.
26
Cambrian Consultants America, Inc. (“Cambrian”) filed an action in the District Court of Harris
County, Texas, number CV2014-55719, on September 26, 2014 against Infinity Energy
Resources, Inc. resulting from certain professional consulting services provided for quality
control and management of seismic operations during November and December 2013 on the
Nicaraguan Concessions. Cambrian provided these services pursuant to a Master Consulting
Agreement with Infinity, dated November 20, 2013, and has claimed breach of contract for
failure to pay amounts due. On December 8, 2014, a default judgment was entered against the
Company in the amount of $96,877 plus interest and attorney fees. The Company has included
●
the impact of this litigation as a liability in its accounts payable. The Company will seek to settle
the default judgment when it has the financial resources to do so.
Torrey Hills Capital, Inc. (“Torrey”) notified the Company by letter, dated August 15, 2014, of its
demand for the payment of $56,000, which it alleged was unpaid and owed under a consulting
agreement, dated October 18, 2013. The parties entered into a consulting agreement under
which Torrey agreed to provide investor relations services in exchange for payment of $7,000
per month and the issuance of 15,000 shares of common stock. The agreement was for an
initial three month-term with automatic renewals unless terminated upon 30 days’ written notice
by either party. The Company made payments totaling $14,000 and issued 15,000 shares of
common stock during 2013. The Company contends that Torrey breached the agreement by not
performing the required services and that it had provided proper notice of termination to Torrey.
Furthermore, the Company contends that the parties agreed to settle the dispute on or about
June 19, 2014 under which it would issue 2,800 shares of common stock in full settlement of
any balance then owed and final termination of the agreement. Torrey disputed the Company’s
contentions and submitted the dispute to binding arbitration. The Company was unable to
defend itself and the arbitration panel awarded Torrey a total of $79,594 in damages. The
Company has accrued amounts in accounts payable as of June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, which management believes is sufficient to provide for the ultimate resolution of this
dispute.
●
Note 10 – Related Party Transactions
The Company does not have any employees other than the CEO and CFO. In previous years,
certain general and administrative services (for which payment is deferred) had been provided by
the CFO’s accounting firm at its standard billing rates plus out-of-pocket expenses consisting
primarily of accounting, tax and other administrative fees. The Company no longer utilizes the
CFO’s accounting for such support services and was not billed for any such services during the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The amount due to the CFO’s firm for
services previously provided was $762,407 at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and is
included in accrued liabilities at both dates.
On June 6, 2009 the Company entered into a Revenue Sharing Agreement with the officers and
directors for services provided. Infinity assigned to officers and directors a monthly payment
equal to the revenue derived from one percent (1%) of Infinity’s share of the hydrocarbons
produced at the wellhead from the Nicaraguan Concessions. The RSP will bear its proportionate
share of all costs incurred to deliver the hydrocarbons to the point of sale to an unaffiliated
purchaser, including its share of production, severance and similar taxes, and certain additional
costs. The RSP shall be paid by the last day of each month based on the revenue received by
Infinity from the purchaser of the production during the previous month from the Nicaraguan
Concessions. The Revenue Agreement does not create any obligation for Infinity to maintain or
develop the Nicaraguan Concessions and does not create any rights in the Nicaraguan
Concessions for officers and directors.
In connection with its subordinated loan, Offshore Finance, LLC was granted a one percent (1%)
revenue sharing interest in the Nicaraguan Concessions in connection with a subordinated loan
provided previously which was subsequently converted to common stock. The managing partner
of Offshore and the Company’s CFO are partners in the accounting firm which the Company
used for general corporate purposes in the past. In connection with its dissolution, Offshore
assigned its RSP to its individual members, which includes the former managing partner of
Offshore.
27
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had accrued compensation to its
officers and directors of $1,541,208 and $1,423,208, respectively.
The Company entered into a line-of-credit facility on September 23, 2013 that provides it with
borrowing capacity on a revolving basis up to a maximum of $50,000, which was increased to
$75,000 at August 28, 2015 and an initial maturity of November 28, 2013. The line of credit is
convertible to common stock at a rate of $5.00 per share. The entity providing the credit facility is
owned by an officer of another corporation for which Infinity’s president and chairman of the
board serves as president and chairman of the board. The facility is unsecured, bears interest at
8% per annum, and was renewed at its maturity several times with its current maturity date as
May 28, 2016. In consideration for the origination of the line of credit facility and the various
renewals, the Company granted the lender common stock purchase warrants. On February 28,
2016 the Company extended the line-of-credit expiration date to May 28, 2016 and issued a
warrant to purchase 10,000 common shares at an exercise price of $5.00 per share, which
warrants were immediately exercisable and expire on February 28, 2021. On May 28, 2016 the
Company extended the line-of-credit expiration date to August 28, 2016 and issued a warrant to
purchase 10,000 common shares at an exercise price of $5.00 per share, which warrants were
immediately exercisable and expire on May 28, 2021. The Company estimated the fair value of
the warrants at $904 as of the grant date for both extensions combined, which amount was
recorded as debt issuance costs and will be amortized to interest expense over the extended
term of the line-of-credit.
Note 11 – Subsequent Events
From July 1, 2016 through August 15, 2016, the Company issued a total of 164,669 shares of
common stock to the holder of the secured convertible note payable in the form of interest
payments aggregating $2,697. See Note 2 – Secured Convertible Note Payable.
The Company has not resolved the contingency related to the expired letters of credit for its
Nicaraguan Concessions (See Note 9). The Company continues to negotiate the renewal of the
letters of credit with the Nicaraguan Government and its lenders; however, there can be no
assurance that the Company will be successful in that regard.
On December 27, 2013 the Company borrowed $1,050,000 under an unsecured credit facility
with a private, third-party lender which facility has an outstanding principal balance of
$1,000,000. The facility is represented by a promissory note (the “Note”) that matured in April
2016, and is currently in technical default. The Company is seeking an extension of the maturity
date, however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain an extension or what the
final terms will be if the lender agrees to such extension.

adversely affected by changes in the fiscal regime of Nicaragua; (xi) we are continuing to
negotiate with our creditors and may face additional claims in the future; (xii) oil prices may be
affected by regional factors; (xiii) any future production will be contingent on successful
exploration, development and acquisitions to establish reserves and revenue in the future; (xv)
the oil and gas industry is highly competitive; (xvi) exploratory drilling is an uncertain process
with many risks; (xvii) oil and gas prices are volatile, and declines in prices would hurt our
revenues and ability to achieve profitable operations; (xviii) our common stock is traded on the
Pink Sheets, which may not have the visibility or liquidity that we seek for our common stock;
(xix) we depend on key personnel; (xx) sufficient voting power by coalitions of a few of our larger
stockholders to make corporate governance decisions that could have significant effect on us
and the other stockholders, including Amegy Bank, NA; (xxi) sale of substantial amounts of our
common stock that may have a depressive effect on the market price of the outstanding shares of
our common stock, including sales of shares of common stock issued to the holder of the
Convertible Note upon its conversion of portions of the outstanding principal amount of the
Convertible Note; (xxii) possible issuance of common stock subject to options and warrants may
dilute the interest of stockholders; (xxiii) our ability to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
Section 404 as it may be required; (xxiv) our nonpayment of dividends and lack of plans to pay
dividends in the future; (xxv) future sale or issuance of a substantial number of shares of our
common stock that could depress the trading price of our common stock, lower our value and
make it more difficult for us to raise capital; (xxvi) our additional securities available for issuance,
which, if issued, could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock; (xxvii) our
stock price is likely to be highly volatile due to a number of factors, including a relatively limited
public float; (xxviii) indemnification of our officers and directors; (xxix) whether we will be able to
find an industry or other financial partner to enable us to explore and develop our Nicaraguan
Concessions; and (xxx) whether we will be able to identify, acquire and finance domestic oil and

provide positive cash flow.
29
The following information should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Financial
Statements and Notes presented elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. See Note 1 –
“Nature of Operations, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to
the Condensed Financial Statements for the Three and Six Months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015.
2016 Operational and Financial Objectives
Corporate Activities
We hold a 100% working interest in any hydrocarbon deposits found under the Perlas Block
(560,000 acres/2,268 km) and Tyra Block (826,000 acres/3,342 km) located in shallow waters
offshore Nicaragua. The final approval of the EIA by the Nicaraguan government of our
environment impact study on April 13, 2013, began Sub-Period 2 for both the Tyra and Perlas
Blocks as defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions. We believe we have satisfied the acquisition,
processing and interpretation of Seismic data required in Sub-Period 2 for both the Perlas and
Tyra Blocks. Therefore, we are now in Sub-Period 3 of the exploration phase of the 30-year
Concession for both Perlas and Tyra as of December 31, 2015. Sub-Period 3 of the Nicaraguan
Concessions requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016
and the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block. We are in process of identifying at least
one potential drilling site on the Perlas block as required in Sub-Period 3 and will have to
perform supplemental EIA work prior to requesting and receiving the permit to drill from the
Nicaraguan government. The work plan on the Tyra block for Sub-Period 3 requires us to shoot
additional seismic, which is estimated to cost approximately $2,500,000 prior to the
commencement of exploratory drilling. The Company is seeking a waiver of the additional
seismic mapping on the Tyra Block and extension of time to complete its initial well from the
Nicaraguan government. There can be no assurance whether we will be able to obtain such
waiver of the requirements.
During late December 2013, we completed the 2-D seismic survey activities in the area as
required under both of the Nicaraguan Concessions at that point. We believe that the newly
acquired 2-D seismic data, together with the previously acquired reprocessed 2-D seismic,
helped us to further evaluate the structures that were previously identified with 2-D seismic in the
Eocene Zone. Our geological consultants have estimated that these Eocene structures may
contain recoverable hydrocarbons (principally oil) in place. In addition, the new 2-D seismic
acquired in 2013 provided our first geological information regarding the potential for oil resources
in the Cretaceous Zone, which we could not evaluate using less precise older 2-D seismic
mapping. We have identified multiple promising sites on the Perlas Block for exploratory drilling
and are planning the drilling of initial exploratory wells in order to determine the existence of
commercial hydrocarbon reserves, given sufficient capital. We believe that we have performed all
work necessary as of December 31, 2015 to proceed to Sub-Period 3 for the Perlas Block as
defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions, which requires the drilling of at least one exploratory
well on the Perlas concession within the following one-year period. We must first prepare and
submit a supplemental EIA to the Nicaraguan government before the drilling permit can be
issued on the Perlas Block.
We must prepare and submit the EIA supplement to the Nicaraguan Government, assuming that
it accepts the supplemental EIA and grant the drilling permit, we will be required to drill at least
one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 or risk being in default and losing our rights
under the Nicaraguan Concessions. We do not believe that we will drill a well on the Nicaraguan
Concessions during 2016 given the current state of the oil and gas commodity markets, financing
the drilling, and the challenging economics for any new exploration and development project,
especially a project in an area of the world without historical proven reserves of commercial
hydrocarbons. We believe that we will be able to negotiate extensions with the Nicaraguan
government of the required date by which an exploratory well must be drilled; however, there can
be no assurance in this regard.
30
The Company is in technical default of the Nicaraguan Concession because it has not provided
the required letters of credit to the Nicaraguan Government. In accordance with the Nicaraguan
Concession agreements, the Company had previously provided the Ministry of Energy with the
required letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for Perlas (expired March 2014) and
$408,450 for Tyra (expired September 2014). The Company had also made all required
expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training programs and as “area fees,” for
each respective year for 2010 through 2015. The Company is currently negotiating the renewal
and increase of the required letters of credit which total $1,356,227 for the Perlas block and
$278,450 for the Tyra block with the Nicaraguan Government and its lenders; however, there can
be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the regard. The Company considers it is
fully in compliance with the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions agreements, except for the
renewal of the expired letters of credit. The foregoing items remain as substantial operational and
legal issues that we must resolve in order to maintain our rights under the Nicaraguan
Concessions during 2016.
We are also seeking offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the
acreage in the Nicaraguan Concessions in exchange for cash and a carried interest in
exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement. Accordingly, we
intend to finance our business strategy through external financing, which may include debt and
equity capital raised in public and private offerings, joint ventures, sale of working or other
interests, employment of working capital and cash flow from operations, if any, and net proceeds
from the sales of assets.
Our ability to complete these activities is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not
limited to:
●The availability of the capital resources required to fund the activities;
    
 ●The availability of third party contractors for completion services; and
    
 ●The approval by regulatory agencies of applications for permits to conduct exploration activities
in a timely manner.
The Company is considering the acquisition of domestic oil and gas properties with both proven
and unproven reserves. Management believes that the current distressed state for oil and gas
properties and the resulting decline in valuations may yield an opportunity for the Company to
accumulate undervalued oil and gas assets which will produce positive cash flows even with the
decline in natural gas and crude oil commodity prices. Management believes that there may be
financing available for such cash generating oil and gas properties at reasonable cost of capital
especially when compared to the Nicaraguan Concessions which may yield higher returns but at
higher risk levels. This initiative may provide the Company with positive cash flows to address
immediate working capital needs while the environment improves for exploration projects such
as the Nicaraguan Concessions. No assurances can be given regarding the Company’s ability to
identify, acquire and finance such domestic properties or whether such properties would provide
positive cash flow.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions, arrangements,
obligations (including contingent obligations) or other relationships with any unconsolidated
entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial conditions,
changes in the financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital
resources, or significant components of revenue or expenses.
31
For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Results of Operations
Revenue
The Company had no revenues in either 2016 or 2015 as it focused solely on the exploration,
development, financing and maintenance of the Nicaraguan Concessions.
Production and Other Operating Expenses (income)
The Company had no production related operating expenses in either 2016 or 2015. The
Company sold its investment in Infinity-Texas in July 2012 and held no developed or
undeveloped oil and gas properties in the United States in 2016 and 2015.
The Company has no current domestic exploration and development activities; however, it is
seeking to identify and acquire domestic properties with both proven and unproven reserves,
given sufficient financing. It is not actively working on any domestic property, focusing instead on
the exploration, development and financing of the Nicaraguan Concessions.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses of $148,925 for the three months ended June 30, 2016
increased $26,615, or 22.0%, from $122,310 in the same period in 2015. The increase in general
and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase of $15,000 in Nicaraguan
Concession costs incurred. The Company is no longer capitalizing Nicaraguan Concession
expenditures due to its decision to fully impair the Nicaraguan Project at December 31, 2016 as a
result of the difficult oil and gas economy and noncompliance issues with the requirements of the
Concessions. The increase was also attributable to an overall increase in professional fees of
$4,095 as the Company incurred increases in audit fees.
Stock-based compensation
Stock-based compensation expenses of $-0- for the three months ended June 30, 2016
decreased $42,612, or 100% from the same period in 2015. The Company has had minimal
resources to pay employees, consultants and other service providers. Therefore, it has issued
stock options to compensate and motivate its officers, directors and other service providers in
previous years that vest generally over a two-year time period. The Company did not grant any
stock options during 2016 and 2015. The significant decrease in stock-based compensation
expense during 2016 compared to 2015 is attributable to the full vesting of the January 2014
stock option grant in January 2016, which reduced the related amortization during the three
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2015. All outstanding stock options are fully vested as
of June 30, 2016.
Interest expense
Interest expense decreased from $124,221 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $29,349
for the 2016 period. This significant decrease is attributable to the Company converting
approximately $555,000 of its interest bearing debt to common stock during early 2015. The
Company received loan proceeds of $450,000 from the Secured Convertible Note issued in May
2015 and $85,000 from two other convertible notes issued in July 2015, all of which bear interest
at 8% per annum and remained outstanding at June 30, 2016. In previous years the Company
issued short-term notes payable at various dates and extended their maturities by paying
additional compensation to the lenders chiefly in the form of warrants. The fair value of the
warrants issued to the note holders at the origination and extension dates of the short-term
promissory notes was recorded as a discount on the related debt. Amortization of the value of the
warrants and revenue sharing interests granted to the holders resulted in a substantial increase
in the overall effective borrowing costs during the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared
to the same period in 2016. Discount amortization represents a non-cash expense and totaled
$3,928 and $77,052 of total interest expense recognized in the three months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company’s current financial condition has made traditional bank loans and customary
financing terms unattainable; therefore, the Company may find it necessary to continue with
these types of short-term borrowings with high effective interest rates.

Secured Convertible Note Payable Issuance Costs
On May 7, 2015, we completed the May 2015 Private Placement of a $12.0 million principal
amount Convertible Note and a Warrant exercisable to purchase 1,800,000 shares of our
common stock, $0.0001 par value. We elected to account for and record such note on a fair value
basis. Accordingly, all related debt issuance expenses, which totaled $1,302,629 (including
$1,071,201 representing the value of the warrant to purchase 240,000 shares of common stock
issued to placement agent and $231,428 of other fees and expenses), was charged to non-
operating expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2015. No similar transaction
occurred during 2016.
Change in Fair Value of Secured Convertible Note
We issued the Secured Convertible Note in the May 2015 Private Placement and elected to
account for and record such Note on a fair value basis. We received $450,000 of proceeds at the
date of issuance and the fair market value of the Secured Convertible Note was estimated to be
$265,929 as of December 31, 2015 and $145,673 at June 30, 2016. After considering principal
repayments and additional funding received the net $11,578 and $168,100 change in fair market
value of such Note is included in the accompanying statement of operations for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Issuance of Warrant Derivative in Connection with Secured Convertible Note
The Warrant issued in the May 2015 Private Placement contains various provisions that grant the
holder ratchet and anti-dilution rights. Consequently, such Warrant is required to be treated on a
liability basis at its estimated fair value and classified as a derivative liability in the
accompanying financial statements. We recorded its origination date estimated fair value at
$8,034,007 as a non-operating expense in the three months ended March 31, 2015. The value of
the Warrant to purchase 240,000 shares granted to the placement agent in the May 2015 Private
Placement was included in secured convertible note issuance costs in the statement of
operations as previously described.
Change in Derivative Fair Value
The conversion feature of the promissory notes and the common stock purchase warrants issued
in connection with short-term notes and the secured convertible note outstanding during 2016
and 2015 are treated as derivative instruments because the promissory notes and warrants
contain ratchet and anti-dilution provisions. Accordingly, we adjusted the value of the outstanding
derivative liabilities to their estimated fair value as of June 30, 2016 and 2015. The mark-to-
market process resulted in a loss of $743 during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and a
gain of $2,202,839 during the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the gain
recognized is primarily the result of the lesser reduction in the closing market price of our
common stock between the December 31, 2015 ($0.16 per share) and June 30, 2016 ($0.07 per
share) compared to the corresponding period in 2015 ($5.50 at December 31, 2014 versus $4.10
at June 30, 2015). Generally, the fair value of the derivative liability declines when the market
value of the underlying common stock decreases compared to the derivatives exercise price.
Gain on Derecognition of liabilities
Gain on derecognition of liabilities decreased from $3,440 for the three months ended June 30,
2015 to $-0- in 2016. The Company derecognized certain previously recorded liabilities due to
the expiration of the statute of limitations on collection of such obligations for the Company.
Income Tax
For income tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
$67,415,000 as of December 31, 2015, which expire from 2025 through 2030. The Company has
provided a 100% valuation allowance against the resulting deferred tax asset due to the
uncertainty of realizing the tax benefits from its net operating loss carry-forwards.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company realized net losses. The Company
anticipates operating losses and additional tax losses for the foreseeable future and does not
believe that utilization of its tax loss carryforward is more likely than not. Therefore, because of
the uncertainty as to the ultimate utilization of the Company’s loss carryforwards, any deferred tax
asset at June 30, 2016 that resulted from anticipated benefit from future utilization of such
carryforward has been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
33
Net income (loss)
As a result of the above, we reported a net loss of $190,595 for the three months ended June 30,
2016 compared to a net loss of $7,587,600 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This
represents an improvement of $7,397,005.
Basic and Diluted Income (Loss) per Share
Basic net Income (Loss) loss per share is computed by dividing the net Income (Loss) by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income
(loss) per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the
period. Common share equivalents included in the diluted computation represent shares
issuable upon assumed exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock and “if
converted” method. For periods in which net losses from continuing operations are incurred,
weighted average shares outstanding is the same for basic and diluted loss per share
calculations, as the inclusion of common share equivalents would have an anti-dilutive effect.
The basic and diluted income (loss) per share was ($0.03) and ($2.83) for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the reasons previously noted. All outstanding
stock options and warrants to purchase common stock were considered antidilutive and therefore
excluded from the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share for the three months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015 because of the exercise price of the warrants being substantially higher than
market price in 2016 and the net loss reported for both periods. Potential shares of common stock
as of June 30, 2016 that have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share
amounted to 2,919,221 shares, which included 2,507,771 outstanding warrants and 411,450
outstanding stock options.
For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Results of Operations
Revenue
The Company had no revenues in either 2016 or 2015 as it focused solely on the exploration,
development, financing and maintenance of the Nicaraguan Concessions.
Production and Other Operating Expenses (income)
The Company had no production related operating expenses in either 2016 or 2015. The
Company sold its investment in Infinity-Texas in July 2012 and held no developed or
undeveloped oil and gas properties in the United States in 2016 and 2015.
The Company has no current or planned domestic exploration and development activities at this
time. It is not actively working on any domestic property, focusing instead on the exploration,
development and financing of the Nicaraguan Concessions.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses of $231,496 for the six months ended June 30, 2016
increased $3,317, or 1.5%, from $228,179 in the same period in 2015. The increase in general
and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase of $27,952 in Nicaraguan
Concession costs incurred. The Company is no longer capitalizing Nicaraguan Concession
expenditures due to the decision to fully impair the Nicaraguan Project at December 31, 2016 as
a result of the difficult oil and gas economy and noncompliance issues with the requirements of
the Concessions. The increase in general and administrative expenses was offset by a decrease
of $19,326 in Delaware annual report and franchise taxes for 2016 compared to 2015. The
Delaware tax is based on our total assets which decreased substantially due to the impairment of
our Nicaraguan oil and gas properties during 2015. The increase in general and administrative
costs was also offset by reductions in expenses relating to the Company attending fewer investor
conferences or similar forums during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2015,
which decreased such expenses by $13,003. The closing of the May 2015 Private Placement
reduced the need to incur additional costs related to capital raising and investor relations
activities during the 2016 period coupled with the poor investment climate for oil and gas
companies during 2016 and 2015.
34
Stock-based compensation
Stock-based compensation expenses of $7,598 for the six months ended June 30, 2016
decreased $93,374, or 92.5%, from the same period in 2015. The Company has had minimal
resources to pay employees, consultants and other service providers. Therefore, it has issued
stock options to compensate and motivate its officers, directors and other service providers in
previous years that vest generally over a two-year time period. The Company did not grant any
stock options during 2016 and 2015. The significant decrease in stock-based compensation
expense during 2016 compared to 2015 is attributable to the full vesting of the January 2014
stock option grant in January 2016, which reduced the related amortization during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2015. All outstanding stock options are fully vested as of June
30, 2016.
Interest expense
Interest expense decreased from $697,304 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $107,518
for the 2016 period. This significant decrease is attributable to the Company converting
approximately $555,000 of its interest bearing debt to common stock during early 2015. The
Company received loan proceeds of $450,000 from the Secured Convertible Note issued in the
May 2015 Private Placement and $85,000 from two other convertible notes issued in July 2015,
all of which bear interest at 8% per annum and remained outstanding at June 30, 2016. In
previous years the Company issued short-term notes payable at various dates and extended
their maturities by paying additional compensation to the lenders chiefly in the form of warrants.
The fair value of the warrants issued to the note holders at the origination and extension dates of
the short-term promissory notes was recorded as a discount on the related debt. Amortization of
the value of the warrants and revenue sharing interests granted to the holders resulted in a
substantial increase in the overall effective borrowing costs during the six months ended June
30, 2015 compared to the same period in 2016. Discount amortization represents a non-cash
expense and totaled $52,981 and $600,836 of total interest expense recognized in the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company’s current financial condition has made traditional bank loans and customary
financing terms unattainable; therefore, the Company may find it necessary to continue with
these types of short-term borrowings with high effective interest rates.

(including $1,071,201 representing the value of the warrant to purchase 240,000 shares of
common stock issued to placement agent and $231,428 of other fees and expenses), was
charged to non-operating expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2015. No similar
transaction occurred during 2016.
Change in Fair Value of Secured Convertible Note
We issued the Secured Convertible Note in the May 2015 Private Placement and elected to
account for and record such Note on a fair value basis. We received $450,000 of proceeds at the
date of issuance and the fair market value of the Secured Convertible Note was estimated to be
$265,929 as of December 31, 2015 and $145,673 at June 30, 2016. After considering principal
repayments and additional funding received the net $64,784 and $168,100 change in fair market
value of such Note is included in the accompanying statement of operations for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Issuance of Warrant Derivative in Connection with Secured Convertible Note
The Warrant issued in the May 2015 Private Placement contains various provisions that grant the
holder ratchet and anti-dilution rights. Consequently, such Warrant is required to be treated on a

accompanying financial statements. We recorded its origination date estimated fair value at
$8,034,007 as a non-operating expense in the six months ended June 30, 2015. The value of the
Warrant to purchase 240,000 shares granted to the placement agent in the May 2015 Private
Placement was included in Secured Convertible Note issuance costs in the statement of
operations as previously described.
Change in Derivative Fair Value
The conversion feature of the promissory notes and the common stock purchase warrants issued
in connection with short-term notes and the Secured Convertible Note outstanding during 2016
and 2015 are treated as derivative instruments because the promissory notes and warrants
contain ratchet and anti-dilution provisions. Accordingly, we adjusted the value of the outstanding
derivative liabilities to their estimated fair value as of June 30, 2016 and 2015. The mark-to-
market process resulted in a gain of $117,768 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and a
gain of $2,468,106 during the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the gain
recognized is primarily the result of the lesser reduction in the closing market price of our
common stock between the December 31, 2015 ($0.16 per share) and June 30, 2016 ($0.07 per
share) compared to the corresponding period in 2015 ($5.50 at December 31, 2014 versus $4.10
at June 30, 2015). Generally, the fair value of the derivative liability declines when the market
value of the underlying common stock decreases compared to the derivatives exercise price.
Gain on Derecognition of Liabilities
Gain on derecognition of liabilities increased from $174,457 for the six months ended June 30,
2015 to $1,134,082 in 2016. The Company derecognized certain previously recorded liabilities
due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on collection of such obligations for the
Company.
Income Tax
For income tax purposes, the Company has net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
$67,415,000 as of December 31, 2015, which expire from 2025 through 2030. The Company has
provided a 100% valuation allowance against the resulting deferred tax asset due to the

deferred tax asset at June 30, 2016 that resulted from anticipated benefit from future utilization of
such carryforward has been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
Net income (loss)
As a result of the above, we reported net income of $840,454 for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to a net loss of $7,888,628 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This
represents an improvement of $8,729,082.
Basic and Diluted Income (Loss) per Share
Basic net Income (Loss) loss per share is computed by dividing the net Income (Loss) by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income
(loss) per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the

The basic and diluted income (loss) per share was $0.16 and ($2.99) for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the reasons previously noted. All outstanding stock
options and warrants to purchase common stock were considered antidilutive and therefore
excluded from the calculation of diluted income (loss) per share for the three months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015 because of the exercise price of the warrants being substantially higher than
market price in 2016 and the net loss reported for 2015. Potential shares of common stock as of
June 30, 2016 that have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share
amounted to 2,919,221 shares, which included 2,507,771 outstanding warrants and 411,450
outstanding stock options.

Liquidity and Capital Resources; Going Concern
We have had a history of losses and have generated little or no operating revenues for a number
of years as we concentrated on development of our Nicaraguan Concessions, which is a long-
term, high-risk/reward exploration project in an otherwise unproven part of the world. Historically,
we financed our operations through the issuance of redeemable preferred stock and various
short and long-term debt financing that contained some level of detachable warrants to provide
the holder’s with a level of equity participation should we be successful exploring our Nicaraguan
Concessions.
During 2013 we borrowed approximately $1,825,000 on a short-term basis by issuing various
subordinated promissory notes with detachable warrants to purchase common shares. The fair
value of the warrants resulted in a substantial increase in the overall effective borrowing costs.
We used the proceeds of these notes to repay previously issued notes, including the foregoing
related party note, to meet obligations and conduct seismic mapping related to our Nicaraguan
Concessions and to provide working capital. In addition, we entered into an unsecured line-of-
credit with a related party that supplemented its working capital needs and also provided
detachable warrants to purchase common stock that increased the overall cost of the borrowing.
In April 2013, we conducted a private placement of units composed of common stock and
warrants under which we raised $890,000 in proceeds and exchanged $125,000 principal
amount of an outstanding note plus accrued interest for units. We used part of these proceeds to
retire notes issued earlier in 2013.
We were unable to raise long-term capital in 2014 to pay the majority of the outstanding short-
term promissory notes on their respective maturity dates. We were able to negotiate extensions of
the maturity dates on these short-term promissory notes by issuing additional warrants
exercisable to purchase shares of common stock and, in one case, granting a revenue sharing
interest in our Nicaraguan Concessions.
In the first quarter 2015, we were able to increase our line-of-credit to a maximum of $100,000,
which provided us some liquidity, but were unable to obtain other sources of capital. On February
28, 2015, the short-term note holders of maturing debt exercised their right to convert principal
balances totaling $475,000 and accrued interest totaling $28,630 into 100,726 shares of common
stock at an exchange rate of $5.00 per share. In addition, on June 30, 2015, the lender who
provides the line-of-credit facility converted a partial principal balance totaling $50,000 into
10,000 shares of common stock at a price of $5.00 per share. Such debt to equity conversions
helped to reduce our near term cash needs.
In July 2015, the Company issued two promissory notes for total cash proceeds of $85,000. The
promissory notes have maturity dates that have been extended several times and currently
mature in August 2016. In connection with the origination and extension of the notes, the
Company issued warrants exercisable to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price
of $5.60 per share. The warrants are immediately exercisable and terminate five years from their
dates of issuance.
On December 27, 2013 the Company borrowed $1,050,000 under the December 2013 Note,
which is an unsecured credit facility with a private, third-party lender. Effective April 7, 2015 the
Company and the lender agreed to extend the maturity date of the December 2013 Note from
April 7, 2015 to the earlier of (i) April 7, 2016 or (ii) the payment in full of the Investor Note issued
in the May 2015 Private Placement in the principal amount of $9,550,000 (the “New Maturity
Date”). All other terms of the Note remained the same and the remaining principal balance was
reduced to $1,000,000 as of June 30, 2016 after the $50,000 principal repayment required by the
extension agreement.
The December 2013 Note may be prepaid without penalty at any time. The December 2013 Note
is subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness, as such terms are defined in the
December 2013 Note. The December 2013 Note matured in April 2016 and is currently in
technical default. The Company is seeking an extension of the maturity date; however there can
be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such extension or what the final terms will be if the
lender agrees to such an extension.
37
On May 7, 2015 the Company completed the May 2015 Private Placement of $12.0 million
Secured Convertible Note and a Warrant exercisable to purchase 1,800,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock with an institutional investor. At the closing of the May 2015 Private
Placement, the investor acquired the Convertible Note by paying $450,000 in cash and issuing
the Investor Note, secured by cash, with a principal amount of $9,550,000. Assuming all amounts
payable to the Company under the Investor Note are paid, the May 2015 Private Placement will
result in gross proceeds of $10.0 million before placement agent fees and other expenses
associated with the transaction, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Company
used the initial proceeds from the closing to retire certain outstanding obligations, including the
2015 area and training fees of approximately $155,000 owed to the Nicaraguan government
relating to its Nicaragua Concessions, and to provide additional working capital.
The Company will receive the remaining cash proceeds upon each voluntary or mandatory
prepayment of the Investor Note. The investor may, at its option and at any time, voluntarily
prepay the Investor Note, in whole or in part.
The Convertible Note matures on the three-year anniversary of its issuance, bears interest at 8%
per annum, and is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into shares of the Company’s
common stock at $5.00 per share (the “Conversion Price”). As a part of the May 2015 Private
Placement, the Company issued a Warrant to the investor giving it the right to purchase up to an
aggregate of 1,800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per
share. The Warrant is exercisable commencing six months from the date of issuance for a period
of seven years from the date of issuance.
The investor has no right to convert the Convertible Note or exercise the Warrant to the extent
that such conversion or exercise would result in the investor being the beneficial owner of in
excess of 9.99% of the Company’s common stock. The Convertible Note ranks senior to the
Company’s existing and future indebtedness and is secured by all of the assets of the Company,
excluding the Nicaraguan Concessions.
WestPark Capital acted as placement agent for the Company in the May 2015 Private Placement
and received a fee of 6% of cash proceeds, or $600,000, if and when the Company receives the
full cash proceeds. It received $27,000 of such amount at the closing plus the reimbursement of
legal fees totaling $7,500. The Company also issued WestPark a warrant exercisable to
purchase 240,000 shares of common stock at a price of $5.00 per share. The warrant was
exercisable upon from the date of issuance for a period of seven years.
In summary, as of June 30, 2016, we owed: (i) $68,303 on our line-of-credit, which is due August
28, 2016; (ii) the two promissory notes in the total principal amount of $85,000, which are due in
August 2016; (iii) the Secured Convertible note with a fair value of $145,673, which is due in 26
monthly installment payments either in cash or stock; and (iv) and the December 2013 Note in
the principal amount of $1,000,000, which was due in April 2016 and is currently in technical
default. We are seeking to extend the maturity date in order to cure the technical default; however
there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such extension or what the final terms will
be if the lender agrees to such extension. We intend to seek additional funding under the secured
convertible note and other short-term debt financing to provide the funds necessary to pay-off the
line-of-credit when it comes due and to provide working capital to fund normal operations,
although we can provide no assurances that we will be successful in this regard. Our current
financial condition has made traditional bank loans and normal financing terms unattainable;
therefore, we may find it necessary to continue with these types of short-term borrowings with
high effective interest rates.
The Company is in Sub-Period 3 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concessions for both
Perlas and Tyra as of June 30, 2015. Sub-Period 3 of the Nicaraguan Concessions requires the
drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 and the shooting of
additional seismic on the Tyra Block. The Company is in process of identifying at least one
potential drilling site on the Perlas Block as required in Sub-Period 3 and will have to perform
supplemental EIA work prior to requesting and receiving the permit to drill from the Nicaraguan
government. The work plan on the Tyra block for Sub-Period 3 requires the Company to shoot
additional seismic, which is estimated to cost approximately $2,500,000 prior to the
commencement of exploratory drilling. The Company is seeking a waiver of the additional
seismic mapping on the Tyra Block and extension of time to complete its initial well from the
Nicaraguan government. There can be no assurance whether it will be able to obtain a waiver of
the requirements.
38
In accordance with the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company has previously
provided the Ministry of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of $443,100 for
Perlas (expired March 2014) and $408,450 for Tyra (expired September 2014). The Company
has also made all required expenditures related to the Nicaraguan Concessions for training
programs and as “area fees,” for each respective year for 2010 through 2015. In accordance with
the Nicaraguan Concession agreements, the Company must provide the Ministry of Energy with
the required letters of credit in the amounts which total $1,356,227 for the Perlas block and
$278,450 for the Tyra block for exploration requirements on the leases as required by the
Nicaraguan Concessions, to replace the expired letters of credit. The minimum cash
requirements to maintain and comply with the minimum work program as defined in the
Nicaraguan Concessions for the next twelve-month period will be approximately $5,500,000 for
the Perlas Block which includes all costs to prepare for and drill the initial exploratory well, and
$280,000 for the Tyra Block, assuming the waiver is granted regarding the seismic mapping. If
such waiver is not granted, the Company estimates it will require approximately $2,500,000 for
the seismic mapping. Finally, the Company estimates it will need approximately $300,000 to
prepare and submit an environmental supplement to the Nicaraguan government to identify and
receive authorization to drill up to five wells in the Concessions.
The Company has identified multiple sites for exploratory drilling and is planning the initial
exploratory wells in order to determine the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves,
subject to receipt from the Nicaraguan government of authorizations for the drilling of up to five
wells. In order to meet its obligations under the Perlas Block of the Nicaraguan Concession, the
Company must drill its initial exploratory well during 2016 or risk being in default and losing its
rights under the Nicaraguan Concessions.
We are negotiating the renewal and/or adjustment of the required letters of credit with the
Nicaraguan Government. Further, we are seeking a waiver of the 3-D seismic mapping
requirement because we do not believe it will be effective in providing additional information due
the supplemental water depth and other factors. We plan to prepare the necessary information to
submit to the EIA in order to obtain the necessary authorizations to drill up to five locations in the
Concessions. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of the foregoing
regards. Except for the foregoing items, we believe we are in full compliance with the terms of the
Nicaraguan Concessions agreements.
The Company must successfully comply with the restrictions related to the secured convertible
note in order to release the remaining $9.49 million in funding under the Investor Note or it must
raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital in the immediate future in order to fund: (1)
the required letters of credit to the Nicaraguan Government; (2) fund approximately $300,000 to
prepare and submit an environmental supplement to the Nicaraguan government to identify and
receive authorization to drill up to five wells in the Concessions; (3) the drilling of at least one
exploratory well on the Perlas Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016; (4) the
shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions if it is unable to
negotiate a waiver of such requirement form the Nicaraguan government; (5) the payment of
normal day-to-day operations and corporate overhead; and (6) the payment of outstanding debt
and financial obligations as they become due including the $1.0 December 2013 Note which
currently is in technical default. These are substantial operational and financial issues that must
be successfully addressed during 2016 or the Company’s ability to satisfy the conditions
necessary to maintain its Nicaragua Concessions will be in significant doubt. The Company is
actively seeking new outside sources of debt and equity capital in order fund the substantial
needs enumerated above, however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such
capital or obtain it on favorable terms or within the timeframe necessary to cure the technical
defaults existing on the Nicaraguan Concessions or to meet its ongoing requirements to drill the
exploratory wells.
In addition to the minimum cash requirements related to the Nicaraguan Concessions, we
estimate that we will require approximately $330,000 of working capital to maintain corporate
operations for the next 12 months, but not including approximately $1,000,000 principal amount
of a short-term promissory note which matured in April 2016 and is in technical default, plus
accrued interest, the $85,000 principal due on the two promissory notes due in October 2016 and
the $68,303 currently outstanding under a revolving line of credit due August 2016. We owe
$4,945,000 in trade payables related to seismic activities already performed (in December 2013)
but not yet paid; however, we believe such party has agreed to extend the time for payment of
this obligation to until such time as we begin drilling operations on the Nicaraguan Concessions.
We also owe other obligations to third parties as noted on our balance sheet, which we intend to
pay, negotiate and/or settle prior to the beginning of any drilling operations, although there is no
assurance that will be able negotiate settlements with venders or avoid collection activities.
39
We plan to raise long-term capital to satisfy the foregoing needs through an offering of our equity
or debt securities and/or through a commercial relationship with other industry operators, which
may involve the granting of revenue or other interests in the Nicaraguan Concessions in
exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or the
creation of a joint venture or other strategic partnership. There can be no assurance that we will
obtain such funding or obtain it on terms acceptable to us. Further, if we cannot meet our
obligations respecting the Nicaraguan Concessions, we may lose our rights to them.
The Company does not believe that it will be able to meet all of the Nicaraguan Concession
requirements in 2016, including proceeding to drill the required exploration well during 2016
given the current state of the oil and gas commodity markets and the challenging economics for
any new exploration and development project especially a project in an area of the world without
historical proven reserves of commercial hydrocarbons. The Company believes that it will be
able to negotiate extensions with the Nicaraguan government relative to the required date by
which any exploratory wells must be drilled as well as the other requirements for maintaining the
Concessions; however, there can be no assurance in this regard. These are substantial
operational and legal issues that the Company must resolve in order to maintain its rights under
the Nicaraguan Concessions during 2016.
Due to the uncertainties related to these matters, there exists substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification
of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable
assurance of achieving the control objectives, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on their evaluation as of June 30, 2016, the end of the
period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective but not timely
in assuring that financial statement presentation and disclosure are in conformity with those
which are required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. The lack of timeliness is a material
weakness which management believes could be relieved with sufficient working capital to allow
full-time accounting staff or the equivalent.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, have inherent limitations.
Therefore, even a system which is determined to be effective cannot provide absolute assurance
that all control issues have been detected or prevented. Our systems of internal controls are
designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is currently involved in litigation as follows:
●
In October 2012 the State of Texas filed a lawsuit naming Infinity-Texas, the Company and the
corporate officers of Infinity-Texas, seeking $30,000 of reclamation costs associated with a
single well, in addition to administrative expenses and penalties. The Company engaged in
negotiations with the State of Texas in late 2012 and early 2013 and reached a settlement
agreement that would reduce the aggregate liability, in this action and any extension of this to
other Texas wells, to $45,103, which amount has been paid. Certain performance obligations
remain which must be satisfied in order to finally settle and dismiss the matter.
Pending satisfactory performance of the performance obligations and their acceptance by the
State of Texas, the officers have potential liability regarding the above matter, and the officers
are held personally harmless by indemnification provisions of the Company. Therefore, to
extent they might actually occur, these liabilities are the obligations of the Company.
Management estimates that the liabilities associated with this matter will not exceed $780,000,
calculated as $30,000 for each of the 26 Infinity-Texas operated wells. This related liability, less
the payment made to the State of Texas in 2012 in the amount of $45,103, is included in the
asset retirement obligation on the accompanying balance sheets.
Cambrian Consultants America, Inc. (“Cambrian”) filed an action in the District Court of Harris
County, Texas, number CV2014-55719, on September 26, 2014 against Infinity Energy
Resources, Inc. resulting from certain professional consulting services provided for quality
control and management of seismic operations during November and December 2013 on the
Nicaraguan Concessions. Cambrian provided these services pursuant to a Master Consulting
Agreement with Infinity, dated November 20, 2013, and has claimed breach of contract for
failure to pay amounts due. On December 8, 2014, a default judgment was entered against the
●
Company in the amount of $96,877 plus interest and attorney fees. The Company has included
the impact of this litigation as a liability in its accounts payable. The Company will seek to settle
the default judgment when it has the financial resources to do so.
Torrey Hills Capital, Inc. (“Torrey”) notified the Company by letter, dated August 15, 2014, of its
demand for the payment of $56,000, which it alleged was unpaid and owed under a consulting
agreement, dated October 18, 2013. The parties entered into a consulting agreement under
which Torrey agreed to provide investor relations services in exchange for payment of $7,000
per month and the issuance of 15,000 shares of common stock. The agreement was for an
initial three month-term with automatic renewals unless terminated upon 30 days’ written notice
by either party. The Company made payments totaling $14,000 and issued 15,000 shares of
common stock during 2013. The Company contends that Torrey breached the agreement by not
performing the required services and that it had provided proper notice of termination to Torrey.
Furthermore, the Company contends that the parties agreed to settle the dispute on or about
June 19, 2014 under which it would issue 2,800 shares of common stock in full settlement of
any balance then owed and final termination of the agreement. Torrey disputes the Company’s
contentions and submitted the dispute to binding arbitration. The Company was unable to
defend itself and the arbitration panel awarded Torrey a total of $79,594 in damages. The
Company has accrued amounts in accounts payable as of June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, which management believes is sufficient to provide for the ultimate resolution of this
dispute.
●
ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company entered into the following
unregistered sales of equity securities:
●
On May 28, 2016 the Company negotiated an extension of the line-of-credit facility to August
28, 2016 and granted the lender common stock purchase warrants exercisable to purchase an
aggregate of 10,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share, which
warrants were immediately exercisable and expire on May 28, 2021. The Company used the
loan proceeds for working capital and paid no compensation to any party in connection with the
establishment of the credit facility and issuance of the warrants. It relied on the exemption from
registration set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for issuance of the credit facility and
warrants.
41
In May 2016, the Company negotiated an extension of the maturity date for each of the two
promissory notes with an aggregate principal balance of $85,000. The promissory notes have
●
extended maturity dates to October 2016. In connection with the extension of the maturity
dates, the Company issued warrants exercisable to purchase 8,500 shares of common stock at
an exercise price of $5.60 per share. The warrants are immediately exercisable and terminate
five years from their dates of issuance. The Company relied on the exemption from registration
set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for issuance of the foregoing notes and
warrants. It paid no compensation in connection with the issuance of the notes and warrants.
The Company is required to make monthly installment payments under its Secured Convertible
Note which can be made in the form of cash, common stock or a combination at the Company’s
discretion. In accordance with the Note provisions. The Company delivered a total of 2,263,622
shares of common stock to the Secured Convertible Note holder representing required
principal repayments ($113,040 principal balances) and 62,873 representing interest payments
($3,140 interest payments) during the three months ended June 30, 2016. The 2,263,622
shares delivered to the holder of the Secured Convertible Note during the three months ended
June 30, 2016 were issued under an exemption from registration set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of
the Securities Act.
