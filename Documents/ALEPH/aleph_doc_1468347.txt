1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
9
The  accompanying  unaudited  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Manas  Petroleum  Corporation  ("Manas"  or  the  “Company")  and  its  subsidiaries 
(collectively, together with the Company, the “Group”) for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 have been prepared in accordance with
U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  for  interim  financial  information  and  with  the  instructions  to  Form  10-Q  and  Article  10  of  Regulation  S-X. 
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. 
These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, included in the 
Group's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.
In terms of the oil and gas industry lifecycle, the Company considers itself to be an exploration stage company. Since it has not realized any revenues from its 
planned principal operations, the Company presents its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America (US GAAP) that apply in establishing operating enterprises, i.e. development stage companies. As an exploration stage enterprise, the Company discloses 
the deficit accumulated during the exploration stage and the cumulative statements of operations and cash flows from inception to the current balance sheet date.
The Company, formerly known as Express Systems Corporation, was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 9, 1988.
On April 10, 2007, the Company completed a Exchange Transaction whereby it acquired its then sole subsidiary DWM Petroleum AG (“DWM”) pursuant to an 
exchange agreement signed in November 2006 whereby 100% of the shares of DWM were exchanged for 80,000,000 common shares of the Company. At the 
closing of the Exchange Transaction, the Company issued 800,000 shares as finders’ fees at a price equal to the closing price of $3.20 per share.
The acquisition of DWM has been accounted for as a merger of a private operating company into a non-operating public shell. Consequently, the Company is the 
continuing legal registrant for regulatory purposes and DWM is treated as the continuing accounting acquirer for accounting and reporting purposes. The assets 
and liabilities of DWM remained at historic cost. Under US GAAP in transactions involving the merger of a private operating company into a non-operating public 
shell,  the  transaction  is  equivalent  to  the  issuance  of  stock  by  DWM  for  the  net  monetary  assets  of  the  Company,  accompanied  by  a  recapitalization.  The 
accounting is identical to a reverse acquisition, except that no goodwill or other intangibles are recorded.
The  Group  follows  a  strategy  focused  on  the  exploration  and  development  of  oil  and  gas  resources  in  Central  and  East  Asia  (Kyrgyz  Republic,  Republic  of 
Tajikistan  and  Republic  of  Mongolia)  and  in  the  Balkan  Region  (participation  in  Petromanas  Energy  Inc.  with  activities  in  Albania).  Although  the  Group  is 
currently  focused  primarily  on  projects  located  in  certain  geographic  regions,  it  remains  open  to  attractive  opportunities  in  other  areas.  There  are  no  known 
reserves on any of the Group’s properties.
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Group’s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures, if any, of contingent 
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
The accompanying financial data as of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 and for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 
and for the period from inception, May 25, 2004, to September 30, 2011, has been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
10
The complete accounting policies followed by the Group are set forth in Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements contained in the Group's Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments, except as disclosed herein) necessary to present a fair statement of 
financial position as of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, results of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 
2010 and for the period from inception, May 25, 2004, to September 30, 2011, cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 and for 
the period from inception, May 25, 2004, to September 30, 2011 and statement of shareholders’ equity (deficit) for the period from inception, May 25, 2004, to 
September 30, 2011, as applicable, have been made. The results of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 are not necessarily 
indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future periods.
3. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-13, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Effect of Denominating the Exercise Price of a Share-Based 
Payment Award in the Currency of the Market in Which the Underlying Equity Security Trades." ASU 2010-13 provides amendments to Topic 718 to clarify that 
an employee share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of  the entity's equity
securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market, performance, or service condition. Therefore, an entity would not classify 
such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity. The amendments in ASU 2010-13 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those 
fiscal  years,  beginning  on  or  after December  15,  2010.  The  Company  adopted ASU  2010-13  as of  January  1,  2011  and  its application had  no  impact  on  the 
Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

6. STOCK COMPENSATION PROGRAM
2007 Omnibus Stock Option Plan
11
On May 1, 2007, the Board of Directors approved the granting of stock options according to a Nonqualified Stock Option Plan. The purpose of this stock option 
plan was: (a) to ensure the retention of the services of existing executive personnel, key employees, and Directors of the Company or its affiliates; (b) to attract and 
retain competent new executive personnel, key employees, consultants and Directors; (c) to provide incentive to all such personnel, employees, consultants and 
Directors to devote their utmost effort and skill to the advancement and betterment of the Company, by permitting them to participate in the ownership of the 
Company and thereby in any success and increase in value of the Company; and (d) allowing vendors, service providers, consultants, business associates, strategic 
partners and others the opportunity to participate in the ownership of the Company and thereby participate in its success.
This Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (“NQSO Plan”) provides for grants of stock and nonqualified stock options (“NQSOs”) up to an aggregate maximum of 
20,000,000.
2011 Stock Option Plan
At the Company’s Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders held on September 22, 2011, the shareholders approved the Company’s 2011 stock option plan. 
The purpose of the 2011 stock option plan is to advance the interests of the Company by encouraging its directors, officers, employees and consultants to acquire 
shares of the Company’s common stock, thereby increasing their proprietary interest in the Company, encouraging them to remain associated with the Company 
and providing them with additional incentive to assist the Company in building value.
The 2011 Stock Option Plan authorizes the Company to issue options to purchase such number of the Company’s common shares as is equal to up to 10% of the 
number of issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock at the time of the grant (it is the type of stock option plan referred to as a “rolling” stock 
option plan).
If all or any portion of any stock option granted under the 2011 Stock Option Plan expires or terminates without having been exercised in full, the unexercised 
balance will be returned to the pool of stock available for grant under the 2011 stock option plan.
Recognition of Stock-based Compensation Costs
Stock-based compensation costs are recognized in earnings using the fair-value based method for all awards granted. For employees fair value is estimated at the 
grant date and for non-employees fair value is re-measured at each reporting date. Compensation costs for unvested stock options and unvested share grants are
expensed over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis.
Grants
On  January  5,  2011,  the  Company  issued  1,000  shares  to  a  consultant  for  services  performed  during  the  month  of  December  2010  pursuant  to  a  consulting 
agreement entered into on December 7, 2010.
On January 10, 2011, the Company issued 923,317 shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $0.26 per share upon exercise of stock options. 250,000 of 
these shares are subject to a dribble-out clause, which allows a cumulative release of 3% of these shares (7,500 shares) every quarter.
On  February  3,  2011,  the  Company  issued  1,186  shares  to  a  consultant  for  services  performed  during  the  month  of  January  2011  pursuant  to  a  consulting 
agreement entered into on December 7, 2010.
12
On March 2, 2011, the Company issued 1,765 shares to a consultant for services performed during the month of February 2011 pursuant to a consulting agreement 
entered into on December 7, 2010.
On March 31, 2011, 1,500,000 vested options with an exercise price of $0.70 per share expired unexercised as a result of the termination, effective December 31, 
2010, of an employment agreement.
On April 1, 2011, the Company issued 2,131 shares to a consultant for services performed during the month of March 2011 pursuant to a consulting agreement 
dated in December 2010.
On May 17, 2011, the Company issued 100,000 shares of its common stock to an employee pursuant to an employment agreement dated May 1, 2010. These 
shares are subject to a hold period until May 1, 2012.
On September 1, 2011, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with a consultant for the provision of investor relations and marketing services to the 
Company. Under the terms of the consulting agreement, the consultant will be paid a monthly fee of $10,000 and the Company issued 500,000 stock options to 
purchase shares of its common stock at an exercise price of $0.225 per share until September 1, 2016. These options are to vest in three installments over a period 
of 18 months, i.e. 166,666 options vest on March 1, 2012, 166,667 options vest on September 1, 2012 and 166,667 options vest on March 1, 2013.
On September 22, 2011 the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of its common stock to a director in part as compensation for services previously provided and in 
part as an incentive to him to continue to provide services to the Company in the future. Half of the 2,000,000 shares are subject to a one-year hold period from the 
date of issuance, while the other half are subject to a two-year hold period from the date of issuance.
On September 22, 2011, the Company issued under the 2011 stock option plan a total of 9,100,000 stock options to four directors, two officers and one employee. 
All of these options are for a term of ten years from the date of grant, have an exercise price of $0.215 (being the closing share price, last sale of the day on 
September 21, 2011, on the OTC BB) and vest in four equal installments over 24 months, with installments vesting on March 22, 2012, September 22, 2012, 
March 22, 2013 and September 22, 2013.
6.1. Stock Option Grants
The  Company  calculates  the  fair  value  of  options  granted  by  applying  the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model.  Expected  volatility  is  either  based  on  the
Company’s own historical share price volatility, or on an average of historical volatility data from a peer group, whichever is more suitable to price the respective 
stock option grant. The Company’s share price data can be traced back to April 2, 2007, and the Company believes that this set of data is sufficient to determine
expected volatility as input for the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In cases, where the contractual option term substantially exceeds the Company’s own 
historical data, information regarding historical volatility from the peer group is considered when determining expected volatility.
The weighted average assumptions for the variables used in the Black-Scholes model during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 
are noted in the following table:
Expected dividend yield

respectively.

As of September 30, 2011 the expected total of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock-option grants was $2,093,780. The Company expects to 
recognize this amount over a weighted average period of 1.85 years.
6.2. Share Grants
The Company calculates the fair value of share grants at the grant date based on the market price at closing. For restricted share grants, the Company applies a 
prorated discount of 12% on the market price of the shares over the restriction period. The discount rate is an estimate of the cost of capital, based on previous 
long-term debt the Company has issued.
The following table summarizes the Company's activity with respect to share grants for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011:

As  of  September  30,  2011  the  expected  total  of  unrecognized  compensation  costs  related  to  unvested  share  grants  was  $219,575.  The  Company  expects  to 
recognize this amount over a weighted average period of 3.58 years.

registration  statement  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  on  Form  S-1  in  the  United  States.  In  the  Offering,  the  Company  sold  a  total  of 
44,450,500 units at a price of $0.50 per unit for aggregate gross proceeds of $22,225,250. Each unit consisted of one share of common stock in the capital of the 
Company and one common share purchase warrant (“Unit Warrants”). Each Unit Warrant entitles the purchaser to purchase one additional common share until 
May 6, 2014 at a purchase price of $0.70.
Raymond James Ltd. acted as agent in the Offering. As consideration for its assistance, the Company paid to Raymond James a cash commission equal to 6.75% 
of the gross proceeds of the offering (i.e. $ 1,500,204) and reimbursed Raymond James for expenses. In addition, the Company issued to Raymond James agents' 
warrants (“Agent Warrants”) that entitle Raymond James to purchase 1,333,515 shares of the Company's common stock at a purchase price of $0.60 until May 6, 
2013. The fair value of the Agent Warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The inputs for the variables used in the Black-Scholes 
formula per May 6, 2011 are shown in the following table:

The fair value per  Agent Warrant was $0.2101. The  total costs associated with all Agent Warrants amounted to $280,171. This amount was directly charged 
against equity and had no impact on the Company’s statement of operations.

Net cash proceeds from the public offering amounted to $19,877,000 and were recorded in shareholders’ equity, net of non-cash issuance costs associated with the 
Agent Warrants, i.e. $19,596,829. Refer to Note 9 for the discussion of the warrants.
8. DEBENTURE
On April 30, 2008, the Company successfully negotiated a mezzanine tranche of bridge financing and raised $4,000,000 through the issuance of 4,000 debenture 
notes (Debentures) of $1,000 each and 1,000,000 detachable warrants. The warrants are exercisable to purchase the Company’s unregistered common shares at 
$2.10 per share and will expire on April 30, 2010. The net proceeds after paying a finder’s fee were $3,790,000. The Debentures bear an interest of 8% per annum 
payable twice a year (June and December) and are due and payable in full two years from the date of issuance (April 30, 2010). The Debentures can be prepaid 
along with any unpaid interest at the Company’s request without prepayment premium or penalty. The Debentures can be converted into unregistered common 
shares at any time on demand of the holder at a conversion price based upon the average price of the 20 days trading price prior to conversion. The conversion 
price of 2,000 of the Debentures is subject to a floor of $1.00 per share. Interest can be paid in the equivalent amount of unregistered common shares of the 
Company.  If  the  Company  issues  shares  for  proceeds  in  excess  of  $40,000,000,  then  up  to  50%  of  the  proceeds  are  required  to  be  used  to  pay  down  the 
Debentures.
15
The aggregate proceeds received have been allocated between the detachable warrants and the Debentures on a relative fair value basis. Accordingly, $240,000 
was credited to additional paid in capital with respect to the warrants.
At the date of issuance the conversion price determined in accordance with the Debenture agreement was less than the actual share price on the issuance date. This 
resulted in a beneficial conversion feature of $557,989, which has been amortized using the effective interest rate method and recorded as part of interest expense 
over the term of the Debenture.
Debt issuance costs of $210,000 were incurred and were amortized over the term of the Debentures using the effective interest rate method. For the nine-month 
periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 the Company amortized debt issuance costs related to Debentures of $0 and $67,400, respectively. For the three-
month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 the Company amortized debt issuance costs related to debentures of $0 and $0, respectively.
On March 9, 2010, we fully repaid prior to its maturity the principal and interest accrued.
For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 the Company accreted the Debentures for the discount, including the beneficial conversion feature 
by $0 and $112,821 (i.e. $78,974 accretion of discount and $33,847 loss on extinguishment of debt), respectively.
For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 the Company had interest expense of $0 and $0, respectively.
9. WARRANTS
As  of  September  30,  2011  and  December  31,  2010,  the  Company  had  a  total  of  45,934,015  and  150,000  warrants  outstanding  to  purchase  common  stock, 
respectively. Upon completion of its public offering on May 6, 2011, the Company issued 44,450,500 Unit Warrants and 1,333,515 Agent Warrants. The Unit 
Warrants are exercisable until May 6, 2014 and the Agent Warrants until May 6, 2013, respectively (please refer to Note 7, above, for additional information about 
this public offering). In accordance with ASC 815, the Company determined that the Unit Warrants and the Agent Warrants are to be classified in stockholders’
equity due to the fact that there are no cash settlement provisions, no re-set provisions or any other provisions that would require liability accounting.
The Company has enough shares of common stock authorized in the event these warrants are exercised.

10. CONTINGENT CONVERTIBLE LOAN
On August 18, 2008, the Company issued contingent convertible loans (the “Loans”) with an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 and disposed of 8% of its 
interest in it Mongolian project (Blocks 13 and 14) for aggregate proceeds of $2,000,000. The net proceeds after paying a finder’s fee were $1,860,000. The 
Company  is  responsible  for  the  Loan  holder’s  share  of  the  exploration  costs  attributable  to  Blocks  13  and  14  through  phases  1,  2  and  3  (hereinafter,  the 
“Participation Liability”).
The  Company  has  allocated  part  of  the  gross  proceeds  to  the  Participation  Liability.  The  Company  has  estimated  that  there  is  a  range  of  costs  that  could  be 
incurred through phases 1, 2 and 3 of its Mongolia exploration plan. The total minimum amount estimated for expenditure on phase 1, the only phase that is 
currently  probable,  is  $4,000,000  and  therefore  a  Participation  Liability  of  $320,000  has  been  recorded.  This  liability  was  reduced  as  expenses  incurred  and 
amounted to $0 as of December 31, 2009.
The Loans carried an interest rate of 8% per annum and all principal and accrued interest was payable in full two years from the date of issuance (August 18, 
2010). The Loans were secured by the Group’s assets in the Kyrgyz Republic.
The principal and any accrued but unpaid interest on the Loans were convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holders if the Group conducted a public 
offering at the prevailing market price. The loan was accounted for as a liability in accordance with FASB ASC 480-10-25 (Prior authoritative literature: FAS150 
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity”). Because the financial instrument embodied a conditional 
obligation that the Company must or may settle by issuing a variable number of equity shares, the monetary value of the obligation is based on a fixed monetary 
amount known at inception.
The initial carrying amount of the Loans of $1,680,000 was accreted to the redemption amount of $2,000,000 over the term of the loans using the effective interest 
method.
On March 9, 2010, the Company fully repaid, prior to maturity, the entire amount of principal together with all accrued interest.
For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 the Company amortized debt issuance costs related to the Loan of $0 and $45,219, respectively. 
For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 the Company amortized debt issuance costs of $0 and $0, respectively.
For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 the Company had interest expense on the Loan of $0 and $29,893, respectively.
For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 the Company had interest expense on the Loan of $0 and $0, respectively.
17
At  September  30,  2011  and  December 31,  2010,  the unamortized  debt  discount  relating  to  the  Loan  amounted  to  $0  and  $0  respectively.  To  account  for  the 
unamortized debt discount the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of the Loan for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, of $0 and 
$83,202, respectively.
11. PROMISSORY NOTE
On December 5, 2008, the Company borrowed $540,646 from four shareholders who are also Directors of the Company at no discount to the principal amount by 
selling to each a promissory note (collectively, the “Shareholder Notes”). The parties agreed that no interest would accrue on the Shareholder Notes unless the 
Company breached the repayment schedule. Repayment of the principal amount of the Shareholder Notes was required if and when the Company raised greater 
than $1,000,000 in financing or 90 days after written demand for repayment by the Shareholder Notes holder, whichever was first to occur. The Company was also 
permitted to repay any or all of the principal amount of the Shareholder Notes at any time without notice, bonus or penalty. In the event that the Company failed to 
make  a  payment  when  it  was  due,  the  Company  was  required  to  pay  interest  on  the  outstanding  principal  amount  at  the  rate  of  12%  per  annum  until  the 
Shareholder  Notes  were  paid  in  full.  On  May  1,  2009,  the  Company  received  proceeds  of  a  financing  that  was  in  excess  of  $1,000,000,  which  caused  the 
Shareholder Notes to be due and payable immediately. However, as payment was not made on the due date, interest began to accrue on that date.
On March 9, 2010, the Company fully repaid the principal of $540,646 and total interest accrued of $54,568.
For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded $0 and $11,198 interest expense, respectively.
For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded $0 and $0 interest expense, respectively.
12. SALE OF MANAS ADRIATIC
On February 12, 2010 the Company signed a formal share purchase agreement with WWI Resources Ltd., a Canadian public company (TSXV: PMI). On February 
24, 2010, the Company completed the sale of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Manas Adriatic to WWI Resources Ltd. At closing, WWI Resources 
changed its name to Petromanas Energy Inc. (“Petromanas”).
As consideration for the shares of Manas Adriatic, Petromanas advanced to DWM Petroleum AG, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, the sum of $917,723
in December 2009 in payment of expenses, and it paid to DWM Petroleum CAD $2,000,000 ($1,937,396) in cash on March 3, 2010, $350,000 on May 17, 2010 
for compensation of operational expenses in Albania for January and February 2010. In addition, Petromanas issued to DWM Petroleum 100,000,000 Petromanas 
common shares. At closing, the purchase agreement provided that DWM Petroleum would be entitled to receive an aggregate of up to an additional 150,000,000 
Petromanas common shares as follows:
(cid:122) 100,000,000 Petromanas common shares upon completion of the first well on the Albanian project by Manas Adriatic, or on the date that is 16 months after
the Closing Date, whichever occurs first;
(cid:122) 25,000,000 Petromanas common shares if, on or before the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date, Manas Adriatic receives a report prepared pursuant to
Canada’s National Instrument 51-101, Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities, confirming that the Albanian project has 2P reserves of not less 
than 50,000,000 barrels of oil (BOE); and
(cid:122) if, on or before the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date, Manas Adriatic receives a report prepared pursuant to Canada’s National Instrument 51-101, 
Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities, confirming that the Albanian project has 2P reserves in excess of 50,000,000 BOEs, then for each
50,000,000 BOEs over and above 50,000,000 BOEs, Petromanas will be required to issue 500,000 Petromanas common shares to DWM Petroleum to a
maximum of 25,000,000 Petromanas common shares.
18
At closing, Petromanas also funded Manas Adriatic with $8,500,000 to be used by Manas Adriatic to repay advances previously made by DWM Petroleum and its 
predecessors in respect of the Albanian project and Petromanas appointed to its six member board of directors three directors who were nominated by our company 
(Michael Velletta, Heinz Scholz and Peter-Mark Vogel). Also at closing, the board of directors of Petromanas appointed Erik Herlyn (our former Chief Executive
Officer) and Ari Muljana (our Chief Financial Officer) as the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, of Petromanas. Erik Herlyn ceased 
to  act  as  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Petromanas  on  July  15,  2010;  Ari  Muljana  ceased  to  act  as  Chief  Financial  Officer  of  Petromanas  on  August  31,  2010, 
respectively.
Contemporaneously with the completion of its purchase of Manas Adriatic, Petromanas completed a private placement offering in which it sold to third parties an 
aggregate  of  100,000,000  of  its  common  shares  for  gross  proceeds  of  CAD  $25,000,000  (approximately  $24,518,000).  After  adjustment  for  the  100,000,000 
common shares issued to DWM Petroleum at the completion of the sale of Manas Adriatic and the 100,000,000 common shares issued in this private placement, 
Petromanas had 328,231,466 common shares issued and outstanding, of which DWM Petroleum owned 100,000,000, or approximately 30.47% .
Immediately following the closing, the Company analyzed whether it had obtained control of Petromanas at closing. In conducting this analysis, the Company’s 
management considered beneficial ownership of voting power (both diluted and undiluted), composition of the Petromanas board of directors and management, the 
terms of the purchase agreement and the relative size of Petromanas and Manas Adriatic. Based on this analysis, the Company concluded that:
(cid:122) the  Company  did  not  have  majority  voting  interest  in  Petromanas.  DWM  Petroleum,  the  Company’s  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  held  100,000,000
outstanding shares of Petromanas, which represented 30.47% of the issued and outstanding shares of Petromanas;
(cid:122) the Company’s nominees did not constitute a majority of the board of directors of Petromanas, nor did the Company have the ability to appoint, elect or
remove a director of Petromanas;
(cid:122) although two of the three executive officers of Petromanas were also officers of the Company, this was a temporary solution and, due to the inherent
conflicts of interest, was subject to change in near future;
(cid:122) no assessment could be made concerning whether or not a significant premium was paid by either party in respect of the exchange of equity interests; and
(cid:122) both Petromanas and Manas Adriatic were small companies, neither had yet generated any revenue and neither was significantly larger than the other.
Based  on  the  above,  the  Company’s  management  concluded  that  it  did  not  obtain  control  over  Petromanas  upon  closing  of  the  transaction.  The  transaction
therefore was accounted for in accordance with ASC 810-10-40, which resulted in a de-recognition of the subsidiary, Manas Adriatic GmbH, in exchange for cash 
received, liabilities assumed and Petromanas common shares issued.
The shares of Petromanas are traded on the TSX-V, which is an active market and the Company believes that the quoted market price for Petromanas common 
shares (TSXV:PMI) is readily determinable and can reasonable be taken as a basis for the calculation of the fair value.
The Company’s management reached this conclusion based on an assessment on the following criteria:
(cid:122) The shares are traded in a foreign market of breadth and scope comparable to the OTCBB, which according to ASC 820 provides readily determinable fair
value for equity securities;
(cid:122) Bid/ask-spreads are narrow; and
(cid:122) Trading activity is regular and frequent.
In addition, the shares of Petromanas owned by DWM Petroleum are held in escrow imposed pursuant to the Policies of the TSX Venture Exchange. Since these 
shares are held in escrow and are subject to an escrow release schedule, the Company’s management consider the shares as a Level 2 input for the calculation of
the fair value in accordance with ASC 820 (fair value measurements and disclosures). The Company applies an annual discount rate of 12% on the quoted market 
price based on the time before the shares become freely tradable. The discount rate is an estimate of the cost of capital, based on previous long-term debt the 
Company has issued. The following table outlines the escrow release schedule:

Each escrowed and issued share entitles DWM Petroleum to exercise voting rights and each escrowed and issued share corresponds to one vote.
The 50,000,000 additional Petromanas common shares which are issuable upon achievement of certain conditions (see above (i) and (ii)) will be accounted for in 
accordance with ASC 450 (Contingencies). As the likelihood of the contingent events is not reasonably determinable, these shares will only be recognized when 
realized.
A gain on sale of asset is recognized on the statement of operations under non-operating income and is calculated according to ASC 810-10-40 as the difference 
between  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received  and  the  carrying  amount  of  Manas  Adriatic  GmbH’s  assets  and  liabilities  resulting  in  a  gain  on  sale  of

* The quoted market price on February 25, 2010 was CAD $0.39. In calculating the fair value per share we have taken into account the dilution effect of the 
additional 100,000,000 shares that were to be issued, at the latest, 16 months after the closing date (these shares were actually issued on May 26, 2010, pursuant to 
an amending agreement dated May 25, 2010 – please see Note 13, below). Furthermore, the shares are subject to an escrow agreement and their fair value was 
therefore discounted based on the escrow release schedule. The annual interest rate applied to discount the diluted quoted market price was 12% and represents 
cost of opportunity at which the Company may raise debt.
Net cash proceeds from the sale of Manas Adriatic GmbH amounted to a total of CAD $2,000,000 ($1,937,396), $8,500,000 to be used by Manas Adriatic to repay 
advances made by DWM Petroleum and $350,000 for compensation of operational expenses in Albania for January and February 2010 reduced by $21,586, the 
cash owned by Manas Adriatic consolidated as of February 24, 2010.
13. INVESTMENT IN PETROMANAS
On February 12, 2010, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary DWM Petroleum, signed a Share Purchase Agreement and completed the sale of all of the issued
and outstanding shares of Manas Adriatic to Petromanas Energy Inc. (“Petromanas”). After closing, the Share Purchase Agreement was amended by an amending 
agreement dated May 25, 2010. As a result of this transaction, the Company owns 200,000,000 common shares of Petromanas. 100,000,000 of these were issued 
on March 3, 2010 pursuant to the original terms of the Share Purchase Agreement; the additional 100,000,000 were received on May 26, 2010, pursuant to the 
amending  agreement.  The  shares  were  subject  to  a  hold  period  expiring  June  24,  2011  and  bore  a  legend  to  that  effect.  In  addition,  all  of  these  shares  were 
deposited into an escrow pursuant to the requirements of the TSX Venture Exchange, which provides for the release of the shares from escrow in installments over 
a two year period (see Note 12, above).
DWM  currently  owns  and  controls  200,000,000  common  shares  of  Petromanas  and  it  has  the  right  to  acquire  a  further  50,000,000  common  shares  upon  the 
occurrence of certain conditions. The 200,000,000 common shares represent approximately 31.7% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Petromanas.
Since the shares were subject to a hold period of thirteen months, and because the shares were also deposited into escrow and subject to a fixed escrow release 
schedule, the Company has deemed them to have a Level 2 input for the calculation of the fair value in accordance with ASC 820 (Fair value measurements and 
disclosures). The Company applies an annual discount rate of 12% on the quoted market price based on the time before the shares become freely tradable. The 
discount rate is an estimate of the cost of capital, based on previous long-term debt the Company has issued.
21
The quoted market price for one common share of Petromanas on September 30, 2011 was CAD $0.1250 (approximately $0.1210) .
In order to calculate the fair value of the Company’s investment in Petromanas the Company has discounted the market price of the shares based on the escrow
release schedule. The effective discount applied on the quoted market price of the shares is 4.31% .
During  the  nine-month  periods  ended  September  30,  2011  and  2010,  the  Company  recorded  $(49,090,911)  unrealized  loss  on  investment  in  Petromanas  and 
$13,635,118 unrealized gain on investment, respectively.
During  the  three-month  periods  ended  September  30,  2011  and  2010,  respectively,  the  Company  recorded  $(32,854,768)  unrealized  loss  on  investment  in
Petromanas and $10,700,583 unrealized gain on investment, respectively.
When a company chooses the fair value option, pursuant to ASC 323 further disclosures regarding the investee are required in cases where the Company has the 
ability to exercise significant influence over the investee’s operating and financial policies.
As of today, there is no managerial interchange and there are no material intercompany transactions. In addition, technological dependencies do not exist. The 
majority ownership of the investee is concentrated among a small group of shareholders who operate the investee without regard to the views of the Company. The 
Company made an effort to obtain from Petromanas financial information that would be needed in order for the for the Company to include that information in its 
own financial disclosure, but Petromanas, which is a reporting company in Canada and subject to the Canadian regulatory requirements in respect of selective 
disclosure,  has  refused  to  provide  this  information  in  advance  of  it  being  made  available  to  the  general  public  in  its  own  periodic  disclosure  filings.  This 
information would be necessary if the Company were disclose selected financial data of Petromanas in accordance with US GAAP in timely manner.
The Company has previously requested that Petromanas provide detailed financial records in order to enable the Company to reconcile between Canadian GAAP 
and US GAAP but Petromanas has refused, stating that Petromanas is a public company and required to comply with securities legislation and TSX Venture 
Exchange rules and it cannot provide selective disclosure to any shareholder, nor can it permit its results to be publicly disclosed through any document published 
by a third party until after it has publicly disseminated the information.
Based on the foregoing, the Company has concluded that it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over Petromanas’ (the investee’s) operating 
and financial policies.

15. COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Legal actions and claims (Kyrgyz Republic, Republic of Tajikistan, Chile and Albania)
23
In the ordinary course of business, members of the Group doing business in the Kyrgyz Republic, Republic of Tajikistan, Mongolia and Chile may be subject to 
legal actions and complaints from time-to-time.
During the initial phase of applying for an exploration license in Chile, the Company formed a joint bidding group with two other companies, namely Improved 
Petroleum Recovery Tranquillo Chile (“IPR”) and a start-up company called Energy Focus. Each had a one-third interest. Of its own accord, Energy Focus left the 
bidding group. The three parties signed a side letter which provided that Energy Focus would have an option to rejoin the bidding group under certain conditions.
Even though Energy Focus has been asked many times to join the group by contributing its prorated share of capital, it has failed to do so. Despite this, Energy 
Focus claims that it is entitled to participate in the bidding group at any future time, not just under certain conditions. Both the Company and IPR believe that 
Energy Focus no longer has any right or option to rejoin the bidding group because the conditions specified in the side letter did not occur and can no longer occur.
Energy Focus commenced litigation for specific performance and damages in an unspecified amount in Santiago de Chile, claiming interest in the Tranquilo Block 
from the Company and IPR, and their subsidiaries. The Company, IPR and their respective legal counsel are of the view that the Energy Focus claim is without 
merit, is brought in the wrong jurisdiction and that Energy Focus has failed to properly serve the parties. The courts of Santiago have dismissed the case, but the 
verdict is open for appeal. The Company believes that an estimate of the possible impact on future cash flows and financial conditions is not practicable.
At September 30, 2011, there had been no legal actions against any member of the Group in the Kyrgyz Republic, Republic of Tajikistan and Mongolia.
Management believes that the members of the Group are in substantial compliance with the tax laws affecting their respective operations in the Kyrgyz Republic, 
Republic of Tajikistan, Mongolia and Chile. However, the risk remains that relevant authorities could take differing positions with regards to interpretative issues.
Management believes that the ultimate liability, if any, arising from any of the above will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or the results 
of future operations of the Group in the Kyrgyz Republic, Republic of Tajikistan, Mongolia and Chile.
16. PERSONNEL COSTS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Defined benefit plan
24
The  Company  maintains  a  Swiss  defined  benefit  plan  for  four  of  its  employees.  The  plan  is  part  of  an  independent  collective  fund  which  provides  pensions 
combined with life and disability insurance. The assets of the funded plan are held independently of the Company’s assets in a legally distinct and independent 
collective trust fund which serves various unrelated employers. The fund’s benefit obligations are fully reinsured by AXA Winterthur Insurance Company. The
plan  is  valued  by  independent  actuaries  using  the  projected  unit  credit  method.  The  liabilities  correspond  to  the  projected  benefit  obligations  of  which  the 
discounted net present value is calculated based on years of employment, expected salary increases, and pension adjustments.

During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 the Company made cash contributions of $64,289 and $55,021, respectively, to its defined
benefit pension plan. The Company does not expect to make any additional cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans during the remainder of 2011.
17. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
FASB ASC 820 (Prior authoritative literature: SFAS 157 Fair Value Measurements) establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used 
in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than 
quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, 
therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as of September 30, 2011 are classified in one of 
the three categories as follows:

18. EARNINGS PER SHARE
25
Basic earnings per share result by dividing the Company’s net income (or net loss) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the contemplated
period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated applying the treasury stock method. When there is a net income, dilutive effects of all stock-based compensation 
awards or participating financial instruments are considered. When the Company posts a loss, basic loss per share equals diluted loss per share.
The following table depicts how the denominator for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share was determined under the treasury stock method:
Basic weighted average shares outstanding 
Dilutive effect of stock equivalents* 
  
    - stock options and non-vested stock under employee compensation plans

19. SHARE PLACEMENT/PURCHASE AGREEMENT – TEMPORARY EQUITY
On September 26, 2010, the Company entered into a share placement/purchase agreement with Alexander Becker, an individual who, at the time, beneficially 
owned 14,144,993 shares of the Company’s common stock. Mr. Becker had previously expressed an interest in selling all of his shares of the Company’s common 
stock to a third party or, failing that, back to the Company. The share placement/purchase agreement provided that in the event any of Mr. Becker's shares of the 
Company’s common stock were not placed with buyers within six months after September 26, 2010, the Company would be obligated to purchase such shares 
from Mr. Becker within 30 days subsequent to March 26, 2011. This purchase deadline can be extended on mutual consent. The price of the shares was determined 
by the first sale, which occurred on October 25, 2010 when an arms-length third party investor purchased shares from Mr. Becker at a purchase price of $0.39 per
share.
As of December 31, 2010 the calculated the exposure, i.e. the maximum cash obligation of the Company according to ASC 480-10-S99 for all redeemable shares. 
The following table shows the Company’s exposure, i.e. the number of redeemable shares and their aggregate value as of December 31, 2010:

The  Company  recognizes  changes  in  the  redemption  value  immediately  as  they  occur  and  adjusts  the  carrying  value  of  the  temporary  equity  to  equal  the 
redemption value at each reporting date. According to ASC 480-10-S99 we classified these redeemable shares under Temporary Equity.
As of February 17, 2011 all of the shares of the Company owned by Mr. Becker had been placed with third party investors. The Company’s exposure resulting 
from  the  share  placement/purchase  agreement  with  Mr.  Becker,  therefore,  is  nil  as  of  September  30,  2011.  The  following  table  shows  the  development  of

On January 29, 2010, the Company signed an agreement to assign its interest in the Chilean project in exchange for a return of the money it had invested in the 
joint venture and relief from all current and future obligations in respect of the project. On April 14, 2011, the Company transferred all its rights, interests and 
obligations in the project to Methanex and Wintershall. The Chilean Minister of Energy authorized this transfer on April 28, 2011.
According to an external audit report dated July 31, 2011 all previous cash contributions made by the partners in the Chilean project have been reconciled. The 
report confirmed the Company’s cash contribution of $72,000. The cash payment for the transfer of the Company’s interest in the Chilean project of $72,000 was 
received on September 23, 2011 from the new owners.
With the disposal of the Company’s interest in the Chilean project, there are no continuing cash flows to be generated and there is no continuing involvement in
the operations remaining. In accordance with ASC 205-20-45 the Company classified the disposed component as a discontinued operation.

29
(cid:122) our ability to establish or find resources or reserves;
(cid:122) our need for, and our ability to raise, capital;

(cid:122) other factors discussed under the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 21, 2011.
These risks, as well as risks that we cannot currently anticipate, could cause our company’s or our industry’s actual results, levels of activity or performance to be 
materially different from any future results, levels of activity or performance expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity or 
performance. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States and Canada, we do not intend to update any of the forward-
looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.
As used in this quarterly report, the terms “we”, “us”, and “our” refer to Manas Petroleum Corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiaries DWM Petroleum AG, a 
Swiss company, DWM Energy AG, a Swiss company, Manas Energia Chile Limitada, a Chilean company, Manas Petroleum of Chile Corporation, a Canadian 
company, and Manas Management Services Ltd., a Bahamian company, and its partially owned subsidiaries CJSC Somon Oil Company, a Tajikistan company,

Company, a Kyrgyz company and its 31.7% ownership interest in Petromanas Energy Inc., a British Columbia company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange in 
Canada (TSXV: PMI), as the context may require.
The following discussion and analysis provides a narrative about our financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the unaudited 
consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this quarterly report.
Overview of Business Operations
We are in the business of exploring for oil and gas, primarily in Central and East Asia. In particular, we focus on the exploration of large under-thrust light oil 
prospects in areas where, though there has often been shallow production, their deeper potential has yet to be evaluated. If we discover sufficient reserves of oil or 
gas,  we  intend  to  exploit  them.  Although  we  are  currently  focused  primarily  on  projects  located  in  certain  geographic  regions,  we  remain  open  to  attractive 
opportunities in other areas. We do not have any known reserves on any of our properties.
30
We carry out our operations both directly and through participation in ventures with other oil and gas companies. We are involved in projects in Mongolia and 
Tajikistan and we were until recently involved in a project in Chile. In addition, we are involved in oil and gas activities in Albania through our ownership of 
common shares of Petromanas Energy Inc., and oil and gas activities in the Kyrgyz Republic through our ownership of shares of CJSC South Petroleum Company, 
which is involved in a project in the Kyrgyz Republic.
We have no operating income yet and, as a result, we depend upon funding from various sources to continue operations and to implement our growth strategy.
Results of Operations
The Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2011 Compared to the Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2010
Net Income/Net Loss
Net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 was $54,858,940 as compared to net income of $65,530,401 for the same period in 2010. This 
decrease of $120,389,341 was primarily due to our investment in Petromanas.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, we recorded a decrease in fair value of investment in associate of $49,090,911. In the nine-month period 
ended  September  30,  2010  we  recorded  an  initial  gain  from  sale  of  subsidiary  (Manas  Adriatic)  of  $57,850,918  and  a  subsequent  increase  in  fair  value  of 
investment in associate (Petromanas) of $13,635,118.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 decreased to $5,735,293 from $6,099,437 reported for the same period in 2010. This is a 
decrease of 6% or $364,144 in our total operating expenses, attributable to lower personnel and consulting expenses, partially offset by higher administrative and 
exploration costs.
Personnel costs
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 our personnel costs decreased to $1,446,244 from $3,293,175 for the same period in 2010. This decrease of 
56%  or  $1,846,931  is  mainly  attributable  to  lower  charges  related  to  equity  awards  under  the  stock  compensation  and  stock  option  plan.  For  such  grants  we 
recorded $678,417 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 and $2,740,137 for the same period in 2010.
Exploration costs
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 we incurred exploration costs of $2,327,222 as compared to $880,367 for the same period in 2010. This is an
increase of 164% or $1,446,855 and is mainly due to increased exploration activities in Mongolia.
Consulting fees
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 we incurred consulting fees of $518,537 as compared to consulting fees of $938,967 for the same period in
2010. This is a decrease of 45% or $420,430 and is primarily attributable to a gain resulting from the quarterly revaluation of consultant stock options. For the 
nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, we recorded stock based compensation income of $(357,969) as compared to an expense of $256,459 for the same 
period in 2010.
Administrative costs
31
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, we recorded administrative costs of $1,407,303 compared to $943,939 for the same period in 2010. This 
increase of 49% and $463,364 is mainly attributable to higher accounting and audit fees and also to higher travel expense and administrative costs related to our 
Mongolian project.
Non-operating income/expense
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 we recorded a non-operating expense of $49,175,962 compared to a non-operating income of $71,631,867 
for the same period in 2010. This is a decrease of $120,807,829 and mainly attributable to our investment in Petromanas.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, we recorded a decrease in fair value of investment in associate of $49,090,911. In the same period for 2010 
we recorded a gain from sale of subsidiary of $57,850,918 and an increase in fair value in associate of $13,635,118 (together $71,486,036).
The Three-Month Period Ended September 30, 2011 Compared to the Three-Month Period Ended September 30, 2010
Net Income/Net Loss
Net loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 was $36,185,111 as compared to net income of $9,618,213 for the same period in 2010. This is a 
decrease of $45,803,322 and is due primarily to our investment in Petromanas.
For the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, we recorded a decrease in fair value of investment in associate of $32,854,768. In the three-month period 
ended September 30, 2010 we recorded an increase in fair value of investment in associate (Petromanas) of $10,007,583. This was due primarily to a change in the 
market value of shares of Petromanas on the TSX Venture stock exchange (by way of illustration, on September 30, 2010, the closing price for one share of 
Petromanas common stock was CDN $0.345, while on September 30, 2011, the closing price for one share was CDN $0.125) .
Operating Expenses
Operating Expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 increased to $3,381,564 from $1,110,270 reported for the same period in 2010. This 
increase of 205% or $2,271,294 in our total operating expenses is due primarily to increased exploration activity in Mongolia and higher stock-based compensation 
expenses recorded in personnel costs.
Personnel costs
For the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 our personnel costs increased to $743,672 from $255,045 for the same period in 2010. This increase of 
192% or $488,627 is mainly attributable to higher expenses related to equity awards granted under the stock compensation and stock option plans. For such grants 
we recorded in the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 $480,605 and $74,481 for the same period in 2010.
Exploration costs
For the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 we incurred exploration costs of $1,700,656 as compared to $268,345 for the same period in 2010. This 
increase of 534% or $1,432,311 is mainly attributable to higher exploration activity in Mongolia.
Consulting fees
32
For the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 we incurred consulting fees of $344,523 as compared to consulting fees of $277,948 for the same period in 
2010. This is an increase of 24% or $66,575 and is mainly attributable to consulting fees related to our exploration project in Tajikistan.
Administrative costs
For the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 we recorded administrative costs of $579,223 compared to $295,737 for the same period in 2010. This 
increase of 96% or $283,486 is mainly attributable to higher accounting and audit fees and also to higher travel expense and administrative costs related to our 
Mongolian project.
Non-operating income/expense
For the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 we recorded a non-operating expense of $32,875,263 compared to a non-operating income of $10,729,107 
for the same period in 2010. This is a decrease of $43,604,370 and mainly related to our investment in Petromanas.
For the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, we recorded a decrease in fair value of investment in associate of $32,854,768. In the same period for 2010 
we recorded an increase in fair value in associate of $10,700,583.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our  cash  balance  as  of  September  30,  2011  was  $17,200,360.  Our  total  current  assets  as  of  September  30,  2011  amounted  to  $17,685,179  and  total  current 
liabilities were $1,509,467 resulting in net working capital of $16,175,712.
Of the 200,000,000 common shares of Petromanas held by us, 110,000,000 were eligible for immediate resale without restriction as of September 30, 2011. The 
market value of these “freely tradable” shares was approximately $13,315,000 on September 30, 2011.
Shareholders’ equity as of September 30, 2011 was $39,579,439.
We expect that our liquidity is sufficient to implement our business plan for the next 12 months.

Net cash used in operating activities of $4,659,509 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 changed from net cash used of $4,697,640 for the same
period in 2010. This is a decrease in net cash used in operating activities of $38,131. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities is primarily due to an 
increase in net working capital, partially offset by an increase in exploration costs.
Investing Activities
33
Net cash provided by investing activities of $63,884 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 changed from net cash provided by investing activities 
of $11,575,352 for the same period in 2010. This decrease in cash provided by investing activities of $11,511,468 is mainly attributable to proceeds from sale of 
investment of $10,765,810 recorded in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 and changes in restricted cash.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities of $20,117,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 changed from net cash used of $4,421,880 for the
same period in 2010. This is an increase of net cash provided by financing activities of $24,538,880 and is primarily due to net cash provided by the issuance of 
units  of  $19,877,000  for  the  nine-month  period  ended  September  30,  2011.  In  the  same  period  in  2010  cash  was  used  to  repay  contingent  convertible  loans 
($2,000,000), debentures ($4,000,000), promissory notes to shareholders ($540,646) and to settle a bank overdraft of $196,154 and cash was provided by warrant 
exercises ($2,260,958) and by the increase in refundable deposits ($53,962).

Our monthly burn rate (excluding Geological & Geophysical) amounts to approximately $350,000. We believe that we will have sufficient money to fund our 
planned operations for the next 12 months.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Recent Developments
Since the end of our most recent fiscal year, the following developments have affected our operations or operations of the companies in which we participate.
Mongolia
Our  2011  work  program  in  Mongolia  is  based  on  the  integration  of  all  available  data  acquired  by  Gobi  Energy  Partners  (“Gobi”)  from  the  region.  We  were 
concentrating on our two blocks – Block XIII, Tsagaan Els and Block XIV, ZuunBayan – and the area operated today by Dongsheng, which just finalized its field 
development. Gobi acquired this data by conducting its own surveys in recent years and from former operators as well as the local authorities. The data includes 
431 wells and 951 km of 2D seismic in addition to several gravity surveys, field data and the results of last year’s seismic program.
This evaluation resulted in a work program consisting of up to 1700 km 2 D seismic covering 10 prospective areas over both blocks, identified by the integrated 
approach. The 2D survey is designed in 8 phases without any interruption between the phases; however, some phases show interdependencies. The contract with 
the seismic contractor is based on 532 km full fold as a firm program and a further 1,106 km full fold as an optional program.
34
Since the commencement of this program in August we have acquired 786 km full fold data and optioned up for 1063 km full fold data. The seismic quality is 
good and the chosen phased program approach has proved successful. Phases have changed due to the in time control and the survey has been adapted to the needs, 
i.e. we are concentrating on the prospective areas as defined by the key lines and leads defined during the survey. In the next report we hope to include a table 
showing the planned and actual data.
Sinopec  Mongolia  LLC  (“Sinopec”),  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  China  Petrochemical  Corporation  (Sinopec  Group),  is  Gobi`s  contractor  for  this  seismic
survey. Sinopec has extensive seismic experience in this area. Sinopec is using Sercel equipment for this survey. The total cost of the whole program, including 
mobilization and demobilization, is projected to be $4.2 million.
Using information from this seismic survey, we hope to spud the first well in the second quarter of 2012.
Corporate
On  May  11,  2011  DWM  Petroleum  AG  received  permission  from  the  Mongolian  Petroleum  Authority  to  transfer  the  title  of  both  PSCs  covering  Blocks 
Zuunbayan-XIV and Tsagaan Els XIII to its newly created Swiss subsidiary Gobi Energy Partners GmbH. After the restructuring DWM, through its subsidiary,
will have a working interest of 74%. Currently the Mongolian team is finalizing the documentation process enabling the transfer of the local company Gobi Energy 
Partners LLC to Gobi Energy Partners GmbH.

In support of prospect delineation available geological and geophysical data has been interpreted. Old seismic lines have been interpreted and 
correlated with newly btained seismic data and well logging data of the earlier drilled wells. The available structural maps by the key Paleogene 
bed with delineation of the most potential prospects for drilling are regularly updated based on the result of this work. Further, it is expected to 
conduct a prognosis evaluation of such structures using all the acquired geological and geophysical data. Information on the earlier drilled wells, 
geological and geophysical data gathering and digitizing was on-going.

Updated oil and gas prospects within the license areas. This is intended to provide a basis for geological- economic evaluation and new prospect 
drill well location preparation. 
In August, the Ministry of Natural Resources initiated verification of the fulfillment of the license agreement terms with an on-site visit. From the 
18th to the 28th of August all the oil and gas companies on Jalal-Abad were checked. On August 24 the ministry experts visited the Nanai area for 
a field seismic work scope verification. SPC employees showed location of the planned Ala-Buka #1 well, and the place where some seismic lines 
pass. In September, all the oil and gas companies of Batken oblast were checked. On the 12th and 13th of September, the ministry experts visited 
the Soh, West Soh and Tuzluk areas to verify the scope of field seismic and drilling work. SPC employees showed the structures inferred for 
drilling, the place where some seismic lines pass and the drilled wells as well.
Information provided in this quarterly report pertaining to the exploration project in the Kyrgyz Republic owned by South Petroleum Company has been provided 
to our company by the operator of that project, with which we deal at arms length, and is included in this quarterly report in an effort to share that information with 
the public. Although we have no reason to doubt the accuracy of this information, we expressly disclaim responsibility therefor and make no representation or 
warranty that it is complete or correct.
Chile
On January 29, 2010, we signed an agreement to assign our interest in our Chilean project in exchange for a return of all of the money that we have invested in this 
project to date and relief from all currently outstanding and future obligations in respect of the project. On April 14, 2011, we transferred all our rights, interests 
and obligations to Methanex Chile S.A. and Wintershall Chile Limitada. The Chilean Ministry of Energy authorized this transfer on April 28, 2011. On September 
23, 2011, we received $72,000 from the new owners as reimbursement in full of our participation in the project.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Not applicable.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures”, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to 
the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934.  Disclosure  controls  and  procedures  include  controls  and  procedures  designed  to  ensure  that  information  required  to  be 
disclosed in our company’s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods 
specified  in  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission’s  rules  and  forms,  and  that  such  information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management, 
including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer 
and our principal financial officer, evaluated our company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based
on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, our 
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
37
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2011, that have materially affected, or are 
reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
PART II—OTHER INFORMATION
Except as disclosed below, there are no pending legal proceedings to which our company or any of our subsidiaries is a party or of which any of our properties, or 
the properties of any of our subsidiaries, is the subject. In addition, we do not know of any such proceedings contemplated by any governmental authorities.
Litigation in Chile
Energy Focus commenced litigation for specific performance and damages in an unspecified amount in Santiago Chile, claiming an interest in the Tranquillo 
Block from our company and IPR, and their subsidiaries. The Courts of Santiago have dismissed the case, but the verdict is open for appeal.
Factual Allegations
During the initial phase of applying for our Chilean Exploration license, we formed a joint bidding group with Improved Petroleum Recovery Tranquillo Chile 
(commonly referred to as “IPR”) and a start-up company called Energy Focus Limitada. Each had a one-third interest. Of its own accord, Energy Focus left the 
bidding group. The three parties signed a side letter which provided that Energy Focus would have an option to rejoin the bidding group under certain conditions.
Even though Energy Focus has been asked many times to join the group by contributing its prorated share of capital, it has failed to do so. Despite this, Energy 
Focus claims that it is entitled to participate in the consortium at any future time, not just under certain conditions. We and IPR believe that Energy Focus no 
longer has any right to join the bidding group because the conditions specified in the side letter did not occur and can no longer occur.
Energy Focus commenced litigation for specific performance and damages in an unspecified amount in Santiago de Chile, claiming interest in the Tranquilo Block 
from our company and IPR, and our respective subsidiaries. Our company, IPR and our respective legal counsel are of the view that the Energy Focus claim is 
without merit, is brought in the wrong jurisdiction and that Energy Focus has failed to properly serve the parties. The courts of Santiago have dismissed the case, 
but the verdict is open for appeal. We believe that an estimate of the possible impact on future cash flows and financial conditions is not practicable.
Our  management  believes  that  the  ultimate  liability,  if  any,  arising  from  the  Energy  Focus  litigation  will  not  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  financial 
condition or the results of future operations of our company.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading
with respect to the period covered by this report;
 
Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all 
material  respects  the  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows  of  the registrant  as  of,  and  for,  the  periods 
presented in this report; 
 
The  registrant’s  other  certifying  officer  and  I  are  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure controls  and

defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f)) for the registrant and have:
 
(a)
designed  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  or  caused  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to  be  designed 
under  our  supervision,  to  ensure  that  material  information  relating  to  the  registrant,  including  its  consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is 
being prepared; 
 
designed  such  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  or  caused  such  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  to  be 
designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
 
evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  the  registrant’s  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  and  presented  in  this  report  our 
conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this 
report based on such evaluation; and 
 
disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the

performing the equivalent functions): 
 
(a)
all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting 
which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial 
information; and 
 
any  fraud,  whether  or  not  material,  that  involves  management or  other  employees  who  have  a  significant  role  in  the
