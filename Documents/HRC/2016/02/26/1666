</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and affirming the 
inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that all States have an obligation to promote and protect human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, as stated in the Charter and as elaborated in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other 
applicable instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, the Human 
Rights Council, the Security Council and the General Assembly reaffirming, inter alia, the 
illegality of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, including in East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>Human Rights Council resolution 19/17 of 22 March 2012, in which 
the Council decided to establish an independent international fact-finding mission to 
investigate the implications of the Israeli settlements on the human rights of the Palestinian 
people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful </i>that Israel is a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, which is applicable de 
jure to Palestinian and all Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including East 
Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and recalling the declaration adopted by the Conference of 
High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, held in Geneva on 5 December 
2001, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Considering </i>that the transfer by the occupying Power of parts of its own civilian 
population into the territory it occupies constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention and relevant provisions of customary law, including those codified in 
Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of 
Justice on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory</i>, and recalling also General Assembly resolutions ES-10/15 of 20 July 
2004 and ES-10/17 of 15 December 2006, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that the International Court of Justice concluded that the Israeli settlements in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, had been established in 
breach of international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the recent relevant reports of the Secretary-General, the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Special Committee to 
Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and 
Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories and the treaty bodies monitoring compliance with 
the human rights treaties to which Israel is a party, as well as the recent reports of the 
Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the situation of human rights in the 
Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note also</i> of the report of the independent international fact-finding mission 
to investigate the implications of the Israeli settlements on the civil, political, economic, 
social and cultural rights of the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem,1 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming </i>that the Israeli settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem, undermine regional and international efforts aimed at the 
realization of the two-State solution of Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and 
security within recognized borders, on the basis of the pre-1967 borders, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict, and emphasizing specifically the Quartet&#8217;s call for a freeze on all 
settlement activity, including so-called natural growth, and the dismantlement of all 
settlement outposts erected since March 2001, and the need for Israel to uphold its 
obligations and commitments in this regard, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of General Assembly resolution 67/19 of 29 November 2012, by which, 
inter alia, Palestine was accorded the status of non-member observer State in the United 
Nations, and taking note of the follow-up report thereon of the Secretary-General,<footnote name="2">A/67/738.  </footnote> 
</p>
<p><i>Aware </i>that Israeli settlement activities involve, inter alia, the transfer of nationals of 
the occupying Power into the occupied territories, the confiscation of land, the forced 
displacement of Palestinian civilians, including Bedouin families, the exploitation of 
natural resources and other actions against the Palestinian civilian population and the 
civilian population in the occupied Syrian Golan that are contrary to international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing grave concern </i>at the continuation by Israel, the occupying Power, of 
settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in East Jerusalem, in 
violation of international humanitarian law, relevant United Nations resolutions, the 
agreements reached between the parties and obligations under the Quartet road map, and in 
defiance of the calls by the international community to cease all settlement activities, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 A/HRC/22/63.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Expressing grave concern</i> <i>in particular</i> at the construction and expansion by Israel 
of settlements in and around occupied East Jerusalem, including its so-called E-1 plan, 
which aims to connect its illegal settlements around and further isolate occupied East 
Jerusalem, thus threatening the creation of a contiguous Palestinian State, as well as at the 
continuing demolition of Palestinian homes and eviction of Palestinian families from the 
city, the revocation of Palestinian residency rights in the city, and ongoing settlement 
activities in the Jordan Valley, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing grave concern </i>at the continuing construction, contrary to international 
law, by Israel of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around 
East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular at the route of the wall in departure 
from the Armistice Line of 1949, which is causing humanitarian hardship and a serious 
decline in socioeconomic conditions for the Palestinian people, is fragmenting the territorial 
contiguity of the Territory and undermining its viability, and could prejudge future 
negotiations and make the two-State solution physically impossible to implement, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>that the wall&#8217;s route has been traced in such a way as to include 
the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i>Deploring</i> settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan, as well as any activities involving the 
confiscation of land, the disruption of the livelihood of protected persons, the forced 
displacement of civilians and the de facto annexation of land, 
</p>
<p><i>Gravely concerned</i> at the rising number of incidents of violence, destruction, 
harassment, provocation and incitement by extremist Israeli settlers in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, against Palestinian civilians, including 
children, and their properties, including historic and religious sites, and agricultural lands, 
</p>
<p><i>Aware</i> of the detrimental impact of the Israeli settlements on Palestinian and other 
Arab natural resources, especially as a result of the confiscation of land and the forced 
diversion of water resources, including the destruction of orchards and crops and the 
seizure of water wells by Israeli settlers, and of the dire socioeconomic consequences in this 
regard, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 22/29 of 22 March 2013, in follow-up 
to the report of the independent international fact-finding mission to investigate the 
implications of Israeli settlements on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights 
of the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,<footnote name="3">A/HRC/17/31, annex.  </footnote> which place 
responsibilities on all business enterprises to respect human rights by, inter alia, refraining 
from contributing to human rights abuses arising from conflict, and urge States to provide 
adequate assistance to business enterprises to assess and address the heightened risks of 
abuses in conflict-affected areas, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the fact that the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva 
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War undertook to 
respect and ensure respect for the Convention in all circumstances, and that States should 
not recognize an unlawful situation arising from breaches of peremptory norms of 
international law, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the importance for States to act in accordance with their own national 
legislation on promoting compliance with international humanitarian law with regard to 
business activities that result in human rights abuses, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its concern </i>at the failure of Israel, the occupying Power, to cooperate 
fully with the relevant United Nations mechanisms, in particular the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territories occupied since 1967, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Reaffirms</i> that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan are illegal and an obstacle to 
peace and economic and social development; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the Geneva Convention 
relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, to the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to the occupied Syrian 
Golan, to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention, in particular article 49 
thereof, and to comply with all its obligations under international law and cease 
immediately all actions causing the alteration of the character, status and demographic 
composition of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the 
occupied Syrian Golan; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, immediately and completely 
cease all of its settlement activities in all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan, and calls in this regard for the full 
implementation of all relevant resolutions of the Security Council, including, inter alia, 
resolutions 446 (1979) of 22 March 1979, 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979, 465 (1980) of 1 
March 1980, 476 (1980) of 30 June 1980 and 1515 (2003) of 19 November 2003; 
 4. <i>Demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, comply fully with its legal 
obligations, as mentioned in the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the 
International Court of Justice; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Condemns </i>the continuing settlement and related activities by Israel, including 
the expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, the demolition of houses, the 
confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion of Palestinians and the construction 
of bypass roads, which change the physical character and demographic composition of the 
occupied territories, including East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and constitute a 
violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in 
Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and in particular article 49 thereof; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Also condemns</i> the recent Israeli announcements of the construction of new 
housing units for Israeli settlers in the West Bank and around occupied East Jerusalem, as 
they seriously undermine the peace process and jeopardize the ongoing efforts by the 
international community to reach a final settlement compliant with international legitimacy, 
including relevant United Nations resolutions, constitute a threat to the two-State solution 
and the creation of a contiguous, sovereign, independent Palestinian State, and are in 
violation of international law and would entail the forced transfer of Palestinian civilians, 
and calls upon Israel to immediately reverse its decisions; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses its grave concern </i>at: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The increasing number of newly built structures over the past years and to 
date, undermining the efforts of the international community to advance the Middle East 
peace process; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The implications for the final status negotiations of Israel&#8217;s announcement 
that it will retain the major settlement blocks in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including the settlements located in the Jordan Valley; </p>


<p> (<i>c</i>) The expansion of Israeli settlements and the construction of new ones on the 
occupied Palestinian territory rendered inaccessible behind the wall, which create a fait 
accompli on the ground that could well be permanent, in which case, it would be 
tantamount to de facto annexation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The operation by Israel of a tramway between West Jerusalem and the Israeli 
settlement of Pisgat Zeev, which is in clear violation of international law and relevant 
United Nations resolutions; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon </i>Israel, the occupying Power: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To reverse the settlement policy in the occupied territories, including East 
Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and, as a first step towards their dismantlement, to stop 
immediately the expansion of existing settlements, including so-called natural growth and 
related activities, prevent any new installation of settlers in the occupied territories, 
including in East Jerusalem, and discard its E-1 plan; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To immediately cease construction of the new illegal settlement highway (the 
&#8220;Begin Highway&#8221;) in the neighbourhood of Beit Safafa in occupied East Jerusalem, which 
is in clear violation of international law; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To put an end to the human rights violations linked to the presence of 
settlements, especially of the right to self-determination, and fulfil its international 
obligations to provide effective remedy for victims; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To take immediate measures to prohibit and eradicate all policies or practices 
that discriminate against and disproportionately affect the Palestinian population in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, by, inter alia, putting an end to 
the system of separate roads for the exclusive use of Israeli settlers, who reside illegally in 
the said territory, to the complex combination of movement restrictions consisting of the 
wall, roadblocks and a permit regime that only affects the Palestinian population, and to the 
application of a two-tier legal system; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To put an end to measures resulting in the territorial fragmentation of the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and which are isolating 
Palestinian communities into separate enclaves; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To take and implement serious measures, including confiscation of arms and 
enforcement of criminal sanctions, with the aim of ensuring full accountability for, and 
preventing, all acts of violence by Israeli settlers, and to take other measures to guarantee 
the safety and protection of Palestinian civilians and Palestinian properties in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To bring a halt to all actions, including those perpetrated by Israeli settlers, 
harming the environment, including the dumping of all kinds of waste materials in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian 
Golan, which gravely threaten their natural resources, namely water and land resources, and 
which pose an environmental, sanitation and health threat to the civilian populations; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Welcomes</i> the adoption of the European Union Guidelines on the eligibility 
of Israeli entities and their activities in the territories occupied by Israel since June 1967 for 
grants, prizes and financial instruments funded by the European Union from 2014 onwards; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Encourages </i>all States and international organizations to continue to actively 
pursue policies that ensure respect of their obligations under international law with regard 
to all illegal Israeli practices and measures in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem, particularly Israeli settlements; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Urges</i> all States: </p>


<p>(<i>a</i>) To ensure that they are not taking actions that assist the expansion of 
settlements or construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To implement the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in 
relation to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to take 
appropriate measures to encourage businesses domiciled in their territory and/or under their 
jurisdiction, including those owned or controlled by them, to refrain from committing or 
contributing to gross human rights abuses of Palestinians, in accordance with the expected 
standard of conduct in the Guiding Principles and relevant international laws and standards; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To provide information to individuals and businesses on the financial, 
reputational and legal risks, as well as the possible abuses of the rights of individuals, of 
getting involved in settlement-related activities, including economic and financial activities, 
the provision of services in settlements and the purchasing of property; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Requests</i> that all parties concerned, including United Nations bodies, 
implement and ensure the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report 
of the independent international fact-finding mission to investigate the implications of 
Israeli settlements on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the 
Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
and endorsed by the Human Rights Council through its resolution 22/29, in accordance 
with their respective mandates; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Calls upon</i> the relevant United Nations bodies to take all necessary measures 
and actions within their mandates to ensure full respect for and compliance with Human 
Rights Council resolution 17/4 of 16 June 2011, on the Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights and other relevant international laws and standards, and to ensure the 
implementation of the United Nations &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework, which 
provides a global standard for upholding human rights in relation to business activities that 
are connected with Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Welcomes</i> the decision of the Working Group on the issue of human rights 
and transnational corporations and other business enterprises to issue a statement before the 
twenty-sixth session of the Human Rights Council, in follow-up to Council resolution 
22/29; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Requests </i>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
present a report detailing the implementation of the recommendations contained in the 
report of the independent fact-finding mission on the implications of Israeli settlements on 
the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian People throughout 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, to the Human Rights Council 
at its twenty-eighth session; 
</p>
