<p>1. The present addendum is submitted in the light of paragraph 8 of the report of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the implementation of 
paragraph 3 of Human Rights Council resolution 15/1 on follow-up to the report of the 
independent international fact-finding mission on the incident of the humanitarian flotilla 
(A/HRC/16/73), in which the High Commissioner undertook to provide in due course any 
relevant updated information, if available, with regard to significant developments 
pertaining to the implementation of paragraph 3 of Human Rights Council resolution 15/1.  
</p>
<p>2. On 11 January 2011, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) addressed notes verbales to the Permanent Missions of Israel and 
Turkey, as well as to the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations in 
Geneva, drawing attention to paragraph 8 of the report of the High Commissioner and 
requesting information about any steps that their respective Governments had taken, 
envisaged taking or were otherwise aware of concerning the implementation of paragraph 3 
of resolution 15/1. 
</p>
<p>3. In a submission to OHCHR, the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine expressed 
dismay at the persistent lack of cooperation by Israel with the international fact-finding 
mission on the incident of the humanitarian flotilla, and demanded that the Government of 
Israel conduct independent, impartial, thorough, effective and prompt investigations into 
the allegations of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The 
Mission welcomed the national report of the Government of Turkey and called for the 
immediate and full implementation of the conclusions and recommendations contained 
therein. It also explained that it would continue its efforts to ensure accountability for the 
victims of the attack on the flotilla. The Mission called attention to the deteriorating human 
rights situation in Gaza owing to the continuous violations by Israel, the occupying Power, 
and demanded that Israel lift immediately the siege imposed on the Gaza Strip. 
</p>
<p>4. In a submission to OHCHR, the Permanent Mission of Turkey emphasized that the 
conclusions contained in the report of the independent international fact-finding mission on 
the incident of the humanitarian flotilla (A/HRC/15/21) needed to be implemented 
promptly.  
</p>
<p>5. No information has yet been received on the status of implementation by Israel of 
the conclusions of the report of the independent international fact-finding mission.
