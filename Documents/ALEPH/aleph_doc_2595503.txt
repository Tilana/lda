WOODSIDE RECORDS FIRST HALF PROFIT OF US$340 MILLION, 
PRODUCTION UP 9% AND UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS 38% LOWER
Woodside has recorded a half-year reported net profit after tax (NPAT) of US$340 million, underpinned by 
production of 45.9 MMboe, 9% higher than 1H 2015. Operating revenue for the period was US$1.9 billion. 
Half-year reported NPAT was 50% lower than for 1H 2015 mainly due to lower prices, with benchmark oil 
prices1 falling 46% from 1H 2015 to 1H 2016. 
Continued focus on driving business efficiencies delivered world-class unit production costs of US$5.2/boe, 
38% lower than in 1H 2015.  
Woodside  CEO  Peter  Coleman  said  the  company  was  in  a  strong  financial  position  and  continued  to 
prioritise value growth while delivering peer-leading returns. 
“Our  operational  performance  is  world  class  with  LNG  production  consistently  exceeding  original  design 
capacity. Combined with the low cost of our operations and a continued focus on cost reduction we are in a 
robust position as oil price forecasts improve into 2017.  
“Our pre-tax cost of debt remains at a competitive 2.9% with only US$125 million in debt facilities maturing 
before 2018. We continue to extend our debt maturity profile and further diversify our debt investor base to 
fund committed expenditure and growth. 
“Moving forward, we will add significant production volumes from Wheatstone LNG to our portfolio in mid-
2017  and  further  low-cost  production  from  the  Greater  Enfield  Project  in  2019. Work continues  on  North 
West Shelf plateau extension projects with GWF-2 on track for start-up in the second half of 2019. 
“We also see near-term opportunities to commercialise the SNE discovery in Senegal. 
“In Myanmar we made back-to-back discoveries, increasing our contingent resources by 83 MMboe. Both 
discoveries  are  located  close  to  existing  infrastructure  and  markets  and  we  are  working  through 
development options with significant appraisal work scheduled for next year. 
“We have also been successful in rebalancing our global exploration portfolio and plan to drill a series of 
wells in 2017,” he said.

Key business activities
Operational excellence 
•
Increased 2016 production guidance to 90–95 MMboe. This includes the impact of the sale of the 
Northern Endeavour FPSO facility and cessation of oil production at Balnaves.
•  Production of 45.9 MMboe, 9% higher than 1H 2015, while reducing unit production costs by 38%. 
•  Pluto LNG annualised production rate of 4.9 mtpa was 14% higher than expected capacity at time
of FID. The asset continued to achieve top-quartile reliability of 99.2% during the half.
•  Executed major North West Shelf (NWS) Project planned onshore and offshore turnaround ahead 
of schedule and on budget. The NWS Train 4 turnaround was delivered in 23 days, 8 days ahead of 
schedule.
Managing risk profile 
•  Signed a heads of agreement with Pertamina for the supply of 0.5 to 1.0 mtpa of LNG commencing in 
2019 for a period of 15–20 years. The heads of agreement remains conditional on the negotiation and 
execution of a fully termed LNG sale and purchase agreement (SPA).
•  De-risked 2017 to 2018 revenue stream with 85–90% of expected production now either committed
under term contracts or subject to finalisation of SPAs.
•  Executed  ten  additional  NWS  LNG  contract  price  reviews  and  continue  to  work  with  customers  to 
achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. Price review outcomes maintained strong oil price linkage and 
Woodside  achieved  approximately  US$50  million  in  additional  reconciliation  payments  and  other 
commercial benefits.
•  Executed agreements necessary to enable equity lifting of NWS uncommitted LNG and domestic gas 
volumes. Uncontracted LNG and domestic gas volumes have been equity lifted from 1 July 2016. This 
provides additional portfolio scale and flexibility. Existing sales contracts will continue to be managed 
jointly on behalf of the NWS Project participants.
•  Added one LNG carrier to our shipping fleet in the first quarter, increasing it to four comprising two 
portfolio vessels  and  two  dedicated  Pluto  vessels. The  expanded  shipping  fleet  provides  additional 
capacity and flexibility to manage a diversifying customer base including in Egypt and India.
•  Pre-tax portfolio cost of debt remains competitive at 2.9%. 
•  Extended debt maturity profile with only US$125 million in debt facilities maturing before 2018. 
•  Subsequent  to  the  half,  further  diversified  debt  investor  base  via  issuances  under  the  Global
Medium Term Notes (GMTN) programme.
Capturing and building near-term value growth
•  The Wheatstone Project (Woodside 13%, non-operator) construction and commissioning activities
are progressing consistent with previous guidance of first LNG from Train 1 mid-2017. First LNG 
production from Train 2 is expected 6-8 months later. LNG site productivity improvements since the 
beginning of the year provide confidence in the current schedule. The operator will provide an update 
on shared facility and downstream plant cost and joint venture budget in due course.
•  The Julimar Project (Woodside 65%, operator) is progressing to plan to be ready for start-up in 2H
2016 and the cost outlook remains below our estimate at acquisition.
•  NWS  Project  plateau  extension  work  is  progressing  well.  The  Persephone  Project  remains  on 
budget with a revised earlier start-up expected in 2H 2017 and the Greater Western Flank Phase 2 
Project remains on track for start-up in 2H 2019.
•  Approved Greater Enfield Project, developing oil reserves (2P) of 41 MMbbl Woodside share (69
MMbbl, 100%) as a tie-back to the Ngujima-Yin FPSO, targeting first oil mid-2019.
•  Discoveries  offshore  Myanmar  in  Block  A-6  (Shwe  Yee  Htun-1)  and  Block  AD-7  (Thalin-1A)
increased contingent resources (2C) by 83 MMboe Woodside share.
•  Entered agreement to acquire a 65% participating interest and operatorship of AGC Profond Block
in Senegal – Guinea-Bissau.2
•  On 14 July 2016, Woodside agreed to acquire ConocoPhillips Senegal B.V., a company that holds 
a 35% interest in the 560 MMbbl SNE deep water oil discovery (100%, at the 2C confidence level).3 
•  Expanded acreage position offshore Gabon by acquiring a 40% interest in the Luna Muetse Block.4  
•  Entered  into  a  Project  Development  Agreement  with  Sempra  LNG  &  Midstream  to  continue
assessment of a potential 10 mtpa natural gas liquefaction facility in Port Arthur, Texas.
•  The Kitimat LNG Project in British Columbia continued progressing work on reducing capital cost. 
Appraisal  drilling  of  the  Liard  resource  (30  Tcf  2C,  100%)  continued  with  extended  production 
testing of two wells currently underway. Well performance is exceeding initial expectations. Further 
well testing will be undertaken in the second half.
•  Pursuing a phased development concept to maximise value of the Browse Development. 
•  Entered FEED with the Equus project participants to process third party gas resources through the
NWS.

Notes on petroleum resource estimates 
 
1.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  petroleum  resource  estimates  are  quoted  as  at  the  balance  date  (i.e.  31 
December)  of  the  Reserves  Statement  in  Woodside’s  most  recent  Annual  Report  released  to  ASX  and 
available  at  http://www.woodside.com.au/Investors-Media/Announcements,  net  Woodside  share  at  standard 
oilfield conditions of 14.696 psi (101.325 kPa) and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.56 deg Celsius). Woodside is not 
aware  of  any  new  information  or  data  that  materially  affects  the  information  included  in  the  Reserves 
Statement. All the material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the Reserves 
Statement continue to apply and have not materially changed.
2.  Subsequent  to  the  Reserves  Statement  dated  31  December  2015,  by  ASX  Announcements  dated  20  May 
2016,  Woodside:  (i)  increased  its  estimate  of  contingent  resource  (2C)  by  83  MMboe  as  a  result  of  the 
ShweYee Htun and Thalin fields and (ii) reduced its estimate of contingent resource (2C) by 1 MMboe as a 
result of a revision of its estimate of contingent resource (2C) relating to the Laverda and Cimatti fields. By ASX 
Announcement dated 27 June 2016, Woodside increased its reserves (2P) by 41 MMboe (and decreased its 
estimate of contingent resource (2C) by 41 MMboe) in conjunction with the final investment decision to proceed 
with  the  Greater  Enfield  Oil  Development.  The  decision  to  proceed  increased  proved  reserves  (1P)  by  30 
MMboe.
3.  Woodside reports reserves net of the fuel and flare required for production, processing and transportation up to 
a reference point. For offshore oil projects, the reference point is defined as the outlet of the floating production 
storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel, while for the onshore gas projects the reference point is defined as the 
inlet to the downstream (onshore) processing facility.
5.
4.  Woodside uses both deterministic and probabilistic methods for estimation of petroleum resources at the field 
and project levels. Unless otherwise stated, all petroleum estimates reported at the company or region level are 
aggregated  by  arithmetic  summation  by  category.  Note  that  the  aggregated  Proved  level  may  be  a  very 
conservative estimate due to the portfolio effects of arithmetic summation. 
‘MMboe’ means millions (106) of barrels of oil equivalent. Dry gas volumes, defined as ‘C4 minus’ hydrocarbon 
components and non-hydrocarbon volumes that are present in sales product, are converted to oil equivalent 
volumes via a constant conversion factor, which for Woodside is 5.7 Bcf of dry gas per 1 MMboe. Volumes of 
oil and condensate, defined as ‘C5 plus’ petroleum components, are converted from MMbbl to MMboe on a 1:1 
ratio.
6.  The  estimates  of  petroleum  resources  are  based  on  and  fairly  represent  information  and  supporting 
documentation prepared by qualified petroleum reserves and resources evaluators. The estimates have been 
approved  by  Mr  Ian  F  Sylvester,  Woodside’s  Vice  President  Reservoir  Management,  who  is  a  full-time 
employee of the company and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Mr Sylvester’s qualifications 
include a Master of Engineering (Petroleum Engineering) from Imperial College, University of London, England, 
and more than 20 years of relevant experience.
