<p>resolution 25/37 of 28 March 2014. 
</p>
<p>Libya is facing the worst political crisis and escalation of violence since the 2011 
</p>
<p>armed conflict. Two parliaments and governments claim legitimacy, while powerful armed 
</p>
<p>groups exercise effective control on the ground, committing violations of international 
</p>
<p>human rights and humanitarian law with impunity. The justice system continues to be 
</p>
<p>attacked and is no longer functioning in parts of the country. In this context, the provision 
</p>
<p>of technical assistance has been significantly disrupted. However, some State institutions 
</p>
<p>and civil society organizations are still functioning to varying degrees and require 
</p>
<p>assistance.  
</p>
<p>The report gives an overview of the human rights situation in Libya and of the 
</p>
<p>technical assistance provided to support key institutions and civil society actors. It contains 
</p>
<p>recommendations to address the protection of civilians, improve the administration of 
</p>
<p>justice and support legal reform, transitional justice and national institutions.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 25/37 
</p>
<p>of 28 March 2014. It was prepared in cooperation with the United Nations Support Mission 
</p>
<p>in Libya (UNSMIL). The figures in the report are best estimates based on information 
</p>
<p>received from members of the United Nations Country Team in Libya and other sources. 
</p>
<p>The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)  
</p>
<p>continues to provide support to the human rights mandate of UNSMIL. The Director of 
</p>
<p>UNSMIL Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division represents the 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner in Libya.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>2. Since the High Commissioner&#8217;s last report to Council (A/HRC/25/42), the human 
</p>
<p>rights and humanitarian situation in Libya has deteriorated amidst escalating violence and 
</p>
<p>an increasingly volatile political environment. In March 2014, following controversy over 
</p>
<p>the expiry date of the term of the parliament &#8212; the General National Congress &#8212;, an 
</p>
<p>agreement was reached to amend the Constitutional Declaration to hold national elections 
</p>
<p>on 25 June to create a new parliament &#8212; the House of Representatives. The House was to 
</p>
<p>convene in Benghazi in accordance with the amended Constitutional Declaration, but in the 
</p>
<p>light of the security situation, its first meeting was convened in Tobruk on 4 August 2014, 
</p>
<p>and has remained there since. In February 2014, separate nation-wide elections were held 
</p>
<p>for a Constitution Drafting Assembly, which was established in the town of Al-Baida and 
</p>
<p>held its first meeting on 21 April.  
</p>
<p>3. In mid-May 2014, in Benghazi, General Khalifa Haftar launched Operation Dignity 
</p>
<p>(<i>karama</i>) against the Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council, an alliance comprising 
</p>
<p>Ansar al-Shari&#8217;a, Libya Shield units and other armed groups. Fierce fighting has continued 
</p>
<p>since then. The Shura Council initially gained control of most of the city. Fighting in 
</p>
<p>Benghazi intensified in mid-October 2014, following a renewed offensive by General 
</p>
<p>Haftar&#8217;s forces &#8212; the Libya National Army &#8212;, which appeared to have gained control of 
</p>
<p>sizeable areas of Benghazi by December 2014.  
</p>
<p>4. Tripoli witnessed six consecutive weeks of heavy fighting from mid-July 2014, 
</p>
<p>when an alliance of armed groups, primarily from Misrata, but also from other towns, 
</p>
<p>including Al-Zawiya and Gheryan, and Tripoli-based armed groups launched Operation 
</p>
<p>Libya Dawn (<i>fajr Libya</i>) against the Zintan-affiliated Al-Qa&#8217;qa&#8217; and Al-Sawai&#8217;q armed 
</p>
<p>groups allied with fighters from the Warshafana region, west of Tripoli. The fighting was 
</p>
<p>particularly intense around Tripoli International Airport, but affected other large areas of 
</p>
<p>Tripoli. On 24 August 2014, Libya Dawn fighters seized control of the airport and other 
</p>
<p>areas of Tripoli from Zintan-affiliated armed groups, which withdrew from the city. Libya 
</p>
<p>Dawn operations were extended to the Warshafana region until Libya Dawn gained control 
</p>
<p>over the region. Fighting then broke out in the Nafusa Mountains when Zintan-affiliated 
</p>
<p>armed groups attacked the towns of Kikla and Al-Qala&#8217;a. At the time of writing, 
</p>
<p>intermittent fighting was ongoing in the Nafusa Mountains and air strikes against Mitiga 
</p>
<p>Airport and other areas in the west of the country had been carried out by the air force 
</p>
<p>aligned with General Haftar. 
</p>
<p>5. Sporadic fighting also erupted throughout the year in southern Libya around the 
</p>
<p>towns of Sabha, Kufra and Awbari, involving Arab, Tabu and Tuareg armed groups, many 
</p>
<p>allied with either the Dignity or Libya Dawn camps.  </p>


<p>6. Following Libya Dawn&#8217;s takeover of Tripoli at the end of August 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Government, led by incumbent Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni, left Tripoli and moved 
</p>
<p>to the town of Al-Baida. The House of Representatives subsequently confirmed Mr. Al-
</p>
<p>Thinni as Prime Minister. In Tripoli, the General National Congress reconvened and 
</p>
<p>established its own government, led by Omar al-Hasi, which gradually took control of 
</p>
<p>Tripoli-based ministries and other State institutions. On 6 November, the Supreme Court 
</p>
<p>declared unconstitutional a provision of the March 2014 constitutional amendment which 
</p>
<p>had paved the way for elections to create the House of Representatives. 
</p>
<p>7. Hundreds of armed groups, comprising more than 200,000 fighters, continue to be 
</p>
<p>paid from central State funds. Some are nominally affiliated with either the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Defence or the Ministry of the Interior. Those groups exercise effective control in localized 
</p>
<p>areas and over detention centres, where thousands of persons associated with the former 
</p>
<p>regime, among others, continue to be detained outside of the effective oversight of the 
</p>
<p>authorities.  
</p>
<p>8. UNSMIL/OHCHR continues to monitor and report on the human rights situation in 
</p>
<p>Libya, despite the relocation of UNSMIL international staff outside of Libya in mid-July 
</p>
<p>2014. UNSMIL has repeatedly called on all armed groups to desist from violations of 
</p>
<p>international human rights and humanitarian law and abuses of human rights. Joint reports 
</p>
<p>on the situation were issued by OHCHR and UNSMIL on 4 September 20141 and 23 
</p>
<p>December 2014.2 However, interlocutors are often reluctant to talk about human rights 
</p>
<p>abuses out of fear of retaliation by armed groups. That climate and the continuing violence 
</p>
<p>and political crisis have severely impacted the delivery of technical assistance by 
</p>
<p>UNSMIL/OHCHR and others. In some cases, such assistance had to be reconfigured or 
</p>
<p>suspended.  
</p>
<p>9. On 27 August 2014, the Security Council adopted resolution 2174 (2014), in which 
</p>
<p>it decided that travel ban or asset freeze measures would be applied to individuals or 
</p>
<p>entities &#8220;engaging in or providing support for other acts that threaten the peace, stability or 
</p>
<p>security of Libya&#8221;, including &#8220;planning, directing, or committing, acts that violate 
</p>
<p>applicable international human rights law or international humanitarian law, or acts that 
</p>
<p>constitute human rights abuses, in Libya&#8221; (para. 4). 
</p>
<p>10. Libya is a party to the core international human rights treaties, including the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination Against Women, the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman 
</p>
<p>or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 
</p>
<p>International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and 
</p>
<p>Members of Their Families. It has also ratified the first Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>Libya is also a party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, but has not yet 
</p>
<p>ratified, inter alia, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
</p>
<p>Enforced Disappearance, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other 
</p>
<p>Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, or the 1951 Convention 
</p>
<p>relating to the Status of Refugees and its Protocol. In 2013, Libya ratified the Convention 
</p>

<p>on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but it has not yet deposited the instrument of 
</p>
<p>ratification. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights priorities and technical support needs 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Protection of civilians 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Indiscriminate shelling and other violations of international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>11. Indiscriminate attacks by all sides in densely populated areas have been frequently 
</p>
<p>reported, resulting in civilian casualties in Tripoli, Benghazi, Warshafana, the Nafusa 
</p>
<p>Mountains and other areas. While the precise number of casualties is not known, hundreds 
</p>
<p>are reported to have been killed. Land mines were reportedly used in the Tripoli 
</p>
<p>International Airport area and explosive remnants of war are a major hazard for civilians.  
</p>
<p>12. Armed groups have been using a variety of weapons, including small arms, rockets, 
</p>
<p>mortars, anti-aircraft guns, tanks and air attacks. Many of the weapons used are unreliable 
</p>
<p>because they are old and poorly maintained, with inaccurate aiming systems and faulty 
</p>
<p>ammunition. Fighters have received little training and do not operate with the appropriate 
</p>
<p>discipline, command and control systems. Those factors have contributed to the 
</p>
<p>indiscriminate nature of many attacks. 
</p>
<p>13. There have been frequent power, fuel and food shortages and a breakdown in basic 
</p>
<p>health and education services. 
</p>
<p>14. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
</p>
<p>estimated that the violence has led to the internal displacement of nearly 400,000 persons 
</p>
<p>between May and November 2014.3  
</p>
<p>15. Civilian infrastructure in Benghazi, Tripoli and other parts of Libya has been 
</p>
<p>damaged extensively by the fighting. Armed groups affiliated with different camps have 
</p>
<p>also engaged in the deliberate destruction of civilian property belonging to their perceived 
</p>
<p>opponents in Benghazi, Tripoli and Warshafana, including through the use of bulldozers. 
</p>
<p>16. Several hospitals were hit, including Tripoli Al-Afya Hospital and Tripoli Central 
</p>
<p>Hospital, during July and August 2014. In September, a hospital in Al-Zawiya was also hit 
</p>
<p>and Al-Zahra hospital in the Warshafana area was reportedly looted and burned. In 
</p>
<p>Benghazi, the Hawari General Hospital suspended operations due to the fighting, and Ansar 
</p>
<p>al-Shari&#8217;a temporarily occupied Al-Jalaa hospital and reportedly shelled a wing of the 
</p>
<p>Benghazi Medical Centre, setting off a fire in December. Reports were also received of the 
</p>
<p>obstructed evacuation of injured persons and of impeded humanitarian assistance, as well as 
</p>
<p>of the misuse of medical vehicles for military purposes. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Summary executions, abductions, torture and other ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>17. Throughout 2014, UNSMIL/OHCHR received reports of summary executions by 
</p>
<p>targeted assassination, car bombs and beheadings. Human rights defenders, civil society 
</p>
<p>activists and media professionals, as well as members of the judiciary and law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officers, were among the victims, amidst the increasing violence. In November, footage of 
</p>
<p>the beheading of several people, apparently in Benghazi and Derna, were circulated on 
</p>
<p>social media. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 See www.unhcr.org/5465fdb89.html. </p>


<p>18. The escalation in violence in 2014 also increased the number of persons deprived of 
</p>
<p>their liberty by armed groups. In addition to fighters belonging to rival armed groups, 
</p>
<p>UNSMIL/OHCHR received reports of civilians being abducted solely for their actual or 
</p>
<p>suspected tribal, family, political or religious affiliation and nationality. A significant 
</p>
<p>proportion of victims interviewed by UNSMIL/OHCHR reported that they had been 
</p>
<p>subjected to torture and other ill-treatment during abduction. People abducted have been 
</p>
<p>either unlawfully detained in official detention facilities or in makeshift facilities which are 
</p>
<p>not officially recognized. Many people remain missing since the time of their abduction. 
</p>
<p>19. In western Libya, abductions were carried out by armed groups belonging to or 
</p>
<p>allied with Libya Dawn, as well as those from Warshafana and Zintan. Libya Dawn fighters 
</p>
<p>have continued to search for and abduct people, following their takeover of Tripoli. Armed 
</p>
<p>groups from Zintan and Warshafana abducted travellers and other people from Gheryan, 
</p>
<p>Misrata, Nalut, Tripoli and Al-Zawiya. Many were held in captivity until they were 
</p>
<p>exchanged for other abductees. 
</p>
<p>20. In eastern Libya, armed groups affiliated with Operation Dignity abducted dozens of 
</p>
<p>men in areas under their control, including on the basis of their political affiliation or 
</p>
<p>nationality. Some of those abducted were allegedly tortured in several detention centres 
</p>
<p>before being taken to Gernada prison near Al-Baida. In October 2014, the Benghazi 
</p>
<p>Revolutionaries Shura Council moved over 130 inmates from Buhdeima military prison to 
</p>
<p>an unknown destination and stated that they were going to be tried in accordance with 
</p>
<p>sharia<i>.</i> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Groups in focus 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Women 
</b></p>
<p>21. There were numerous incidents of violence against women during 2014. In the lead-
</p>
<p>up to the February 2014 elections for the Constitution Drafting Assembly, 
</p>
<p>UNSMIL/OHCHR received reports of threats and attacks against female candidates, which 
</p>
<p>contributed to their reluctance to run for election, and staff observed posters of female 
</p>
<p>candidates being torn down. On 25 June, prominent human rights defender Salwa 
</p>
<p>Bughaigis was shot dead in her Benghazi residence, after casting her vote in elections for 
</p>
<p>the House of Representatives. On 17 July, former member of the General National 
</p>
<p>Congress Fariha Barkawi was assassinated in Derna.  
</p>
<p>22. Several women activists reported that they had been pressured to abandon their 
</p>
<p>public roles. One human rights defender reported that she had received several telephone 
</p>
<p>calls from armed groups warning that if she continued writing about women&#8217;s rights, she 
</p>
<p>and her children would be killed. She and her family have since left the country. Another 
</p>
<p>human rights defender and lawyer who had taken part in a public debate on women&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>received anonymous telephone calls and text messages warning her that she would be 
</p>
<p>abducted and killed.  
</p>
<p>23. Libyan women also face discrimination in personal status and other matters, such as 
</p>
<p>polygamy, prohibition to travel without a male guardian and the inability to pass on their 
</p>
<p>nationality to their children or spouses. Civil society activists have raised these as key 
</p>
<p>issues to be addressed in the constitution drafting process.  
</p>
<p>24. UNSMIL is in regular contact with women&#8217;s rights defenders and has organized 
</p>
<p>several workshops to build their capacity. UNSMIL has also provided technical advice to 
</p>
<p>strengthen women&#8217;s participation in areas such as the political process and constitution 
</p>
<p>drafting. </p>


<p>25. The present report also addresses the efforts of the Libyan authorities to provide 
</p>
<p>support to women and men victims of sexual violence.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Children 
</b></p>
<p>26. UNSMIL/OHCHR received reports of children killed or maimed as a result of the 
</p>
<p>violence, victims of attacks on schools and hospitals, and affected by the denial of 
</p>
<p>humanitarian access.  
</p>
<p>27. UNSMIL/OHCHR documented tens of cases of children injured or killed as a result 
</p>
<p>of shelling in Tripoli and Benghazi. Children in camps housing displaced persons have also 
</p>
<p>been injured as a result of the shelling. On 30 August 2014, a 15-year-old Tawerghan boy 
</p>
<p>was reportedly injured during an attack on Al-Fallah camp for internally displaced persons 
</p>
<p>in an area controlled by Libya Dawn. On 14 September, shelling in Al-Zawiya resulted in 
</p>
<p>serious injury to two boys, aged 6 and 9, and a girl, aged 10. Other reports include the 
</p>
<p>killing of at least six children in incidents of shelling or crossfire, in Benghazi.  
</p>
<p>28. Explosive remnants of war remain a major hazard for children, and civilian objects, 
</p>
<p>such as schools, have been extensively damaged by shelling, limiting access to education. 
</p>
<p>Schools in Benghazi, Tripoli and other places have been closed and converted into 
</p>
<p>makeshift shelters for internally displaced persons. UNSMIL/OHCHR also received reports 
</p>
<p>that schools in the Warshafana areas and Nafusa Mountains were being used as bases by 
</p>
<p>armed groups for launching attacks.  
</p>
<p>29. UNSMIL/OHCHR closely liaised with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
</p>
<p>(UNICEF) in monitoring violations of the rights of children; contributing to the annual 
</p>
<p>report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict; and reporting relevant 
</p>
<p>violations to the Security Council by way of the Global Horizontal Note coordinated by the 
</p>
<p>Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>30. Prior to the recent violence in 2014, roughly 60,000 Libyans remained internally 
</p>
<p>displaced4, mainly as a result of the 2011 conflict.  Those affected included persons from 
</p>
<p>Mashashiya, Gualish, Jaramla, Si&#8217;an, as well as Tabu and Tuareg communities. The 
</p>
<p>inhabitants of the town of Tawergha are the largest group of internally displaced, totalling 
</p>
<p>about 30,000.5 They were forcibly displaced from their town in August 2011 by armed 
</p>
<p>groups from Misrata, following allegations of grave human rights abuses committed in 
</p>
<p>Misrata by pro-Qadhafi forces from Tawergha. Since then, Tawerghans have been unable 
</p>
<p>to return to their town and have been subjected to continuous harassment. Some camps for 
</p>
<p>internally displaced Tawerghans were located in or near areas affected by the fighting in 
</p>
<p>Tripoli and Benghazi. Members of armed groups have raided camps for displaced 
</p>
<p>Tawerghans, conducting unlawful killings and abductions. On 30 August, Al-Fallah camp 
</p>
<p>was raided by forces affiliated with Libya Dawn: one person was reportedly killed and 
</p>
<p>three were injured. Many Tawerghans have thus fled for fear of further shelling or 
</p>
<p>abductions. In mid-October, 2,500 Tawerghans fled their camp in Benghazi and are staying 
</p>
<p>in makeshift shelters in Ajdabiya and elsewhere. UNSMIL/OHCHR has maintained close 
</p>
<p>contact with the representatives of the Tawergha community in order to monitor their 
</p>
<p>situation, ensure awareness of abuses against them and address their humanitarian needs.  
</p>
<p>31. The ongoing escalation in violence led to a new wave of internally displaced 
</p>
<p>persons. In mid-November 2014, UNHCR estimated that approximately 400,000 people 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 See www.unhcr.org/538484ab9.html. 
</p>
<p> 5 Ibid. </p>


<p>had been internally displaced by the fighting.6 UNSMIL/OHCHR received reports of 
</p>
<p>displacement as a result of damage to residential properties through indiscriminate shelling, 
</p>
<p>and of intentional destruction of residential properties, farms, factories and other businesses 
</p>
<p>by armed groups targeting perceived opponents, particularly in Warshafana and in 
</p>
<p>Benghazi.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers 
</b></p>
<p>32. Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers remain extremely vulnerable in Libya. Libya 
</p>
<p>has not ratified the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and the authorities 
</p>
<p>have not established a proper protection framework. Detention of such individuals is 
</p>
<p>widespread and prolonged, particularly affecting those originating from sub-Saharan 
</p>
<p>Africa. The detainees usually have no means of challenging their detention.  
</p>
<p>33. In the first half of 2014, UNSMIL/OHCHR visited various detention centres for 
</p>
<p>migrants, including in Abu Salim, Al-Zawiya, Al-Tewisha, Al-Hamra, Al-Khoms, Al-
</p>
<p>Gewia, Burshada, Gatrun, Surman, Zoo Centre and Zliten. UNSMIL/OHCHR found 
</p>
<p>conditions of grave concern, including chronic overcrowding, poor sanitation and health 
</p>
<p>care, and insufficient food. There were also consistent reports of physical or verbal 
</p>
<p>mistreatment, labour exploitation, sexual abuse, extortion and confiscation of identity 
</p>
<p>documents, and minors were being detained with adults. Women detainees reported that 
</p>
<p>they were subjected to sexual violence. The escalation in the violence has exacerbated the 
</p>
<p>situation due to the breakdown in public services and the scarcity of basic items. 
</p>
<p>34. Migrants became even more vulnerable due to the recent violence, especially those 
</p>
<p>in areas affected by the fighting, without the ability or means to leave. Many migrants have 
</p>
<p>sought to flee the violence by crossing the borders into neighbouring countries, some of 
</p>
<p>which have intermittently imposed strict restrictions on entry. In a visit to Zuwara in north-
</p>
<p>western Libya, in mid-August 2014, UNSMIL/OHCHR staff interviewed migrants who had 
</p>
<p>fled the shelling in the Al-Krimeya neighbourhood of Tripoli and were living without 
</p>
<p>adequate shelter, proper sanitary facilities, sufficient food or basic physical security, and 
</p>
<p>who reported threats from Libyan border guards. Others, including women, unaccompanied 
</p>
<p>children and elderly people, have sought to leave by sea routes. UNHCR estimates that 
</p>
<p>approximately 130,000 people arrived in Italy from Libya between January and October 
</p>
<p>2014.7 While many were rescued at sea by the Italian navy and other forces, over 3,000 
</p>
<p>people reportedly died at sea during that period.8 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Amazigh, Tabu and Tuareg communities 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Amazigh, Tabu and Tuareg communities are officially referred to as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;components&#8221; of Libyan society. Many within these communities consider themselves 
</p>
<p>indigenous persons. The Amazigh community, as well as sizeable proportions of the Tabu 
</p>
<p>and Tuareg communities, boycotted the elections for the Constitution Drafting Assembly 
</p>
<p>on the grounds that the proposed decision-making procedures of the Assembly did not offer 
</p>
<p>sufficient guarantees to protect their rights. In addition, they did not consider the two seats 
</p>
<p>reserved for each community as adequate. However, Tabu and Tuareg communities did 
</p>
<p>vote, one month later, to elect representatives.

<p><b> 6. Religious minorities 
</b></p>
<p>36. In February 2014, the bodies of seven Egyptian Coptic Christians were found near 
</p>
<p>Benghazi. Also, in February, over 30 Egyptian Copts were detained in Benghazi, allegedly 
</p>
<p>tortured and asked to convert to Islam by Ansar al-Shari&#8217;a, before being released a few days 
</p>
<p>later and deported to Egypt.  
</p>
<p>37. In October 2014, armed men looted and damaged the Othman Pasha Madrasa, which 
</p>
<p>serves Tripoli&#8217;s Sufi community. In the same month, a group of gunmen stormed and 
</p>
<p>vandalized the Karamanli Mosque. Days later, attackers attempted to vandalize the Darghut 
</p>
<p>Mosque, but failed when local volunteers protected the building.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Civil society 
</b></p>
<p>38. Since the outbreak of violence in mid-2014, UNSMIL/OHCHR has received reports 
</p>
<p>of civil society activists in Benghazi and Tripoli being threatened, abducted, unlawfully 
</p>
<p>killed or having their homes looted or burned down. Individuals have been shot in the street 
</p>
<p>while going about their routine, others have been threatened through social media and text 
</p>
<p>messages. In one case, an activist was abducted shortly after he had been threatened on 
</p>
<p>Facebook. One prominent human rights defender received text messages warning that his 
</p>
<p>children would be abducted and killed if he did not stop his advocacy work. Known 
</p>
<p>activists, Tawfik Bensaud, aged 18, and Sami al-Kawafi, aged 17, were killed in Benghazi 
</p>
<p>on 19 September. In Derna, Usama al-Mansuri was killed on 6 October, apparently after 
</p>
<p>publicly criticizing a declaration by armed groups in the town pledging allegiance to the so-
</p>
<p>called Islamic State. As a result, numerous human rights defenders have curtailed their 
</p>
<p>activism, gone into hiding or left the country.  
</p>
<p>39. UNSMIL/OHCHR is in regular contact with human rights defenders, including 
</p>
<p>those who have relocated out of the country as a result of attacks and intimidation directed 
</p>
<p>against them, and has sought to support them through the provision of practical advice, the 
</p>
<p>facilitation of contact with local non-governmental providers of aid, and ongoing 
</p>
<p>monitoring and public reporting of their situation.9  
</p>
<p><b> 8. Media professionals 
</b></p>
<p>40. Media professionals have been subjected to increasing attacks and abductions, which 
</p>
<p>has limited freedom of expression and opinion and the dissemination of information. On 26 
</p>
<p>May 2014, Muftah Abu Zeid, the editor-in-chief of <i>Berniq</i> newspaper, was killed in 
</p>
<p>Benghazi. On 8 October, Al-Mu&#8217;tasem al-Warfalli, a journalist with the Libya Al-Watan 
</p>
<p>radio station, was shot dead in Benghazi. Television stations Libya Al-Aseema, Al-Ahrar, 
</p>
<p>Al-Dawliya and Al-Wataniya have been attacked in Benghazi and Tripoli. A journalist who 
</p>
<p>used to be based in Tripoli informed UNSMIL/OHCHR that he left the country after 
</p>
<p>receiving death threats as well as threats against his family on social media. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Detention and conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p>41. The situation of persons deprived of their liberty since the 2011 conflict remains a 
</p>
<p>major concern. In October 2013, UNSMIL/OHCHR published a joint report on widespread 
</p>
<p>torture, other ill-treatment and deaths of those detained in Libya.10 According to the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 See www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15168. 
</p>
<p> 10 See www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/LY/TortureDeathsDetentionLibya.pdf. </p>


<p>Ministry of Justice, as of March 2014, 6,200 people were held under its control across the 
</p>
<p>country. Only 10 per cent of them had been tried and were serving prison sentences.  
</p>
<p>42. As a result of the serious security challenges faced by the authorities, progress in the 
</p>
<p>judicial screening of detainees and the release of those who would not be prosecuted has 
</p>
<p>been minimal despite successive deadlines set by national legislation. While, scores of 
</p>
<p>detainees have been released from detention facilities in Al-Zawiya and Misrata, the vast 
</p>
<p>majority continue to await judicial process.  
</p>
<p>43. UNSMIL/OHCHR is concerned that, amidst the heightened violence and political 
</p>
<p>vacuum, persons held in detention are at increased risk of abuse, as it has received several 
</p>
<p>reports of torture and other ill-treatment. Conditions in some facilities, such as Al-Jawiya 
</p>
<p>prison in Misrata, officially under the Ministry of Justice, seem to have deteriorated, with 
</p>
<p>reports of beatings and other abuses. UNSMIL also documented individual cases of torture 
</p>
<p>carried out by armed groups from Warshafana and Al-Zawiya (in particular in Al-Jazira and 
</p>
<p>Al-Jandubi prisons) and in Tripoli (in particular in Mitiga and Abu Salim detention 
</p>
<p>centres). Three inmates were killed in unclear circumstances, allegedly during a prison riot, 
</p>
<p>in Al-Sikt prison in Misrata, on 29 August. On 22 October, more than 130 detainees were 
</p>
<p>removed by the Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council from Buhdeima military prison to 
</p>
<p>an unknown location, reportedly to be tried in accordance with sharia.  
</p>
<p>44. During the course of 2014, UNSMIL/OHCHR staff visited, at least once, some 20 
</p>
<p>detention centres, mostly in western Libya, where the largest concentration of detainees is 
</p>
<p>found. Through that monitoring, UNSMIL notified the authorities in control of the facilities 
</p>
<p>and relevant ministries of pertinent issues and specific cases requiring attention, and made 
</p>
<p>recommendations to improve the conditions of detention, in an attempt to bring them into 
</p>
<p>line with international human rights standards, including the Standard Minimum Rules for 
</p>
<p>the Treatment of Prisoners. 
</p>
<p><b>2. The Judicial Police 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Libyan authorities have continued to integrate members of armed groups into 
</p>
<p>the Judicial Police, whose responsibilities include managing prisons, enforcing court 
</p>
<p>decisions, maintaining the security of courts and apprehending fugitives. By June 2014, 
</p>
<p>approximately 10,000 members had been integrated into the Judicial Police. Despite advice 
</p>
<p>from UNSMIL/OHCHR on international standards relating to vetting procedures, no formal 
</p>
<p>vetting process was undertaken. The Judicial Police face challenges in ensuring control 
</p>
<p>over the facilities it is nominally responsible for. Many armed groups continue to retain 
</p>
<p>command structures and exercise autonomous control over those facilities, even when they 
</p>
<p>are formally under the authority of the Ministry of Justice.  
</p>
<p>46. While UNSMIL/OHCHR has observed that basic security has been maintained for a 
</p>
<p>number of prisons, the recent violence has presented further challenges for the Judicial 
</p>
<p>Police. Only about 50 per cent of Judicial Police officers are estimated to have been 
</p>
<p>reporting for duty during the fighting. Prisons have also been affected by the disruption in 
</p>
<p>basic services, which has led to a lack of medical supplies and scarcity of certain food 
</p>
<p>items.  
</p>
<p>47. In February 2014, UNSMIL/OHCHR assisted the Judicial Police in conducting a 
</p>
<p>census of detainees. For the first time since the 2011 conflict, the exercise provided the 
</p>
<p>authorities with snapshot data on detainees, including their name, age, gender, charges and 
</p>
<p>legal status. The census facilitated the follow-up of specific cases. UNSMIL/OHCHR 
</p>
<p>further advised on the development of information management systems to ensure 
</p>
<p>sustainable means of maintaining and retrieving timely data on detainees. In May, 
</p>
<p>UNSMIL/OHCHR cooperated with the World Organisation Against Torture in providing 
</p>
<p>capacity-building sessions on increasing prison authorities&#8217; awareness of human rights </p>


<p>standards. In November, it took part in a regional exchange on human rights complaint 
</p>
<p>mechanisms within detention centres. 
</p>
<p><b>3. The judiciary and the courts 
</b></p>
<p>48. The deteriorating security environment has impacted heavily on the judiciary, 
</p>
<p>further undermining the effective administration of justice and the process of reform. 
</p>
<p>Prosecutors and judges have been frequently subjected to intimidation and attacks, in the 
</p>
<p>form of court bombings, physical assaults, abduction of individuals or family members and 
</p>
<p>unlawful killings. An explosion on 6 January led to the death of a police officer guarding 
</p>
<p>the South Benghazi Court. Former Prosecutor General, Judge Abd al-Aziz al-Hasadi, was 
</p>
<p>assassinated in Derna on 8 February. Two months later, Deputy Director General of the 
</p>
<p>High Judicial Institute, Judge Kamal al-Bahari, was abducted from his office and released 
</p>
<p>the following evening. The offices of the Prosecutor General and courts in central Tripoli 
</p>
<p>were hit by shells on 20 August.  
</p>
<p>49. The attacks are often intended to prevent the release of members of the former 
</p>
<p>regime and to thwart the arrest and prosecution of members of armed groups. Law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officials and the Judicial Police do not have sufficient capacity, training or 
</p>
<p>resources to ensure the security of the judiciary or to undertake effective investigations.  
</p>
<p>50. The courts in Derna, Benghazi and Sirte effectively stopped functioning since March 
</p>
<p>2014, and in Tripoli during the fighting in July and August. There has been no known 
</p>
<p>prosecution of leaders or members of armed groups, despite serious and continuous human 
</p>
<p>rights abuses being carried out. Social dispute-resolution mechanisms, such as councils of 
</p>
<p>elders, have emerged to fill the gap created by the largely non-functioning courts, further 
</p>
<p>undermining the rule of law.  
</p>
<p>51. To compound matters, on 31 August 2014, the Government announced that it had 
</p>
<p>lost control of most ministries and government facilities in Tripoli, including the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Justice. UNSMIL/OHCHR subsequently received a number of reports that the archives 
</p>
<p>of the ministries of Justice, Defence and the Interior, in Tripoli, had been broken into and a 
</p>
<p>large number of files, including civilian criminal investigation files, were taken by fighters 
</p>
<p>apparently belonging to Libya Dawn. 
</p>
<p>52. Prior to the recent violence, UNSMIL/OHCHR had advised the authorities on the 
</p>
<p>need to conduct a threat assessment and adopt appropriate security plans for the protection 
</p>
<p>of the courts and the judiciary, with the support of the ministries of the Interior and 
</p>
<p>Defence, due to the limited capacity of the Judicial Police to confront the scale of the 
</p>
<p>security challenge.  
</p>
<p>53. UNSMIL provided technical advice on an ongoing comprehensive judicial reform 
</p>
<p>process to the High Judicial Institute, which trains judges and prosecutors, and the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Judicial Council, which governs and administratively manages the courts and the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>The process includes reform of the organization and functioning of the court system and a 
</p>
<p>review of career development policies of the judiciary. In February 2014, UNSMIL and the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) organized a study tour to Italy for 
</p>
<p>members of the Council to interact with counterparts on judicial reform and security issues. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Legal reform 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Libyan Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure have gaps as well as 
</p>
<p>provisions that are not in line with international human rights standards. In coordination 
</p>
<p>with UNDP, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Ministry of Justice, the </p>


<p>High Judicial Institute, academics and civil society, UNSMIL/OHCHR continued to 
</p>
<p>support the review of the codes, which was initiated in 2013, in order to ensure their 
</p>
<p>compliance with international human rights standards. On 5 February, the General National 
</p>
<p>Congress issued Law No. 5, amending Article 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The 
</p>
<p>new provision punishes with imprisonment any person found to be undermining the 
</p>
<p>17 February Revolution or publicly insulting the legislative, executive or judicial 
</p>
<p>authorities or disgracing the national flag. The Congress also passed Decree No. 5, 
</p>
<p>authorizing relevant ministries to discontinue and prevent the broadcasting of satellite 
</p>
<p>channels that are hostile to the 17 February Revolution or those which &#8220;undermine the 
</p>
<p>security and stability of the country or sow discord and sedition among the Libyans.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>UNSMIL/OHCHR has expressed concern that such broad and vague language could be 
</p>
<p>used to arbitrarily curtail freedom of expression and opinion. For instance, in November 
</p>
<p>2014, on the basis of the new provision, the Tripoli Appellate Court convicted Amara al-
</p>
<p>Khatabi, editor of <i>Al-Umma</i> newspaper, in absentia, to five years&#8217; imprisonment for 
</p>
<p>allegedly defaming public officials. It also barred him from practising journalism and 
</p>
<p>ordered him to pay compensation to five claimants. The sentence followed the publication 
</p>
<p>of a 2012 article, in which he named more than 80 judges and prosecutors accusing them of 
</p>
<p>being involved in corruption.  
</p>
<p><b>2. Law on Counter-terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>55. On 14 September 2014, the House of Representatives passed Law No. 3 of 2014 on 
</p>
<p>Counter-terrorism, defining terrorism as &#8220;any use of force, threat or intimidation for the 
</p>
<p>purpose of inflicting a serious harm to the public order or endangering the integrity of 
</p>
<p>society, its interests and safety, when the use of force results in harming individuals or 
</p>
<p>terrorizing them or endangering their life, public rights and liberties or their safety&#8221;. The 
</p>
<p>definition includes environmental and property offences, attacks on infrastructure, as well 
</p>
<p>as obstructing or hampering public authorities, diplomatic missions and international and 
</p>
<p>regional organizations and bodies in Libya. Most of the offences specified under the law are 
</p>
<p>punishable by life imprisonment or other severe prison terms, although the law also refers 
</p>
<p>to, but does not specify, &#8220;more severe&#8221; penalties.  
</p>
<p>56. The adoption of such an overly broad definition appears to be in violation of the 
</p>
<p>principle of legality and carries the potential for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Transitional justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Law on Transitional Justice 
</b></p>
<p>57. On 2 December 2013, the General National Congress promulgated Law 29 of 2013 
</p>
<p>on Transitional Justice, which repealed a previous law on transitional justice. The new law 
</p>
<p>provided for the establishment of a new Fact-finding and Reconciliation Commission and a 
</p>
<p>framework for reparations, and emphasized the importance of criminal accountability. It 
</p>
<p>further provided for a deadline of 90 days from its promulgation &#8212; subsequently extended 
</p>
<p>by another 30 days &#8212;, whereby those still detained in relation to the 2011 conflict would be 
</p>
<p>either charged or released. At the time of writing there had been little progress in that 
</p>
<p>process. 
</p>
<p>58. UNSMIL/OHCHR provided advice to the authorities on the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>law, as well as extensive comments on the draft law, some of which were incorporated in 
</p>
<p>the final draft. UNSMIL/OHCHR also organized several meetings with civil society groups 
</p>
<p>to facilitate their interaction with the Commission and other transitional justice bodies.  </p>


<p><b>2. Truth seeking 
</b></p>
<p>59. In March 2014, the General National Congress formed a four-person committee to 
</p>
<p>establish a roster of candidates for the Board of the Fact-finding and Reconciliation 
</p>
<p>Commission. On 1 April, the committee issued a public advertisement for candidates. The 
</p>
<p>committee also participated in a national television programme to explain the selection 
</p>
<p>process and how transitional justice principles may be applied in the Libyan context. Due to 
</p>
<p>the political volatility and announcement of elections, the committee did not complete its 
</p>
<p>work and the Board has yet to be appointed. 
</p>
<p>60. UNSMIL/OHCHR advised the Congress on international standards and best practice 
</p>
<p>relating to criteria for and selection of the Board. UNSMIL/OHCHR further informed civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations about the invitation for applications for membership of the Board, and 
</p>
<p>facilitated discussions between civil society organizations and the committee. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Reparations 
</b></p>
<p>61. There was no progress on the establishment of a Victims Compensation Fund, as 
</p>
<p>provided for in the Law on Transitional Justice. However, other bodies established in 2014 
</p>
<p>provide for reparations to victims of serious human rights violations. Law No. 1 of 2014 on 
</p>
<p>the Martyrs and Missing of the 17 February Revolution provides, inter alia, for symbolic 
</p>
<p>and material reparations, such as commemoration efforts, monthly grants and medical care 
</p>
<p>to victims (see para. 71 below for further information). 
</p>
<p>62. In February 2014, the Council of Ministers issued Decree No. 119 of 2014, 
</p>
<p>Addressing the Conditions of Victims of Sexual Violence, which provides for the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a specialized committee to identify victims under the former regime and 
</p>
<p>during the 2011 armed conflict. The committee is to recommend reparations, such as a 
</p>
<p>monthly stipend, health care, a mechanism to grant legal status to children born of rape and 
</p>
<p>legal aid for victims to seek accountability. In March, the Minister of Justice passed a 
</p>
<p>decree to appoint members of the specialized committee and subsequently appointed the 
</p>
<p>Head of the compensation fund. The fund itself is yet to function.  
</p>
<p>63. UNSMIL/OHCHR provided advice to the authorities on best practices in the design 
</p>
<p>and delivery of reparations programmes, and worked with civil society to facilitate their 
</p>
<p>engagement on reparations with officials. It also provided advice on establishing an 
</p>
<p>effective complaint mechanism within the police or the Ministry of Health, as well as 
</p>
<p>drafting legislation which comprehensively addresses the issue. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Criminal justice 
</b></p>
<p>64. On 24 March 2014, the Court of Assize in Tripoli began hearing the trial of Saif al-
</p>
<p>Islam Qadhafi, Abdullah al-Senussi and 35 other members of the former regime, all 
</p>
<p>charged with crimes related to the 2011 conflict.  
</p>
<p>65. UNSMIL/OHCHR has been monitoring the trial, attending many sessions and 
</p>
<p>meeting with the Prosecutor and defence counsel. On one occasion, a staff member seeking 
</p>
<p>to attend a session was temporarily detained and his personal effects were confiscated. The 
</p>
<p>authorities subsequently apologized for the incident. UNSMIL/OHCHR also conducted 
</p>
<p>interviews with all defendants held in detention. The majority are held in Al-Hadhba 
</p>
<p>Correction and Rehabilitation Institution, in Tripoli, where the Court is based. Mr. Qadhafi 
</p>
<p>remained held in Zintan at the time of writing, while the eight defendants who had been 
</p>
<p>held in Misrata were moved to Tripoli in November 2014. Mr. Qadhafi and other 
</p>
<p>defendants held outside of Tripoli were connected by video-link to some sessions of the 
</p>
<p>trial, following the adoption of Law No. 7 of 2014, which amended the Code of Criminal 
</p>
<p>Procedure to permit such a modality to link defendants to a courtroom. The law established 
</p>
<p>that a hearing shall be considered public if broadcast live on television.  </p>


<p>66. A trial session scheduled for August 2014 was postponed due to the fighting in 
</p>
<p>Tripoli, and the trial resumed in October, although Saif al-Islam Qadhafi was not connected 
</p>
<p>by video-link and has not participated in trial sessions since.  
</p>
<p>67. While all the defendants were eventually represented by defence counsel during the 
</p>
<p>trial sessions (either retained by their families or appointed by the court), the defence 
</p>
<p>counsel for Messrs. al-Senussi and Qadhafi have changed several times and Mr. Qadhafi is 
</p>
<p>no longer represented by a lawyer. Defence counsels reported difficulties in having full and 
</p>
<p>timely access to case material and in meeting their clients in private.  
</p>
<p>68. UNSMIL/OHCHR is concerned that the trial risks falling short of basic international 
</p>
<p>standards as reflected in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The 
</p>
<p>prosecution presented its case in June 2014, in less than one hour, without calling any 
</p>
<p>witnesses. At the time of writing, the court was asking defence counsel to present their case 
</p>
<p>and was reportedly trying to curtail the number of witnesses per defendant to two or three. 
</p>
<p>UNSMIL/OHCHR has repeatedly stressed that the trial should take place in compliance 
</p>
<p>with international human rights standards, including in relation to the importance of proper 
</p>
<p>legal representation for all defendants and for unfettered access by defence counsel to case 
</p>
<p>files and their clients in confidence. If the trial continues to proceed in this way, it will not 
</p>
<p>meet international standards. It will also constitute a missed historical opportunity to 
</p>
<p>publicly disclose and scrutinize crimes committed under the former regime. 
</p>
<p><b>5. Proceedings before the International Criminal Court 
</b></p>
<p>69. Following the Security Council&#8217;s referral of the situation in Libya to the Prosecutor 
</p>
<p>of the International Criminal Court in 2011, the Court issued arrest warrants and requested 
</p>
<p>the transfer of Abdullah al-Senussi and Saif al-Islam Qadhafi to The Hague. The Libyan 
</p>
<p>authorities challenged the admissibility of the cases. On 21 May 2014, the Appeals 
</p>
<p>Chamber confirmed that the case of Mr. Qadhafi was admissible before the Court, in part 
</p>
<p>because it found that he was not in State custody. In contrast, in July 2014, the Appeals 
</p>
<p>Chamber decided that Abdullah al-Senussi&#8217;s case was inadmissible before the Court as it 
</p>
<p>was subject to ongoing domestic proceedings and that Libya was willing and able to carry 
</p>
<p>out such investigation; also he was considered to be in State custody. On 10 December, the 
</p>
<p>Pre-Trial Chamber found that Libya had failed to surrender Mr. Qadhafi to the Court, and 
</p>
<p>referred the matter to the United Nations Security Council.  
</p>
<p>70. To date, both Saif al-Islam Qadhafi and Abdullah al-Senussi have been unable to 
</p>
<p>access legal counsel representing them before the International Criminal Court. In her 
</p>
<p>briefing to the Security Council on 12 November 2014, the Prosecutor noted that the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;ongoing violence and alleged threats to judges, prosecutors and lawyers do not augur well 
</p>
<p>for a fair trial&#8221;. She further noted that she would assess options, &#8220;including whether to 
</p>
<p>apply for a review of the judge&#8217;s decision upholding Libya&#8217;s request that the case against  
</p>
<p>Mr. Al-Senussi be tried in Libya&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>71. On 25 July 2014, the Prosecutor issued a statement that she &#8220;[would] not hesitate to 
</p>
<p>investigate and prosecute those who commit crimes under the Court&#8217;s jurisdiction in Libya, 
</p>
<p>irrespective of their official status or affiliation.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>6. Law on Political and Administrative Isolation  
</b></p>
<p>72. The authorities have undertaken limited or no vetting of new members of the armed 
</p>
<p>forces, law enforcement, judiciary or Judicial Police. In contrast, extensive measures 
</p>
<p>targeting those affiliated with the Qadhafi regime have been applied. Law No. 13 of 2013 
</p>
<p>on Political and Administrative Isolation lists a wide range of political, administrative and 
</p>
<p>other positions under the Qadhafi regime, as well as types of affiliation and conduct, as a 
</p>
<p>basis for excluding individuals from public life for 10 years. It contains criteria which are </p>


<p>vague, far-reaching and disproportionate and thus likely to violate the right to public 
</p>
<p>service of those affected. UNSMIL/OHCHR had advised the General National Congress on 
</p>
<p>international standards for vetting State institutions and the risks of exclusionary measures, 
</p>
<p>but that advice was largely not taken into account.  
</p>
<p>73. The Supreme Court considered seven challenges to the constitutionality of the law, 
</p>
<p>presented on both substantive and procedural grounds. The last session was on 26 June 
</p>
<p>2014, whilst members of armed groups protested outside the court. No further sessions have 
</p>
<p>been held since and no decision has been rendered.  
</p>
<p><b>7. Missing persons 
</b></p>
<p>74. More than 2,000 people from all sides of the conflict are reported to have gone 
</p>
<p>missing during the 2011 revolution. At the time of writing, there had been no progress in 
</p>
<p>the implementation of Law No. 1 of 2014 on the Care for Martyrs and Missing Persons of 
</p>
<p>the 17 February Revolution. The law provides for the establishment of a General 
</p>
<p>Commission for Tracing and Identifying Missing Persons and benefits to the families of 
</p>
<p>those killed or missing in the context of the revolution. However, it explicitly excludes 
</p>
<p>from such benefits the families of those who opposed the revolution. The Commission is 
</p>
<p>yet to be set up.  
</p>
<p><b> F. National institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. The General National Congress and the House of Representatives  
</b></p>
<p>75. In contrast to the 2012 legislative elections for the General National Congress, the 
</p>
<p>2014 electoral law in relation to elections for the 200-member House of Representatives 
</p>
<p>excluded the participation of political parties, with 1,714 candidates standing in their 
</p>
<p>personal capacity. A special provision ensured that a minimum of 32 seats would be taken 
</p>
<p>up by women. Approximately 40 per cent of the 1.5 million registered Libyans voted on 
</p>
<p>25 June 2014. UNSMIL/OHCHR provided technical advice to the Congress specifically on 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the Law on Transitional Justice, but the growing political crisis and 
</p>
<p>the escalation in violence precluded the provision of further assistance to the Congress and 
</p>
<p>the beginning of a programme of assistance to the House.  
</p>
<p><b>2. Constitution Drafting Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>76. The elections for the Constitution Drafting Assembly took place on 20 February 
</p>
<p>2014. A special provision held that six of the 60 available seats would be taken up by 
</p>
<p>women; however, due to security complications in a multi-district area in the east of the 
</p>
<p>country, one of the six seats ended up being seated by a man. As a result of the boycott by 
</p>
<p>the Amazigh community and the security situation in Derna, which halted polling there, 
</p>
<p>four seats comprising of two from Derna and two reserved for the Amazigh community 
</p>
<p>remain unfilled. On 21 April, the Assembly held its first session in Al-Baida.  
</p>
<p>77. Amendment 3 of the Constitutional Declaration mandated the Assembly to draft the 
</p>
<p>constitution within 120 days. The Assembly publicly committed to completing a draft 
</p>
<p>Constitution by the end of December 2014. However, at the time of writing, it was expected 
</p>
<p>to take longer. The Constitution is to be adopted by a referendum.  
</p>
<p>78. A committee of the Assembly was established to address human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms in the Constitution. UNSMIL/OHCHR has identified international 
</p>
<p>experts on standby to advise the Assembly on human rights matters, but at the time of 
</p>
<p>writing, the Assembly had not specified the modalities of the assistance it wished to 
</p>
<p>receive.  </p>


<p><b>3. National human rights institution 
</b></p>
<p>79. The National Council for Civil Liberties and Human Rights was established in 
</p>
<p>December 2011 and began functioning in January 2013. UNSMIL/OHCHR deployed a 
</p>
<p>dedicated adviser, in December 2013, to provide sustained technical assistance to the 
</p>
<p>Council for four months. The adviser delivered training activities on relevant international 
</p>
<p>norms and standards, and provided advice on organizational structure and working methods 
</p>
<p>to improve the effectiveness of day-to-day operations. 
</p>
<p>80. In March 2014, UNDP, in partnership with UNSMIL/OHCHR, organized a 
</p>
<p>workshop for civil society organizations working on issues related to human rights, and the 
</p>
<p>Council, UNDP and UNSMIL/OHCHR organized a seminar with civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations and members of the Human Rights Committee of the General National 
</p>
<p>Congress to discuss a national plan of action on human rights. The work stalled following 
</p>
<p>the June 2014 elections for the House of Representatives. 
</p>
<p>81. UNSMIL/OHCHR received reports of threats and intimidation targeting staff 
</p>
<p>members of the Council. In October 2014, a staff member left Tripoli after receiving a 
</p>
<p>threatening phone call from someone claiming to be affiliated with Libya Dawn. That same 
</p>
<p>month, armed men sought to question senior Council representatives who were not in the 
</p>
<p>office at the time. A group of armed men claiming to be associated with Libya Dawn also 
</p>
<p>visited the premises of the Council requesting the handover of keys and official stamps. 
</p>
<p>Council staff refused to comply. Witnesses reported that armed men in military uniform 
</p>
<p>arrived at the Council headquarters on 9 November 2014, locked the doors and publicly 
</p>
<p>proclaimed that the Council was being closed by Libya Dawn, and that anybody attempting 
</p>
<p>to re-open the premises would be arrested. At the time of writing, the Council was not 
</p>
<p>functioning. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The actions taken by all parties involved in the current violence have led to 
numerous grave abuses of human rights and violations of international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>and humanitarian law.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The High Commissioner reiterates his appeal to all parties to the conflict to end 
hostilities and, through an inclusive political dialogue, to put in place a framework to 
</b></p>
<p><b>build a State based on respect for human rights and rule of law. He accordingly 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) All armed groups comply fully with international humanitarian law, 
</b></p>
<p><b>specifically with the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution in attack. 
</b></p>
<p><b>In particular, they must immediately cease all attacks on civilians and must take steps 
</b></p>
<p><b>to protect civilians and fighters hors de combat. All armed groups must also desist 
</b></p>
<p><b>from violations of international human rights law and humanitarian law and abuses 
</b></p>
<p><b>of human rights, and remove from active duty those suspected of such actions; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The Libyan authorities hold accountable, in accordance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards, all parties responsible for violations of international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights and humanitarian law and abuses of human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Whilst the ongoing violence has significantly impacted the rule of law and 
effective running of key institutions, some institutions still operate. There is a need for 
</b></p>
<p><b>further technical assistance to enhance their effectiveness and compliance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights standards. Accordingly, whilst cognizant of the major 
</b></p>
<p><b>security challenges, the High Commissioner recommends that the Libyan authorities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>through capacity-building and technical assistance support:  </b></p>


<p><b>(a) Urgently address the situation of persons deprived of their liberty. Those 
</b></p>
<p><b>detained in connection with the recent conflict, as well as those held since the 2011 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflict, must be released or handed over to the justice system. All detention facilities 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be handed over from armed groups to the effective control of the State. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Authorities must investigate all allegations of torture and other ill-treatment, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>those found responsible must be removed from active duty and brought to justice. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Safeguards against torture and other ill-treatment should also be put in place; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Develop a comprehensive strategy to address the issue of displaced 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons. Those displaced </b>&#8212;<b> including since 2011 </b>&#8212;<b> must be allowed to return to their 
homes in safety and dignity. In the interim, they must be given protection and 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian assistance, in accordance with the Guiding Principles on Internal 
</b></p>
<p><b>Displacement; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Resume building State institutions, in particular the armed forces, law 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforcement and the judiciary, as soon as feasible. Enhance security for prosecutors, 
</b></p>
<p><b>judges and the courts as a priority to strengthen the rule of law. Establish a fair and 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparent vetting and recruitment process for the Judicial Police, and ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>prison officials are provided with adequate resources and training to effectively 
</b></p>
<p><b>manage their facilities, in line with international human rights standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure full support to the Constitution Drafting Assembly and ensure an 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusive and consultative drafting process, leading to a constitution that is fully 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliant with international human rights standards, safeguarding dignity, non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, equality and human rights for all. National legislation should also be 
</b></p>
<p><b>fully reviewed to ensure its compliance with international human rights standards, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and revised accordingly, with priority to the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal 
</b></p>
<p><b>Procedure; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Review and strengthen legal and policy protections which guarantee the 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights of women, minorities, children, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>establish measures to facilitate greater access to justice for those groups; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Bring the transitional justice process back on track, with priority to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>appointment of qualified and independent members of the Board of the Fact-finding 
</b></p>
<p><b>and Reconciliation Commission, taking into account fair gender representation. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Law on Political and Administrative Isolation should be revised to ensure that vetting 
</b></p>
<p><b>criteria are precise, proportionate and fair. The law on missing persons should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>revised to ensure that benefits extend to all victims, regardless of affiliation, and an 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent and impartial commission on missing persons established; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Ensure that all those responsible for human rights violations and abuses 
</b></p>
<p><b>are brought to justice, with all the guarantees of a fair trial and due process, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>the ability to speak freely with counsel in confidence, and adequate facilities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources to conduct their defence. All necessary measures should be taken to ensure a 
</b></p>
<p><b>safe environment, free of intimidation, for any trial; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Cooperate fully with the International Criminal Court by assisting its 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigations and complying with its rulings; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Take all necessary steps to ratify the Optional Protocol to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</b></p>
<p><b>Punishment, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
</b></p>
<p><b>Enforced Disappearance, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and 
</b></p>
<p><b>its 1967 Protocol and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and withdraw reservations to the Convention 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The High Commissioner further urges Member States of the Human Rights 
Council to remain seized of the situation in Libya, and proposes to present an oral 
</b></p>
<p><b>report on the human rights situation in Libya during the twenty-ninth session of the </b></p>


<p><b>Council and a written report during the thirty-first session, in order to keep Member 
</b></p>
<p><b>States actively apprised of the rapidly developing situation.</b>
