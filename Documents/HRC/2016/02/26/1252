<p><b>  Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>26/16.  Human rights and the regulation of civilian acquisition, 
possession and use of firearms 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, other international human rights law 
instruments and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, and Human 
Rights Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 and decision 5/101 of 18 June 2007, and 16/21 of 25 
March 2011, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling in particular</i> that the Human Rights Council has the mandate to, inter alia, 
serve as a forum for dialogue on thematic issues on all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>that States bear the primary responsibility under international law to 
promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to life 
and security of person, and that such responsibility may include, as appropriate, the 
enacting and enforcing of relevant national legislation, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person and is 
entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be fully realized, 
</p>
<p><i>Alarmed</i> that hundreds of thousands of human beings of all ages around the world, 
including women and children, have their human rights, in particular their right to life and 
security of person, negatively affected by the misuse, intentional or unintentional, of 
firearms, and that a significant number of such killings of women have occurred as a result 
of inter-partner violence, 
</p>

<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that effective national regulation of civilian acquisition, possession 
and use of firearms may enhance the protection of the right to life and security of person 
and thus positively contribute to diminishing the number of victims of the misuse of 
firearms, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging also</i> the efforts made by different States at various levels, including 
at the regional and subregional levels, to ensure that the civilian acquisition, possession and 
use of firearms in their respective societies are effectively regulated, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Expresses its deep concern</i> at the fact that hundreds of thousands of human beings of 
all ages around the world, including women and children, have lost their lives or suffered 
injuries and psychological harm by the misuse of firearms by civilians, thus having their 
human rights, in particular their right to life and security of person, negatively affected; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to take appropriate legislative, administrative and other 
measures, consistent with international human rights law and their constitutional 
frameworks, in order to ensure that civilian acquisition, possession and use of firearms are 
effectively regulated with the aim of enhancing the protection of the human rights, in 
particular the right to life and security of person, of all; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Invites</i> all relevant special procedures, commissions of inquiry and human rights 
treaty bodies to bear in mind the present resolution within the framework of their respective 
mandates.
