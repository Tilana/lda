NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
Note 1 – Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Growblox
Sciences, Inc. (the "Company," "We" or "Us") have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulations S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  In
the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered
necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Operating results for the periods presented
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending March 31,
2017. The balance sheet at March 31, 2016 has been derived from the audited financial
statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S.
GAAP for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the consolidated
financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-
K for the year ended March 31, 2016.
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements include all operating divisions and majority owned
subsidiaries, reported as a single operating segment, for which we maintain controlling interests.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Reclassifications
 
Certain reclassifications have been made to the comparative period amounts in order to conform
to the current period presentation.  These reclassifications had no effect on the reported financial
position, results of operations or cash flows of the entity.
 
Significant Accounting Policies
 
A description of the Company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 3 of its Annual
Report on Form 10–K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued amended
accounting guidance that changes the accounting for leases and requires expanded disclosures
about leasing activities. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a right-of-
use asset and a lease liability, measured on a discounted basis, at the commencement date for
all leases with terms greater than twelve months. Lessor accounting will remain largely
unchanged, other than certain targeted improvements intended to align lessor accounting with
the lessee accounting model and with the updated revenue recognition guidance issued in 2014.
Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing
at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial
statements. The amended guidance is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim
periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2018, and early application is
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial
position and results of operations.
6
INDEX
Management does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting
pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.
Note 2 – Going Concern
 
The Company's financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue
as a going concern. The Company has sustained net losses since inception, which have caused
an accumulated deficit of approximately $22.1 million at June 30, 2016. In addition, the Company
has consumed cash in its operating activities of approximately $1 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1.1 million for the same period last year. These factors,
among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern.
Management has been able, thus far, to finance the losses through a public offering, private
placements and obtaining operating funds from stockholders. The Company is continuing to seek
sources of financing.  There are no assurances that the Company will be successful in achieving
its goals.
 
In view of these conditions, the Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to obtain additional financing or capital sources, to meet its financing
requirements, and ultimately to achieve profitable operations. Management believes that its
current and future plans provide an opportunity to continue as a going concern. The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be
necessary in the event the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
 
Note 3 – Convertible Notes
In February 2016, the Company issued a short-term Promissory Note ("Note") with a face value
of $192,500 resulting in aggregate proceeds of $175,000 reflecting a 9.1% original discount and
a nominal rate of 10%. The Note is payable within one year of issuance and is convertible into
962,500 shares of the Company's common stock and 962,500 common stock purchase warrants
at any time and from time to time before maturity at the option of the holder. Each warrant gives
the Noteholder the right to purchase one share of common stock of the Company at an exercise
price of $0.50 per share for a period of three years.  The beneficial conversion feature resulting
from the discounted conversion price compared to the market price was calculated based on the
date of issuance to be $94,037 after adjusting the effective conversion price for the relative fair
value of the note proceeds compared to the fair value of the attached warrants and note. In
addition to this discount related to the beneficial conversion feature, an additional discount of
$66,912 was recorded based on the fair value of the 962,500 warrants attached to the note. This
value was derived using the Black-Scholes valuation model. At June 30, 2016, the Note had a
balance of $0.09 million net of $0.1 million unamortized discount and beneficial conversion
feature.
 
In March 2016, the Company issued a short-term Promissory Note ("Note") with a face value of
$300,000 resulting in aggregate proceeds of $250,000 reflecting a 16.67% original discount and
a nominal rate of 20%. The Note is payable within one year of issuance and is convertible into
1,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock and 1,500,000 common stock to purchase
warrants at any time and from time to time before maturity at the option of the holder. Each
warrant gives the Noteholder the right to purchase one share of common stock of the Company at
an exercise price of $0.50 per share for a period of three years. The beneficial conversion feature
resulting from the discounted conversion price compared to the market price was calculated
based on the date of issuance to be $143,750 after adjusting the effective conversion price for the
relative fair value of the note proceeds compared to the fair value of the attached warrants and
note. In addition to this discount related to the beneficial conversion feature, an additional
discount of $93,750 was recorded based on the fair value of the 1,500,000 warrants attached to
the note. At June 30, 2016, the Note had a balance of $0.1 million net of $0.2 million unamortized
discount and beneficial conversion feature.
 
The Notes and Warrants were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D
under the Securities Act, as amended.
 
Note 4– Note Payable

INDEX
The Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, dated May 12, 2015 and effective as of
June 8, 2015, with Pacific Leaf Ventures, LP ("Pacific Leaf"), pursuant to which Pacific Leaf has
made installment loans (the "Loans") to us in the aggregate amount of $1.75 million. The purpose
of the financing is to provide for the acquisition and installation of an operating facility, equipment
and other tangible assets by GBSN. Such facility and equipment will be dedicated to the
cultivation of cannabis and the extraction of oils and other constituents present in cannabis,
subject at all times to Nevada legal requirements. The note is convertible at the option of the
holder into common shares at a conversion price of $0.50, subject to anti-dilution adjustments.
 
To evidence the Loans, the Company issued to Pacific Leaf a 6% senior secured convertible
promissory note (the "Note"), bearing interest at the rate of 6% per annum, payable quarterly. All
outstanding principal and interest due under the Note were due and payable on May 12, 2020.
We were required to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Note on a quarterly basis in
an amount equal to 50% of the cash flow (accrued EBITDA) of GB Sciences Nevada, LLC
("GBSN") attributable to our percentage interest in GBSN no later than the earlier to occur of (a)
the fifth (5th) business day following receipt of a distribution of the Company's Share of GBSN's
EBITDA for the calendar quarter in question, or (b) thirty (30) days following the end of the
calendar quarter in question, with the first such prepayment to be made not later than July 31,
2015 with respect to the quarter ending June 30, 2015. In order to induce the Pacific Leaf to
extend the loan to the Company and to secure the payment and performance of all of the
Secured Obligations, the Company agreed to grant Secured Party a security interest in certain of
its assets and enter into the lending agreement.
 
On February 8, 2016, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated 6% Senior
Convertible Promissory Note ("Amended Note") with Pacific Leaf Ventures, LP ("Pacific Leaf"). 
The amended agreement modifies the 6% Senior Secure Convertible Promissory Note dated
May 12, 2015 and effective as of June 8, 2015, in the principal amount of $1.75 million.
 
Per the terms of the amended agreement, Pacific Leaf may make up to $1.0 million in additional
advances to the Company under the Amended Note bringing the total in the aggregate to $2.75
million. The note is convertible at the option of the holder into common shares at a conversion
price of $0.25, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The Company has an option to prepay the
Amended Note, without premium or penalty, in whole or in part, with accrued interest to the date
of such prepayment.
 
Until the payment in full of the Amended Note, the Investor or its designee shall have the option
(the "Option") to purchase up to a 20% membership interest in GBSN for a purchase price equal
to $100,000 for each 2% of membership interest purchased (i.e., $1,000,000 if the Option is
exercised in full), provided that the Option may not be exercised for less than a 1% membership
interest in GBSN.
In connection with the Amended Note, the Company also entered into the Amended and
Restated Royalty Agreement with Pacific Leaf dated and effective as of February 8, 2016.  Per
the terms of the Amended Royalty Agreement, the royalty rate at any time shall equal to the sum
of (i) 9.1%, and (ii) the percentage calculated by dividing the amount advanced in excess of
$1.75 million by $1.0 million, multiplied by the gross revenues of GBSN.  On the earlier of (i) the
seventh anniversary of the royalty payment date, or (ii) the date that all amounts outstanding
under the Amended Note have been paid in full, the royalty rate shall be reduced by 50%.
 
On June 13, 2016 the Company received notice from Pacific Leaf Ventures, LP ("Pacific Leaf")
that it had elected to convert $500,000 of the Company's indebtedness to Pacific Leaf Note into
common stock of the Company pursuant to the Amended and Restated 6% Senior Secured
Convertible Promissory.  Accordingly, the Company has issued 2,000,000 shares of its common
stock ($500,000 converted at a price of $0.25 per share) to Pacific Leaf and the Company's
indebtedness to Pacific Leaf pursuant to the Note has been reduced by $500,000. As of June 30,
2016, the total amount of installments received, net of conversion, is $2.02 million.

Administrative Services, LLC, Strategic Turnaround Equity Partners, L.P. (Cayman), Seth M.
Lukash, and Gary Herman, 14 Civ. 02280 (ER) (the "Action"). After the change of name of
Signature Exploration and Production Corporation, the caption was amended to substitute
GrowBlox Sciences, Inc. as the plaintiff. The complaint in the Action sought a declaratory
judgment that neither Lukash nor Herman was entitled to receive any interest in, including any
shares of stock of, Growblox pursuant to certain share conversion rights held under promissory
notes in the aggregate amount of $75,000, given by a related party of ours to the entity
defendants GCM and Strategic.

INDEX
On May 9, 2014, defendants filed an answer denying the complaint's material allegations, and
asserted a counterclaim against us, against persons identified as certain of our officers or
directors, and against GrowOpp, LLC and Tumbleweed Holdings, Inc. On November 19, 2014,
defendants filed an amended counterclaim, including a prayer for monetary relief or damages in
the sum of $9 million. We moved to dismiss the counterclaim and by opinion dated June 2, 2015,
the Court granted the motion in part and dismissed counts one and two (for declaratory judgment
as to an alleged partnership or joint venture, and for breach of fiduciary duty predicated upon
those allegations), and denied the motion in part, leaving counts three and four of the
counterclaim standing. The Court viewed the third and fourth claims as a single claim for unjust
enrichment, in which recovery would be based on quantum meruit, that is, upon the alleged value
of any benefit conferred by defendants to us through alleged work and services rendered. In view
of the fact that the pleading did not assign a particular value to that claim we are unable at
present to advise what specific sum of money damages is sought. We did not challenge the fifth
count of the counterclaim at this stage that seeks damages of $75,000 for alleged non-payment of
the above-referenced promissory notes.
 
The Company and its adversaries entered an agreement in principle, subject to the execution of
formal documents and dated as of June 20, 3016, to settle and dismiss the action. The
Company's board approved the settlement on July 6, 2016. The parties are in the process of
executing a formal, written settlement agreement. Under the settlement, the Company will deliver
1,400,000 shares of its common stock to its adversaries. Craig Ellins, formerly CEO of the
Company and now its chief scientific officer, will deliver 3,000,000 shares that he owns
personally. Based on our estimate of potential outcomes, we have accrued $0.5 million with
respect to this matter as of June 30, 2016.
 
Cathryn Kennedy Complaint Settlement
 
On August 19, 2015, Cathryn Kennedy, our former Chief Financial Officer, filed a Complaint
against us in the District Court in Clark County, Nevada alleging that she was assigned new
duties by us which constituted a termination without cause effective July 24, 2015, and that as a
consequence thereof she is entitled to severance, vacation pay and stock compensation from us
pursuant to her Employment Agreement dated November 18, 2014.  On April 8, 2016, the
Company entered into a mutual agreement with Cathryn Kennedy per terms of which the
Company issued 200,000 of its unrestricted common shares in exchange for a full dismissal with
prejudice of all causes of action pending in the above-referenced Complaint.
 
From time to time, the Company also becomes involved in certain legal proceedings and claims
which arise in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, based on consultations with
outside counsel, the results of any of these ordinary course matters, individually and in the
aggregate, are not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial
condition, or cash flows. As more information becomes available, if management should
determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable on such a claim and that the amount of such
probable loss that it will incur on that claim is reasonably estimable, we will record a reserve for
the claim in question. If and when we record such a reserve is recorded, it could be material and
could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
 
Note 8 – Loss per Share
 
The Company's basic loss per share has been calculated using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. The Company had 31,359,167 and 27,558,334 of
potentially dilutive common shares at June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. 
However, such common stock equivalents were not included in the computation of diluted net
loss per share as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
 
Note 9 – Subsequent Events
 
GB Sciences Nevada LLC
 
On July 21, 2016, an entity associated with Pacific Leaf Partners, LLC completed the purchase of
the building housing the Company's cultivation facility at 3550 W. Teco Ave., Las Vegas, NV. In
connection with the purchase, the Company entered into an amended lease agreement per the
terms of which the initial term of the lease covering the facility was extended to ten years, with an
optional five-year extension.
 
On August 4, 2016, the Company entered into the Second Omnibus Amendment ("Amendment")
of its existing agreements with Pacific Leaf Ventures, LP ("Pacific Leaf").  Principally, the
Amendment eliminates Pacific Leaf's option to purchase up to a 20% membership interest in GB
Sciences Nevada LLC ("GBSN") and reduces Pacific Leaf's existing royalty rate to 16.4%. It also
caps maximum aggregate royalty payments to be made to Pacific Leaf at $2,420,000 with respect
to any calendar year. In consideration of the amended terms, Pacific Leaf will receive 1,000,000
shares of the Company's common stock and a five-year warrant to purchase 1,500,000 shares of
the Company's common stock at $0.36 per share.
 
Growblox Sciences, Inc.  v. GCM Administrative Services, LLC Settlement
On August 9, 2016, the Company finalized a settlement agreement in final disposition of the
lawsuit filed by the Company on April 2, 2014, in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York.  The Company's obligation under the agreement is to issue 1,400,000
shares of restricted common stock to certain non-affiliates of the Company.
Executive Appointments
On August 5, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors accepted the resignation of John Poss as
Chief Financial Officer of the Company and appointed Ksenia Griswold as the Company's Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Poss will continue to serve as the President, Chief
Executive Officer, and Chief Operating Officer of the Company. Ms. Griswold has been serving as
the controller of the Company since November, 2015.  For the five years prior to that time
beginning in October, 2010, she worked in the Las Vegas, Nevada office of Ernst & Young, LLP. 
At the time of her departure from Ernst & Young, she was audit manager.  It is expected that an
amendment to Ms. Griswold's employment agreement and compensation will be negotiated
during the upcoming fiscal quarter.

and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The Company does not undertake any obligation to update
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this
report.
 
The following discussion highlights the Company's results of operations and the principal factors
that have affected our financial condition, as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the
periods described, and provides information that management believes is relevant for an
assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations
presented herein. The following discussion and analysis is based on the Company's unaudited
financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report, which we have prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles. You should read this discussion
and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.
 
Overview
 
The Company seeks to be an innovative technology and solution company that converts the
cannabis plant into medicines, therapies and treatments for a variety of ailments. The Company
is developing and utilizing state of the art technologies in plant biology, cultivation and extraction
techniques, combined with biotechnology, and plans to produce consistent and measurable
medical-grade cannabis, cannabis concentrates and cannabinoid therapies.
 
Although we believe that maximum shareholder value will ultimately be achieved through the
development, production and marketing of certified cannabinoid medicines, therapies and
treatments, in order to generate cash flow and near term profitability, we intend to cultivate and
dispense cannabis for medical purposes in both Nevada and other states which permit such
sales and in which we and our operating partners are able to obtain cultivation and dispensing
licenses.
 
We seek to become a trusted producer of consistent and efficacious medicinal strains and
products, combining both cannabinoids and terpenes, which we intend to market in those states
within the United States and in other countries where the sale of medical cannabis products are
permitted. In addition, subject to obtaining Food and Drug Administrative (FDA) certification, we
intend to market our cannabinoid based drug discoveries on a world-wide basis.
 
11
INDEX
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 4, 2001, under the name "Flagstick
Venture, Inc." On March 28, 2008, stockholders owning a majority of our outstanding common
stock approved changing our then name "Signature Exploration and Production Corp." as our
business model had changed.
On March 13, 2014, we entered into a definitive assets purchase agreement for the acquisition of
assets, including the Growblox(TM) cultivation technology which resulted in a change in our
corporate name on April 4, 2014, from Signature Exploration and Production Corporation to
Growblox Sciences, Inc.
Plan of Operation
 
The Company will cultivate cannabis using innovative, but conventional methods in its wholly
owned subsidiary, GB Sciences Nevada, LLC ("GBSN").  GBSN is in the final states of opening
Phase 1 of an approximately 28,000 sq. ft. facility in Las Vegas, Nevada.  When all phases of
construction are completed, the facility is expected to produce 6,800 pounds of marijuana per
year and generate revenues of $16.9 million, based on a projected wholesale price of $2,500 per
pound.  Completion of all Phases of this facility is dependent upon the availability of capital to
complete construction. The Company has made completion of all Phases of this facility its
number one priority. In that connection, we have received every approval from licensing and
occupancy permit that we have sought to date, and we expect to have our first crop growing in
our state-of-the-art pharmaceutical grade cultivation rooms by October 1, 2016. Our first harvest
will be approximately 10 weeks later.
We expect our products to compete well in the marketplace because of the considerable efforts
we have made in the plant genetics and tissue culturing of our proprietary strains of cannabis. 
And, we are the exclusive Nevada grower of Kyle Kushman's proprietary marijuana strains which
have been highly rated top sellers in California. Furthermore our ownership interest in the
Showgrow dispensary on Fort Apache Boulevard in Las Vegas guarantees retail distribution of
our products from that facility.  Our products will have enough exposure to ensure that consumers
can appreciate its quality and superiority compared to other brands.
The current emphasis on near-term cash flow allows us to plan for exploiting the potential of our
science assets.  We recently formed Growblox Life Sciences, LLC and have retained Fenwick &
West, a Silicon Valley based law firm focusing on life sciences and high technology companies
with a nationally top-ranked intellectual property practice, to development strategies for the
protection of the Company's intellectual property.
Our proprietary Growblox chambers, anticipated to be commercially ready during the second
quarter of fiscal 2017 will enable us to grow a 100% consistent and cost-effective pharmaceutical
grade cannabis which is important irrespective of its ultimate consumers; a consistent
recreational brand will be as important to consumers as a consistent medicine will be to its
patients. Ultimately, our science will enable us to identify and develop proprietary strains, which
will provide us with raw materials for our soon to be patented medical compounds.

INDEX
Revenues
 
The Company has not achieved any operating revenues to date.
General and administrative expenses
 
General and administrative expenses decreased $0.3 million to $1.2 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The
decrease in primarily attributable to $0.2 million decrease in consulting and advisory services
related to development of our proprietary GrowBLOX Suites combined with a $0.1 million
decrease in legal expenses.
 
Other expense
 
Total other expense increased by $0.2 million compared to the same period in prior year. The
increase in primarily due to the recognition of $0.03 million in accrued interest related to the
Pacific Leaf Loan and $0.13 million amortization of the debt discount related to the beneficial
conversion features discount recorded on the convertible debt.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
Current Liquidity
 
The Company will need additional capital to implement our strategies. There is no assurance
that it will be able to raise the amount of capital needed for future growth plans. Even if financing
is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable. If unable to raise the necessary capital at
the times required, the Company may have to materially change the business plan, including
delaying implementation of aspects of the business plan or curtailing or abandoning the business
plan. The Company represents a speculative investment and investors may lose all of their
investment. In order to be able to achieve the strategic goals, the Company needs to further
expand its business and financing activities. Based upon the cash position, it is necessary to
raise additional capital by the end of the next quarter in order to continue to fund current
operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going
concern.  The Company is pursuing several alternatives to address this situation, including the
raising of additional funding through equity or debt financings. In order to finance existing
operations and pay current liabilities over the next twelve months, the Company will need to raise
approximately $4-5 million of capital depending upon license status. No assurance can be given
that the Company will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis, or at all, in the future.
 
The principal sources of liquidity to date have been cash generated from sales of debt and equity
securities and loans.
 
At June 30, 2016, cash was $0.18 million, other current assets excluding cash were $0.16 million
and our working capital deficit was $1.9 million. At the same time, current liabilities were
approximately $2.2 million, which consisted principally of $0.8 million in accrued liabilities, $0.8
million in accounts payable, and $0.5 million in notes payable. At March 31, 2016, the Company
had cash balance $0.03 million, other current assets excluding cash were $0.2 million and our
working capital deficit was $2.1 million. Current liabilities were approximately $2.3 million, which
consisted principally of $0.9 million in accounts payable, $0.8 million in accrued liabilities, and
$0.5 million in notes payable. An improvement in our liquidity position at June 30, 2016
compared to March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to the capital raised through private
offerings.
Sources and Uses of Cash
 
Operating Activities
 
Net cash used in operating activities was $1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016,
as compared to net cash used of $1.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. We
anticipate that cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund business operations for the
next twelve-month period. Accordingly, we will have to generate additional liquidity or cash flow
to fund our current and anticipated operations. This will likely require the sale of additional
common stock or other securities. There is no assurance that we will be able to realize any
significant proceeds from such sales, if at all.
13
INDEX
Investing Activities
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company used $0.9 million and
$0.2 million, respectively, of cash in investing activities. The cash used in investing activities
during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was primarily for the purchase of
property and equipment.
 
Financing Activities
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, cash flows from financing activities
totaled $2 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Cash flows from financing activities for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 related primarily to $1.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of
common stock and warrants, $0.6 million in other financing activities consisting primarily of
deferred stock compensation, and $0.07 million in proceeds from non-controlling interests. Cash
flows from financing activities for the three months ended June 30, 2015 related primarily to $1.3
million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants, $0.3 million in proceeds
from non-controlling interests, and $0.1 million in proceeds from notes payable.
 
GOING CONCERN
 
The unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which
assumes that the Company will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal
course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses since inception
resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately $22.1 million as of June 30, 2016, and further
losses are anticipated in the development of the business raising substantial doubt about the
ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to
meet obligations and repay liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing
cash on hand and/or private placements of debt and equity securities. The financials do not
include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and reclassification of recorded asset
amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.
VARIABLES AND TRENDS
 
In the event the Company is able to obtain the necessary financing to progress with its business
plan, the Company expects expenses to increase significantly to grow the business. Accordingly,
the comparison of the financial data for the periods presented may not be a meaningful indicator
of future performance and must be considered in light of these circumstances.
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
A description of the Company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 3 of its Annual
Report on Form 10–K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.
 
ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
 
As a "smaller reporting company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not
required to provide information required by this Item.
 
ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
The Company  maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
material information required to be disclosed in the periodic reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or 1934 Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and to ensure that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. At the end of the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the
principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) and Rule 15d-
15(e) under the 1934 Act. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that as of June 30,
2016 the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses as
no member of our board of directors qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined
in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act.
 
14
INDEX
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
 
Management, including the Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief
Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), does not expect that disclosure controls and
procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple
error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some
persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The
design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
 
Changes in Internal Controls
 
During the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016, there have been no changes in the internal
controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
affect the internal controls over financial reporting.

Board of Directors Expansion and Management Changes
Effective April 29, 2016 the Company's Board of Directors was expanded to five members. As a
result of the expansion, the Board of Directors elected Leslie Bocskor, Shane Terry and John
Poss to serve as Members of the Board of Directors for a term of three years to fill the three
existing vacancies.
The Board of Directors also accepted the resignation of Craig Ellins as Chief Executive Officer of
the Company and immediately appointed Craig Ellins to serve as Chief Innovation Officer of the
Company.
The Board of Directors elected John Poss to serve as Chief Executive Officer until such time as
the Board of Directors can identify and hire a suitable replacement. Mr. Poss has been serving as
the CFO of the Company since August, 2015 and its COO since December 31, 2015.  He will
continue serving as CFO and COO until suitable replacements can be recruited.
On June 1, 2016, the Board of Directors established compensation for outside directors to be
$25,000 annually with an additional $1,000 for each meeting attended.  The compensation is
payable in cash or stock at the election of the Company.  The outside directors also each
received options to purchase 450,000 shares of stock which vest over 24 months.  The strike
price of the options is $0.16 per share, the market value of the Company's common stock on the
date the outside directors were elected to the Board.
Amendments to the Executive Employment Agreements
