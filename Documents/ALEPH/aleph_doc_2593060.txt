GOLDEN MINERALS COMPANY
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Expressed in United States dollars)
(Unaudited)
1.     Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements and Nature of Operations
Golden Minerals Company (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, has prepared these unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Such rules and regulations allow the omission of certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), so long as such omissions do not render the
financial statements misleading.  The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial
statements, but does not include all disclosures normally required by GAAP.
In the opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all adjustments that are necessary for a fair
presentation of the financial results for the periods presented. These interim financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the annual financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and filed with the SEC on February 25, 2016.
The Company is a mining company, holding a 100% interest in the Velardeña and Chicago precious metals
mining properties and associated oxide and sulfide processing plants in Mexico (the “Velardeña
Properties”).  During November 2015 the Company suspended mining and sulfide processing activities at its
Velardeña Properties in order to conserve the asset until the Company is able to develop mining and processing
plans that at then current prices for silver and gold indicate a sustainable positive operating margin (defined as
revenues less costs of sales) or the Company is able to locate, acquire and develop alternative mineral sources
that could be economically mined and transported to the Velardeña Properties for processing.  The Company
has placed the mine and sulfide processing plant on care and maintenance to enable a re-start of either the
mine or mill when mining and processing plans and metals prices support a cash positive outlook.  The
Company incurred approximately $1.2 million in related costs for employee severance, net working capital
obligations, and other shutdown expenditures to place the property on care and maintenance in the fourth
quarter 2015 and $1.1 million in shutdown and care and maintenance costs for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and expects to incur approximately $0.3 million in quarterly holding costs while mining and processing
remain suspended.  The Company has retained a core group of employees, most of whom have been assigned
to operate the oxide plant, which is leased to a third party and not affected by the shutdown.  The oxide plant
began processing material for the third party in mid-December 2015, and the Company expects to receive net
cash flow under the lease of approximately $4.5 million in 2016.  The retained employees also include an
exploration group and an operations and administrative group to continue to advance the Company’s plans in
Mexico, oversee corporate compliance activities, and to maintain and safeguard the longer term value of the
Velardeña assets.
The Company remains focused on evaluating and searching for mining opportunities in North America
(including Mexico) with near term prospects of mining, and particularly for properties within reasonable haulage
distances of our Velardeña Properties. The Company is also reviewing strategic opportunities, focusing
primarily on development or operating properties in North America, including Mexico. The Company is
continuing its exploration efforts on selected properties in its portfolio of approximately 10 exploration properties
located primarily in Mexico. It continues to hold its El Quevar advanced exploration property in Argentina on care
and maintenance until it can find a partner to further advance the project.
The Company is considered an exploration stage company under the criteria set forth by the SEC as the
Company has not yet demonstrated the existence of proven or probable mineral reserves, as defined by SEC
Industry Guide 7, at the Velardeña Properties, or any of the Company’s other properties.  As a result, and in
accordance with GAAP for exploration stage companies, all expenditures for exploration and evaluation of the
Company’s properties are expensed as incurred. As such the Company’s financial statements may not be
comparable to the financial statements of mining companies that do have proven and probable mineral
reserves.  Such companies would typically capitalize certain development costs including infrastructure
development and mining activities to access the ore. The capitalized costs would be amortized on a units-of-
production basis as reserves are mined.  The amortized costs are typically allocated to inventory and eventually
to cost of sales as the inventories are sold.  As the Company does not have proven and probable reserves,
substantially all expenditures at the Company’s Velardeña Properties for mine construction activity, as well as
costs associated with the
7
Table of Contents
mill facilities, and for items that do not have a readily identifiable market value apart from the mineralized
material, have been expensed as incurred. Such costs are charged to cost of metals sold or project expense
during the period depending on the nature of the costs. Certain of the costs may be reflected in inventories prior
to the sale of the product. The term “mineralized material” as used herein, although permissible under SEC
Industry Guide 7, does not indicate “reserves” by SEC standards. The Company cannot be certain that any
deposits at the Velardeña Properties or any other exploration property will ever be confirmed or converted into
SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant “reserves”.
2.     Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern
At June 30, 2016 the Company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.9 million, $0.2 million lower
than the $4.1 million in similar assets held at December 31, 2015. The reduction is due primarily to $1.1  million
in shutdown and care and maintenance costs at the Velardeña Properties, $1.9 million in exploration
expenditures, including costs related to drilling at the San Luis del Cordero, Santa Maria, and Rodeo properties,
$0.4 million in care and maintenance and property holding costs at the El Quevar project, $2.2 million in general
and administrative expenses, $0.5 million from an increase in working capital primarily related to a decrease in
deferred revenue from the lease of the oxide plant, offset in part by $0.2 million of net proceeds from the sale of
nonstrategic exploration properties, $2.1 million of net operating margin received pursuant to the lease (defined
as oxide plant lease revenue less oxide plant lease costs) and $3.6 million of net proceeds received in a
registered direct offering of the Company’s common stock as discussed below.
On February 11, 2016, The Sentient Group (“Sentient”) converted approximately $3.9 million of principal and
$0.1 million of accrued interest (representing the total amount of accrued interest at the conversion date)
pursuant to the Sentient Note (defined below) into 23,355,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. See
Note 11 for a full discussion of the Sentient Note. On June 10, 2016 Sentient converted the remaining
approximately $1.1 million and approximately $34,000 of accrued interest under the Sentient Note into
4,011,740 shares of the Company’s common stock.  At June 30, 2016 the Company had no outstanding debt.
On May 6, 2016, the Company issued 8.0 million registered shares of common stock at a purchase price of
$0.50 per share in a registered direct offering (the “Offering”) resulting in gross proceeds of $4.0 million. The
Company incurred costs and fees of approximately $0.4 million related to the Offering resulting in net proceeds
of approximately $3.6 million.  In connection with the Offering, for each share of common stock purchased by an
investor, such investor received an unregistered warrant to purchase three‐quarters of a share of common stock.
The warrants have an exercise price of $0.75 per share and are exercisable six months after the date of
issuance and will expire five years from the initial exercise date (see Note 15).
The Company currently expects that it will have sufficient cash to continue its business plan into 2017 without
external funding.  In addition to its $3.9 million cash balance at June 30, 2016, the Company expects to receive
approximately $2.4 million in net operating margin from the lease of the oxide plant in the remaining two quarters
of 2016 and has received $0.6 million from the sale of non-strategic exploration properties in the third quarter.
The Company currently plans to spend approximately $3.9 million in the remaining two quarters of 2016, as
detailed below, resulting in a projected cash balance at the end of 2016 of approximately $3.0 million.
·Approximately $0.7 million at the Velardeña Properties for care and maintenance;
·Approximately $1.1 million on exploration activities and property holding costs related to the Company’s
portfolio of exploration properties located primarily in Mexico, including project assessment and development
costs relating to Santa Maria, Rodeo, and other properties;
·Approximately $0.3 million at the El Quevar project to fund ongoing maintenance activities, property holding
costs, and continuing  project evaluation costs;
·Approximately $1.4 million on general and administrative costs; and
·Approximately $0.4 million on an increase in working capital primarily related to a reduction in current liabilities
involving the payment of equity taxes in a foreign jurisdiction.

Table of Contents
The actual amount that the Company spends during the remainder of 2016 and the projected yearend cash
balance may vary significantly from the amounts specified above and will depend on a number of factors,
including variations from anticipated care and maintenance costs at the Velardeña Properties and costs for
continued exploration, project assessment, and development at the Company’s other exploration properties,
including Santa Maria and Rodeo.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under which an entity is
considered to be able to realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business.  However,
the continuing operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability to secure sufficient funding and to
generate future profitable operations.  The underlying value and recoverability of the amounts shown as
property, plant and equipment in Note 8 are dependent on the ability of the Company to generate positive cash
flows from operations and to continue to fund exploration and development activities that would lead to profitable
mining activities or to generate proceeds from the disposition of property, plant and equipment.  There can be no
assurance that the Company will be successful in generating future profitable operations or securing additional
funding in the future on terms acceptable to the Company or at all.
3.     New Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update
(“ASU”) 2016-09, “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”), which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment award transactions including accounting for income taxes and classification of excess tax benefits on
the statement of cash flows, forfeitures and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.  For the Company,
ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any interim or annual period. The adoption of this update is
not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal
versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)” (“ASU 2016-08”), which clarifies principal
versus agent when another party, along with the entity, is involved in providing a good or service to a customer.
Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requires an entity to determine whether the nature of its
promise is to provide that good or service to the customer (i.e., the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the good
or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (i.e., the entity is an agent). For the Company, ASU
2016-08 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. The adoption of this update is not expected to
have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities” (“ASU 2016-01”), which amended its standards related to the accounting of certain financial
instruments. This amendment addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and
disclosure. The new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2017. Early adoption is not permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have
on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements - Going
Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern” (“ASU 2014-15”).  ASU 2014-15 will require management to evaluate whether there are conditions
and events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year after the financial statements are issued on both an interim and annual basis. Management will be required
to provide certain footnote disclosures if it concludes that substantial doubt exists or when its plans alleviate
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 becomes effective
for annual periods beginning in 2016 and for interim reporting periods starting in the first quarter of 2017. The
Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

4.     Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to
be cash equivalents. Short-term investments include investments with maturities greater than three months, but
not exceeding 12 months, or highly liquid investments with maturities greater than 12 months that the Company
intends to liquidate during the next 12 months for working capital needs.
The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in equity securities at the time of
acquisition and re-evaluates those classifications at each balance sheet date.  Available for sale investments
are marked to market at each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income (loss). If declines in fair value are deemed other than temporary, a charge is made to net
income (loss) for the period.
The following tables summarize the Company’s short-term investments at June 30, 2016 and December 31,

The available for sale common stock consists of 5,000,000 shares of a junior mining company received during
the first quarter 2015 in a transaction involving the Company’s 50% interest in the San Diego exploration
property in Mexico.  The Company received shares in the junior mining company that holds the other 50%
interest in the property in exchange for extending by two years from March 24, 2015 the period of time in which
the junior mining company can earn an additional 10% interest in the property by completing an additional $0.8
million of exploration work.  Following the receipt of the shares the Company owns approximately 9% of the
outstanding shares of the junior mining company.  The extension agreement was executed on March 23, 2015
and the value of shares on that date was recorded by the Company as a short-term investment using quoted
market prices.  See Note 13 for further discussion on the fair value measurement techniques used by the
Company to value the above investments.

The Company had no metals or in process inventories at June 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015 as the result of
the suspension of mining and processing at the Velardeña Properties (see Note 1). The material and supplies
inventory at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is reduced by a $0.2 million and $0.3 million obsolescence
charge respectively.
7.     Value Added Tax Receivable, Net
Mexico law allows for certain VAT payments to be recovered through ongoing applications for refunds. The
Company expects that the current amounts will be recovered within a one year period.  At June 30, 2016 the
Company has also recorded approximately $49,000 of VAT receivable as a reduction to VAT taxes payable in
Mexico, which appears in Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
The Company has also paid VAT in Mexico as well as other countries, primarily related to exploration projects,
which has been charged to expense as incurred because of the uncertainty of recoverability.

suppliers in the amounts of $0.4 million and $0.3 million related to the Company’s Velardeña Properties and
corporate administrative activities, respectively.  In the case of the Velardeña Properties, amounts due also
include a net VAT payable of approximately $50,000.
Accrued employee compensation and benefits at June 30, 2016 consist of $0.2 million of accrued vacation
payable and $0.7 million related to withholding taxes and benefits payable, of which $0.3 million is related to
activities at the Velardeña Properties.
December 31, 2015
Accounts payable and accruals at December 31, 2015 consist primarily of $0.3 million due to contractors and
suppliers and $0.3 million related to the Company’s Velardeña Properties and corporate administrative
activities, respectively.  In the case of the Velardeña Properties, amounts due also include a VAT payable that is
not an offset to the VAT receivable.
Accrued employee compensation and benefits at December 31, 2015 consist of $0.1 million of accrued vacation
payable and $0.4 million related to withholding taxes and benefits payable, of which $0.2 million is related to
activities at the Velardeña Properties.
10.     Asset Retirement Obligation and Reclamation Liabilities
The Company retained the services of a mining engineering firm to prepare a detailed closure plan for the
Velardeña Properties. The plan was completed during the second quarter 2012 and indicated that the Company
had an ARO and offsetting ARC of approximately $1.9 million. The estimated $3.5 million ARO and ARC that
was recorded at the time of the acquisition of the Velardeña Properties was adjusted accordingly.
The Company will continue to accrue additional estimated ARO amounts based on an asset retirement plan as
activities requiring future reclamation and remediation occur.  During the first six months of 2016 the Company
recognized approximately $0.1 million of accretion expense and approximately $20,000 of amortization expense
related to the ARC.
The following table summarizes activity in the Velardeña Properties ARO:

The ARO set forth on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 includes approximately $0.1 million of reclamation liabilities related to activities at the El
Quevar project in Argentina.
11.     Convertible Note Payable – Related Party, Net
On October 27, 2015, the Company borrowed $5.0 million from Sentient, pursuant to the terms of a Senior
Secured Convertible Note (“the Sentient Note”) and a related loan agreement (the "Sentient Loan"), with
principal and accrued interest due on October 27, 2016. To comply with security regulations and stock exchange
rules in the United States and Canada, the Company received stockholder approval on January 19, 2016 to
allow the Sentient Note principal and accrued interest to be converted, solely at Sentient's option, into shares of
the Company's common stock at a price equal to the lowest of: 1) $0.29, 90 percent of the 15-day volume
weighted average price ("VWAP") for the period immediately preceding the Loan closing date, 2) 90 percent of
the 15-day VWAP for the period immediately preceding the loan conversion date, or 3) an anti-dilution adjusted
price based on the lowest price for which the Company has sold its stock following the loan closing date. The
loan bears interest at a rate of 9.0% per annum, compounded monthly.
The beneficial conversion feature of the Sentient Note represents an embedded derivative as defined by ASC
815 "Derivatives and Hedging" ("ASC 815"). ASC 815 provides that a derivative instrument's fair value must be
bifurcated from the note and separately recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The
Company used a third party consultant to value the embedded derivative in the Sentient Note employing a
Monte Carlo type probability analysis, which falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see Note 13). For
purposes of valuing the embedded derivative as of the Sentient Loan closing date, at December 31, 2015, at
February 11, 2016 (first partial conversion date), and at June 10, 2016 (the remaining conversion date), the
valuation model takes into account, among other items: 1) the probability of successfully achieving stockholder
approval of the Sentient Note’s conversion feature, 2) future variations in the Company’s stock price, and 3) the
probability of entering into an equity transaction prior to the Sentient Loan maturity date that would lower the
conversion price.  It was determined that the embedded derivative had a fair value of approximately $1.1 million
at October 27, 2015, the date the Company entered into the Sentient Loan.  Subsequent mark-to-market
changes in the value of the derivative are recorded as income or loss in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Loss.  The Sentient Note was recorded net of the bifurcated embedded
derivative at October 27, 2015 with the $1.1 million difference between the face value and the recorded value of
the note representing a loan discount that is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the loan using
the interest rate method.
The Company also incurred approximately $0.3 million in legal and other costs associated with the Sentient
Loan. Per the guidance of ASU 2015-03 "Interest—Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" (“ASU 2015-03”), the loan costs are presented as a reduction to the note
payable on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be amortized to interest expense over the
life of the Sentient Note using the interest rate method.
Because the Sentient Loan has been recorded net of the bifurcated embedded derivative and loan costs, both of
which will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the loan, the effective rate of interest on the recorded
loan obligation is higher than the stated nominal rate of interest. The effective interest rate on the Sentient Note
is approximately 36%, compounded monthly, compared to the stated nominal rate of 9% per annum,
compounded monthly.
On February 11, 2016, Sentient converted approximately $3.9 million of principal and $0.1 million of accrued
interest (representing the total amount of accrued interest at the conversion date) on the Sentient Note into
23,355,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of approximately $0.172 per share,
equal to 90% of the 15-day VWAP immediately preceding the conversion date. On June 10, 2016, Sentient
converted the remaining approximately $1.1 million of principal and approximately $34,000 of accrued interest
(representing the total amount of accrued interest at the conversion date) pursuant to the Sentient Note into
4,011,740 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of approximately $0.289 per share, equal
to 90% of the 15‐day VWAP immediately preceding the loan’s original issue date.
The Company adjusted the recorded value of the Sentient Loan as of the conversion dates to reflect the
amortization of the loan discount and loan costs, shown as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Loss. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company has recorded a
total noncash loss on debt extinguishment of $1.7 million reflecting the difference between the value of the
shares issued to Sentient as a result of
13
Table of Contents
the two separate conversions and the recorded value of the Sentient Loan, including related loan costs, loan
discount and embedded derivative eliminated at the conversion dates. The Company marked-to-market the
embedded derivative at each of the conversion dates and at the end of the first quarter ended March 31, 2016
and recorded a total derivative loss of $0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
At June 30, 2016 the Sentient Note had been fully converted and the Company had no outstanding debt.
12.     Other Liabilities
The Company recorded other current liabilities of approximately $0.2 million and $0.6 million at June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 amounts include a net
liability of approximately $0.2 million and $0.4 million respectively related to the Argentina tax on equity due for
years 2009 through 2012 stemming from a tax audit of those years.  For June 30, 2016 the total $0.2 million
amount payable consists of estimated interest and penalties.  The Company is awaiting the final assessment of
interest and penalties, estimated not to exceed the $0.2 million accrual, payable immediately upon final
assessment. The final assessment is expected during the third quarter 2016.  The December 31, 2015 amount
also includes $0.1 million of accrued interest on the Sentient Loan and $0.1 million as a loss contingency on a
disputed contract with a third party contractor in Mexico.  The dispute was settled during the first quarter 2016 for
the amount previously accrued.
13.     Fair Value Measurements
Financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value under a
framework of a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs into valuation techniques used to measure fair
value into three broad levels.  This hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.  Further, financial assets and liabilities should be
classified by level in their entirety based upon the lowest level of input that was significant to the fair value
measurement.  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy per ASC 820 are as follows:
Level 1:  Unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible
at the measurement date.
Level 2:  Quoted prices in inactive markets for identical assets or liabilities, quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets, or other observable inputs either directly related to the asset or liability or derived
principally from corroborated observable market data.
Level 3:  Unobservable inputs due to the fact that there is little or no market activity. This entails using
assumptions in models which estimate what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The Company’s cash equivalents, comprised principally of U.S. treasury securities, are classified within Level 1
of the fair value hierarchy.
The Company’s trade accounts receivable are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, are related to
the sale of metals at our Velardeña Properties and the oxide plant lease and are valued at published metals
prices per the terms of the refining and smelting agreements and lease rates per the plant lease agreement.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a liability for warrants to acquire the
Company’s stock as a result of anti-dilution clauses in the warrant agreements that could result in a resetting of
the warrant exercise price in the event the Company were to issue additional shares of its common stock in a
future transaction at a price lower than the current exercise price of the warrants (see Note 15). The Company
assesses the fair value of its warrant liability at the end of each reporting period, with changes in the value
recorded as a separate line item on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Loss. The valuation policies are approved by the Chief Financial Officer who reviews and
approves the inputs used in the fair value calculations and the changes in fair value measurements from period
to period for reasonableness. Fair value measurements are discussed with the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer, as deemed appropriate.  The warrant liability has been recorded at fair value as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 based primarily on a valuation performed by a third party expert using a Monte Carlo
simulation, which falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  The valuation model takes into account the
probability that the Company could issue additional shares in a future transaction at a lower price than the
current exercise price of the warrants.
The beneficial conversion feature of the Sentient Note represents an embedded derivative as defined by ASC
815 (see Note 11). ASC 815 provides that a derivative instrument’s fair value must be bifurcated from the host
contract and separately recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  At December 31, 2015,
March 31 2016, and at each of the conversion dates (see Note 11) the Company had recorded a derivative
liability related to the beneficial conversion feature of the Sentient Note.  On June 10, 2016, the remaining
Sentient Note and related embedded derivative had been fully retired.  The Company assesses the fair value of
the derivative liability at the end of each reporting period, with changes in the value recorded as a separate line
item on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The
valuation policies are approved by the Chief Financial Officer who reviews and approves
15
Table of Contents
the inputs used in the fair value calculations and the changes in fair value measurements from period to period
for reasonableness. Fair value measurements are discussed with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, as
deemed appropriate. The derivative liability was recorded at fair value at December 31, 2015, March 31, 2016,
and each of the conversion dates based primarily on a valuation performed by a third party expert using a Monte
Carlo simulation, which falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The valuation model takes into account,
among other items: 1) the probability of successfully achieving stockholder approval of the loan’s conversion
feature, 2) future variations in the Company’s stock price, and 3) the probability of entering into an equity
transaction prior to the Loan maturity date that would lower the conversion price.
In addition to the warrant exercise prices (see Note 15) and Sentient Note conversion price (see Note 11) other
significant inputs to the warrant valuation model and derivative valuation model included the following as
applicable:

An increase or decrease in the Company’s stock price, in isolation, would result in a relatively lower or higher
fair value measurement respectively.  A decrease in the probability of the issuance of additional common stock
at a lower price than the current warrant exercise price would result in a lower value for the warrants.  The table
below highlights the change in fair value of the warrant and derivative liabilities.

Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements
There were no non-recurring fair value measurements at June 30, 2016.
14.     Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC
740”), on a tax jurisdictional basis.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company recognized an
income tax benefit of $26,000 related to the partial removal of a valuation allowance on net operating losses
resulting from an unrealized gain on held for sale investments reported in other comprehensive income in the
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss and treated as a source of
taxable income.  The Company operates in jurisdictions that have generated ordinary losses on a year-to-date
basis. However, the Company is unable to recognize a benefit for those losses, except as described in this
paragraph, thus an estimated effective tax rate has not been used to report the year-to-date results.
In accordance with ASC 740, the Company presents deferred tax assets net of its deferred tax liabilities on a tax
jurisdictional basis on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of June 30, 2016 and as of December
31, 2015, the Company had no net deferred tax assets or net deferred tax liabilities reported on its balance
sheet.
The Company, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the United States and in various
foreign jurisdictions.  The tax rules and regulations in these countries are highly complex and subject to
interpretation. The Company’s income tax returns are subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities
and in connection with such examinations, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation
or application of certain tax rules within the country involved.  In accordance with ASC 740, the Company
identifies and evaluates uncertain tax positions, and
16
Table of Contents
recognizes the impact of uncertain tax positions for which there is less than a more-likely-than-not probability of
the position being upheld upon review by the relevant taxing authority.  Such positions are deemed to be
“unrecognized tax benefits” which require additional disclosure and recognition of a liability within the financial
statements.  The Company had no unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.
15.     Equity
Offering and Private Placement
On May 6, 2016, the Company issued 8.0 million registered shares of common stock at a purchase price of
$0.50 per share in a registered direct offering (the “Offering”) resulting in gross proceeds of $4.0 million. The
Company incurred costs and fees of approximately $0.4 million related to the Offering, resulting in net proceeds
of approximately $3.6 million.  In connection with the Offering, for each share of common stock purchased by an
investor, such investor received an unregistered warrant to purchase three‐quarters of a share of common stock.
The 6,000,000 warrants have an exercise price of $0.75 per share and are exercisable six months after the date
of issuance and will expire five years from the initial exercise date.
The net proceeds of the Offering were recorded in equity and appear as a separate line item in the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity.  Using the Black Scholes model, the fair value of the warrants
issued was $3.6 million, considering the closing stock price on April 29, 2016 (the first business day preceding
May 2, 2016, the date the Company entered into a definitive agreement to issue the shares), the exercise price
and exercise period of the warrants, the Company’s volatility rate of 105%, and the applicable risk free rate of
0.74%.
Sentient Note conversion
On February 11, 2016, Sentient converted approximately $3.9 million of principal and $0.1 million of accrued
interest (representing the total amount of accrued interest at the conversion date) pursuant to the Sentient Note
into 23,355,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of approximately $0.172 per share,
reflecting 90% of the 15-day VWAP immediately preceding the conversion date. On June 10, 2016, Sentient
converted the remaining approximately $1.1 million of principal and approximately $34,000 of accrued interest
(representing the total amount of accrued interest at the conversion date) pursuant to the Sentient Note into
4,011,740 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of approximately $0.289 per share, equal
to 90% of the 15‐day VWAP immediately preceding the loan’s original issue date (see Note 11).  At June 30,
2016 the Sentient Note had been fully converted and the Company had no further debt outstanding. After
conversion, Sentient holds approximately 47% of the Company’s 88.9 million shares of issued and outstanding
common stock.
Equity Incentive Plans
In May 2014, the Company’s stockholders approved amendments to the Company’s 2009 Equity Incentive Plan,
adopting the Amended and Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Plan”) pursuant to which awards of
the Company’s common stock may be made to officers, directors, employees, consultants and agents of the
Company and its subsidiaries.  The Company recognizes stock-based compensation costs using a graded
vesting attribution method whereby costs are recognized over the requisite service period for each separately
vesting portion of the award.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company recognized approximately $3,000 of compensation
expense related to the restricted stock grants.  The Company expects to recognize additional compensation
expense related to these awards of approximately $3,000 over the next six months.
In addition to the restricted stock grants in the table above on May 19, 2016, the Company granted a consultant
50,000 shares of fully vested stock. The Company recognized stock compensation expense of $21,000 related
to the grant.

Also, pursuant to the Equity Plan, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the Non-Employee Director’s
Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”).  Pursuant to the Deferred
Compensation Plan the non-employee directors receive a portion of their compensation in the form of Restricted
Stock Units (“RSUs”) issued under the Equity Plan. The RSUs vest on the first anniversary of the grant and each
vested RSU entitles the director to receive one unrestricted share of common stock upon the termination of the
director’s board service.

Included in the RSUs granted during the period are 250,000 RSUs granted to the Chairman of the Board that
vested immediately.  The restrictions lifted during the period relate to a director who retired during the period.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company recognized approximately $0.2 million of compensation
expense related to the RSU grants.  The Company expects to recognize additional compensation expense
related to the RSU grants of approximately $0.1 million over the next 11 months.
Key Employee Long-Term Incentive Plan
In December 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company approved and the Company adopted the 2013 Key
Employee Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “KELTIP”), which became effective immediately. The KELTIP provides
for
18
Table of Contents
the grant of units (“KELTIP Units”) to certain officers and key employees of the Company, which units will, once
vested, entitle such officers and employees to receive an amount, in cash or in Company common stock issued
pursuant to the Company’s Amended and Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, measured generally by the price
of the Company’s common stock on the settlement date. KELTIP Units are not an actual equity interest in the
Company and are solely unfunded and unsecured obligations of the Company that are not transferable and do
not provide the holder with any stockholder rights. Payment of the settlement amount of vested KELTIP Units is
deferred generally until the earlier of a change of control of the Company or the date the grantee ceases to serve
as an officer or employee of the Company.  The KELTIP Units are recorded as a liability. On May 19, 2016 the
Company awarded 585,000 KELTIP Units to two officers of the Company and recorded approximately $0.3
million of compensation expense, included in stock based compensation in the Condensed Consolidated
Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. At June 30, 2016 the KELTIP Units were marked-to-market
and the Company recognized approximately $0.1 million of additional compensation expense. At June 30, 2016
the 585,000 KELTIP Units were outstanding. At December 31, 2015 there were no KELTIP Units outstanding.

The warrants relate to prior and current registered offerings and private placements of the Company’s stock.  In
September 2012, the Company closed on a registered offering and concurrent private placement with Sentient
in which it sold units, consisting of one share of common stock and a five-year warrant to acquire one half of a
share of common stock at an exercise price of $8.42 per share. A total of 3,431,649 warrant shares were issued
and became exercisable on March 20, 2013 and will expire on September 19, 2017, five years from the date of
issuance.
In September 2014 the Company closed on a registered public offering and concurrent private placement with
Sentient in which it sold units, consisting of one share of common stock and a five-year warrant to acquire one
half of a share of common stock at an exercise price of $1.21 per share.  A total of 4,746,000 warrant shares
were issued that became exercisable on March 11, 2015 and will expire on September 10, 2019, five years from
the date of issuance.
On May 6, 2016 the Company closed on the Offering (discussed above) under which the investors received an
unregistered warrant to purchase three‐quarters of a share of common stock for each share of common stock
purchased. The resulting 6,000,000 warrants have an exercise price of $0.75 per share and are exercisable six
months after the date of issuance and will expire on November 6, 2021, five years from the initial exercise date.
The warrants issued in September 2012 and September 2014 are being recorded as a liability on the balance
sheet as a result of anti-dilution clauses in the warrant agreements that could result in a resetting of the warrant
exercise price in the event the Company were to issue additional shares of its common stock in a future
transaction at an offering price lower than the current exercise price of the warrants. The May 2, 2016 warrant
agreement did not contain an anti-dilution clause and the warrants were recorded as equity.
Pursuant to the anti-dilution clauses in the September 2012 and 2014 warrant agreements, the exercise price of
the warrants has been adjusted downward as a result of the subsequent issuance of the Company’s common
stock in separate transactions, including the September 2014 registered public offering and private placement,
the conversion of the Sentient Note, and the recent Offering (discussed above).  As a result of these
transactions, the number of shares of common stock
19
Table of Contents
issuable upon exercise of the September 2012 Warrants was increased from the original 3,431,649 shares to
6,120,573 shares (2,688,924 share increase) and the exercise price was reduced from the original $8.42 per
share to $4.72 per share. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the September 2014
Warrants was increased from the original 4,746,000 shares to 5,458,377 shares (712,377 share increase) and
the exercise price was reduced from the original $1.21 per share to $0.87 per share.
At June 30, 2016 the total liability recorded for the 2012 and 2014 warrants was $2.5 million, consisting of $2.2
million for the 2014 warrants and $0.3 million for the 2012 warrants.  The warrant liability has been recorded at
fair value as of June 30, 2016 based primarily on a valuation performed by a third party expert using a Monte
Carlo simulation, which falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see Note 13).
16.     Revenue and Related Costs
Oxide Plant Lease and Oxide Plant Lease Costs
For the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company recorded revenue of approximately $3.0 million and
related costs of approximately $0.9 million associated with the lease of the Velardeña Properties oxide plant.
The Company recognizes oxide plant lease fees and reimbursements for labor, utility and other costs as
"Revenue from oxide plant lease" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss
following the guidance of ASC 605 regarding "income statement characterization of reimbursements received
for "out-of-pocket" expenses incurred" and "reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent". ASC
605 supports recording as gross revenue fees received for the reimbursement of expenses in situations where
the recipient is the primary obligor and has certain discretion in the incurrence of the reimbursable expense. The
actual costs incurred for reimbursed direct labor and utility costs are reported as "Oxide plant lease costs" in the
statement of operations. The Company recognizes lease fees during the period the fees are earned per the
terms of the lease.
In addition, the Company had received an advance lease payment of $0.5 million during 2015 that was applied
to the lease amounts due during the first four months of 2016. At December 31, 2015 the advance payment
balance was recorded as deferred revenue in the amount of $0.5 million on the accompanying Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For the six months ended June 30, 2015 the Company had no plant lease revenue or plant lease costs.
Sale of Metals and Cost of Metals Sold
For the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company had no sale of metals or cost of metals sold as a result of
the suspension of mining and processing at the Velardeña Properties in November 2015.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015 the Company sold marketable lead and zinc concentrates from its
Velardeña Properties to a single customer.  Under the terms of the Company’s agreement with its concentrates
customer, title passed when a provisional payment was made, which occurred generally after the product was
shipped and customary sales documents were completed.  Costs related to the sale of metals products include
direct and indirect costs incurred to mine, process and market the products.  At June 30, 2015 the Company had
written down its metals and in-process inventories to net realizable value including a charge to the cost of metals
sold of approximately $0.2 million.
17.     Interest and Other Income
For the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company had only a nominal amount of interest and other
income.  For the six months ended June 30, 2015 the Company reported interest and other income of $1.4
million related primarily to the reduction of a loss contingency liability related to foreign withholding taxes that
the government could assert are owed by the Company, acting as withholding agent, on certain interest
payments made to a third party.
18.     Derivative Loss
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company recorded approximately $2.3 million of warrant
derivative loss related to an increase in the fair value of the liability recorded for warrants to acquire the
Company’s common stock (see Note 15).  During the six months ended June 30, 2015 the Company recorded
approximately $0.9 million of warrant derivative income related to a decrease in the fair value of the liability
recorded for the warrants. The warrant liability has
20
Table of Contents
been recorded at fair value as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 based primarily on a valuation performed by a third
party expert using a Monte Carlo simulation, which falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see Note
13).  The valuation model takes into account the probability that the Company could issue additional shares in a
future transaction at a lower price than the current exercise price of the warrants.  Significant inputs to the
valuation model included prices for the warrants disclosed above, the probability of an additional issuance of the
Company’s common stock at a lower price than the current warrant exercise price and the inputs in the table
below for the respective periods.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company recorded approximately $0.8 million of derivative loss
related to an increase in the fair value of the derivative liability related to the Sentient Loan (see Note 11). The
derivative liability was recorded at fair value at June 10, 2016, the date of the conversion of the remaining note
(see Note 11), based primarily on a valuation performed by a third party expert using a Monte Carlo simulation,
which falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see Note 13).  Significant inputs to the valuation model
included: 1) the probability of successfully achieving stockholder approval of the loan’s conversion feature, 2)
future variations in the Company’s stock price, and 3) the probability of entering into an equity transaction prior to
the loan maturity date that would lower the conversion price.

current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, for estimated interest and penalties related to the
Argentina tax on equity (see Note 12).  The Company recorded a loss contingency of approximately $0.3 million
at December 31, 2015 for
21
Table of Contents
estimated interest and penalties related to the Argentina tax on equity and a disputed contract with a third party
contractor in Mexico (see Note 12).
21.     Segment Information
The Company’s sole activity is the mining, construction and exploration of mineral properties containing
precious metals. The Company’s reportable segments are based upon the Company’s revenue producing
activities and cash consuming activities. The Company reports two segments, one for its Velardeña Properties
in Mexico and the other comprised of non-revenue producing activities including exploration, construction and
general and administrative activities. Intercompany revenue and expense amounts have been eliminated within
each segment in order to report on the basis that management uses internally for evaluating segment
performance.

22.     Subsequent Event
On August 2, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its remaining 50% interest in the
San Diego property in Mexico to Golden Tag Resources, Ltd., the company that holds the other 50% interest in
the property.  As a result of the sale, the Company received approximately $379,000 in cash and 2,500,000
shares of Golden Tag.  Pursuant to the agreement, Golden Tag will be required to pay the Company a 2.0% net
smelter return royalty in respect to the San Diego property.  The Company had previously written down the value
of the San Diego property to approximately zero and accordingly will recognize a gain of approximately $0.5
million on the sale in the third quarter 2016.  Following receipt of the new shares, and including the 5,000,000
shares of Golden Tag previously acquired, the Company now holds 7,500,000 shares representing
approximately 10% of the outstanding shares of Golden Tag.
On August 5, 2016, the Company, through its wholly owned Mexican subsidiary, entered into an earn-in
agreement with a 100% owned Mexican subsidiary of Electrum Global Holdings, L.P., a privately owned
company (together “Electrum”), related to the Company’s Celaya exploration property in Mexico. The Company
received an upfront payment of $200,000 and Electrum has agreed to incur exploration expenditures totaling at
least $0.5 million within the first year of the agreement, reduced by certain costs Electrum previously incurred on
the property since December 2015 in its ongoing surface exploration program.  Electrum, at its option, can elect
to acquire an undivided 60% interest in a joint venture company to be formed to hold the Celaya project after
incurring exploration expenditures totaling $2.5 million during the first three years of the agreement. Following
the initial three year earn-in period the joint venture Company would be formed to hold all project assets and a
management committee would be formed with one representative of the Company and two representatives of
Electrum. Electrum would serve as manager of the project. The Company would have the right to maintain its
40% interest in the Celaya project by funding its share of additional exploration or development expenditures. If
the Company were to elect not to contribute to additional exploration or development
22
Table of Contents
expenditures after the initial earn-in period, Electrum, at its option, would have the right to earn an additional
20% interest in the Celaya project, for a total interest of 80%, by incurring an additional $2.5 million of
exploration or development expenditures over a second three year period. Following the second earn-in period
the Company would have the right to maintain its 20% interest in the Celaya project by funding its share of
additional exploration or development expenditures or its interest can ultimately be converted into a 10% net
profits interest. The Company has previously expensed all of its costs associated with the Celaya property and
accordingly will recognize a gain of $0.2 million from the farm-out of the property in the third quarter 2016.
Item 2.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Our Company
We were incorporated in Delaware under the Delaware General Corporation Law in March 2009, and are the
successor to Apex Silver Mines Limited for purposes of reporting under the Exchange Act. During the six months
ended June 30, 2016, our only principal source of revenue was from the lease of our oxide plant. We incurred
net operating losses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
The Company remains focused on evaluating and searching for mining opportunities in North America
(including Mexico) with near term prospects of mining, and particularly for properties within reasonable haulage
distances of our Velardeña Properties.  The Company is also reviewing strategic opportunities, focusing
primarily on development or operating properties in North America, including Mexico.
This discussion should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 25,
2016.
2016 Highlights
Offering and Private Placement
On May 6, 2016, we issued 8.0 million registered shares of common stock at a purchase price of $0.50 per share
in a registered direct offering (the “Offering”) resulting in gross proceeds of $4.0 million. We incurred costs and
fees of approximately $0.4 million related to the Offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately $3.6
million.  In connection with the Offering, for each share of common stock purchased by an investor, such investor
received an unregistered warrant to purchase three‐quarters of a share of common stock. The warrants have an
exercise price of $0.75 per share and are exercisable six months after the date of issuance and will expire five
years from the initial exercise date.
Care and maintenance activities at the Velardeña Properties
Due to continuing net operating losses, we suspended mining and sulfide processing activities at the Velardeña
Properties during the first half of November 2015 in order to conserve the future value of the asset. We have
placed the mine and sulfide processing plant on care and maintenance to enable a re-start of either the mine or
the mill when mining and processing plans and metals prices support a cash positive outlook for the
property.  We incurred approximately $1.1 million of costs during the six months ended June 30, 2016 on
remaining shutdown expenditures and for care and maintenance activities and we expect to incur approximately
$0.3 million in quarterly holding costs going forward while mining and processing remain suspended.
Velardeña Oxide Plant Lease Agreement
In July 2015 a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hecla Mining Company leased our Velardeña oxide plant for an
initial term of 18 months beginning July 1, 2015. Hecla may extend the initial 18 month term for six additional
months at its option.  We have agreed to permit Hecla at its option to extend the lease for an additional 18
months following the initial six month extension until December 31, 2018 in exchange for constructing, at its own
cost, an expansion of the tailings impoundment. It is not known at this time if Hecla will exercise its options to
extend the lease. Hecla is responsible for ongoing operation and maintenance of the oxide plant.  During the six
months ended June 30, 2016, Hecla processed approximately 62,000 tonnes of material through the oxide plant,
resulting in revenues to us of approximately $1.4 million plus fixed fees and net reimbursable costs totaling
approximately $1.6 million. Now that Hecla has reached its intended
23
Table of Contents
processing throughput of approximately 400 tonnes per day, net cash payments to us, net of reimbursable costs,
should total approximately $400,000 per month, including variable and fixed fees, or nearly $5.0 million
annually. The Company expects to receive net cash flow under the lease of approximately $4.5 million in 2016.
Completion of Sentient Loan Conversion
On June 10, 2016, Sentient converted the remaining approximately $1.1 million of principal and approximately
$34,000 of accrued interest (representing the total amount of accrued interest at the conversion date) pursuant to
the $5.0 million Sentient Note into 4,011,740 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of approximately
$0.289 per share, equal to 90% of the 15‐day VWAP immediately preceding the loan’s original issue date. In
February 2016 Sentient had converted $3.9 million of principal and $0.1million of accrued interest into
23,355,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of approximately $0.172 per share, reflecting 90%
of the 15-day volume weighted average price (VWAP) immediately preceding the conversion date. After the
conversions, the Sentient Note is no longer outstanding and Sentient holds approximately 47 % of our 88.9
million shares of issued and outstanding common stock.
Santa Maria
We continued exploration work during the second quarter 2016 at the Santa Maria property west of Hildalgo de
Parral, Chihuahua, which we have the right to acquire under an option agreement.  We mined approximately
1,500 tonnes of material as a bulk sample.  In total, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 we mined
approximately 4,500 tonnes of material with grades of approximately 235 grams per tonne (gpt) silver and 0.7
gpt gold.  We processed the bulk sample through a toll milling facility, generating approximately 100 tonnes of
concentrates containing approximately 22,000 ounces of silver and 44 ounces of gold.  The concentrates were
sold to a third party for approximately $300,000 during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 consisting of
approximately 21,000 payable ounces of silver and 40 payable ounces of gold, which offset exploration costs.
We have recently completed an underground drilling program of 2,200 meters in 24 drill holes.  Assay results
are partially complete and we expect to evaluate the results and update the resource estimate and, if justified,
complete a preliminary economic assessment during the third quarter 2016.
San Luis del Cordero
We commenced a $0.6 million exploration drilling program in the first quarter 2016 at the Santa Rosa vein in the
San Luis del Cordero project in Durango State, Mexico.  The 20 hole, 4,600 meter drilling program was
completed in June 2016, and we received drill results from that program in July.  Based on our evaluation of
those July results, we concluded that further work on this project is not likely to meet our near-term objectives
and we plan to terminate the farm-in arrangement for the property in August 2016.
El Quevar
We continue to hold our El Quevar property on care and maintenance until we can find a partner to fund further
exploration.
Other Exploration
In June 2016 we began a 2,000 meter core drilling program at the Rodeo property, approximately 80 kilometers
west of the Velardeña Properties in Durango Mexico at a cost of $300,000 to $400,000. If our exploration efforts
are successful, material from this property could be trucked to the Velardeña oxide plant for processing after the
Hecla lease has terminated. We acquired the Rodeo property in 2015.
Financial Results of Operations
For the results of continuing operations discussed below, we compare the results from operations for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016 to the results from operations for the three and six months ended June 30,
2015.

Revenue from oxide plant lease. In July 2015 a third party leased our inactive Velardeña oxide plant. We
recorded revenue of $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 related to the lease. The oxide plant
was not leased during the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Oxide plant lease costs. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 we recorded $0.5 million of costs related
to the oxide plant lease consisting primarily of reimbursable labor and utility costs which for accounting
purposes were also included in revenue from the oxide plant lease. The oxide plant was not leased during the
three months ended June 30, 2015.
Revenue from the sale of metals.  We recorded no revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016 due to the
suspension of mining and processing at our Velardeña Properties in Mexico beginning November 2015.  We
recorded $2.0 million in revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2015, all from the sale of lead, zinc and
pyrite concentrates from our Velardeña Properties in Mexico.
Costs of metals sold.  We recorded no cost of metals sold during the three months ended June 30, 2015 due to
the suspension of mining and processing at our Velardeña Properties in Mexico beginning November 2015.  For
the three months ended June 30, 2015 we recorded $2.8 million of costs of metals sold, including a $0.1 million
write down of finished goods inventory to its estimated net realizable value.
Exploration expense. Our exploration expense, including drilling at the San Luis del Cordero, Santa Maria, and
Rodeo properties, property holding costs and allocated administrative expenses totaled $1.2 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Exploration expense for both years was incurred primarily in Mexico.  The decrease in exploration expenses in
2016 is primarily related to lower costs incurred for drilling programs in Mexico.
Velardeña project expense.  We recorded no Velardeña project expenses for the three months ended June 30,
2016 or June 30, 2015.  We recorded only a nominal amount for capital expenditures at our Velardeña
Properties for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and recorded no amounts in the 2016 period.
Velardeña shutdown and care and maintenance costs.  We recorded $0.5 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 for expenses related to shut down and care and maintenance at our Velardeña Properties as the
result of the suspension of mining and processing activities in November 2015.  No amounts were recorded for
the three months ended June 30, 2015.
El Quevar project expense. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 we incurred $0.2 million
and $0.4 million of expenses, respectively, primarily related to holding costs for the Yaxtché deposit at our El
Quevar project in Argentina. The decrease in expense for the 2016 period is primarily related to an accrual for
Argentina equity tax recorded during the 2015 period resulting from an audit of certain prior years.  For both
years, costs incurred for work performed outside of the Yaxtché deposit in Argentina are included in “Exploration
Expense”, discussed above.
Administrative expense.    Administrative expenses totaled $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Administrative expenses, including
costs associated with being a public company, are incurred primarily by our corporate activities in support of the
Velardeña Properties, El Quevar project and our exploration portfolio. The $0.9 million of administrative
expenses we incurred during the second quarter 2016 are comprised of $0.4 million of employee compensation
and directors’ fees, $0.3 million of professional fees and $0.3 million of insurance, rents, travel expenses, utilities
and other office costs. The $1.0 million of administrative expenses we incurred during the second quarter 2015
is comprised of $0.6 million of employee compensation and directors’ fees, $0.1 million of professional fees and
$0.3 million of insurance, rents, travel expenses, utilities and other office costs.
Stock based compensation. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 we incurred approximately $0.5
million related to stock based compensation compared to approximately $0.1 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015. Stock based compensation varies from period to period depending on the number and timing of
shares granted, the type of grant, the market value of the shares on the date of grant and other variables. The
2016 stock based compensation
25
Table of Contents
amount includes $0.4 million related to KELTIP grants made to two officers (see Note 15 to the consolidated
financial statements filed as part of this 10-Q for a discussion of KELTIP grants).
Reclamation and accretion expense. During each of the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 we
incurred a nominal amount of reclamation expense related to the accretion of an asset retirement obligation at
the Velardeña Properties and in 2015 reclamation activities at the El Quevar project in Argentina.
Other operating income, net. We recorded $0.2 million of other operating income for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to $0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The net amount for both
periods consists primarily of net gains recorded on the sales of certain fixed assets and non-strategic exploration
properties.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 we incurred
depreciation, depletion and amortization expense of $0.4 million compared to $1.2 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2016 is primarily the result of
the suspension of mining and processing at the Velardeña Properties as noted above.
Interest and other income. We recorded only a nominal amount of interest and other income for the three months
ended June 30, 2016.  During the three months ended June 30, 2015 we recorded approximately $0.5 million of
interest and other income primarily related to the reduction of a loss contingency liability related to foreign
withholding taxes that the government could assert are owed by the Company, acting as withholding agent, on
certain interest payments made to a third party.
Warrant derivative (loss) gain. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 we recorded a loss of
approximately $1.1 million related to an increase in the fair value of the liability recorded for warrants to acquire
the Company’s stock. During the three months ended June 30, 2015 we recorded a gain of approximately $0.2
million related to a decrease in the fair value of the liability recorded for warrants to acquire the Company’s
common stock. (See Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this Form 10-Q).
Derivative loss. For the three months ended June 30, 2016 we recorded a $0.1 million loss related to the fair
value adjustment to the beneficial conversion feature of the Sentient Note, which constitutes an imbedded
derivative (see Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this Form 10-Q). The $0.1 million
loss was recorded prior to the remaining conversion of the note on June 10, 2016.  For the three months ended
June 30, 2015 we had no derivative gain or loss.
Loss on foreign currency. We recorded nominal foreign currency losses for the three months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015. Foreign currency gains and losses are primarily related to the effect of currency fluctuations on
monetary assets net of liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than
US dollars.
Income taxes. We recorded a minimal income tax benefit for the three months ended June 30, 2016 related to
mark-to-market held for sale investment gains recorded as other comprehensive income.  We recorded no
income tax expense or benefit for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016
Revenue from oxide plant lease. In July 2015 a third party leased our inactive Velardeña oxide plant. We
recorded revenue of $3.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 related to the lease. The oxide plant
was not leased during the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Oxide plant lease costs. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 we recorded $0.9 million of costs related to
the oxide plant lease consisting primarily of reimbursable labor and utility costs which for accounting purposes
were also included in revenue from the oxide plant lease. The oxide plant was not leased during the six months
ended June 30, 2015.
Revenue from the sale of metals.  We recorded no revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to the
suspension of mining and processing at our Velardeña Properties beginning November 2015.  We recorded
$4.3 million in revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2015, all from the sale of lead, zinc and pyrite
concentrates from our Velardeña Properties in Mexico.

Table of Contents
Costs of metals sold.  We recorded no cost of metals sold during the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to the
suspension of mining and processing at our Velardeña Properties in Mexico beginning November 2015.  For the
six months ended June 30, 2015 we recorded $5.8 million of costs of metals sold including a $0.2 million write
down of finished goods inventory to its estimated net realizable value.
Exploration Expense. Our exploration expense, including drilling at the San Luis del Cordero, Santa Maria, and
Rodeo properties, property holding costs and allocated administrative expenses, totaled $1.9 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Exploration
expense for both years was incurred primarily in Mexico.  The decrease in exploration expenses in 2016 is
primarily related to lower costs incurred for drilling programs in Mexico.
Velardeña project expense. We did not record any Velardeña project expense during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 as the result of the suspension of mining and processing at the Velardeña Properties in
November 2015. We recorded $0.1 million of Velardeña project expense for the six months ended June 30,
2015 primarily related to the preparation of an updated estimate of mineralized material for the Velardeña
Properties. We did not record any amounts for capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2016 at
our Velardeña Properties. Only a nominal amount of capital expenditures were recorded for the six months
ended June 30, 2015.
Velardeña shutdown and care and maintenance costs.  We recorded $1.1 million for the six months ended June
30, 2016 for expenses related to shut down and care and maintenance at our Velardeña Properties as the result
of the suspension of mining and processing activities in November 2015.  No amounts were recorded for the six
months ended June 30, 2015.
El Quevar project expense. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 we incurred $0.4 million and
$0.8 million of expenses, respectively, primarily related to holding costs for the Yaxtché deposit at our El Quevar
project in Argentina. The decrease in expense for the 2016 period is primarily related to an accrual for Argentina
equity tax recorded in 2015 resulting from an audit of certain prior years. For both years, costs incurred for work
performed outside of the Yaxtché deposit in Argentina are included in “Exploration Expense”, discussed above.
Administrative expense.    Administrative expenses totaled $2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Administrative expenses, including costs
associated with being a public company, are incurred primarily by our corporate activities in support of the
Velardeña Properties, El Quevar project and our exploration portfolio. The $2.1 million of administrative
expenses we incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016 is comprised of $0.7 million of employee
compensation and directors’ fees, $0.8 million of professional fees and $0.7 million of insurance, rents, travel
expenses, utilities and other office costs. The $2.3 million of administrative expenses we incurred during the first
quarter 2015 is comprised of $1.1 million of employee compensation and directors’ fees, $0.5 million of
professional fees and $0.7 million of insurance, rents, travel expenses, utilities and other office costs.
Stock based compensation. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 we incurred $0.6 million of expense
related to stock based compensation compared to $0.3 million for six months ended June 30, 2015. Stock based
compensation varies from period to period depending on the number and timing of shares granted, the type of
grant, the market value of the shares on the date of grant and other variables. The 2016 stock based
compensation amount includes $0.4 million related to KELTIP grants made to two officers (see Note 15 to the
consolidated financial statements filed as part of this 10-Q for a discussion of KELTIP grants)
Reclamation and accretion expense. During each of the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 we incurred
approximately $0.1 million of reclamation expense related to the accretion of an asset retirement obligation at
the Velardeña Properties and in 2015 reclamation activities at the El Quevar project in Argentina.
Other operating income, net. We recorded $0.2 million of other operating income for the six months ended June
30, 2016 compared to $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  The net amount for both years
consists primarily of net gains recorded on the sales of certain fixed assets and non-strategic exploration
properties.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 we incurred depreciation,
depletion and amortization expense of $1.0 million compared to $2.5 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015. The
27
Table of Contents
decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2016 is primarily the result of the suspension of
operations at the Velardeña Properties as noted above.
Interest and other income. We recorded only a nominal amount of interest and other income for the six months
ended June 30, 2016.  During the six months ended June 30, 2015 we recorded approximately $1.4 million of
interest and other income primarily related to the reduction of a loss contingency liability related to foreign
withholding taxes that the government could assert are owed by the Company, acting as withholding agent, on
certain interest payments made to a third party.
Warrant derivative (loss) gain. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 we recorded a loss of approximately
$2.3 million related to an increase in the fair value of the liability recorded for warrants to acquire the Company’s
stock. During the six months ended June 30, 2015 we recorded a gain of approximately $0.9 million related to a
decrease in the fair value of the liability recorded for warrants to acquire the Company’s stock. (See Note 13 of
our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this Form 10-Q).
Derivative loss. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 we recorded a $0.8 million loss related to the fair value
adjustment to the beneficial conversion feature of the Sentient Note which constitutes an imbedded derivative
(see Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this Form 10-Q). The $0.8 million loss was
recorded prior to the remaining conversion of the Note on June 10, 2016. For the six months ended June 30,
2015 we had no derivative gain or loss.
Loss on foreign currency. We recorded nominal foreign currency losses for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015. Foreign currency gains and losses are primarily related to the effect of currency fluctuations on
monetary assets net of liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than
US dollars.
Income taxes. We recorded a minimal income tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2016 related to
mark-to-market held for sale investment gains recorded as other comprehensive income.  We recorded no
income tax expense or benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern
At June 30, 2016 our aggregate cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.9 million, $0.2 million lower than the $4.1
million in similar assets held at December 31, 2015. The reduction is due primarily to $1.1  million in shutdown
and care and maintenance costs at the Velardeña Properties, $1.9 million in exploration expenditures, including
costs related to drilling at the San Luis del Cordero, Santa Maria, and Rodeo properties, $0.4 million in care and
maintenance and property holding costs at the El Quevar project, and $2.2 million in general and administrative
expenses, $0.5 million from an increase in working capital primarily related to a decrease in deferred revenue
from the lease of the oxide plant, offset in part by $0.2 million of net proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic
exploration properties, $2.1 million of net operating margin received pursuant to the lease (defined as oxide
plant lease revenue less oxide plant lease costs) and $3.6 million of net proceeds received in a registered direct
offering of our common stock as discussed below.
On February 11, 2016, Sentient converted approximately $3.9 million of principal and $0.1 million of accrued
interest (representing the total amount of accrued interest at the conversion date) into 23,355,000 shares of our
common stock. On June 10, 2016 Sentient converted the remaining approximately $1.1 million and
approximately $34,000 of accrued interest into 4,011,740 shares of our common stock.  At June 30, 2016 we had
no outstanding debt. See Note 11 for a full discussion of the Sentient Note.
On May 6, 2016, we issued 8.0 million registered shares of common stock at a purchase price of $0.50 per share
in a registered direct offering (the “Offering”) resulting in gross proceeds of $4.0 million. We incurred costs and
fees of approximately $0.4 million related to the Offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately $3.6
million.  In connection with the Offering, for each share of common stock purchased by an investor, such investor
received an unregistered warrant to purchase three‐quarters of a share of common stock. The warrants have an
exercise price of $0.75 per share and are exercisable six months after the date of issuance and will expire five
years from the initial exercise date.
We currently expect that we will have sufficient cash to continue our business plan into 2017 without external
funding.  In addition to our $3.9 million cash balance at June 30, 2016, we expect to receive approximately $2.4
million in net operating margin from the lease of the oxide plant in the remaining two quarters of 2016 and has
received $0.6 million
28
Table of Contents
from the sale of non-strategic exploration properties in the third quarter. We currently plan to spend
approximately $3.7 million in the remaining two quarters of 2016, as detailed below, resulting in a projected
cash balance at the end of 2016 of approxiamtely $3.0 million.
·Approximately $0.7 million at the Velardeña Properties for care and maintenance;
·Approximately $1.1 million on exploration activities and property holding costs related to our portfolio of
exploration properties located primarily in Mexico, including project assessment and development costs
relating to the Santa Maria, Rodeo, and other properties;
·Approximately $0.3 million at the El Quevar project to fund ongoing maintenance activities, property holding
costs, and continuing  project evaluation costs;
·Approximately $1.4 million on general and administrative costs; and
·Approximately $1.4 million on general and administrative costs; and
·Approximately $0.4 million on an increase in working capital primarily related to a reduction in current liabilities
involving the payment of equity taxes in a foreign jurisdiction.
The actual amount that we spend during the remainder of 2016 and the projected yearend cash balance may
vary significantly from the amounts specified above and will depend on a number of factors, including variations
from anticipated care and maintenance costs at the Velardeña Properties and costs for continued exploration,
project assessment, and development at our other exploration properties, including Santa Maria and Rodeo.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under which an entity is considered to
be able to realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business. However, our continuing
operations are dependent upon our ability to secure sufficient funding and to generate future profitable
operations. The underlying value and recoverability of the amounts shown as property, plant and equipment in
Note 8 are dependent on our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations and to continue to fund
exploration and development activities that would lead to profitable mining activities or to generate proceeds
from the disposition of property, plant and equipment. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in
generating future profitable operations or securing additional funding in the future on terms acceptable to us or at
all.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”), which simplifies several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including accounting for income taxes
and classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, forfeitures and minimum statutory tax
withholding requirements. For us, ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any interim or annual
period. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal
versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)” (“ASU 2016-08”), which clarifies principal
versus agent when another party, along with the entity, is involved in providing a good or service to a customer.
Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requires an entity to determine whether the nature of its
promise is to provide that good or service to the customer (i.e., the entity is a principal) or to arrange for the good
or service to be provided to the customer by the other party (i.e., the entity is an agent). For us, ASU 2016-08 is
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that
reporting period. Early application is not permitted. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a
material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities” (“ASU 2016-01”), which amended its standards related to the accounting of certain financial
instruments. This amendment addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and
disclosure. The new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2017. Early adoption is not permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have
on our consolidated financial position
29
Table of Contents
or results of operations. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, “Income Taxes: Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes” (“ASU 2015-17”). ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities
be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a
material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements - Going
Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern” (“ASU 2014-15”).  ASU 2014-15 will require management to evaluate whether there are conditions
and events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year after the financial statements are issued on both an interim and annual basis. Management will be required
to provide certain footnote disclosures if it concludes that substantial doubt exists or when its plans alleviate
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 becomes effective
for annual periods beginning in 2016 and for interim reporting periods starting in the first quarter of 2017. The
Company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

those forward-looking statements are reasonable. However, we cannot assure that these expectations will prove
to be correct. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as
a result of the factors set forth below and other factors set forth in, or incorporated by reference into this report:
·Higher than anticipated care and maintenance costs at the Velardeña Properties in Mexico or at El Quevar in
Argentina;  
·Lower revenue than anticipated from the oxide lease, which could result from delays or problems at the third
party’s mine or at the oxide plant, permitting problems at the third party’s mine or the oxide plant, delays in
constructing additional tailings capacity at the oxide plant, earlier than expected termination of the lease or
other causes;
·Continued decreases or insufficient increases in silver and gold prices;
·Whether we are able to raise the necessary capital required to continue our business on terms acceptable to us
or at all, and the likely negative effect of continued low silver and gold prices or unfavorable exploration results;
·Unfavorable results from exploration at the Santa Maria, Rodeo or other exploration properties and whether we
will be able to advance these or other exploration properties;
·Risks related to the El Quevar project in Argentina, including whether we will be able to find a joint venture
partner to advance the project, the feasibility and economic viability and unexpected costs of maintaining the
project;
·Variations in the nature, quality and quantity of any mineral deposits that are or may be located at the
Velardeña Properties or the Company’s exploration properties, changes in interpretations of geological
information, and unfavorable results of metallurgical and other tests;
·Whether we will be able to mine and sell minerals successfully or profitably at any of our current properties at
current or future silver and gold prices and achieve our objective of becoming a mid-tier mining company;
30
Table of Contents
·Potential delays in our exploration activities or other activities to advance properties towards mining resulting
from environmental consents or permitting delays or problems, accidents, problems with contractors, disputes
under agreements related to exploration properties, unanticipated costs and other unexpected events;
·Our ability to retain key management and mining personnel necessary to successfully operate and grow our
business;
·Economic and political events affecting the market prices for gold, silver, zinc, lead and other minerals that may
be found on our exploration properties;
·Political and economic instability in Mexico, Argentina, and other countries in which we conduct our business
and future actions of any of these governments with respect to nationalization of natural resources or other
changes in mining or taxation policies;
·Volatility in the market price of our common stock; and
·The factors discussed under "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015 and item 1A of this Report on Form 10-Q.
Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. You should not unduly rely on these forward-
looking statements. These statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Except
as required by law, we are not obligated to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to
reflect future events or developments.
Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
We invest substantially all of our excess cash in U.S. government and debt securities rated “investment grade”
or better. The rates received on such investments may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions. Based on
the average cash and investment balances outstanding during the second quarter 2016, a 1% decrease in
interest rates would have resulted in only a nominal reduction in interest income for the period.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Although most of our expenditures are in U.S. dollars, certain purchases of labor, supplies and capital assets are
denominated in other currencies, primarily in Mexico. As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact the
costs of our exploration and mining activities. To reduce this risk, we maintain minimum cash balances in foreign
currencies and complete most of our purchases in U.S. dollars.
Commodity Price Risk
We are primarily engaged in the exploration and mining of properties containing gold, silver, zinc, lead and other
minerals. As a result, decreases in the price of any of these metals have the potential to negatively impact our
ability to establish reserves and mine on our properties. We currently hold no commodity derivative positions.
Item 4.     Controls and Procedures
(a)  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer)
have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”))
as of June 30, 2016 (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of
the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
