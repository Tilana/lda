<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Secretary-General submitted to the Commission on Human Rights and subsequently 
the Human Rights Council an annual report on technical cooperation in the field of human rights, 
reflecting the discussions of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for 
Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights. In the light of Commission on Human 
Rights resolution 2004/81, the subsequent analytical report on the progress and concrete 
achievements made (E/CN.4/2006/104), and obstacles encountered in the implementation of the 
programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights and on the 
operation and administration of the Voluntary Fund, the Council, in its decision 2/102, requested<b> 
</b>the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue with the 
fulfilment of their activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the 
Commission on Human Rights, and to update the relevant reports and studies. The present report 
is therefore submitted as an update of the previous report (A/HRC/7/74), and focuses on the 
work of the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund. 
</p>
<p><b>II. BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNITED NATIONS VOLUNTARY 
FUND FOR TECHNICAL COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF  
HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>2. The members of the Board of Trustees are appointed by the Secretary-General to advise 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on 
streamlining and rationalizing the working methods and procedures of the technical 
cooperation programme. Its current members are Mary Chinery-Hesse (Ghana), chairperson; 
Viacheslav Bakhmin (Russian Federation); Monica Pinto (Argentina); William Schabas 
(Canada); and Deepika Udagama (Sri Lanka). Ms. Chinery-Hesse and Mr. Bakhmin concluded 
their mandates at the end of 2008. The process of identification of two new members has been 
initiated. 
</p>
<p>3. In recent years, the Board has moved away from detailed revision of individual projects to 
advising OHCHR on policy orientation, global vision and strategy at a broader programme level. 
The evolution of the role played by the Board has been appreciated by the Office, which benefits 
greatly from its experience and wisdom, particularly during the recent reforms within the 
United Nations and OHCHR and the Office&#8217;s strengthened country engagement. 
</p>
<p>4. The Board holds its meetings twice a year. The twenty-eighth session was held in 
May 2008 the twenty-ninth in November 2008. At the sessions, the Board continued its 
examination of various components of the United Nations Human Rights Programme on 
Technical Cooperation funded by the Voluntary Fund. The twenty-ninth session was timed to 
partly coincide with the annual OHCHR consultation with heads of field presences, which gave 
the Board the opportunity to learn first-hand from field representatives about the implementation 
of technical cooperation activities on the ground. In the framework of annual consultations, 
Board members also attended a joint session between OHCHR field representatives and the 
Secretary-General, during which the challenges faced by human rights work in the field were 
discussed. During the two sessions, the Board members had the opportunity of a brief exchange 
of views with a number of Member States and the President of the Human Rights Council, and 
also held discussions with the High Commissioner and Deputy High Commissioner. In its 
meetings with OHCHR staff, including field representatives, the Board focused on the ongoing </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>OHCHR internal evaluation exercise of its technical cooperation programme in paying special 
attention to technical cooperation in the context of economic, social and cultural rights and 
synergies between the current technical cooperation programme and activities planned in the 
framework of the follow-up to the universal periodic review. As in previous sessions, the Board 
also focused on technical cooperation and capacity-building activities implemented through 
human rights advisers working in United Nations country teams and human rights components of 
United Nations peace missions. 
</p>
<p><b>III. TRANSLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS THEMES INTO THE TECHNICAL 
COOPERATION PROGRAMME AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>5. Translating the Office&#8217;s thematic capacity into action in the field remains a major priority, 
while technical cooperation is an important tool for operationalizing the Office&#8217;s thematic 
expertise. Although the 2005 plan of action emphasized the importance of technical cooperation<b> 
</b>and stipulated the essential linkage between protection and technical cooperation, activities in the 
field remain characterized by a diversity of approaches. The Board was pleased therefore to learn 
about the Office&#8217;s stocktaking and lessons-learned exercise with regard to its technical 
cooperation activities. It also noted with interest the outcome of the discussion on possible 
principles for future implementation of technical cooperation activities, which was held in the 
framework of the 2008 annual OHCHR consultations of heads of field presences in Geneva. The 
Board appreciated the strong reaffirmation of the intrinsic linkage between protection and 
technical cooperation and stressed that the ultimate objective of technical cooperation should be 
to promote institution-building and to effect genuine institutional changes for the benefit of 
right-holders. The Board also emphasized the need to engage in concrete interaction and 
partnership with Governments and civil society actors with regard to the conception and delivery 
of technical cooperation in order to increase the impact and sustainability of technical 
cooperation projects. The Board encouraged the Office to continue its work on re-assessing its 
technical cooperation programme and on establishing a set of principles for the implementation 
of future technical cooperation activities.  
</p>
<p>6. The Board appreciated the Office&#8217;s ongoing engagement to support national human rights 
institutions. The Board reiterated that they are central elements of strong national human rights 
protection systems and are crucial when addressing core protection issues. The more the 
United Nations system works closely with and through independent national human rights 
institutions, the greater the chances of success and sustainability of good governance, rule of law 
and human rights efforts. The Board stressed that technical cooperation programmes can only be 
sustained if the capacity of national partners is ensured. 
</p>
<p>7. The Board was briefed about the Office&#8217;s efforts to strengthen its capacities in economic, 
social and cultural rights and noted the important achievements in this area, including 
developments with regard to special procedures on economic, social and cultural rights, 
strengthened expertise at Headquarters, and the development of tools and a strategy to support 
field presences. It also noted the excellent activities being conducted at the field level, such as 
right to food activities in Timor-Leste; activities in the area of housing in Central Asia; the 
non-discrimination approach to economic, social and cultural rights in Nepal; and tackling forced 
evictions in Cambodia. The Board stated that examples of such best practices should be shared 
more broadly and systematically internally and publicized externally in order to ensure 
increased, sustained and coherent work on economic, social and cultural rights. The Board also </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>recommended that further work should be carried out to systematically operationalize relevant 
concepts and standards and to continue enhancing capacity, knowledge and skills both at 
Headquarters and in the field. The Board underlined the fact that enhancing institutional 
commitment within OHCHR to raise economic, social and cultural rights to the same level as 
civil and political rights, as well as addressing the lack of understanding and knowledge of those 
rights in OHCHR remains a priority challenge. With regard to measuring the success of the 
Office&#8217;s work on economic, social and cultural rights, the Board highlighted the<b> </b>importance of 
developing monitoring tools.  
</p>
<p>8. With regard to specific rights, the Board received an update on the activities carried out by 
the Office in the area of disabilities, including the recent developments regarding the new 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto. The 
Board highlighted the need for a strategy to integrate the provisions of the Convention into the 
work throughout the United Nations system in order to operationalize the principles therein and 
to enhance its implementation. 
</p>
<p>9. In view of the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Board 
was briefed on indigenous and minority fellowship programmes. The Board learned about the 
successful cooperation with other United Nations agencies in these areas and encouraged further 
application of this good practice. The Board recommended that these issues be integrated firmly 
into the work of the Office. It also noted possible areas of future cooperation, in particular the 
promotion of the Declaration, staff training and capacity-building at the country level, 
development of guidelines, the establishment of a forum on indigenous issues and follow-up to 
the fellowship programmes. 
</p>
<p>10. Ahead of the 2009 Durban Review Conference that will review progress and assess 
implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action in order to foster its 
implementation, the Board received an overview of the preparatory process. The Board noted the 
various internal task forces, panels and working groups that have been set up within OHCHR to 
prepare for the Review Conference and the regional meetings that had been organized. The 
Board appreciated the efforts by the Office, in particular field presences, to engage with 
United Nations country teams and non-governmental organizations for their participation in the 
Conference. The Board regarded the dissemination of the first e-bulletin for non-governmental 
organizations on the Durban Review Conference as an important tool to support their 
engagement in the process.  
</p>
<p>11. Concerning the ongoing work of OHCHR on human rights indicators, the Board took note 
of the new report on indicators for promoting and monitoring the implementation of human 
rights (HRI/MC/2008/3), which provides an outline of the conceptual and methodological 
framework as it has evolved over the past two years. The Board appreciated the fact that the 
framework had been subject to a validation exercise through workshops and consultations with 
members of treaty bodies, special rapporteurs, United Nations agencies, academics and 
non-governmental organizations and with country-level stakeholders, namely human rights 
institutions, relevant governmental bodies, statistical agencies, non-governmental organizations 
and United Nations country teams in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The Board acknowledged 
the importance of having indicators to measure the impact of the Office&#8217;s activities. At the same </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>time, the Board highlighted the difficulties in measuring the impact on human rights and 
emphasized that indicators should be seen primarily as a tool for States to assess their progress 
with regard to implementation of rights and to allow them to compare different strategies. 
</p>
<p>12. In the framework of the twenty-ninth session, the Deputy High Commissioner invited the 
Board members, as well as senior managers from the field and from Headquarters, to join her in 
a round table to discuss the ongoing efforts to develop an OHCHR performance monitoring 
system. The discussion had the aim of facilitating an interactive space in which senior managers 
from the field and Headquarters would be able to better understand the system proposed and 
contribute jointly to the refinement of next steps in the process of implementing this system at 
both the national and global levels. An introductory presentation by the OHCHR Policy, 
Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Section on the process developed to date in order to 
implement the system was followed by a session of questions and answers. The Deputy 
High Commissioner stressed the fact that performance monitoring was an internal necessity, a 
United Nations requirement and a donors&#8217; request. The Board noted that OHCHR would 
gradually set up the system that it will use to monitor its own performance effectively, for full 
implementation by 2010. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. CAPACITY AND INSTITUTION-BUILDING ACTIVITIES:  
HUMAN RIGHTS ADVISERS AND HUMAN RIGHTS  
COMPONENTS OF UNITED NATIONS PEACE MISSIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Human rights advisers in United Nations country teams  
</b></p>
<p>13. The Board was updated on recent developments affecting the work of human rights 
advisers, including with regard to human rights mainstreaming in United Nations country teams 
and the role of United Nations Resident Coordinators with regard to advocacy on human rights. 
The Board noted with interest the latest developments in the context of the United Nations 
Development Group reform, including the agreement on the management and accountability of 
the Resident Coordinator system. The Board in particular acknowledged the decision of the 
Secretary-General on human rights and development, which stipulated the roles and 
responsibilities of Resident Coordinators in human rights. The Board stressed the importance of 
availability of specific training and guidance to Resident Coordinators on how to address human 
rights challenges and political tensions at the country level, going beyond the conventional 
training on the human rights-based approach to development. The Board welcomed the recent 
study on OHCHR performance in mainstreaming human rights within the United Nations at the 
country level, with a special focus on capacity development, joint advocacy, programming and 
overall strategy.  
</p>
<p>14. The Board was also briefed on the outcome of the session on human rights advisers in the 
framework of OHCHR annual consultations. The Board noted that the demands and expectations 
with regard to advisers are very high and that it is difficult at times for them to address all the 
demands made of them. The Board also noted that the support currently available to advisers, 
from partners as well as from within OHCHR, significantly differs according to the country they 
are based in. The Board recommended that support for human rights advisers should be 
strengthened, while ensuring that a minimum standard of support is available to all of them.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Human rights components of United Nations peace missions 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Board was briefed on the Voluntary Fund resources used in the context of human 
rights capacity- and institution-building activities in peace operations. A consultancy paper on 
human rights capacity-building in post-conflict peace operations was presented to the Board, 
which encouraged, in the framework of the Office&#8217;s current overall evaluation of the technical 
cooperation programme, the elaboration of standards and principles to support the 
implementation of technical cooperation by human rights components. It also recommended that 
an overarching strategy be developed to ensure coherence in the work of various United Nations 
programmes contributing to peace operations. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Board was also briefed on a number of key developments relevant to the work of 
human rights components of peace missions, including the first policy directive, led jointly by 
OHCHR, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Political Affairs, 
on public reporting by human rights components of United Nations peace operations, and the 
increased issuing of public reports, an institutionalized focal point for human rights in the  
Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support, the imminent 
commencement of a joint review of Department of Political Affairs special political missions, 
and progress towards full implementation of the human rights database project. 
</p><p>17. The Board acknowledged that human rights components have an important and 
challenging role to play. One particular challenge is promoting accountability during peace 
processes and reconciling the rule of law with political expediency. The Board stressed that 
peace and justice should not be seen as separate goals, and that human rights are central to both. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  TECHNICAL COOPERATION ACTIVITIES  
</b></p>
<p>18. The Board was briefed about the Office&#8217;s engagement and capacity-building activities in 
different geographic regions. It was informed that most activities under the OHCHR Africa 
programme are carried out by the Office&#8217;s 22 presences in the region, which include four 
regional offices (in Addis Ababa for East Africa, in Pretoria for Southern Africa, in Dakar for 
West Africa, and the Central Africa Centre in Yaound&#233;), five human rights advisers (in Guinea, 
Kenya, the Niger, Rwanda and West Africa), two country offices (Togo and Uganda), as well as 
support to 11 peace operations (in Burundi, Chad and the Central African Republic, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Central African 
Republic, Guinea Bissau, Somalia and the two missions in the Sudan).  
</p>
<p>19. The OHCHR Africa programme helps African Governments, institutions and civil society 
organizations to incorporate human rights principles into their everyday efforts to respond to the 
human rights needs of their people, reduce widespread poverty, fight impunity and address 
discrimination, especially against women. The programme seeks in particular to increase 
institutional awareness and fill capacity gaps on human rights, especially to address violations by 
the police, army and the judiciary. Similarly, existing knowledge and capacity gaps of national 
human rights institutions and civil society organizations, including organizations focusing on 
transitional justice, human rights monitoring, reporting and advocacy, are bridged through 
human rights training programmes. Regular public reporting from OHCHR presences in Africa 
serves as a major tool for diagnosing human rights gaps, dialoguing with Governments and 
raising awareness broadly on key human rights issues. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>20. In the Asia region, the Office&#8217;s capacity to implement technical cooperation has been 
increasingly facilitated through the expansion of field presences, including the deployment of 
human rights advisers. There are currently four advisers in the region (in Indonesia, Papua 
New Guinea, Sri Lanka and Maldives (mandate completed in 2008)); the deployment of more 
advisers is currently being discussed. OHCHR also maintains two country offices (in Cambodia 
and Nepal), two components of peacekeeping missions (in Afghanistan and Timor-Leste) and 
two regional offices (in Bangkok and Suva) with plans for a third.  
</p>
<p>21. In addition to work with individual Member States and United Nations country teams, the 
Office works closely with several important regional partners, including the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum, as well as the Asia-Pacific Forum of 
National Human Rights Institutions. OHCHR also supports an overarching Asia-Pacific regional 
framework on the promotion and protection of human rights, which, in the absence of a regional 
human rights mechanism, brings together Member States from across the region. 
</p>
<p>22. With regard to the Europe, North America and Central Asia region, which covers 
the 56 member countries of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Office 
selects its priorities for capacity-building carefully, taking into account the very effective 
regional mechanisms already covering Europe and the strong civil society actors active in quite a 
number of countries. In terms of fieldwork, one major shift in focus within the Office has been 
away from the Balkans (with the exception of Kosovo), where the Office was heavily engaged in 
recent years, to Central Asia, where work has been growing in the past two years and where a 
regional office has been established in Kyrgyzstan. The Office is also represented by human 
rights advisers to the United Nations country teams in the Russian Federation and the south 
Caucasus, which are major areas for priority involvement. The Office is planning the 
establishment of a regional office in Brussels to facilitate relations with the institutions of the 
European Union.  
</p>
<p>23. Throughout the region, the Office has been emphasizing the placing of human rights 
advisers, including national ones, in United Nations country teams, as well as, to the extent 
possible, working with country teams in countries where OHCHR has no presence. The Office&#8217;s 
technical assistance and policy advocacy work in the region focuses on ongoing issues of 
concern, which often involve impunity and range from weak institutions - judiciary and 
legislature, in particular - to women&#8217;s rights, restrictions on freedom of expression and 
association, human rights in the fight against terrorism, racism and xenophobia, the treatment of 
asylum-seekers, irregular migrants and Roma, as well as economic and social rights, including 
poverty and the right to housing.   
</p>
<p>24. In Latin America, OHCHR technical cooperation activities are mainly implemented 
through its presences in the region, including the regional office for Latin America (Panama), its 
four country offices (Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico), two human rights advisers 
(Ecuador and Nicaragua), and the human rights component in the United Nations Stabilization 
Mission in Haiti.  
</p>
<p>25. The Office however also engages with countries with no presence, for example by 
providing assistance for the inclusion of a human rights-based approach within the social 
cohesion programme developed by the Department of Political Affairs and the United Nations 
Development Programme for the English-speaking Caribbean, a priority in 2009. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>26. The Office&#8217;s priorities for its technical cooperation programme in the region include 
addressing impunity and weak institutions (access to and administration of justice, and public 
security); discrimination (particularly against Afro-descendants and indigenous persons); poverty 
and inequality; and violence (mainly against women and children).  
</p>
<p>27. In the Middle East and North Africa region, the Office currently has a regional office based 
in Beirut, which covers the Middle East, and a country office in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory. The Office also supports the Human Rights Office of the United Nations Assistance 
Mission for Iraq. The Office is in the process of increasing its field presences in the region, to 
further the implementation of technical cooperation. 
</p>
<p>28. In the region, the Office&#8217;s priorities are to help Member States implement applicable 
human rights standards, regularize ratification status and comply with universal periodic review 
and treaty body reporting obligations. Women&#8217;s rights, minority rights and access to justice are 
all major themes of such work. It also aims at supporting Member States in the development and 
finalization of their national human rights action plans, and to strengthen the compliance of 
national human rights institutions with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p>29. Thematic priorities for the region include freedom of expression, association and assembly; 
the fight against impunity; attending to the need of countries in conflict; and the human rights of 
non-citizens, namely refugees, stateless persons and migrant workers. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  
</b></p>
<p>30. The Board was briefed on the recent sessions of the Human Rights Council, the functions 
of its Advisory Committee and the holding of special sessions, with a special focus on the 
seventh special session on &#8220;the negative impact on the realization to the right to food of the 
worsening of the world food crisis&#8221;, which the Board partly observed. The Board encouraged the 
involvement and contribution of other relevant agencies in theme-based special sessions. While 
noting that the trend in the elaboration of technical cooperation matters in the Council had yet to 
be observed, the Board underlined the importance of identifying a mechanism which would 
ensure that the work of the Council had a real impact on the ground. With regard to the working 
methods of the Council, the Board took note of the Council review to be completed by 2011. 
</p>
<p>31. The Board received an update on the progress of the universal periodic review and 
expressed its satisfaction over the internal process within OHCHR with regard to preparation of 
relevant documents. The Board learned about several review experiences at the country level, 
including with regard to disseminating information to local stakeholders, assisting the State 
under review in consultations on drafting the national report, providing training to States and 
civil society organizations, and utilizing recommendations to engage the Government and 
United Nations country teams in the consideration of key human rights issues. The Board was 
also informed that two trust funds to support the universal periodic review process had been 
formed; one is used to facilitate the travel of delegations to participate in review sessions, while 
the other, which is not operational yet, is aimed at providing support to the follow-up of review 
recommendations. The Board reiterated the importance of follow-up to the universal periodic 
review, and asked to be kept informed on developments regarding any additional resources for </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>relevant training and for technical assistance in the implementation of recommendations. The 
Board also suggested that the experience of the Voluntary Fund be taken into account for the 
administration of the universal periodic review funds. 
</p>
<p>32. The Board was updated on recent developments with regard to treaty body reform, 
including a new mechanism for individual complaints. It reiterated the importance of the treaty 
body system and emphasized the need for developing common policies and guidelines that 
would allow for a minimum of standardization with regard to States&#8217; reporting obligations. The 
Board also emphasized the importance of providing technical assistance to States that do not 
have the institutional capacity to meet their reporting obligations. The Board was updated on the 
recent development of the Universal Human Rights Index, a tool for searching the most recent 
treaty body outcomes. The index is accessible in the six official languages of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>33. In view of possible overlapping of universal periodic review and treaty body 
recommendations, and the concern that they could be competitive rather than complementary, 
the Board emphasized the need for a coordination mechanism between the universal periodic 
review mechanism and treaty bodies. At the same time, the Board acknowledged the importance 
of the recommendations of treaty bodies and special procedure with regard to universal periodic 
review compilations and discussions.  
</p>
<p>34. The Board was informed on recent developments with regard to special procedures, 
including the completed review of mandates and the selection of 27 new mandate holders. The 
Board was briefed on positive institutional developments in the area of information management 
and integration of the recommendations of special procedures into country engagement 
strategies. It also underlined the importance of ensuring continuity and of having an adequate 
mechanism for knowledge transfer.  
</p>
<p><b>VII.  FINANCIAL SITUATION OF THE VOLUNTARY FUND 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Finance and Budget Section and the Donor and External Relations Sections of 
OHCHR provide the Board of Trustees with an update on the financial situation of the Voluntary 
Fund at each session. As at 31 December 2008, the total estimated income of the Voluntary 
Fund was $14,264,720. The estimated balance is $10,910,058, considering the 2007 carry-over 
of $8,729,209. The fund balance will be used to meet the Voluntary Fund for Technical 
Cooperation 2009 budget amounting to $17,299,103. 
</p>
<p>36. The Board noted with interest the donation received from the MacArthur Foundation and 
encouraged the Office to continue building partnerships with the private sector. It also reiterated 
the importance of receiving funds from a wide range of donors, including from countries that 
benefit from the Fund, and would like to encourage those countries to contribute to the Fund, 
given that even modest contributions are an important sign of support for the activities carried 
out under it.  </p>
