<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
education, Kishore Singh, undertook a mission to Ecuador from 10 to 17 September 2012. 
During the visit, the Special Rapporteur examined the situation of the right to education in 
the country. 
</p>
<p> In recent years, important steps have been taken for promoting the right to education 
in Ecuador, through the adoption of new laws and policies for primary and higher 
education, in line with international human rights standards. Elaborate provisions in 
Ecuador&#8217;s Constitution on the right to education, along with high priority accorded to 
education in the country, have paved the way for progress. In keeping with its 
responsibility, the Government ushered in long-term planning and implementation of 
public policies for education development, through the 2006&#8211;2015 Plan for Education, with 
a human rights-based approach. The historical reform process has resulted in notable 
achievements in the education system, seeking to provide free education of good quality at 
all levels. The continued increase of public spending on the education sector has also been 
important in contributing to the improvement of the overall educational situation.

<p> However, the Special Rapporteur also notes that long-term challenges persist, 
including poor infrastructure, low quality of education and disparities in education in rural 
and urban areas. Communities living in poverty, indigenous peoples and Afro-Ecuadorians 
remain underserved and do not benefit from full education opportunities. Continuous 
attention to longstanding problems relating to the provision of good quality education and 
full and equal opportunity, backed up by greater resources, is crucial in consolidating the 
progress which has recently been made.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In this report, the Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Kishore Singh, 
presents the main findings of his visit to Ecuador from 10 to 17 September 2012, which was 
undertaken to examine in depth the situation of the right to education in the country.  
</p>
<p>2. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur met with President Rafael Correa and 
multiple authorities, including the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Integration; the 
Minister of Education; the Minister of Economic and Social Inclusion; the Minister of 
Justice, Human Rights and Religion; the Minister of Coordination of Knowledge and 
Human Talent; and the National Secretary for Higher Education, Science, Technology and 
Innovation. He also met with high representatives of the National Secretariat of Planning 
and Development (SENPLADES), the municipality of Quito and the Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo 
(The National Human Rights Institution of Ecuador). 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also met several representatives from the international 
community and civil society, including representatives from the United Nations system, 
teachers&#8217; unions, student councils and numerous civil society organizations working in 
Ecuador. Finally he visited a number of education institutions and met their directors, 
teachers, students and their parents in Quito, Guayaquil and Cayambe. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to the Government of Ecuador for its 
invitation and for the full cooperation throughout his mission. He would like to especially 
express his deep gratitude to President Rafael Correa for giving him the opportunity to 
engage in a dialogue. He also extends his thanks to the representatives of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and to the United Nations Country 
Team in Ecuador. Lastly, he expresses his appreciation to those who took time to meet with 
him and share their experiences in the field of education. 
</p>
<p>5. Over the last decade, in particular after the adoption of a new Constitution in 2008 
and the reform of laws for the education sector, Ecuador&#8217;s education system is making 
</p>
<p>important advances. The State recognition of its duty to ensure access to good quality 
education at all levels appears to have already resulted in notable achievements. For 
example, the public budget for education has expanded and access to both primary and 
secondary education has also increased. The adoption of new standards and measures to 
monitor the quality of education in public and private schools is also important for 
detecting problems and preventing abusive practices.  
</p>
<p>6. Nevertheless, challenges persist, including poor infrastructure, overall low quality of 
education, a lack of qualified human resources in the field of education and disparities in 
access to education. In particular, communities living in poverty, indigenous peoples and 
Afro-Ecuadorians remain underserved and do not benefit from full education opportunities. 
Further efforts are required to ensure full and equal opportunities in education.  
</p>
<p>7. As noted in the Constitution, while education is primarily the responsibility of the 
State, it is also a social responsibility   that non-State actors must also assume. The 
promotion of the right to education and the implementation of education reforms require the 
constant and meaningful participation of all sectors of civil society, including, in particular, 
teachers, students, their parents and communities. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/35/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. Ecuador is a State party to all international human rights instruments1 including the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child (both containing comprehensive provisions on the right to 
education). These place an obligation on the State to take all necessary steps to protect, 
promote and fulfil the right to education for all persons in its territory, without 
discrimination. At the regional level, Ecuador is party to the American Convention on 
Human Rights, recognizes the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights 
and has ratified a number of additional instruments, including the Additional Protocol to the 
American Convention on Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, which also contains detailed provisions with regard to the right to education. 
</p>
<p>9. In 2010, Ecuador was the first country to ratify the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which provides for the 
right of individuals and groups to claim the rights contained in the Covenant in cases of 
their violation. The early recognition of this international complaints mechanism and the 
previous ratification of multiple international and regional human rights instruments are 
important in terms of Ecuador&#8217;s continued commitment to strengthen the protection of all 
human rights, including the right to education. 
</p>
<p>10. In accordance with article 11(3) of the Constitution, international treaties ratified by 
Ecuador are directly applicable in national courts, and can be directly enforced in civil, 
administrative or judicial authorities, even in the absence of national legislation.  
</p>
<p><b> B. National legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>11. Ecuador&#8217;s Constitution, adopted through a national referendum in 2008, includes 
ensuring the enjoyment of the right to education without discrimination as one of the 
essential duties of the State.2 It ushered in a new model for the State, with development that 
focuses on people (A/HRC/WG.6/13/ECU/1, para. 4).  
</p>
<p>12. The Constitution provides an elaborate legal framework on the right to education. 
Specific provisions regarding the right to education are included within Chapter II on 
&#8220;Rights to good living&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>13. Article 26 establishes education as a right of all persons and a core duty of the State. 
It underlines that education constitutes a priority area for public policymaking and State 
investment, with ensuring equality, social inclusion and promoting &#8220;good living&#8221; having 
central importance. It also states that individuals, family and society have the right and 
responsibility to participate in education.   
</p>
<p>  
 1  Ecuador has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; ; the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities; and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families. Ecuador is also a State party to the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and. Cultural Organization Convention against Discrimination in 
Education. 
</p>
<p> 2  Art. 3.1. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/35/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>14. Article 27 provides that education &#8220;shall guarantee holistic human development, 
within the framework of respect for human rights, a sustainable environment, and 
democracy; education shall be participatory, compulsory, intercultural, democratic, 
inclusive and diverse, of high quality and humane&#8221;. It also underlines the centrality of 
education for exercising other rights and consolidating national development. 
</p>
<p>15. Article 28 underscores that education shall respond to public interest and will not be 
subservient to individual or corporate interests. It establishes the compulsory attendance of 
initial schooling, primary education and secondary education or their equivalent. It 
underlines the State role in promoting intercultural dialogue while indicating that learning 
can take place within and outside formal schooling systems. It also establishes that &#8220;public 
education shall be universal and secular at all levels and shall be free of charge up to and 
including the third level of higher education&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>16. Article 29 guarantees academic freedom in higher education, the rights of persons to 
learn in their own language and cultural environment and the freedom of parents or others 
representing children to choose an education that is in line with their principles, beliefs and 
pedagogical options.  
</p>
<p>17. In this respect, it is important to note the work of the Ministry of Justice, Human 
Rights and Religion regarding the promotion of training for judges and lawyers and 
creating greater awareness of the constitutional right to education.3 The Ministry also plays 
an important role in the dialogue with the United Nations human rights treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur notes that the concept of <i>sumak kawsay</i> &#8211; good living &#8211; is 
enshrined in the Constitution in order to reinstate the notion of the common good. Thus, the 
Constitution and the national development framework are marked by the innovative 
concept of a right to &#8220;good living&#8221; and the State goal to promote it. This concept has its 
</p>
<p>roots in local indigenous tradition and refers to the promotion of a harmonious life among 
communities and between human beings and nature. It includes respect for the rights of 
nature as well as the promotion of creative diversity. In this regard, the promotion of the 
right to education is considered one of the most important requirements for the attainment 
of &#8220;good living&#8221;, emphasizing its relevance for the promotion of an intercultural dialogue.  
The Special Rapporteur considers that the introduction of this innovative concept offers a 
perspective for consolidating a more holistic and inclusive approach to education and its 
aims, in line with international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>19. The legal framework for preschool, primary and secondary education is established 
by the Intercultural Education Act of 20114 and accompanying regulations.5 Tertiary 
(university) education is governed by the Higher Education Act of 2010.6 The Ecuadorian 
education system encompasses &#8220;early childhood education&#8221;, covering children up to the age 
of five, &#8220;basic education&#8221; offering an additional 10 years of primary and early secondary 
education, an additional three-year secondary level baccalaureate (which may be technical), 
and post-secondary (university) education. As indicated, education is mandatory up to the 
secondary level and is offered free of charge up to the first university degree (A/HRC/21/4).   
</p>
<p>20. The Intercultural Education Act contains detailed provisions on the aims and 
functioning of all education levels in Ecuador (excepting the higher level) and the rights 
</p>
<p>  
  3  The Constitution of Ecuador also enshrines the rule of law. In the referendum of 7 May  2011,     
</p>
<p>Ecuadorians said yes to an independent justice system for everyone.

<p>and responsibilities of teachers, students, parents and the community in order to achieve the 
goals set out in the Constitution. It establishes the National Education Authority (under the 
oversight of the Ministry of Education) as the national policymaking and standard-setting 
regulator for the sector as well as the manager of national education policies at the local and 
national levels. The law also establishes a National Institute for the Evaluation of 
Education, which is entrusted with the task of the evaluation of the entire education system. 
The law emphasizes the importance of an intercultural approach to the entire education 
system. It also provides the framework for the Bilingual and Intercultural Education 
system, including the direct participation of representatives of indigenous groups in the 
council which is responsible for designing, managing and evaluating bilingual education. 
Finally, the law provides regulations for the teaching profession, including defining 
professional requirements, evaluation and promotion procedures.  
</p>
<p>21. The adoption of an intercultural perspective for the entire education system through 
the Intercultural Education Act is considered an advance in promoting the integration of 
indigenous groups and their knowledge into the education system. The emphasis of the law 
on the rights of stakeholders, including students, parents and communities, to actively 
participate in the education system is also considered important for the promotion of a 
human rights-based approach to education.7  
</p>
<p>22. The Higher Education Act and its regulations provide the legal framework for the 
post-secondary education system and institutions, establishing the rights and 
responsibilities of students, teachers and administrators. This Act underlines the academic, 
administrative, financial and organic autonomy of higher education institutions while 
emphasizing that these institutions must be guided by, inter alia, the principles of social 
responsibility, equality and accountability. It also establishes quality standards and 
accreditation procedures. While public universities are free until at least the first degree 
level, private universities may require fees, but must operate on a non-profit basis.8 
</p>
<p><b> C. National policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Decennial Education Plan 2006&#8211;2015 is the most important policy strategy 
document for the education sector. The eight main objectives of the Plan are: (a) 
universalizing early childhood education from 0 to 5 years of age; (b) universalizing 
general primary education from the first to the tenth grades; (c) increasing registration in 
the high school diploma programme, to attain at least 75 per cent of the population for that 
age; (d) eradicating illiteracy; (e) improving the infrastructure of educational institutions; 
(f) promoting quality and equity in education and implementing a national evaluation 
system with a social responsibility mechanism; (g) promoting the teaching profession, 
enhancing teachers&#8217; professional development and working conditions; and (h) increasing 
public education budget allocations by at least 0.5 per cent of the gross domestic product  
(GDP) every year, with a view of reaching 6 per cent  by 2012.  
</p>
<p>24. Despite predating the recently adopted legal instruments for education, the Plan&#8217;s 
emphasis on promoting better quality education and equality of educational opportunities is 
in general terms aligned to the more recently adopted norms for the right to education. The 
adoption of clear targets and priorities appears to have created a very important instrument 
for evaluating the achievements encountered in the execution of educational policies.

</p>
<p>25. The overall education policies are also guided by the National Plan for Good Living, 
2009&#8211;2013, which details the overall national strategies for development. The National 
Plan embraces a human rights-based approach to planning, and rightly underlines the need 
to pay attention to inequality and discrimination in all planning processes 
(A/HRC/11/9/Add.1). Transforming the higher education system, given the overall strategic 
need to ensure better public investments in this sector as against previous years of 
underinvestment, is one of its 12 objectives.9 Among other things, the National Plan 
stresses the need to create better opportunities to ensure that social economic barriers do not 
impede the progression of students to higher levels of education, and the need to improve 
the overall quality of higher education.    
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the constant reference to core human rights 
principles, with the emphasis on ensuring good coordination in policy planning. In the past, 
education policies and developments in Ecuador have been marked by limited continuity 
and fragmentation, due mostly to the recent history of political instability experienced by 
the country. This legacy has been reversed &#8211; both the National Plan and, most importantly, 
the Decennial Education Plan 2006&#8211;2015 continue to be taken as the guiding instruments 
for the formulation, execution and evaluation of State educational policies. Moreover, the 
reformed legal and policy instruments offer a good national framework for the promotion 
and protection of the right to education. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Education system 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Primary and secondary education 
</b></p>
<p>27. In line with international human rights standards, the universalization of access to 
the primary (general basic education) and secondary education levels is established as an 
obligation of the State by both the Constitution and the Intercultural Education Act. This is 
also one of the priorities of the national development policy framework. Education is 
offered to those between 5 and 14 years of age, comprising general basic education and 
basic secondary curriculum. The higher secondary education (high school or <i>bachillerato</i>) 
consists of a three-year programme for those aged 15 to 17 years. The secondary system is 
subdivided into two main career options, the scientific career (<i>bachillerato</i>) related to the 
common school curricula only, and the technical career that offers an additional technical 
and vocational education. Ecuador achieved nearly universal enrolment in primary 
education. The Government reports that net enrolment rate of students in general basic 
education advanced from 91.2 per cent in 2006 to 95.4 per cent in 2011, including an 
increase in net enrolment rate of Afro-Ecuadorians from 44.1 per cent to 53.9 per cent, and 
a rise from 24.4 per cent to 50.8 per cent for indigenous peoples.10 Total attendance at the 
<i>bachillerato</i> level rose from 47.9 per cent to 63.9 per cent during the same period.11 
Continued investment in the elimination of all financial costs of education is considered to 
have contributed to this expansion. According to information provided by the Ministry of 
Education, from 2007 to 2010, 31 million primary education school textbooks were made 
available free of charge. In his visit to indigenous and other schools, the Special Rapporteur

<p>saw the prescribed textbooks, reflecting values of human rights and democratic citizenship 
as well as solidarity and intercultural education around the key concept of <i>sumak kawsay</i>.  
</p>
<p>28. However, concerns remain with regard to the phenomenon of students experiencing 
grade retention, making them vulnerable to early dropouts or persistent lagging behind their 
peers. In 2009, around 9 per cent of the students enrolled in primary education experienced 
grade retention.12  
</p>
<p>29. The Decennial Education Plan 2006&#8211;2015 includes as its third goal to increase the 
population reaching secondary level to at least 75 per cent of the youth at the respective age 
level. In this regard, the Government reported that the enrolment rate for high school 
education rose from 47.9 per cent in 2006 to 62.1 per cent in 2011. The Government also 
estimated that the 75 per cent enrolment goal fixed in the Decennial Education Plan can be 
reached in 2015 if the pace of progress is maintained.13 Despite these advances, further 
concerns emerge with regard to the high rates of student drop out at this education level: in 
2009&#8211;2010, 5 per cent of the students enrolled in secondary level deserted the system. 
Within the bilingual education system, dropout rates reach 12 per cent of those enrolled.14  
</p>
<p>30. In 2011, gender parity was reportedly achieved with regard to the enrolment of 
students at both the primary and secondary education levels. 
</p>
<p>31. The removal of economic barriers to education played an important role in the 
expansion of enrolment at the primary and secondary levels.  For example, the expansion of 
secondary level enrolment created opportunities for students belonging to the lowest social 
strata to receive an education. On the other hand, overall concerns about the quality of 
education remain. 
</p>
<p>32. Quality concerns appear to also be closely related to the persistence of overall 
unequal opportunities in education &#8211; those belonging to marginalized groups, in particular 
those living in rural and remote areas, appear to be disproportionally affected by lower 
quality education at primary and secondary levels.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Preschool education  
</b></p>
<p>33. The promotion of preschool education is well recognized as a State obligation in the 
laws and policies in Ecuador. Article 28 of the Constitution includes access to &#8220;initial 
education&#8221; as mandatory. The Decennial Education Plan 2006&#8211;2015 has as its first goal 
universalizing access to preschool education. Article 40 of the Intercultural Education Act 
defines &#8220;initial education&#8221; from 3 to 5 years of age as the process of the integral 
development of psychological-social skills. States and families have shared responsibilities 
in ensuring preschool education, with the State being mainly responsible for offering 
education from 3 to 5 years old, and families mainly responsible for those below 3 years of 
age. The Intercultural Education Act also establishes the need to ensure coordination 
between preschool and primary education.   
</p>
<p>34. Public preschool education is currently administered by both the Ministry of 
Education and the Ministry of Social Inclusion through the Institute for Childhood and the 
Family (<i>Instituto de la Ni&#241;ez y la Familia</i>). A transition is in process in the sector, with the 
Ministry of Education (through the National Education Authority) becoming mainly

<p>35. Despite noting an increase in the absolute number of children receiving preschool 
education and in the number of teachers working in the sector, it was estimated that in 2012 
only 27 per cent of 3- and 4-year-old children benefitted from preschool education.15 
Another evaluation noted that the goal of universalization of preschool education by 2015 is 
unlikely to be met.16 The evaluation showed that only around 50 per cent of children under 
5 years of age were covered by some sort of preschool education programme in 2010, while 
noting difficulties in measuring progress due to the lack of accurate information, 
particularly on private preschool and childcare entities. It was also noted that there is a need 
to further promote coherence among the multiple public and private childcare providers, as 
many of these have just recently been integrated into the education system.  
</p>
<p>36. While noting advances, the Special Rapporteur considers that enhanced attention 
and investments to both the coverage and the quality of the preschool education system are 
needed. The role of the State in guaranteeing good quality early childhood education should 
never be underestimated, given its importance for a child&#8217;s development.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Technical and vocational education  
</b></p>
<p>37. The technical and vocational education system in Ecuador comprises technical 
schools at the secondary level (integrated into the overall curricula for secondary education) 
and higher level technical schools. Limited investments in this strategic sector in past 
appear to have impaired its development and capacity. 
</p>
<p>38. In order to ensure adherence to minimal quality standards for technical education, 
the Government has implemented a process of evaluation and accreditation of 407 technical 
institutes, having suspended 125 institutions considered inoperative. Currently, 282 
institutions are accredited to function in the country.17 
</p>
<p>39. In his report to the General Assembly in 2012 (A/67/310), the Special Rapporteur 
emphasized the emerging consensus on the importance of technical and vocational 
education and its relevance for the realization of the right to quality education, the 
promotion of social justice and sustainable development. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur once again underscores the need for further investments in this type of 
education. Further investment in technical and vocational education could play a central 
role in promoting the skill development needed in today&#8217;s world. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Higher education 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Higher Education Act and its regulations provide the framework for the national 
higher education system. The Constitution recognizes academic freedom. As will be noted 
below, the pursuit, development and transmission of knowledge through research and 
teaching is emerging as a priority, with the recognition of the importance of the autonomy 
of higher education institutions and their responsibilities.

<p>41. As already indicated, both the new legislation and the overall development strategy 
(National Plan for Good Living) emphasize the responsibility of the State in the promotion 
of higher education in Ecuador. Recent legal reforms are a positive step toward the 
recognition of the right to higher education, and contribute to protecting education as a 
public good and devising a system to ensure adherence to adequate quality standards in all 
higher education institutions. The PROMETEO project brings together scientists and 
researchers in research projects in strategic areas in public institutions and universities in 
Ecuador.  
</p>
<p>42. The Ministry of Coordination of Knowledge and Human Talent, created in 2011, has 
a key role in the promotion of higher education and of the acquisition of the knowledge, 
skills and competences so necessary in today&#8217;s knowledge societies. It encourages the 
pursuit of knowledge as a universal good, fostering talents and creative spirit as well as 
human dimensions of development. The Secretariat of Higher Education, Science, 
Technology and Innovation oversees the national system of higher education, with the 
responsibility for the overall design and implementation of higher education policies. The 
Ministry of Coordination of Knowledge and Human Talent promotes the integration of the 
work of various authorities in the field of education (primarily the Ministry of Education 
and the Secretariat of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation), within the 
framework of the overall national development strategy. Despite this commitment to 
enlarge access to higher education,18 important challenges remain. The National Plan for 
Good Living recognized that Ecuador displayed one of the lowest indicators of access to 
higher education among Latin American countries. It also underlined that demographic 
changes and growth of secondary education would further increase the demand for higher 
education.19 The Government reported that the net enrolment rate in higher education in 
2011 was 33.6 per cent for women and 28.3 per cent for men (A/HRC/WG.6/13/ECU/1). 
From 2006 to 2011, access to higher education increased from 9.5 per cent to 17.8 per cent 
among the Afro-Ecuadorian community, and from 6.5 per to 14 per cent among the 
indigenous population (A/HRC/WG.6/13/ECU/1, para. 47). When disaggregated, 
enrolment rates for those with lower income and those belonging to indigenous and Afro-
Ecuadorian communities reflect disadvantages faced by these groups despite efforts to 
address inequalities in education.  
</p>
<p>43. Most students at the higher education level are enrolled in private institutions. As 
such, the Government is determined to expand the public higher education system in order 
to meet its commitments with regard to the expansion of the sector and the promotion of 
access to higher education free of charge.  
</p>
<p>44. The Government reported that there are four new public universities under 
construction. The most advanced project is the University of Arts, which is expected to start 
operating in September 2013. There are also ongoing projects for a National University of 
Education (especially for teacher training), the Regional Amazonia University (dealing with 
environmental issues, renewable energies, geology and biology), and the &#8220;Yachay&#8211;
</p>
<p>Knowledge City&#8211;Research University on Experimental Technology&#8221; (mainly for 
petrochemical sciences, renewable energy, climate change, nanosciences, communication 
and information). All the main research areas of the new institutions are considered to be of 
strategic importance for the national developmental strategy. The Government has initiated 
a thorough process of reforms of higher education, setting high research and academic

<p>standards. International cooperation in the field of higher education is being developed, and 
Ecuador already collaborates with a number of countries in this field. The Government has 
instituted a large number of scholarships for studies abroad in reputable universities.  
</p>
<p>45. Pursuant to the Intercultural Education Act, Ecuador established the General Unified 
Baccalaureate or high school curriculum, at the end of which a new single national entrance 
examination is mandatory to accede to higher education. This examination is intended to 
test skills and critical thinking similar to those achieved at the end of high school level.20 In 
September 2014, universities will receive the first group of students selected through the 
new entrance system. The adoption of a unified system seeks to ensure equal opportunities, 
a merit-based approach and increased transparency in access to higher education. The 
Special Rapporteur commends merit-based access to higher education free of charge, 
recognizes the importance of ensuring a fair and transparent selection process to higher 
levels of education, and underlines the need to permanently review the selection process 
with a view to promoting equal opportunities in education.  
</p>
<p>46. Both the law and policies for higher education provide a detailed framework for 
promoting and monitoring the quality in higher education. In this regard, in line with the 
Higher Education Act, a Council for Evaluation, Accreditation, and Promotion of Quality in 
Higher Education (<i>Consejo de Evaluaci&#243;n. Acreditaci&#243;n y Aseguramiento de la Calidad de 
la Educaci&#243;n Superior</i>) was established and is entrusted with the task to, inter alia, promote 
the external evaluation and accreditation21 of academic institutions in order to ensure 
quality standards (institutions are also required to self-evaluate their quality). In April 2012, 
after investigation and evaluation pursuant to the Higher Education Act, 14 universities had 
their accreditation permanently suspended, as they were found to be handling education as 
a for-profit business, in contravention of the constitutional provisions and with disregard for 
the minimum quality standards. This is commendable as it prevents any engagement in 
education as business and preserves education as a public good. The Government also 
reported that it successfully reintegrated around 40,000 students who were attending the 
suspended universities into different institutions. Other institutions were notified and 
required to take necessary measures to enhance the quality of their programmes. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur has repeatedly underlined the need to promote higher 
quality standards and to monitor both public and private education institutions, sanctioning 
abusive practices. In this regard, he welcomes the efforts undertaken to ensure higher 
quality standards in the Ecuadorian system. 
</p>
<p>48. The lack of human and technical capacity is an obstacle for the further development 
of higher education in Ecuador. The Government aims to expand expenditure in research to 
a proportion of at least 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2013 and reported that spending on research 
and development rose from 0.2 per cent of GDP in 2006 to 0.48 per cent of GDP at the end 
of 2010. The Special Rapporteur applauds the efforts to further invest in research and 
higher education, while noting the importance of continued support, given the limitations 
from which the Ecuadorian university system suffered in  past.

<p><b> IV. Achievements and key challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Promotion of equal opportunities in education 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Government has recognized the central role of education in the promotion of 
equality and social justice, and initiated various efforts to assist marginalized groups. The 
Plurinational Plan for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and Ethnic and Cultural 
Exclusion for 2009&#8211;2012 includes the promotion of the right to education as one of its 
central areas of concern.  
</p>
<p>50. The Government reported some improvements. Enrolment rates in higher education 
rose over the last five years from 9.5 per cent to 17.8 per cent among the Afro-Ecuadorian 
community, and from 6.5 per to 14 per cent among the indigenous population 
(A/HRC/WG.6/13/ECU/1, para. 47). 
</p>
<p>51. As indicated, the emphasis in the new legal framework on an intercultural approach 
to the overall education system has opened an important path for ensuring the inclusion of a 
more culturally sensitive approach to education policies. However, despite additional 
investments reported by the Government in the promotion of quality standards and teacher 
training, the bilingual education system still needs to enhance its financial and technical 
capacity to ensure good quality and culturally adequate education to the various indigenous 
groups in the country.  
</p>
<p>52. Historical disadvantages in the access to all levels of education remain a serious 
concern for Afro-Ecuadorians, the Montubio and indigenous groups. In 2010, indigenous 
peoples were estimated to receive only 5.55 years of schooling (the lowest schooling 
average among all ethnic groups). The Montubio and Afro-Ecuadorians displayed slightly 
higher numbers (7.19 and 8.45 years of schooling, respectively), but were also at a 
disadvantage if compared to the white schooling average (11 years, the highest average) or 
the national average (9.39 years).22 Moreover, despite renewed commitments to eliminate 
illiteracy, 30.2 per cent of indigenous peoples and 16.7 per cent of the Montubio remained 
illiterate in 2012, while the national illiteracy average was 7.9 per cent.23 These stark 
differences seem to reflect the accumulated impact of successive decades of inadequate 
education, particularly for groups living in certain remote regions, and insufficient attention 
to the cultural requirements of these groups. 
</p>
<p>53. Various legal instruments, including the Constitution, call for the promotion of an 
inclusive education system, in line with international human rights standards, ensuring 
opportunities for children with disabilities to be integrated within the mainstream education 
system. A number of initiatives and projects have been undertaken by the Office of the 
Vice-President, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, including the elaboration of 
manuals and guides for persons with disabilities. The Ministry of Education reported that 
there has been a nearly 50 per cent increase in the number of children with disabilities 
enrolled in schools from 2007 to 2012.24 Nevertheless, not all children with disabilities are 
yet able to attend schools or kindergarten due to the lack of human and technical capacity to 
promote their integration into the education system. 
</p>
<p>54. In keeping with Ecuador&#8217;s legal and policy commitments to promote universal 
access and equality of opportunities in education, obstacles which disproportionally affect

</p>
<p>the education of persons living in poverty, Afro-Ecuadorians, the Montubio, indigenous 
peoples and persons with disabilities must be overcome. The disadvantages posed by 
economic deprivation often appear closely associated with all discriminatory patterns, 
affecting the most marginalized groups of society. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Empowerment through education and poverty eradication 
</b></p>
<p>55. In recent years, Ecuador has made unprecedented efforts to combat poverty through 
the comprehensive social policies set out in the Sectoral Agenda for Social Development. 
From 2006 to 2011, the national poverty rate dropped from 37.6 per cent to 28.6 per cent, 
the rural poverty rate fell from 60.6 per cent to 50.9 per cent and the urban poverty rate fell 
from 25.9 per cent to 17.4 per cent. The extreme poverty rate fell from 15.7 per cent in 
2008 to 13.1 per cent in 2010 (A/HRC/WG. 6/13/ECU/1, paras. 17 and 21). The persistent 
challenge of poverty elimination requires an enhanced emphasis on empowering the victims 
of poverty through education.  
</p>
<p>56. The prevalence of poverty appears to be directly related to fewer years of 
schooling.25 The Decennial Education Plan recognized the need to eliminate economic 
barriers for the promotion of universal basic education. The Government is accelerating 
measures for converting temporary schools into good quality regular schools so that 
children in these schools have better educational opportunities. In order to eliminate 
potential economic barriers, the Government, for example, outlawed any demand for 
financial contributions from students for enrolment in public schooling. The Government 
has also invested in the free distribution of school books and materials to students from 
poor households. Despite these important measures, at the local level, a lack of information 
and abusive practices by some schools may still expose families to costs that can hamper 
the schooling of their children. 
</p>
<p>57. Moreover, investments in the expansion and consolidation of the <i>bono de desarollo 
humano</i> (a cash transfer programme for families living in poverty that has been 
implemented for over a decade) appear to have contributed to an increased schooling of 
those living in poverty.26 Additional strategies to promote local development and alleviate 
the financial burden of education for those living in poverty include an initiative to locally 
produce, purchase and distribute school uniforms (&#8220;Weaving Development&#8221; or <i>Hilando el 
Desarollo</i>) and the School Feeding Programme. Both strategies were progressively adapted 
for timely delivery of clothing and food of adequate quality. The Special Rapporteur 
recognizes the importance of all such measures, given the deprivation experienced 
particularly by poor children living in rural settings.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Responding to quality imperatives 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Constitution provides for an institutional mechanism for evaluating quality in 
education (art. 346). The Decennial Education Plan also expresses concern with the 
promotion of quality in education and the establishment of a national system of evaluation 
and accountability of the education system, as its sixth goal. Moreover, the Decennial 
Education Plan includes the development of quality goals relating to improving school 
</p>
<p>  
 25 In 2010, only 27.5 per cent of the Ecuadorian population living in poverty benefited from secondary 
</p>
<p>education and only 10.1 per cent would progress access to higher education.  
 26  According to the Government, a child belonging to a household benefiting from the cash transfer 
</p>
<p>scheme had a 10 per cent higher probability of being enrolled in basic education than a child from a 
similar economic background not benefiting from the transfer.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/35/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>infrastructure, teachers&#8217; qualifications and their working conditions, which are directly 
related to promoting quality in education.  
</p>
<p>59. An important initiative taken with the objective of providing higher quality 
education to marginalized groups is the development of the Millennium Education Units. 
The Units are schools which offer primary and secondary education and which are 
strategically built within economically marginalized areas with the aims of providing high 
quality education to their students and supporting other education establishments also 
located in the surrounding areas. At the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur to 
Ecuador, 14 Units were in place. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to visit a Unit 
and a Replica School, another initiative promoting high quality education in marginalized 
areas that consists of replicating the work of existing well-regarded Units in marginalized 
areas. In these visits, he was able to witness the impressive investments made in the 
creation of these new schools. While welcoming the investment in high quality education 
and recognizing its potential catalytic effect in the deprived areas, the Special Rapporteur 
also cautions that due attention should be paid to ensure that these costly efforts do not end 
up exacerbating disparities in education, with a small group of students lucky to be enrolled 
in these new Units, while the large majority of Ecuadorians continue to attend other, 
underresourced schools. 
</p>
<p>60. A number of initiatives were taken by the Ministry of Education to better monitor 
the quality of education in recent years. Pursuant to the Intercultural Education Act, the 
Ministry of Education initiated the process for the establishment of a National Institute of 
Evaluation in order to undertake an assessment of the Ecuadorian education system. At the 
same time, the Ministry developed a set of standards to measure the quality of the 
educational system. Standards elaborated thus far relate to learning achievements, teaching 
performance and school management. 
</p>
<p>61. The National System of Evaluation and Social Accountability (<i>Sistema Nacional de 
Evaluaci&#243;n y Rendici&#243;n de Cuentas</i>) has carried out evaluations since 2008. Evaluations of 
students, teachers and school directors were carried out on a yearly basis (although in 2012, 
no student evaluation was conducted due to the introduction of a new curriculum).27 
Financial rewards were provided to teachers achieving outstanding performances, while 
teachers with inadequate results were offered additional training.  
</p>
<p>62. The development of a unified evaluation system is crucial for assessing progress 
made and the challenges encountered by the education community. While noting the 
importance of recent efforts to assess student learning achievements in traditional areas of 
knowledge, the Special Rapporteur underlines the need to also invest in the promotion of a 
more holistic assessment of learning achievements, in line with the overall development 
concept of <i>sumak kawsay</i>. 
</p>
<p>63. Lower quality standards in education are often related to the limited technical 
capacity of teachers and poor working conditions. The lack of qualification and motivation 
of teachers was identified as a particular concern in Ecuador. In this regard, a number of 
initiatives are being implemented to improve both the qualification of teachers and their 
working conditions. Since 2009, the Government developed various training initiatives 
through the Integral System of Professional Development in Education. Activities are 
divided into four priorities: initial preparatory training for teachers; training for teachers 
changing their position; continuing education programmes; and pedagogical and 
institutional support. The Government is also developing monitoring initiatives for 
capacity-building. 
</p>
<p>  
 27  Ministerio de Educaci&#243;n (see footnote 10 above), pp. 44&#8211;47. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/35/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>64. The Government also reports that the establishment of a National University of 
Education, as set forth by the Intercultural Education Act (art. 76), would provide teacher 
training and enhance pedagogical qualifications of teachers and directors.  
</p>
<p>65. Lower salaries and limited career progression perspectives were also recognized to 
have contributed to the limited capacity of Ecuadorian teachers in the past. The introduction 
of the new legal framework for education establishing detailed criteria for the recruitment 
and career progression of teachers is promising for improving the status of the teaching 
profession &#8211; especially the review of teachers&#8217; contract situations. Since 2011, for example, 
over 17,000 positions were created, offering the possibility of regularizing teachers who 
had temporary contracts. Teacher salaries were increased significantly since 2010. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur welcomes all these efforts to promote better qualification of 
teachers, their training and to make teaching careers more attractive. The consolidation of 
higher quality standards will require continued long-term investments.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Financing education 
</b></p>
<p>67. The need to ensure an adequate public budget for education on a sustainable basis is 
clearly recognized by recently adopted laws and policies. The Decennial Education Plan 
and the National Plan for Good Living acknowledge that previous decades of inadequate 
and irregular funding have seriously impaired the education system in Ecuador.  
</p>
<p>68. The Constitution establishes that the State must provide adequate funding to public 
education on a regular basis (Article 348). It also indicates that the distribution of resources 
should promote equal opportunities and that the competent authorities should be sanctioned 
if resources are not disbursed in accordance with the law. In its eighteenth transitory 
disposition, the Constitution further establishes that &#8220;[t]he State shall progressively allocate 
public resources from the General Budget of the State for initial primary education and 
secondary education leading to a high school diploma, with annual increments of at least 
[0.5 per cent] of gross domestic product (GDP) until the share amounts to [6 per cent] of 
GDP&#8221;. This same commitment was already expressed in the Decennial Education Plan 
2006&#8211;2015. 
</p>
<p>69. Annual public education budgets increased significantly between 2006 and 2012. 
According to the Ministry of Education, the public education budget in 2006 corresponded 
to 2.9 per cent of GDP, and by 2012 it corresponded to 4.2 per cent of GDP.28 The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the repeated commitments to ensure adequate financial resources to 
education. As he underlined in a previous report to the United Nations General Assembly 
(A/66/269), the fulfilment of State obligations concerning the realization of the right to 
education requires assigning adequate resources for education on a consistent and 
predictable basis, and national legal and policy frameworks ensuring investment in 
education play a crucial role in this regard.  
</p>
<p>70. In this respect, due attention must be paid to equitable budget allocation and 
disbursement, in particular to their impact on the promotion of equal opportunities. For 
example, the repercussions of prevailing socioeconomic disparities in education must be 
looked into on a permanent basis in order to ensure that resources are adequately targeted. 
In this regard, the introduction of a decentralized territorial approach to the organization of 
the education system, as described by the Intercultural Education Act, offers an opportunity

</b></p>
<p>to promote more efficient resource utilization, taking into consideration geographically 
disaggregated social and economic indicators.29  
</p>
<p><b> E. Ensuring participation in education 
</b></p>
<p>71. The recently reformed laws and policy strategies for education in Ecuador highlight 
the importance of the participation of teachers, students, their families and communities in 
the education process. Article 26 of the Constitution establishes the right and responsibility 
of all persons, families and society to participate in the education process. This emphasis 
was notable already in the design and adoption of the Decennial Education Plan. This Plan 
was developed in a participatory process involving discussions among public and private 
school systems, unions and civil society and adopted through a national referendum. The 
active involvement of multiple education actors in the design of this Plan and its adoption 
through a referendum certainly confer a unique legitimacy to this instrument. 
</p>
<p>72. Despite having participated in the formulation of certain education policies, some 
civil society organizations reported having difficulties in the dialogue with authorities 
entrusted with the task of implementing and evaluating education policies. Indigenous and 
rural communities, for example, reported not having being consulted in the process leading 
to the closure of some local school units and the relocation of students. Authorities also 
recognized experiencing problems in the dialogue with some sectors of civil society. 
</p>
<p>73. Teachers and students obviously have a role in the consolidation of any reforms in 
the educational process. The Special Rapporteur recalls the importance of ensuring their 
continued participation, in particular given the impact of the ambitious changes currently 
implemented in the entire Ecuadorian education system. In its recent review of the report of 
Ecuador, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (E/C.12/ECU/CO/3) 
recommended ensuring the broad-ranging involvement of the public and private education 
sectors, including parents and guardians, teachers&#8217; unions and social movements, in the 
implementation of State policies in the field of education. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Violence and education 
</b></p>
<p>74. The prevalence of violence in and around the school system can seriously undermine 
the enjoyment of the right to education of entire communities. It is widely understood that 
violence often leads to poor education performances and school dropouts. The Constitution 
makes the State responsible for eliminating all forms of violence in the education system 
and for safeguarding the bodily, psychological and sexual integrity of students (Article 
347). The Intercultural Education Act includes the protection from violence as one of the 
objectives of education (Article 3).  
</p>
<p>75. Despite these legal provisions, violence both within the school and the home 
remains as an important concern, particularly in urban areas. The National Human Rights 
Institution (<i>Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo</i>) reported having received multiple reports of situations 
of violence and abuse and noted the lack of timely responses and accountability by the State 
in most of the cases. In Quito and Guayaquil respectively, 24.5 per cent and 23.3 per cent of 
children reported being victims of sexual abuse.30  
</p>
<p>76. The Government has adopted a number of initiatives to protect children from 
violence, including the National Plan for the Eradication of Gender-based Violence. The

</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>Ministry of Education is included among the multiple partners to implement the Plan. The 
Special Rapporteur considers that the education system must be well prepared not only to 
contribute in the detection of cases of violence, but also to promote preventive strategies. In 
this regard, effective mechanisms of complaint must be in place and accessible to ensure 
the rapid protection of victims.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> Ecuador accords the highest priory to education, placing it at the heart of all

</b></p>
<p><b>demonstrate this. Aligned with the relevant international human rights standards, 
</b></p>
<p><b>these laws and policies recognize the importance of providing good quality education 
</b></p>
<p><b>at all levels to all Ecuadorians, with equal opportunities. Similarly, the commitments 
</b></p>
<p><b>expressed in national policy plans underline the key importance of enhanced 
</b></p>
<p><b>investment in education for the consolidation of sustained progress.  
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> Above all, the Special Rapporteur would like to commend the constitutional 
foundation of the concept of social interest in education, and the commitment by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government to preserving education as a common good. The constitutional 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognition of the right to education, not only as a human right in and of itself, but 
</b></p>
<p><b>also as essential for the exercise of all other human rights, is also highly appreciable. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Moreover, the right to education is one of the core elements in giving shape to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>concept of </b>&#8220;good living&#8221; (<b><i>sumak kawsay</i>).  
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> The Special Rapporteur applauds that Ecuador was the first country to ratify 
the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights. This bears witness to the importance attached to the protection of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights and their justiciability.  
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The legal and policy frameworks for promoting and protecting the right to 
education appear to have already generated positive results. Remarkable progress has 
</b></p>
<p><b>been made in universalizing access to education, which is now obligatory up to the end 
</b></p>
<p><b>of high school, and free up to the tertiary level. The education budget, which was 
</b></p>
<p><b>clearly insufficient in the past, has been significantly expanded over the last six years. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Coordinated efforts to address the impact of economic obstacles through cash 
</b></p>
<p><b>transfers and the elimination of costs in education appear to have increased enrolment 
</b></p>
<p><b>levels in the poorest sections of society. Public schools have gained better esteem, 
</b></p>
<p><b>attracting more students. Education authorities also accord high priority to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>development of instruments to promote and monitor quality in education.  
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> Despite these notable achievements, more needs to be done to ensure the full 
realization of the right to quality education for all. The entrenched nature of 
</b></p>
<p><b>inequalities, in particular the marginalization of indigenous people, Afro-Ecuadorians 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the Montubio, will require long-term targeted support to these groups. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>consolidation of higher quality standards at both the primary and higher levels of 
</b></p>
<p><b>education will also require continued teacher training programmes and enhanced 
</b></p>
<p><b>investments aimed at improving infrastructure and educational facilities. More 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective implementation of the legal framework of the right to education provides a 
</b></p>
<p><b>solid basis for progress in the years ahead.  
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> Taking into consideration the above and his findings during the mission, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to offer the following recommendations:  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/35/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Elimination of disparities in education, with special attention to 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized groups and children from poor households 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> Ecuador should continue paying special attention to the need for elimination of 
disparities </b>&#8211;<b> especially rural and urban </b>&#8211;<b> in education, which adversely affect 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized groups, such as indigenous peoples, Afro-Ecuadorians, the Montubio, 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons with disabilities, and all those who are victims of poverty. Historical 
</b></p>
<p><b>inequalities can only be uprooted through long-term attention to often interrelated 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic, physical, social and cultural barriers to access to good quality education.  
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> Specific strategies and policies are needed to ensure marginalized groups, in 
particular, indigenous peoples, Afro-Ecuadorians, people living in rural areas and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>poor, are able to realize their right to education. As provided for in article 30 of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention on the Rights of the Child, the State must take appropriate measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that children are able to learn and use the language, religion and customs of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their families. Further investments are needed to guarantee better quality in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>bilingual education system, including strengthening teacher training programmes.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Educational texts and curriculum, teachers must respect and integrate the 
</b></p>
<p><b>intercultural heritage of Ecuador, particularly in areas populated by Afro-Ecuadorian 
</b></p>
<p><b>and indigenous peoples.  Continued attention must be paid to ensure that no costs are 
</b></p>
<p><b>imposed locally on poor families, and where necessary support for transportation to 
</b></p>
<p><b>schools should be provided. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Intensifying normative action for improving the quality of education 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> The drive towards quality education is central to reforms in Ecuador. As such, 
normative action for ensuring quality must be intensified. The implementation of a set 
</b></p>
<p><b>of standards being put in place should receive particular consideration. It should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensured that such standards apply to both public and private schools throughout the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country, as required by the International Labour Organization/United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Recommendation concerning the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Status of Teachers.  
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> As Ecuador further refines its quality monitoring mechanisms, enhanced 
attention must be paid to ensure that the evaluation efforts take into account learning 
</b></p>
<p><b>achievements in a holistic perspective, in line with the overall development concept of 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>sumak kawsay</i>. The assessment of quality should be driven by a promotional spirit, 
</b></p>
<p><b>emphasizing the creation of equal opportunities of education for all those who remain 
</b></p>
<p><b>disadvantaged, rather than further marginalizing individuals and schools that fail to 
</b></p>
<p><b>reach the adopted standards. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> Teachers play a key role in imparting quality learning and promoting higher 
quality education. Any effort to promote quality in education would fail without their 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitment and active participation. As such, teacher training programmes should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be scaled up to ensure that all teachers are offered adequate training opportunities 
</b></p>
<p><b>throughout their professional life. Efforts to make the teaching profession more 
</b></p>
<p><b>attractive, ensuring better work conditions and career perspectives, must continue 
</b></p>
<p><b>receiving attention. The role and responsibilities of teachers should be defined clearly 
</b></p>
<p><b>in keeping with the Recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers, mentioned 
</b></p>
<p><b>above. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> In this context, it would be appropriate if Ecuador would engage with the 
teaching profession to create a code of conduct. Such a code can be valuable to outline 
</b></p>
<p><b>disciplinary measures covering fault such as teacher absenteeism, bearing in mind the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/35/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>responsibilities of teaching profession in line with national and international norms 
</b></p>
<p><b>and standards.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Devoting maximum financial resources for education and their optimal 
</b></p>
<p><b>utilization 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> The responsibility of the State with regard to funding education is well 
described in the Constitution and in other relevant laws. In keeping with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>constitutional provisions and obligations with respect to the right to education, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ecuador should continue to increase public funding to education to reach the target of 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 per cent of gross national product. At the same time, specific efforts must be made to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure the optimal utilization of funds at all levels. In particular, attention must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>paid to assessing the impact of additional resources in the promotion of equal 
</b></p>
<p><b>opportunities in education and of higher quality standards.  
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Increased support to preschool education 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> Additional resources must be directed towards the expansion of the preschool 
education system in Ecuador. The failure to provide education and care at early ages 
</b></p>
<p><b>is often related to unequal opportunities later in life, and could undermine 
</b></p>
<p><b>progression to higher levels of education. The preschool education curriculum and 
</b></p>
<p><b>teaching should also be culturally sensitive and inclusive, and professionals providing 
</b></p>
<p><b>such services should be properly trained.   
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Continued expansion of primary and secondary level education 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilities 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The Government efforts for the expansion of enrolment at the general basic 
and secondary levels and for the creation of opportunities for students belonging to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the lowest social strata to receive education should be intensified. Policies should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>targeted at enrolment of all children in both general basic and secondary level 
</b></p>
<p><b>education, as well as in ensuring their graduation. School infrastructure and 
</b></p>
<p><b>educational facilities for children of indigenous communities and Afro-Ecuadorians 
</b></p>
<p><b>especially need greater support to improve educational outcomes in these 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities. 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> It will also be important to integrate vocational education and training into 
secondary education, within the framework of a professional baccalaureate. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Moreover, an institutionalized system of collaboration between technical and 
</b></p>
<p><b>professional education and industry and enterprises must be promoted, with 
</b></p>
<p><b>pathways for higher technical education for those students with proven competence. 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Enhanced support to technical and higher education  
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> Expanding secondary education in Ecuador will increase the demand for both 
technical and higher education. Support to this area must therefore be enhanced, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>line with national legal and developmental frameworks. This is necessary for 
</b></p>
<p><b>endowing the country with human capital. Investment in research and development 
</b></p>
<p><b>should receive adequate attention. Further efforts to promote quality standards in 
</b></p>
<p><b>higher education institutions are also indispensable.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/35/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> In line with the constitutional provisions and the Higher Education Act, the 
Government should continue to preserve public interest in education, especially 
</b></p>
<p><b>higher education, preventing it from becoming a mere business or commercial 
</b></p>
<p><b>pursuit. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue to take 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislative measures to ensure that education remains a public good, provided in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>public interest, aimed at promoting all of the components of <i>sumak kawsay</i>. 
</b></p>
<p><b> G. Ensuring continuity and participation in policy planning and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> Ecuador should continue to assess the implementation of the Decennial 
Education Plan. Such periodic assessment should be inspired by equitable and 
</b></p>
<p><b>innovative approaches. It should be utilized to guide the development of the new 
</b></p>
<p><b>policy frameworks and education development strategies in line with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>constitutional provisions for the right to education.  
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> Recognizing that education is primarily the responsibility of the State, it is also 
a social responsibility, and non-State actors should also assume their social 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibility, under the overall responsibility of the Government. Students, teachers 
</b></p>
<p><b>and communities all have both rights and responsibilities in the implementation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>education policies. As such, all stakeholders should contribute effectively to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the education reform agenda, which is poised on national 
</b></p>
<p><b>consensus. Similarly, the evaluation of the achievements and the formulation of new 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategies must draw upon the meaningful participation of the various actors of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>education and school community. Continued participation of all minorities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigenous communities as provided for in the Intercultural Education Act is critical 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the successful implementation of ongoing reforms in the education system. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur notes that the Intercultural Education Act itself provides for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishment of participatory mechanisms such as the National Council of Education 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Article 23) and the Plurinational Council of the Bilingual Intercultural Education 
</b></p>
<p><b>System (Article 85), and encourages minorities and indigenous stakeholders to 
</b></p>
<p><b>actively engage with them. 
</b></p>
<p><b> H. Promoting a violence-free, peaceful school environment 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> Ecuador must tackle the phenomenon of violence in schools. Schools should be 
fully involved in the promotion of a protective environment for children, and must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>assisted in promoting such an environment. Combined efforts of public authorities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities, teachers, parents and civil society organizations are needed to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>better protection from violence in and around Ecuadorian schools. In this respect, the 
</b></p>
<p>Special Rapporteur underlines the importance of projects such as &#8220;Safe <b>and Friendly 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cities for All</b>&#8221; being promoted by UN<b> Women. The State must put in place strategies 
</b></p>
<p><b>and tools to promote a favourable and protective learning environment. 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Creating wider awareness of the constitutional right to education  
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> Ecuador has endowed itself with an exemplary framework of the constitutional 
right to education. As mentioned above, this is aligned to the international framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>and deserves to be made better known and publicized, for instance, by way of 
</b></p>
<p><b>research, studies and public debate in key areas. Exchange of experiences at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional or international level on the foundation of the right to education in national 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal systems in a comparative perspective would also be important.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/35/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b> J. Engagement with other United Nations initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> The constitutional and legislative prov</b>isions of Ecuador&#8217;s educational system 
<b>provide an innovative, multi-stakeholder approach that aims to provide students with 
</b></p>
<p><b>an educa</b>tion that seeks to achieve &#8220;good living&#8221; or <b><i>sumak kawsay</i>. These innovations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the experiences in implementing them, can provide important lessons that may 
</b></p>
<p><b>resonate beyond Ecuador. The Special Rapporteur would encourage the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>to engage with other international and regional initiatives to disseminate these lessons 
</b></p>
<p><b>and experiences, including the United Nations Secretary-</b>General&#8217;s Global Initiative 
</p>
<p><b>on Education </b>&#8211;<b> Education First. In particular, the concept of <i>sumak kawsay</i> as a broad 
</b></p>
<p><b>overall goal of education resonates with the promotion in the </b>Global Citizens&#8217; 
</p>
<p><b>Initiative, and may also provide a valuable contribution to ongoing discussions on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sustainable Development Goals described in the Rio+20 outcome document. 
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
