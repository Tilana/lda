<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance visited Switzerland from 9 to 13 January 2006, with the 
principal objective of assessing the situation of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia, as 
well as the policies and measures adopted by the Government to address these phenomena. 
</p>
<p> In the course of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur visited three of the country&#8217;s 
language regions.  He met with federal and cantonal authorities, members and representatives of 
foreign communities and national, ethnic, cultural and religious minorities, representatives of 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other civil society groups, such as representatives 
of political parties, employers, and representatives of trade unions, various religions and the 
media. 
</p>
<p> In drafting the present report, the Special Rapporteur compared the information and 
analyses on the question of racism and xenophobia that he received from the national and 
regional political authorities, members and representatives of the communities concerned, NGOs 
and other civil society groups.  He also took account of the relevant reports and documents that 
were submitted to him by these Swiss civil society groups. 
</p>
<p> At the end of his visit, and on the basis of the information gathered, the Special 
Rapporteur came to the main conclusion that there is a dynamic of racism and xenophobia in 
Switzerland.  He noted, in this regard, that, although Switzerland has competent mechanisms and 
motivated officials with mandates to combat racism, at the national level this reality is not 
recognized and there is no coherent and resolute political and legal strategy against racism and 
xenophobia.  In particular, he observed two underlying causes of this dynamic:  deep-rooted 
cultural resistance within Swiss society to the multiculturalization process, especially where 
persons of south-eastern European and non-European origin are concerned, and the growing 
prevalence of racist and xenophobic stances in political programmes and discourse, particularly 
during elections and various votes. 
</p>
<p> Consequently, his recommendations place emphasis on the following main actions:  
recognition of the dynamic of racism and xenophobia and the expression of the political will to 
combat those phenomena; the need for a national programme of action against racism and 
xenophobia comprising national legislation for this purpose and a cultural and ethical strategy for 
the long-term construction of a multicultural society based on both the recognition and 
promotion of the cultural, ethnic and religious diversity of society, and the promotion of 
interaction and reciprocal knowledge among the various communities that make up Swiss 
society. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Following an invitation from the Swiss authorities, issued in response to his request, the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance visited Switzerland from 9 to 13 January 2006.  The purpose of the visit was 
to assess the situation of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia, as well as the policies and 
measures adopted by the Government to address these phenomena. 
</p>
<p>2. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met, at the federal level, in Bern, with Federal 
Councillors Pascal Couchepin and Christopher Blocher, the State Secretary Michael Amb&#252;hl, 
and several directors and representatives of federal departments and offices.  He also visited the 
cantons of Ticino, Basel and Neuch&#226;tel, where he met with, among others, State Councillors 
Luigi Pedrazzini, Gabriele Gendotti, Guy Morin, Eva Herzog and Bernard Soguel and 
Chancellor Robert Heuss. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also spoke with Ermete Gauro, cantonal delegate for the 
integration of foreigners and for combating racism in Ticino; with Thomas Kessler, director of 
the Office for Integration of Basel City canton; and with Thomas Facchinetti, cantonal delegate 
for foreigners&#8217; affairs in Neuch&#226;tel.  He also met with members of the Federal Commission 
against Racism in Bern and of the Federal Commission for Foreigners in Neuch&#226;tel. 
</p>
<p>4. In the cities that he visited, the Special Rapporteur met with many associations, 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), members and representatives of foreign communities 
and national, ethnic and cultural minorities.  He also talked with representatives of other civil 
society groups, such as political parties, employers, trade unions, the sports world, various 
religions and the media.  At the request of one NGO, the Special Rapporteur went to Solothurn 
to meet with asylum-seekers whose applications had not been considered for formal reasons.  
He also visited, in Basel, a deportation centre and a registration and procedure centre. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Switzerland for its invitation, 
as well as for its availability and openness.  He also wishes to thank the competent services for 
their cooperation, particularly the Service for Combating Racism, for the efficient manner in 
which his visit was organized. 
</p>
<p>6. During the months of preparation preceding his visit, the Special Rapporteur closely 
examined the documents and reports sent to him by the Swiss authorities and NGOs, and 
followed with attention articles in the Swiss and international press dealing with questions 
relating to his mandate. 
</p>
<p>7. In the course of his mission, the Special Rapporteur raised three main questions with all 
the persons with whom he met, concerning (a) the existence of racism, racial discrimination and 
xenophobia in Switzerland; (b) their principal manifestations; and (c) measures and programmes 
adopted by the Government to address these phenomena, or to be carried out in cooperation with 
civil society and the communities concerned.  The Special Rapporteur also asked them to 
transmit to him with any documents that might help him to obtain the most objective and 
complete picture possible and to draft an objective, credible and useful report. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  GENERAL INFORMATION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Linguistic and religious composition 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Swiss Confederation is a multicultural country with four national languages:  
German (spoken by 63.7 per cent of the population), French (20.4 per cent), Italian (6.5 per cent) 
and Rumantsch (0.5 per cent).<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>9. Catholicism and Protestantism are the two traditional religions in Switzerland and, 
according to the latest federal census in 2000, represent 39.98 per cent and 46.32 per cent of the 
Swiss population, respectively. 
</p>
<p>10. According to the 2000 federal census, there are 310,807 Muslims in Switzerland; 
most of them are nationals of the former Yugoslavia or Turks; Arabic speakers account for 
only 5.6 per cent of the Muslims in Switzerland.  The Muslim population is more concentrated 
in predominantly urban cantons than in mountainous or rural cantons.<b>2</b>  Of the total 
number of Muslims in Switzerland, 11.75 per cent have Swiss nationality.  The census also 
indicates that 0.4 per cent of the population is Hindu, 0.3 per cent Buddhist and 0.2 per cent 
Jewish. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Distinctive features of the Swiss federal system 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Swiss political structure is composed of three levels:  the commune, the canton and 
the Confederation.  Switzerland has approximately 2,800 communes in 26 cantons and 
semi-cantons.  Each canton has its own constitution, parliament and courts, and has broad 
powers, particularly in the areas of public education, health, the judicial system and security. 
</p><p>12. One of the distinctive features of Swiss democracy is that it is direct, in that the people 
monitor their elected officials on a continuous basis.  In fact, the electorate has two instruments 
that enable it to take action on a measure decided by the State:  popular referendums, which may 
be optional or mandatory, and popular initiatives.  The optional referendum makes it possible to 
question a law adopted by the Federal Assembly.  Referendums are mandatory in the cases 
enumerated in the Federal Constitution.  Popular initiatives at the federal level enable a citizens&#8217; 
committee to propose amendments to the Federal Constitution. 
</p>
<p>13. The Federal Council is the executive organ of the Swiss Confederation.  It is 
composed of seven members, elected or re-elected for a four-year term, renewable by the 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Federal Assembly, and operates according to the principle of collegiate responsibility.  The 
Council is currently composed of two socialists, two radicals, a Christian democrat and two 
members of the Swiss People&#8217;s Party/Centre Democratic Union (SVP/UDC). 
</p>
<p>14. The Federal Constitution defines the fundamental rights and powers of the 
Confederation.  The Confederation is responsible for foreign policy, defence, customs, monetary 
policy and national legislation on entry into, sojourn in and departure from Switzerland and 
settlement by foreigners, and on the granting of asylum.  In keeping with the principle according 
to which the Confederation has only the powers conferred on it by the Constitution, whereas the 
cantons have general and subsidiary powers, matters that do not fall within the competence of 
the Confederation are dealt with by the cantons. 
</p>
<p>15. The Swiss State system is very distinctive owing to federalism, the sharing of powers 
between the Confederation and the cantons, and the operation of direct democracy.  Problem 
relating to racism can therefore fall within the competence of the Confederation, the cantons or 
even the communes. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p>16. The new Federal Constitution, which entered into force in 2000, contains a provision on 
equality and non-discrimination (art. 8).  By amending the article of the previous Constitution, 
which stated that &#8220;All Swiss are equal before the law&#8221;, article 8, paragraph 1, affirms the equality 
of all &#8220;human beings&#8221; before the law.  Paragraph 2 of the same article declares that &#8220;Nobody 
shall suffer discrimination, particularly on grounds of origin, race, sex, age, language, social 
position, lifestyle, religious, philosophical or political convictions, or because of a physical or 
mental disability.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>17. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
was adopted by the Federal Assembly on 9 March 1993 and entered into force in Switzerland 
on 29 December 1994.  In order to meet the requirements of the convention, article 261 bis, 
which criminalizes discrimination and public incitement to racial hatred, was introduced in the 
Criminal Code.  The authorities have also envisaged the adoption of two additional articles to 
this article concerning the wearing of distinctive signs of a discriminatory attitude based on race 
or the public use of slogans, gestures or forms of salutation with a racist meaning (art. 261 ter) 
and the criminalization of the creation of, or participation in, groups that intend to commit acts 
prohibited under article 261 bis (art. 261 quater).  Moreover, in June 2003 Switzerland 
recognized the individual communications procedure under article 14 of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
</p>
<p>18. Article 261 bis of the Criminal Code remains subject to two paradoxical criticisms.  On 
the one hand, some voices, particularly from the political right, are calling for the abolition of 
this article, which they consider useless or contrary to freedom of expression.  During an official 
mission to Turkey in October 2006, the Swiss Minister of Justice, Christophe Blocher, criticized </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/19/Add.2 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>the use of this article and stated:  &#8220;this article makes me sick&#8221;.<b>3</b>  On his return, the Minister of 
Justice confirmed his intention of amending the anti-racist provision of the Criminal Code.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>19. On the other hand, article 261 bis has been criticized because of its lack of scope and 
because it is difficult to use and apply.  During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the question was 
asked whether racist behaviour in the Swiss army was in the &#8220;public&#8221; domain.  In the context of 
an inquiry to obtain additional evidence, an investigating judge of the Military Tribunal proposed 
that the competent commander should not order the taking of evidence against four of his 
recruits for the offence of racial discrimination (Nazi salutes and racist speech), but should 
subject them to disciplinary measures.  According to him, the accused and the soldiers that 
complained knew each other well and, therefore, the remarks were not made in public in the 
meaning of the law.  The Attorney-General of the Swiss Army rejected this argument and 
pointed out that &#8220;the practice of military justice in racial discrimination cases is no different from 
the practice of civil criminal justice, in particular that of the Swiss Federal Tribunal&#8221;.<b>5</b>  In 
accordance with article 171 (c) of the Military Criminal Code, the content of which is identical to 
article 261 bis, military proceedings are still pending. 
</p>
<p>20. According to statistics provided by the Federal Commission against 
Racism, 212 complaints were lodged between 1995 and 2002 with the competent authorities 
through the application of article 261 bis.  In 48 per cent of the cases, the investigating 
authorities, after a brief examination of the facts, did not institute judicial proceedings, 
suspended the proceedings or did not consider the complaints.  In the other cases, the complaints 
were considered in the context of substantive law and a judgement was handed down.  In some 
80 per cent of these cases, the authorities found the accused person guilty.  These decisions and 
judgements were handed down by the prosecution authorities or courts of various instances; 
certain cases were brought before higher judicial bodies.<b>6</b> 
21. New article 386 of the Criminal Code, which entered into force on 1 January 2006, 
created the legal basis for the Confederation&#8217;s measures to stop reprehensible acts and prevent 
crime, and to establish and support organizations that pursue such objectives. 
22. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination considered three reports 
submitted by Switzerland to its fifty-second and sixtieth sessions in 1998 and 2002, respectively, 
and made a number of recommendations to the authorities (CERD/C/304/Add.44 and 
CERD/C/60/CO/14).  Other institutions that have also considered questions relating to racism

<p>and xenophobia in Switzerland include the Council of Europe and the European Commission 
against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI).<b>7</b>  It should be noted that, when it acceded to the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Switzerland 
made two reservations to article 2, paragraph 1 (a), stating that &#8220;Switzerland reserves the right to 
apply its legal provisions relating to the admission of foreigners to the Swiss labour market&#8221;, and 
also to article 4, concerning freedom of association. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Recent votes on immigration and asylum 
</b></p>
<p>23. Since 1970, 22 federal votes have dealt with foreigners or questions relating to asylum.  
A list of these votes is contained in the annex to this document. 
</p>
<p>24. In September 2004, a vote was taken on two issues:  facilitated naturalization for young 
second-generation foreigners and acquisition of citizenship for third-generation foreigners.  
During this campaign, some people condemned the &#8220;disinformation attempting to link facilitated 
naturalization with delinquency&#8221;.  Indeed, sharp criticism was levelled at the political campaigns 
launched by the Swiss People&#8217;s Party/Centre Democratic Union (SVP/UDC) on this subject and, 
inter alia, posters such as one showing the hands of persons of colour trying to catch Swiss 
passports in a basket or a poster showing Osama Bin Laden on a Swiss identity card with the 
subtitle &#8220;don&#8217;t be fooled&#8221;.<b>8</b>  The two issues were rejected. 
25. On 24 September 2006, two issues were submitted for a vote in Switzerland concerning 
the amendment of the Asylum Act and the Federal Act on Foreign Nationals.  During his 
mission, the Special Rapporteur followed with great interest the various debates on these votes, 
which involve matters directly related to his mandate. 
</p>
<p>26. With regard to the amendment of the law on asylum, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention 
was drawn, in particular, to the position of certain NGOs that denounced the amendment of the 
law as incompatible with Switzerland&#8217;s international obligations.  Among other things, the 
NGOs criticized: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The refusal of the authorities to consider requests for asylum if the applicant cannot 
furnish, within 48 hours, a passport or an identity card (birth certificates or driving 
licences will no longer be recognized as valid);

in the State of origin, will be subject to any risk, as soon as the first decision is taken 
to deport the person; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The exclusion of social assistance for all applicants who have been rejected; 
&#8226; Incarceration for up to two years for persons resisting return.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>27. Moreover, the amendment of the law eliminates the notion of &#8220;honourable motive&#8221; for 
persons who assist asylum-seekers whose requests have not been considered for formal reasons 
(<i>requ&#233;rants d&#8217;asile frapp&#233;s de non-entr&#233;e en mati&#232;re</i>)<b>10</b> and those whose requests for asylum 
have been dismissed.  Thus, on the one hand, whoever &#8220;facilitates the entry, departure or illegal 
sojourn of a foreigner or takes part in preparations for this purpose&#8221; is liable to a penalty of 
imprisonment for up to one year and a fine of 20,000 Swiss francs.  On the other hand, any 
person acting within the framework of an association or group of persons who, even for 
humanitarian reasons or for the purpose of protecting human rights, provide assistance to persons 
whose requests have been dismissed, are liable to a penalty of imprisonment for up to five years 
and a fine of up to 500,000 Swiss francs.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>28. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) expressed 
serious concern at certain aspects of the law, particularly the provisions restricting access to 
asylum for persons without valid travel or identity documents.  The 1951 Convention relating to 
the Status of Refugees specifically provides for refugees who may have had to flee their country 
without being able to obtain valid travel or identity documents.  This Swiss legal provision, 
which has been called one of the &#8220;strictest in Europe&#8221;, seems to ignore the case of persons 
fleeing for their lives who have not been able to obtain such documents.<b>12</b>  The Special 
Rapporteur takes note of the fact that Swiss law provides for exceptions and hopes that courts 
take account of this in their jurisprudence.

</p>
<p>29. With regard to the revision of the law on foreigners, the Special Rapporteur has taken 
note of the position of opponents to the amendment who have criticized the discriminatory 
treatment of foreigners who do not belong to a European country, the toughening of the rules on 
family reunification with regard to foreigners of non-European origin, the obligation to live 
together (and the possible effects on women of non-European origin) or the proliferation of 
measures making it possible to place foreigners who refuse to leave Switzerland in detention for 
up to two years. 
</p>
<p>30. The two issues obtained a majority in all cantons.<b>13</b> 
<b>II.  ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION BY THE AUTHORITIES 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Swiss Government recently submitted the fourth, fifth and sixth periodic reports of 
Switzerland to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.  These reports 
contain a detailed description of the various problems relating to migration policy, as well as 
police violence and other issues, for example, the question of the status of the Travellers. 
</p>
<p>32. As the Federal Council pointed out in a decision of 23 February 2005, the fight against 
racism is a cross-cutting task for which all offices of the Confederation are responsible.  Several 
federal departments deal with matters that are directly or indirectly linked to the subject of 
racism and xenophobia.  In addition to the specialized service to combat racism, the Federal 
Department of the Interior includes the Federal Office for Cultural Affairs, which is responsible 
for the Travellers,<b>14</b> and the Federal Office for Equality between Women and Men whose 
mandate, which derives from the article on equality in the Federal Constitution and equality 
legislation, is to combat all forms of sex-based discrimination, direct or indirect.  The 
Department of Justice and Police includes, inter alia, the Federal Office for Migration,<b>15</b> which 
deals with questions relating to the right of foreigners and the right of asylum, and the Federal 
Police, which deals with all violent forms of extremism, including rightist extremism, as a threat 
to the State.  At the federal and cantonal levels, various federal departments have units or focal 
points that deal with questions of discrimination and produce information materials for 
foreigners and migrants.  The Directorate for Public International Law of the Department of 
Foreign Affairs is responsible for preparing periodic reports under article 9 of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.

</p>
<p><b>A.  Immigration and integration policy 
</b></p>
<p>33. Swiss migration policy is based in theory on the needs of the job market.  In 1991, 
Switzerland opted for a &#8220;three-circle&#8221; immigration policy:  the first circle was composed of the 
countries of the European Union before enlargement, and the countries of the European Free 
Trade Association; the second, of countries with similar economies and ideologies, such as the 
United States of America, Canada and New Zealand; the last circle being the rest of the world.  
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination considered &#8220;the conception and 
effect of this policy to be stigmatizing and discriminatory, and therefore contrary to the 
principles and provisions of the Convention&#8221; (CERD/C/304/Add.44, para. 6).  This &#8220;three-circle 
model&#8221; was officially abandoned in October 1998 and replaced by a &#8220;binary admission system&#8221; 
established by the Federal Council (see CERD/C/351/Add.2, para. 270).  This system is based on 
Switzerland&#8217;s conclusion with the European Union and the European Free Trade Association, 
within the framework of close bilateral relations, of an agreement on the free movement of 
persons.  It should be noted, however, that the Federal Act on the Temporary and Permanent 
Residence of Foreigners, which concerned all foreigners, has been replaced by the new Federal 
Act on Foreign Nationals, which deals with foreigners from countries that are not members of 
the European Union.  This binary admission system, which provides for two different legal 
regimes depending on the person&#8217;s origin, is considered by some, including Swiss anti-racist 
circles, to be highly discriminatory and a perpetuation of the spirit of the &#8220;three-circle model&#8221; in 
Swiss legislation.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>34. With regard to integration, every year Switzerland allocates 14 million Swiss francs for 
the integration of the migrant population in accordance with article 25 (a) of the Federal Act on 
the Temporary and Permanent Residence of Foreigners and the Ordinance on the Integration of 
Foreigners.  Article 3 and article 14 (a) of the Ordinance indicate that integration efforts and 
measures are the common task of the cantons and the Confederation. 
</p>
<p>35. Integration is understood as a cross-cutting task involving all official institutions, each 
participating in its area of competence.  The Federal Office for Migration coordinates the 
integration measures adopted by the federal offices, guarantees exchanges of views and 
experience with the cantons and the cities, and finances integration measures for refugees and 
foreigners.  At the cantonal level, delegates for integration are also active in efforts to combat 
discrimination, which is considered as a central objective in the context of promoting integration. 
</p><p>36. The naturalization of foreigners in Switzerland involves three procedures that are carried 
out at the federal, cantonal and communal levels.  The procedures are governed by cantonal law; 
however, there may be variations depending on the commune.  Naturalization procedures have

<p><b>B.  Specialized bodies and commissions 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Federal Commission against Racism 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Federal Council established the Federal Commission against Racism 
on 23 August 1995 with a view to implementing the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  In its message concerning Switzerland&#8217;s accession to this 
Convention and on the relevant amendment of its criminal law of 2 March 1992, the Federal 
Council noted that the fight against racial discrimination is a task that involves pedagogical, 
sociological, cultural, federalist and legal aspects, as well as aspects of development policy and 
migration policy, and it mandated the Commission to &#8220;concern itself with racial discrimination, 
to work towards promoting better understanding between persons of different races, colours, 
origins, ethnic or national backgrounds or different religions and to combat all forms of direct or 
indirect racial discrimination, attaching particular importance to effective prevention&#8221;.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>39. The Federal Commission against Racism is composed of 19 experts appointed 
<i>ad personam</i> by the Federal Council, representing religious communities, minorities, NGOs, 
social partners as well as cantonal directors of public education and the police.  Interest groups, 
the sexes, languages, regions and age groups should, in principle, be equitably represented in the 
Commission. 
</p>
<p>40. The Federal Commission against Racism has, among others, the tasks of raising 
awareness, making recommendations, issuing opinions, and providing advice and support to 
persons who consider themselves to be victims of racial discrimination, and provides mediation 
services in cases of conflict.<b>20</b>

</p>
<p>41. In its discussion with the Special Rapporteur, the Federal Commission against Racism 
raised several important points.  It believes that there is no coherent policy concerning racism in 
Switzerland and that measures taken in this area are isolated and divided among the various 
institutions.  The Commission also referred to the lack of political will in this respect, the decline 
in resources available to actors involved in combating racism, xenophobia and the propagation of 
extremist ideas, and to the limited scope of, and difficulties in implementing, article 261 bis. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Federal Commission for Foreigners 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Federal Commission for Foreigners, established in 1970, is composed 
of 30 members of which half are of foreign nationality, elected by the Federal Council and, at the 
administrative level, attached directly to the Federal Department of Justice and Police.  The 
Commission deals with social, economic, cultural, political, demographic and legal questions 
with a view to encouraging the coexistence of foreign nationals settled in Switzerland and the 
Swiss population.  The Commission takes positions on questions of migration and gives its 
opinion to the Federal Council on questions of integration policy.  It defines integration as &#8220;the 
will of foreigners to become integrated in the host society and the openness of Swiss society to 
the foreign population&#8221;.<b>21</b>  The Commission also administers an integration loan, established 
in 2001, to support projects in different areas.<b>22</b> 
43. During his discussion with the Federal Commission for Foreigners, the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s attention was drawn to the very restrictive nature of naturalization in Switzerland.  
One of the members of the Commission pointed out that article 16 of the 1931 Federal Act on 
the Temporary and Permanent Residence of Foreigners refers to &#8220;foreign overpopulation&#8221;, which 
would indicate that any foreign presence is considered excessive by the law.<b>23</b>  The text of the 
amended Act on Foreign Nationals no longer refers to &#8220;foreign overpopulation&#8221; but to 
&#8220;sociodemographic evolution&#8221;.  In spite of this semantic progress, the Commission believes that 
the new text is more restrictive than the one currently in force.  According to the Commission, 
the agreements on the free movement of persons between the European Union and the European 
Free Trade Association have had the result that this article no longer applies to nationals from 
these countries, who account for 60 per cent of the foreigners in Switzerland.  In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur noted that the situation is strangely reminiscent of the old &#8220;three-circle&#8221; 
immigration policy, which was considered discriminatory by the Committee on the Elimination 
of Racial Discrimination.  Here, there are only two circles:  the Swiss, the Europeans and &#8220;close&#8221; 
countries (such as the United States or Canada) and the &#8220;others&#8221;, or the rest of the world.

</p>
<p><b>3.  Service for Combating Racism 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Service for Combating Racism, which is part of the Department of the Interior, is the 
Confederation&#8217;s representative in matters concerning the fight against racism, anti-Semitism, 
xenophobia and rightist extremism.  The activities of the Service include coordination and 
encouragement of initiatives to prevent and combat these phenomena at the federal, cantonal and 
communal levels. 
</p>
<p>45. The Service was established on 21 February 2001 by the Federal Council with a view to 
coordinating and networking internal administrative measures, and cooperating with cantonal 
and communal partners and representatives of civil society.  On the same day, the Federal 
Council decided to create a fund for projects against racism and in favour of human rights, with 
15 million Swiss francs to support projects in these areas (2001-2005).  On 23 February 2005, 
the Federal Council decided to continue to support the work of the Service and third-party 
projects by allocating to them, beginning in 2006, an annual amount of 1.1 million Swiss 
francs.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Other relevant departments and services 
</b></p>
<p>46. During discussions with representatives of offices and departments of special interest to 
his mandate, the Special Rapporteur gathered the following information concerning measures to 
combat racism and promote integration: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; According to the Office for Equality between Women and Men, women of foreign 
origin are more likely to be employed in precarious jobs and have lower-than-average 
salaries; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Federal Office for Statistics informed the Special Rapporteur that there were no 
statistics or indicators for racism.  The representative of the Office stated that Swiss 
society was beginning to become stratified by ethnic origin; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The lack of a specific study on racial discrimination by the Federal Office of 
Public Health; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In the area of employment, termination is abusive when it is given by one party 
&#8220;because of a quality inherent in the personality of the other party&#8221; (article 336 of the 
Code of Obligations).  Nevertheless, the State Secretary for Economic Affairs has 
stated that he has no information on this subject; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Primary school is accessible to all children, even children whose parents are in an 
illegal situation. 
</p>
<p>

 page 15 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>47. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s discussions with various cantonal and federal 
departments, in particular the Federal Office for Migration and the departments of justice and 
police, it was pointed out that crime in Switzerland was perpetrated mainly by foreigners, 
particularly asylum-seekers, that 90 per cent of requests for asylum do not meet admissibility 
criteria, and that it would therefore be necessary to adopt measures to distinguish &#8220;bad&#8221; 
asylum-seekers from &#8220;good&#8221; ones.  Moreover, in a letter to the Special Rapporteur, the Federal 
Office for Migration, states that &#8220;the return of individuals to certain countries of origin is often 
very difficult, or even impossible, when the foreigner concerned chooses not to cooperate with 
the authorities.  Such problems are currently encountered by a large number of persons from 
African countries.  For this reason, they are likely to be subjected to coercive measures and are 
comparatively often placed in detention pending deportation.  However, this state of affairs does 
not have any racial connotations&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>48. The delegates for integration who met with the Special Rapporteur stressed the 
importance of the policy for promoting the integration of foreigners, and noting in this regard 
that foreigners should be allowed to vote and stand for election. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur noted with interest the initiatives undertaken by certain cantonal 
police forces, particularity in Basel City, where the police authorities and associations 
representing black communities have begun meetings for dialogue and exchange of views.  
Such exchanges have reportedly improved reciprocal knowledge, reduced prejudice and 
misunderstandings, and fostered better contacts between the police and these communities.  The 
Special Rapporteur notes that the encouragement of similar intercultural dialogues is one way to 
prevent the deterioration of social relations and to avoid misunderstandings and errors arising 
from ignorance and lack of comprehension of others. 
</p>
<p>50. In Basel, the Special Rapporteur visited a deportation centre and a centre for registering 
applicants at the border.  He noted that, while almost all detainees in this deportation centre were 
black, there were few blacks in the registration centre.  According to the explanation given by 
the authorities, &#8220;the high proportion of Africans in the Basel deportation centre can be explained 
by an enforcement problem.  Persons whose countries have concluded bilateral return 
agreements or who are considered to be willing to cooperate cannot be held in deportation 
centres.  Bilateral return agreements provide for material assistance for the return, which gives 
individuals an incentive to return to their countries without resistance; there are no such 
agreements with African countries.  This is why a high number of Africans are held in 
deportation centres&#8221;.  This explanation is contained in a letter from the Service for Combating 
Racism, entitled &#8220;Additional information on the subject of remedies&#8221;, which was sent to the 
Special Rapporteur following his visit. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION BY OTHER ACTORS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Civil society 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur met with various components of civil society, including 
representatives of foreign communities, religious communities, NGOs, associations, 
asylum-seekers, trade unions and employers.  He therefore had an opportunity to hear real-life </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>testimonies from members of the communities and to verify the information provided by Swiss 
and foreign institutions concerning the situation of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia 
in Switzerland. 
</p>
<p>52. During his meetings, the Special Rapporteur collected several testimonies concerning 
racist and xenophobic acts on the part of the population, particularly on the part of State bodies, 
such as the police.<b>25</b>  The information submitted indicated the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A feeling of great anxiety in the black community in Switzerland owing to, on the 
one hand, the general rise in discrimination and, on the other, serious and recurrent 
acts - particularly by the police - of racism against blacks, although there are only 
37,000 black persons - or 0.5 per cent of the population - in Switzerland; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The high number of racial profiling incidents targeting certain groups of foreigners, 
particularly blacks; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A feeling of growing Islamophobia in Swiss society, according to most of the Muslim 
community representatives with whom the Special Rapporteur met; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The existence of old and new forms of anti-Semitism in Switzerland, according to the 
Jewish community leaders with whom the Special Rapporteur met; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The existence of discriminatory practices in stations and airports, particularly Zurich 
airport, including racial profiling, physical violence and verbal abuse, as well as 
violent expulsions of persons tied to wheelchairs, with helmets and diapers; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The negative trend in Swiss domestic legislation towards restricting the rights of and 
reducing protection for, foreigners, or criminalizing foreigners; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The toughening of social relations and the rise of racist and xenophobic discourse by 
political parties; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The general increase of acts and manifestations of racial discrimination<b>26</b> felt by 
members of all foreign communities and national minorities; 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>25
</b>  Many reports by Swiss and international NGOs on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in Switzerland are available.  These include 
the 2005 report of Amnesty International, Switzerland (http://web.amnesty.org/report2005/ 
che-summary-fra); the 2004 report of Observatoire du racisme, Association contre le racisme 
(ACOR), SOS Racisme, 30 pp.; Ramdane Babadji, <i>Lutte contre le racisme:  o&#249; va la Suisse?</i>,

<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The real suffering of the victims and the difficulty of lodging complaints, which is 
often a long and costly procedure that is not always successful and does not guarantee 
the restoration of the rights and respect for the dignity of the victim; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The need expressed by civil society for a national human rights institution; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The lack of mechanisms for an independent investigation into allegations of police 
violence. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur took note of reports concerning the treatment of persons whose 
applications had not been considered for formal reasons.  Such treatment allegedly includes 
physical and verbal abuse, humiliation, refusal to provide medical treatment, body searches and 
the undressing of the victim in public without regard for the sex of the persons present, theft of 
money and property by public authority officials, unhealthy accommodations, detention in public 
toilets, refusal to accept complaints lodged by the victims, etc.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p>54. Some associations have denounced discriminatory practices in the methods used by 
the Swiss authorities in matters relating to asylum, particularly with regard to requests from 
West African asylum-seekers.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>55. Representatives of the Union of Swiss Employers (Schweizerischer Arbeitgeberverband/ 
Union Patronale Suisse) said that the question of racism did not arise at the level of enterprises, 
and referred to the positive stance taken in votes on foreigners and facilitated naturalization.  
They also pointed to the existence, in certain collective agreements, of articles on the protection 
of the person and on non-discrimination against workers. 
</p>
<p>56. Representatives of trade unions talked about discrimination in hiring foreigners and in the 
availability of training places for foreigners, particularly young people, based on their origin and 
social status.  They consider that worker protection in Switzerland is particularly poor, especially 
in cases of discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Political parties 
</b></p>
<p>57. Switzerland&#8217;s policy towards foreigners and its asylum policy continue to be the subject 
of lively political debates.  The following paragraphs provide a general survey of the position of 
the main parties in Switzerland. 
</p>

<p>58. The Swiss Liberal Party (Liberale Partei der Schweiz/Parti lib&#233;ral suisse; LPS/PLS) is 
calling for the prosecution of asylum-seekers who commit criminal offences and for greater 
flexibility in particularly difficult humanitarian situations for which exceptional measures 
(&#8220;humanitarian permit&#8221;) should be taken.  The measures to be taken include:  the speedier and 
more systematic execution of return decisions, graduated social assistance, subject to established 
justification for extending the stay of the person in question and, under certain conditions, 
limited work permits.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>59. For the Christian Democratic Party (Christlich-demokratische Volkspartei/Parti 
d&#233;mocratique chr&#233;tien; CVP/PDC), the declared guiding principle is to control immigration in 
Switzerland while reducing crime committed by foreigners.  The Party advocates the facilitation, 
under certain conditions, of naturalization for young foreigners, the maintenance of the 
prohibition on work by asylum-seekers for three months, the reduction of the time limit for 
lodging an appeal in asylum procedures, and support for expulsion orders for persons residing in 
the country illegally.<b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>60. The Swiss People&#8217;s Party/Centre Democratic Union (Schweizerische Volkspartei/Union 
d&#233;mocratique du Centre; SVP/UDC) is calling for a tougher policy towards foreigners, 
particularly asylum-seekers.  The Party advocates, inter alia, the more effective surveillance of 
Switzerland&#8217;s borders, the placement of asylum-seekers in collective shelters pending the 
authorities&#8217; decision and the execution of this decision, the reduction of time limits for 
procedures, appeals and re-evaluations of asylum procedures, as well as the immediate expulsion 
of asylum-seekers who are known criminals, or their internment pending their expulsion.  This 
Party&#8217;s political campaigns and posters have often been criticized and denounced by civil society 
organizations, the Federal Commission against Racism, the media and members of foreign 
communities and minorities as advocating racist and xenophobic ideas. 
</p>
<p>61. For the Freethinking Democratic Party of Switzerland/Radical Democratic Party of 
Switzerland (Freisinnige Demokratische Partei Schweiz/Parti radical-d&#233;mocrate Suisse; 
FDP/PRD), integration includes &#8220;respect and recognition of the norms and habits of the 
indigenous population&#8221;.  Foreigners should be willing to integrate and the Swiss population 
should be open to that wish.<b>31</b>  According to the Radical Democratic Party&#8217;s programme, the

<p>the limitation of immigration in accordance with the objective of integration.<b>32</b>  The position of 
the Radical Democratic Party on the right to asylum is not as clear-cut as that of the Christian 
Democratic Party or the Centre Democratic Union.  For the Radical Democratic Party, 
&#8220;despite the political implications of the asylum policy, asylum in Switzerland accounts for 
only 7 per cent of total immigration.  The exaggerated problems that this policy causes are the 
result of difficulties in implementing legally adopted decisions&#8221;.<b>33</b> 
</p>
<p>62. For the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland or the Swiss Socialist Party 
(Sozialdemokratische Partei der Schweiz/Parti socialiste suisse; SPS/PSS), the &#8220;establishment of 
quotas for foreigners&#8221; (<i>contingentement des personnes &#233;trang&#232;res</i>) reflects the policy of fear 
surrounding migration policy.  That policy is viewed as a bureaucratic approach to the global 
quantitative management of the number of foreign workers, which is not adapted to the changing 
needs of regional economies.  The Party denounces &#8220;the combination of vague legislation and 
the broad discretionary powers accorded to the cantonal police for foreigners&#8221;, which opens the 
way to unequal treatment and arbitrariness.  Moreover, it states that &#8220;the attitude of the 
authorities towards migrants has largely contributed to the population&#8217;s adoption of a distrustful 
approach towards persons who do not hold Swiss passports&#8221;.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>63. The Green Party of Switzerland (Gr&#252;ne Partei der Schweiz/Parti &#233;cologiste suisse) has 
taken a clear position against the toughening of legislation on foreigners and the right of asylum.  
It considers the tightening of Swiss legislation discriminatory and in violation of the basic human 
rights of asylum-seekers.  With several other organizations, the Green Party launched a 
referendum against the Act on Foreign Nationals, which it called a &#8220;discriminatory and 
segregationist law that leaves the way completely open for arbitrary acts on the part of the 
administration&#8221;.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>64. Switzerland has adopted general laws concerning respect for and the promotion of human 
rights.  However, the lack of comprehensive national legislation against racism, racial 
discrimination and xenophobia poses a major obstacle to the effectiveness of its fight against 
racism.  One illustration of this situation is the relative lack of legislation or remedies against the 
recurring manifestations of discrimination in employment and housing, which may be considered 
symbolic social indicators of discrimination.

</p>
<p>65. Moreover, neither civil nor criminal law in Switzerland grants an association the right to 
bring legal proceedings on behalf of or for victims of racism, contrary to the situation in other 
countries.  However, in certain cantons, a request may be submitted to a judge, who decides on a 
case-by-case basis.  This gap in Swiss legislation has long been criticized by civil society and the 
Federal Commission against Racism. 
</p>
<p>66. Moreover, Switzerland is one of the rare European countries that does not have a 
national institution devoted entirely to human rights, in spite of the existence, for the past five 
years, of a parliamentary initiative calling for the establishment of a federal human rights 
commission. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Swiss authorities, at both the federal and cantonal 
levels, have recognized the existence of problems related to racism and xenophobia, but that they 
have considered that these problems are not really serious, or that they are only a &#8220;secondary 
phenomenon&#8221;.<b>36</b>  He noted that this assessment varies from department to department and 
according to the hierarchical position of the person questioned:  persons who are closest to 
social realities more openly acknowledge the existence of manifestations of racism, racial 
discrimination and xenophobia; this acknowledgement tends to become more diffuse at 
higher levels in the hierarchy.  Most of the members of foreign communities and national 
minorities with whom the Special Rapporteur met stated, often with great emotion, that they 
experienced racism and discrimination on a daily basis and that there was an overall atmosphere 
of xenophobia; they expressed a feeling of loneliness within the population and their fear of 
certain institutions, particularly the police.  The most affected communities and groups seem, at 
present, to be blacks, Jews, Travellers, asylum-seekers and Muslims or persons of Muslim 
culture. 
</p>
<p>68. Like all modern societies, Swiss society is faced with a process of far-reaching 
multiculturalism.  While the previous waves of migration came from European countries, the 
new migrations come from regions of Eastern Europe and from other geocultural regions and 
areas of the world.  Swiss society is therefore tending to be more marked than in the past by a 
higher degree of cultural, ethnic and religious diversity.  In Switzerland, as elsewhere in Europe, 
the challenge to national identity posed by this new diversity is a source of identity-related 
tensions.  The political, legal and cultural awareness, recognition and treatment of these tensions 
are crucial factors in the construction of a harmonious multicultural society.  However, 
Switzerland illustrates, in a particularly striking manner, one of the underlying causes of racism 
and xenophobia, namely the politicization of identity-related tensions that is embodied not only 
by the existence, according to civil society, of political parties with racist and xenophobic 
platforms and with the ability to implement them through government alliances, but also the 
gradual infiltration of these platforms into the political programmes of democratic parties.  This 
most often takes the form of legislation and policies that approach immigration and asylum 
issues solely from a security point of view and criminalize immigrants and asylum-seekers. 
</p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur noted, both in political discourse and in political platforms, as 
well as in some of the media, the growing emphasis on rhetoric based on the &#8220;defence of national 
identity&#8221; and the &#8220;threat of the foreign presence&#8221;.  The electoral success of these platforms 
reflects the existence in society of a current of political opinion that promotes the defence of 
identity vis-&#224;-vis immigration and fosters the emergence of a culture of xenophobia in some 
segments of society - particularly rural society - which has been confirmed by the results of 
certain recent votes.  Questions relating to the place of foreigners in society, immigration and 
asylum are not treated as a matter of priority on the basis of the relevant international human 
rights instruments but, increasingly, only on the basis of two criteria:  the security imperative and 
the defence of national identity. 
</p>
<p>70. Historically, the Swiss authorities have linked foreign immigration to the job market.  
This is reflected in the text of laws on the granting of residence permits.  The Special Rapporteur 
notes that these successive waves of workers have been tolerated and later accepted in the 
country as long as there was no deterioration in the economy and the job market.  The most 
recent influxes of foreigners in Switzerland have come at a time of a relative increase in 
unemployment and a decrease in growth owing to international factors and to the Swiss 
economy.  These new arrivals, including refugees and asylum-seekers, have been singled out by 
certain populist parties as responsible for rising unemployment or the State debt. 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur notes with regret the tendency, which began several years ago, to 
criminalize foreigners, asylum-seekers and refugees in Switzerland.  This is done by the 
enactment of laws, regulations and decrees that place these groups of persons in a vulnerable 
legal situation, resulting in their social marginalization and cultural stigmatization. 
</p>
<p>72. In this context, the Special Rapporteur notes the political authorities&#8217; lack of unity and 
a coherent national policy concerning the question of racism and xenophobia.  The general 
picture, which is one of significant progress and serious regression and is therefore marked by 
contrast and contradiction, seems to reflect the existence of internal tensions and profound 
disagreements among the political authorities.  Indeed, on the one hand, the Swiss Confederation 
has adopted anti-discriminatory norms, even if there is room for progress in this area, and 
finances projects to combat discrimination and racism.  On the other, it constantly reinforces its 
legislative restrictions against foreigners, refugees and asylum-seekers.  In doing so, it sends the 
population the message that foreigners are stigmatized and criminalized, thereby reinforcing 
prejudices and increasing discrimination and xenophobia within society.  This tends to legitimize 
acts of racism and xenophobia, both on the part of State bodies and in everyday social relations.  
The Special Rapporteur noted significant questions in this regard within certain State institutions 
and in civil society.  Thus, an eminent official of one of these institutions stated in a letter 
addressed to the Special Rapporteur following his visit that &#8220;significant efforts have been made 
over the past few years to integrate foreigners.  However, paradoxically, rarely has speech 
reflecting distrust, and even contempt, towards them been so crude, nauseating and so 
widespread and echoed&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur considers that racist and xenophobic discourse has left its mark 
on people&#8217;s minds, even within the State apparatus.  The leitmotif of foreigners as criminals, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>repeatedly revived on the occasion of many votes, punctuated by political discourse and 
exaggerated by certain media, increasingly penetrates the collective mentality and gives 
legitimacy not only to identity-related tensions hostile to cultural diversity but also to 
discriminatory and arbitrary behaviour by members of certain State bodies. 
</p>
<p>74. The establishment of the Service for Combating Racism and the Fund for Projects against 
Racism and in favour of Human Rights within the Federal Department of the Interior reflects a 
certain degree of political will to implement the Durban Programme of Action adopted by the 
World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Related Intolerance.  The 
establishment of the Federal Commission against Racism and the Federal Commission for 
Foreigners reflects a desire to involve civil society in this undertaking.  The personal 
commitment and high degree of motivation and sensitivity regarding the question of racism of 
officials and staff of the Service for Combating Racism and the members of these commissions 
demonstrate the existence in the State apparatus of motivated staff capable of implementing, 
with the appropriate means, any declared political will to combat racism and xenophobia.  
However, two significant factors undermine this political will:  the absence of political 
consensus at the highest level, demonstrated by repeated proposals by political parties 
represented in the Government to abolish or marginalize these services and mechanisms, and 
by the fact that these services and mechanisms do not have the necessary powers and authority 
and do not receive the means and resources that they need to implement their mandates 
effectively. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur notes that the new legislation on foreigners and on asylum, 
owing to its restrictive and repressive nature, reveals a tendency to approach immigration and 
asylum issues solely from a security point of view and to criminalize foreigners, immigrants and 
asylum-seekers.  The considerable number of acts of police violence with racist and xenophobic 
overtones against these target groups and the judicial and administrative impunity enjoyed, 
according to the victims, by the perpetrators, as well as the absence of clear policy guidelines for 
the police force in order to prevent all discriminatory practices, are alarming signs of the failure 
to attach priority to combating racism and xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>76. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur took note with interest of initiatives, such as that of 
the Basel police, to implement an intercultural training programme and establish direct dialogue 
with representatives of the black community.  He was informed that a federal bill on the use of 
coercion by the police and police measures in areas that fall within the competence of the 
Confederation, expressly providing for training in the areas of &#8220;basic rights, protection of the 
person and procedural law and behaviour towards persons of different cultural backgrounds&#8221; 
is under consideration.  Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur, with reference to the testimonies 
that he received during his visit, as well as to various reports prepared by recognized national 
and international NGOs, must conclude that police practices differ not only from canton to 
canton but remain one of the dark stains on Switzerland&#8217;s efforts to combat racism and 
xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur was particularly alarmed at the lack of reliable data and statistics 
concerning manifestations and expressions of racism, discrimination and xenophobia in </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/19/Add.2 
 page 23 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Switzerland.<b>37</b>  The absence of this essential measuring tool makes it difficult to assess the 
phenomenon and limits the effectiveness of even sporadic policies, programmes and initiatives to 
combat racism.  Moreover, since statistics are not standardized among the cantons, whatever data 
are available, particularly data on crime, are difficult to interpret. 
</p>
<p>78. Through the diversity of situations and policies, the Special Rapporteur noted the impact 
of the distinctive nature of the federal structure, the powers and prerogatives of the cantons and 
the democratic tradition of popular votes on the recognition and treatment of questions relating 
to racism and xenophobia.  It would appear, therefore, that the question of racism, racial 
discrimination and xenophobia has not been the subject of a comprehensive and coherent 
approach or a resolute and credible national political programme. 
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur is particularly alarmed at the possibility that, owing to their 
electoral impact, racist and xenophobic political platforms will spread in the future, 
bearing in mind the degree of resistance to cultural diversity in the light of the increasing 
multiculturalization, particularly as a result of non-European immigration, of Swiss society.  In 
this regard, there are already signs, particularly in the context of the widespread tendency in 
Europe to associate Islam with terrorism, that one of the prime targets of these platforms will be 
the presence of Muslims in Switzerland. 
</p>
<p>80. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur spoke at length with his interlocutors concerning 
integration measures and programmes.  He noted that the positive aspects of some of these 
programmes are handicapped by two political and cultural factors in Switzerland:  (a) at the 
political level, by ideological hostility to integration, reflected in the political platforms of 
parties, such as the Swiss People&#8217;s Party/Centre Democratic Union, which are members of the 
Government; and (b) at the cultural level, by the rejection of cultural diversity, which takes the 
form of refusing to acknowledge the cultural specificity of immigrant minorities, particularly 
non-European minorities, which are suspected of threatening &#8220;national identity&#8221; and are enjoined 
to &#8220;adapt to national values&#8221;, thereby depriving such minorities of any opportunity to make 
cultural contributions to and enrich Swiss society. 
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the commitment, in the context of Switzerland&#8217;s 
participatory democracy, of associations and civil society, including churches, to combating 
racism in Switzerland.  However, he notes with concern the current political and legal trend, 
demonstrated by the most recent vote, towards abolishing measures to defend and protect 
victims. 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur is particularly alarmed at the situation, often extremely 
precarious, of asylum-seekers whose applications have not been considered for formal reasons, 
and at the Government&#8217;s policy - characterized by criminalization, suspicion and rejection - 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>37
</b>  The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination requested such information from 
</p>
<p>Switzerland in 2002:  &#8220;The Committee requests information about the legislation in force 
prohibiting racial discrimination within the private sector in fields such as employment, housing, 
education, health and access to public places.&#8221; (CERD/C/60/CO/14, para. 16). </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.2 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>towards such persons.  Reports and official documents<b>38</b> clearly indicate a reduction of social 
assistance for such persons.  According to an official report, the measure excluding social 
assistance, which has been in force since 1 April 2004, has a twofold objective:  &#8220;reduce 
by 10,000 persons staff involved in asylum matters in order to realize savings on the order 
117 million over three years, and create a better basis for asylum policy by refusing access to 
social assistance to persons who clearly have no need to be protected by the Swiss authorities&#8221;.<b>39</b>  
These &#8220;negative incentives&#8221; aimed at decisions not to consider requests for formal reasons will 
take the form of &#8220;a reduction to a minimum of the conditions of housing, food and health care 
provided, an obligation to renew on a regular basis requests for social benefits with the 
institutions stipulated by the authorities&#8221;.<b>40</b>  The Special Rapporteur would like to mention here 
his satisfaction with the decision of the Federal Tribunal of 18 March 2005, in which the 
Tribunal ruled that Solothurn canton&#8217;s withholding of all material assistance, including 
emergency assistance, from persons whose requests had not been considered and who refused to 
cooperate in their return, was unconstitutional (Federal Tribunal ruling 131 166). 
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur regrets that such measures are used by a democratic State in 
contravention of Switzerland&#8217;s international human rights obligations, and that they damage the 
dignity of the persons affected.  In this regard, he wishes to remind the Swiss authorities of 
article 12 of the Federal Constitution, which states:  &#8220;Persons in distress and incapable of looking 
after themselves have the right to be helped and assisted, and to receive the means that are 
indispensable for leading a life in human dignity.&#8221;  It is in this spirit that the obligations 
contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international instruments 
applicable to Switzerland must also be understood.  Moreover, the publication of certain 
documents by the authorities, such as the report referred to in the previous paragraph, reflects a 
premise of suspicion:  the asylum-seeker is a priori a false applicant whose only aim is to take 
advantage of Switzerland&#8217;s wealth. 
</p>
<p>84. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur questions, in this regard, the real meaning of the statement 
following his visit, made by the spokesman of the Swiss People&#8217;s Party/Centre Democratic 
Union, which is represented in the Government, who said:  &#8220;I can accept that a United Nations 
representative can criticize us since we are now members of the United Nations, but it is a bit 
much when these comments are made by a Senegalese.&#8221;  The Special Rapporteur welcomed the

</p>
<p>reactions of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, which deeply regretted the fact that 
the spokesman of a government party should challenge the authority of a Special Rapporteur 
of the United Nations, and of the Federal Department of the Interior, whose spokesman said 
that the comment, which was out of place, showed how ignorant the person was regarding 
the quality of African intellectuals.  Similarly, the President of the Swiss Confederation, 
Mr. Moritz Leuenberger, said that he hoped that no such remark had ever been made but, if it 
had, it should be vigorously condemned. 
</p>
<p>85. Following his visit, the Special Rapporteur received various letters, some anonymous, 
from Swiss people, both denouncing situations of racism and the lack of action on the part of the 
authorities, and criticizing the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s preliminary findings and telling him that 
Switzerland &#8220;had no lessons to learn from anyone&#8221;.  These documents and the content of certain 
articles and commentaries in the press that repeatedly refer to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
nationality demonstrate the disturbing emergence of a culture of xenophobia in certain segments 
of Swiss society, which can have a long-term damaging effect on the image of the country, 
which is the European headquarters of the United Nations and which is rightly respected 
throughout the world for the originality and vitality of its political system of participatory 
democracy. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Swiss authorities prepare, as a matter 
of priority, a comprehensive political strategy to combat racism, racial discrimination and 
xenophobia, focusing on three main areas: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>The Government&#8217;s public expression of its political will to combat all forms and 
manifestations of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Opposition to and condemnation of all racist and xenophobic political platforms; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Recognition of, respect for and promotion of cultural diversity, and commitment 
to promote, in the long term, a democratic, egalitarian and interactive 
multiculturalism. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur therefore recommends that the Government make 
available the appropriate means, mechanisms and institutions to implement this political 
will, in particular by: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Drafting, in cooperation with all political parties and in consultation with civil 
society organizations and representatives of national, ethnic, cultural and 
religious minorities, of comprehensive national legislation and a national 
programme of action to combat racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia. 
</b></p>
<p><b>At the institutional level, the Special Rapporteur recommends two measures: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>In order to address the current rise in xenophobia, the Government should 
strengthen the Federal Commission for Foreigners and the Federal Commission </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/19/Add.2 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p><b>against Racism with regard to material, budgetary and human resources and 
their authority and capacity for action and intervention.  The Service for 
Combating Racism should also be strengthened; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>In order to ensure a holistic approach that takes account of common underlying 
sources and of the link between all forms of discrimination, the Government 
should establish a federal commission to promote human rights and combat all 
forms of discrimination relating to race, religious belief, gender, age, disability 
and sexual preference.  Bearing in mind the urgency of questions relating to 
racism and xenophobia, the commission should attach high priority, at the initial 
stage, to combating racism and xenophobia.  The commission&#8217;s mandate should 
incorporate the current mandates of the Federal Commission against Racism 
and the Federal Commission for Foreigners.  The commission should be 
structured around subcommissions relating to each of these forms of 
discrimination and should be granted administrative, legal and normative 
powers of investigation, action and appeal with respect to all forms of 
discrimination, as well as the appropriate human, material and financial 
resources.  Its budget should be allocated by the Federal Assembly.  The 
president and members of the commission should be appointed by the Federal 
Assembly at the proposal of the Government, in consultation with political 
parties, civil society organizations and all cultural, religious and linguistic 
communities, in order to reflect the diversity of Swiss society and the necessary 
balances.  The commission should submit an annual report to the Federal 
Assembly containing an assessment of the situation and action-oriented 
recommendations for ensuring the promotion of and respect for human rights, 
and for combating all forms of discrimination.  The commission should be 
administered by a technical secretariat under its authority, either by the 
transfer, strengthening and transformation of the current Service for 
Combating Racism, reinforced with additional human, material and budgetary 
resources, or by a new mechanism.  This service should be given the mandate of 
follow-up, collection of statistical data, and recording and analysing incidents, 
manifestations and expressions of discrimination, for the commission. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the resources provided to independent 
bodies that combat racism should be maintained, if not increased. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur is aware of the challenges arising from Switzerland&#8217;s 
federal structure and the division of powers between the Confederation and the cantons.  
He nevertheless considers that the authorities should establish appropriate mechanisms to 
address the shortcomings in the area of protecting individuals against racism and racial 
discrimination.  In this regard, he endorses the recommendations made by the Committee 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in 2002, particularly the assertion that &#8220;the 
Federal Government has the responsibility of ensuring the implementation of the 
Convention on its entire territory and must ensure that cantonal authorities are aware of 
the rights set out in the Convention and take the necessary measures in order to respect 
them&#8221; (CERD/C/60/CO/14, para. 8). </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/4/19/Add.2 
 page 27 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>90. <b>With regard to incidents of police violence, the Special Rapporteur wishes to remind 
the federal and cantonal authorities of their obligations under international norms for the 
protection of human rights, which apply to everyone without distinction.  In this regard, he 
strongly recommends, pending the establishment of the aforementioned federal 
commission, the creation of independent mechanisms to investigate allegations of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance by various bodies and 
administrations at the federal, cantonal and communal levels. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur, having noted the weakness of Swiss administrative and 
civil legislation regarding protection against discrimination, particularly in the areas of 
housing, employment and access to public places, considers that Swiss legislation in these 
areas should explicitly incorporate effective anti-discriminatory and anti-racist norms.  
Swiss law should also provide for legislation for the implementation of anti-racist norms, 
and provide for compensation or reparation. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur supports the planned adoption by the Swiss authorities of 
two articles to supplement article 261 dealing with distinctive symbols of a discriminatory 
attitude based on race or the public use of slogans, gestures or forms of salutation with a 
racist meaning, and with the criminalization of the creation of, or participation in, groups 
that intend to commit acts prohibited under article 261 bis. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>He also recommends that Swiss legislation introduce the right of associations and 
non-governmental organizations to appear in court and act on behalf of victims, since this 
would provide better protection for persons who are reluctant or unable to take their cases 
to the courts. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the Swiss authorities to withdraw the 
reservations to article 2, paragraph 1 (a), and article 4 of the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Special Rapporteur is aware that the legal strategy alone cannot combat 
prejudices which, in Switzerland as elsewhere, are deeply rooted in history and culture.  He 
therefore recommends that the political and legal strategy be supplemented by a cultural 
and ethical strategy with the aim - in order to overcome the deadlocks and tensions of an 
ideological and partisan management of de facto uncontrolled multiculturalization - of 
the voluntary, gradual and long-term construction of a democratic, egalitarian, 
non-discriminatory and interactive multiculturalism centred around two related areas:  the 
promotion of reciprocal knowledge among communities reflecting the diversity of Swiss 
society and the promotion of interaction and cross-fertilization among these communities.  
Action must be taken, here and now, to promote fruitful and non-antagonistic coexistence, 
the dialectic of unity and diversity, the founding principle of Swiss federalism, bearing in 
mind the current twofold challenge of the growing complexity of diversity as a result of 
non-European and non-Christian immigration, and of the dynamic of attempts to defend 
identity, which is exploited for political ends. </b></p>

<p>96. <b>The Special Rapporteur considers that certain awareness-raising and training 
initiatives undertaken within State bodies, such as the training of the Basel City police 
force, are very positive, and recommends that they be undertaken in all cantons.  He also 
recommends that the Government increase, to the extent possible, the recruitment, at all 
State levels, of staff from among the immigrant population and the various foreign 
communities, and promote comprehensive intercultural training in all State services and 
institutions that deal with immigration and the situation of foreigners, in particular the 
police and border authorities, airports, stations, etc. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that civil society organizations make 
use of the United Nations mechanisms available to them, both treaty body mechanisms, 
such as the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and the special 
procedures, and transmit to these bodies relevant information concerning possible human 
rights violations as a result of the application of laws such as the Act on Foreign Nationals 
or the Asylum Act.  In this regard, he encourages civil society to record and document 
acts of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia.  He wishes to commend the 
non-governmental organizations that have already taken steps in this regard.41
