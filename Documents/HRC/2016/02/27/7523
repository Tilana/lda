<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Over the past six years, the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking 
water and sanitation has contributed to develop the normative description of the human 
rights to water and sanitation and has worked with different stakeholders to provide 
guidance on how to implement these rights in practice in particular at the national level. 
The Special Rapporteur has received many requests from States (national and local 
authorities), United Nations agencies, service providers, regulators, civil society 
organizations, and others to provide more concrete and comprehensive guidance and to 
clarify what the implications of these human rights are for their work and activities. The 
Human  Rights Council, in its resolution 16/2, also encouraged the Special Rapporteur to 
&#8220;work on identifying challenges and obstacles to the full realization of the human right to 
safe drinking water and sanitation, as well as protection gaps thereto, and to continue to 
identify good practices and enabling factors in this regard&#8221;. In response to such requests, 
the Special Rapporteur has developed a handbook for realizing the human rights to water 
and sanitation as a culmination of her work on the mandate . The Handbook will be 
published in September 2014 and will be available in five languages (Arabic, English, 
French, Spanish and Portuguese). Hard copies of the Handbook will be shared with 
Member States and other stakeholders, and it will become available also online at websites 
of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and other partners.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Purposes of the Handbook 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Handbook for realizing the human rights to water and sanitation has been 
developed: 
</p>
<p> A. To clarify the meaning of the human rights to water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p> B. To explain the obligations that arise from these rights; 
</p>
<p> C. To provide guidance on implementing the human rights to water and  
 sanitation; 
</p>
<p> D. To share some examples of good practice and show how these rights are  
 being implemented; 
</p>
<p> E. To explore how States can be held to account for delivering on their  
 obligations; 
</p>
<p>3. To provide its users with checklists so they can assess how far they are complying 
with the human rights to water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>4. The target audiences for this Handbook are State authorities at all levels, donors and 
national regulatory bodies. The Handbook provides information that is useful to other 
stakeholders, including civil society and service providers.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur has developed this Handbook collaboratively, first 
identifying the key barriers, dilemmas, challenges and opportunities that stakeholders face 
in realizing the human rights to water and sanitation, and then testing and verifying the 
guidance, checklists and recommendations featured in the Handbook. The Special 
Rapporteur organized a series of consultations both online and in person, and held countless </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/55/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>discussions with interested parties. These consultations included an initial meeting with the 
Advisory Group for this Handbook in September 2012, and a brief survey to identify the  
</p>
<p>main issues that key stakeholders wanted to see analysed, which received 850 responses 
from five continents. The Special Rapporteur then convened a strategy meeting in April 
2013 to discuss the content of the Handbook in detail. In late 2013 and early 2014, she 
convened two regional consultations - a Latin-American and Caribbean consultation in 
Bolivia, about local authority responsibilities, and an Asian consultation in Nepal, covering 
financing and budgeting - as well as a shorter meeting in Kenya at which the specific 
concerns affecting the implementation of the human rights to water and sanitation in urban 
areas were discussed. In late 2013 the Special Rapporteur also sent a <i>note verbale</i> to all 
United Nations member States, requesting them to share any relevant information and 
experience in realizing the human rights to water and sanitation. She organized two e-
discussions in collaboration with the Rural Water Supply Network and with HuriTalk, 
focussing on specific issues to be addressed in the Handbook, including non-discrimination, 
sustainability, and the roles and responsibilities of the different actors. The first draft of the 
Handbook was shared at the rights to water and sanitation website (www.righttowater.info) 
hosted by several civil society organizations, and several comments were received.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Contents of the Handbook 
</b>6. The Handbook gives guidance on the implementation of the human rights to water 
and sanitation as defined by the international human rights legal framework, which 
provides a minimum universal standard. Given the range of different local, regional and 
national standards that exist around the world, it is unrealistic to give detailed and 
differentiated guidance for each country, but States can use these international standards to 
define how these rights can best be implemented nationally. States are encouraged 
ultimately to surpass the standards set by international human rights law, by preparing 
national legislation, regulations and policies that go beyond these minimum legal 
requirements. 
</p>
<p>7. The international legal norms can be incorporated into national laws, regulations and 
policies, into national and sub-national budgets and into the planning processes for service 
delivery. These human rights can be provided for in complaints procedures administered 
either by service providers or by regulators or equivalent bodies, as well as by providing 
people access to justice or remedy for violations of their human rights to water and 
sanitation. 
</p>
<p>8. The Handbook also seeks to identify common challenges and obstacles and how 
these can be overcome, in order to respond to the practical problems that States face when 
realizing the human rights to water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p>9. The Handbook is organized into booklets relating to five main areas relevant to 
States in the realization of the human rights to water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p><b> A. National legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>10. In order to implement the human rights to water and sanitation, States must ensure 
existing legal, policy and regulatory frameworks incorporate human rights considerations, 
and reform them where this is not the case. These frameworks clarify the commitments of 
the State with respect to human rights principles in general and access to water and 
sanitation in particular. Without a clear legal framework, the State cannot be held 
accountable by the individuals, or rights-holders, who live within its jurisdiction.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/55/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Financing, budgeting and budget tracking for the realisation of the 
human rights to water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>11. States must take their human rights obligations into account when developing 
financing strategies and budgets for water and sanitation. This assists States to ensure that 
those areas or populations that lack adequate access to water and sanitation receive targeted 
funds to address inequalities. Financing strategies and budgets must also be monitored to 
ensure that they have been developed and executed in compliance with the human rights to 
water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Services  
</b></p>
<p>12. To comply with the human rights to water and sanitation, the delivery of water and 
sanitation services requires clear planning processes, institutions with a clear mandate, and 
the necessary financial and human resources. Different settlement types will require 
different approaches in terms of technology and management, but must still meet the 
necessary standards of the human rights to water and sanitation. States must set appropriate 
targets to ensure that services are sustainable, available, accessible, safe, affordable and 
culturally acceptable, without discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>13. Monitoring compliance with the human rights to water and sanitation is essential, 
not only to understand the extent to which the State has been successful in realizing these 
rights, but also to gather the necessary data for future planning and resource allocation. 
Monitoring includes collecting data on service levels (such as quality, accessibility and 
affordability) and on who has (or does not have) access to water and sanitation, in order to 
assess discriminatory practices and levels of inequality. With accurate data on who has 
access to water and sanitation, and at what level of service, States can prioritize the 
provision of services to the people who need them most.  
</p>
<p><b> E Access to justice 
</b>14. States must ensure that people whose human rights are either not realized or being 
violated have access to justice. There is a wide range of different remedies available, from 
administrative processes such as complaints procedures, managed by service providers, to 
quasi-judicial and judicial procedures, potentially leading to court cases at the national, 
regional or international level.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Checklists 
</b>15. Under each booklet, the Handbook also provides checklists for States and discusses 
the different roles of the various actors and the essential partnerships between them that are 
necessary to bring about the realization of the human rights to water and sanitation.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/55/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Are there laws in place that protect the quality of water resources; for example, by

service levels, tariffs, and the operation and maintenance of water and sanitation 
services? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Do regulations provide for mechanisms that ensure individual complaints are 
effectively heard, and processed in a timely way? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Has the State undertaken any measures to regulate water supply by informal vendors 
or replace it by a formalised supply?  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are standards regularly reviewed, and do standards progressively improve over time 
minimum amount of water to be available, and a maximum permitted interruption 
of services?  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Does standard-setting take account of the barriers facing particular individuals? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Do regulations clearly spell out what &#8220;availability of sanitation&#8221; means in different 
settings where people spend significant amounts of time, including homes, 
workplaces, schools and kindergartens, hospitals and health care centres, places of 
detention and public places? Do regulations include guidance on safe construction, 
regular cleaning, and emptying of pits or other places that collect human excreta? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Do regulations specify that facilities must be available in schools and other public 
institutions, which allow for hand-washing and for women and girls to practice 
good menstrual hygiene? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Do regulations set minimum standards with regard to physical accessibility? Do they 
take into account the maximum distance and time it takes to reach a facility; the 
location of the facility in order to ensure physical security of users; and do these 
standards consider the barriers faced by particular individuals and groups? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Can people living in informal settlements and without secure tenure gain access to 
formal water and sanitation service provision? Do the State and/or providers give 
access to formal water and sanitation services to households regardless of their

relevant for both public and private service-providers? Are there regulations on 
householders&#8217; arrangements for waste collection and disposal? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are water quality standards set according to the national and local contexts, 
considering contaminants that occur only in specific regions?  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Do standards take into account which type of service would be most efficient in the 
context of the local situation? 
</p>
<p><b>  4. Policies  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Is there a comprehensive water and sanitation policy in force that integrates the 
human rights to water and sanitation and its legal content?  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Is the policy reviewed regularly, to track discriminatory effects; if they are found to 
discriminate, are they repealed or amended? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are existing inequalities in accessing water and sanitation currently assessed? Are 
there plans and policies developed that use indicators and benchmarks to assess 
both the steps taken and the results achieved in the elimination of discrimination in 
water and sanitation service provision?

programmes to eliminate unacceptable practices; for example, manual scavenging, 
and the exclusion of women from daily life during menstruation? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are there policies in place that plan to improve services continually over time? 
</p>
<p><b> B. Financing, budgeting and budget tracking for the realization of the 
human rights to water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. National and sub-national Governments 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Is the national government directing sufficient funds to sub-national governments to 
enable them to progressively realize the rights to water and sanitation (including 
availability, accessibility, quality, affordability and acceptability) to people in its 
area on a non-discriminatory basis? What are the criteria for allocating funds to 
sub-national governments? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are the funds the national government is directing to sub-national governments such 
as to enhance equality in access to clean water and sanitation targeted to those who 
are disadvantaged and among different regions of the country and different 
populations? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are the national and sub-national governments collaborating to ensure that all funds 
directed from the national government for water, sanitation and hygiene projects 
and services reach sub-national government in a timely fashion? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are people made aware of existing subsidies, grants and payment options? 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Ministry of Finance (or Planning, or Central Bank) 
</b>&#8226; Has the Ministry of Finance reviewed water and sanitation related budgets to 
</p>
<p>determine if, when taken together, the allocations seek to realize the rights to water 
and sanitation, as well as promoting non-discrimination, sustainability, 
accountability and participation?  When the budgets from the different line 
ministries are taken together, have the rights to water and sanitation been accorded 
due priority?  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Have any cuts been made in water and sanitation related budgets?  If so, was an 
assessment done of the likely impact of these cuts on people&#8217;s realization of their 
rights to water and sanitation? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Has the Government made water and sanitation related budgets publicly available 
and accessible? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Has it enabled participation by civil society in discussions around the formulation of 
these budgets?  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Has the Finance, or where appropriate, the line ministry allocated sufficient funds 
for subsidies for those unable to afford tariffs as well as for the hardest to reach?   
</p>
<p>&#8226; Has it enabled participation by civil society in discussions around the formulation of 
its budget? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Have water and sanitation related funds been released to line ministries and sub-
national governments in full and in a timely fashion? </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/55/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Line Ministries 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Is the structure of tariffs and/or subsidies such as to ensure that people living in 
poverty will have access to a necessary amount of water and access to sanitation 
facilities regardless of ability to pay? Does it also ensure affordability to the 
middle and lower-income households, but not representing more than a certain 
percentage of the household income?  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Do water and sanitation budgets appear to have reached an appropriate balance of 
infrastructure vs. operation/maintenance/repair so as to ensure sustainability of 
existing systems? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Have the line ministries produced sufficiently disaggregated budgets so that it is 
clear how much they are directing to water and to sanitation , and for what 
purposes? 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Donors 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Has the donor or development agency considered giving a higher priority to support 
for the water and sanitation area?  If it already provides such support, has it 
considered directing more of its contribution to operation and maintenance? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Does the donor or development agency provide its water and sanitation related 
support on-budget? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; If it provides off-budget support in the water and sanitation area, does it harmonize 
its support with the government&#8217;s policies and plans? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Does the donor or development agency make information about its water and 
sanitation related support publicly available? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; If it provides on-budget support, has it discussed with government the need for its 
macroeconomic policies to be in line with its economic, social and cultural rights 
obligations and for it to accord due priority to the rights to water and sanitation in 
its budget?   
</p>
<p>&#8226; If it provides on-budget support, has it discussed with government the need for 
making sure that funding for water and sanitation are aimed at promoting the 
rights to water and sanitation, particular the human rights principles of non-
discrimination, sustainability, accountability and participation? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; If the donor or development agency provides water and sanitation sectoral budget 
support, has it determined that the relevant line ministries have developed their 
budgets in line with human rights considerations? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Has information been made publicly available about funds disbursed to advance the 
rights to water and sanitation? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Have water and sanitation related funds been disbursed or spent in full and in a 
timely fashion? 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Supreme audit institutions 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Is the Supreme Audit Institution independent and does it have sufficient &#8211; human 
and financial &#8211; resources to operate? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Does the Supreme Audit Institution use a human rights framework in auditing 
government budgets? </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/55/Add.3

<p>&#8226; What is the follow up to and impact of the Supreme Audit Institution&#8217;s findings? 
What is the rate of Government&#8217;s compliance with the Supreme Audit Institution&#8217;s 
recommendations? 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Civil society 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Are there capacity-building strategies on budgeting and budget tracking for civil 
society? 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Services 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. National and sub-national governments 
</b></p>
<p><i>Planning Process 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Are national and local planning processes open, transparent and participatory and do 
decision-making processes fully and explicitly include disadvantaged, 
marginalised and vulnerable individuals and groups? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are assessments participatory and available for review? Do baseline studies identify 
the most disadvantaged individuals and groups?  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Do assessments consider accessibility, affordability, adaptability and acceptability?  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are targets set through inclusive processes, with sufficient information available for 
targeted individuals and groups?
