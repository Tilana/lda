AURORA METALS (BVI) LIMITED
This quarterly report contains statements that plan for or anticipate the future
and  are  not  historical facts. In this Report these forward looking statements
are  generally  identified  by  words  such  as "anticipate", "plan", "believe",
"expect",  "estimate",  and the like. Because forward looking statements involve
future  risks  and  uncertainties,  these  are  factors  that could cause actual
results  to differ materially from the estimated results. Additional factors are
discussed  in  Aurora Metals (BVI) Limited's materials filed with the securities
regulatory  authorities  in  the  United States from time to time. Aurora Metals
(BVI)  Limited  disclaims  any  intention  or obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking  statements.
The  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995, which provides a "safe
harbor"  for  such  statements,  may  not  apply  to  this  Report.

Notes  to  the  September  30,  2005  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
Common  Shares  Outstanding
As at September 30, 2005, the Corporation's authorized capital stock consists of
50,000,000  common  shares  with  a  par  value  of  $0.01 per share. There were
18,081,473  common  shares  issued  and  outstanding  at  September  30,  2005.
Stock  Options  Outstanding
At  September 30, 2005 the Company had 1,000,000 (December 31, 2004 - 1,100,000)
options  outstanding  with  an  exercise  price  of  $0.05  per  common  share.
Application  of  Critical  Accounting  Policies
The preparation of its consolidated financial statements requires the Company to
use  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities  as well as revenues and expenses. The Company's accounting policies
are  described  in  note  2  to  its  December  31,  2004 consolidated financial
statements.  The  Company's  accounting  policies  relating  to depreciation and
amortization  of
5
<PAGE>
property,  plant and equipment are critical accounting policies that are subject
to  estimates  and  assumptions  regarding  future  activities.
See  note  2  (d)  Significant  Accounting  Policies  -  Mineral  Properties and
Exploration  Expenses  described in its December 31, 2004 consolidated financial
statements  for  the  Company's  policy  on  exploration  costs  and  expenses.
Generally  accepted accounting principles require the Company to consider at the
end of each accounting period whether or not there has been an impairment of the
capitalized  property,  plant and equipment. This assessment is based on whether
factors  that may indicate the need for a write-down are present. If the Company
determines  there  has been an impairment, then the Company would be required to
write-down  the  recorded value of its property, plant and equipment costs which
would  reduce  the  Company's  earnings  and  net  assets.
Off-balance  Sheet  Arrangements  and  Contractual  Obligations
The  Company  does  not  have  any off-balance sheet arrangements or contractual
obligations  that are likely to have or are reasonably likely to have a material
current  or  future  effect  on  the  Company's  financial condition, changes in
financial  condition,  revenues  or  expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital  expenditures  or  capital resources that have not been disclosed in the
Company's  financial  statements.
Market  Risk  Disclosures
The  Company  has not entered into derivative contracts either to hedge existing
risks  or  for  speculative  purposes.
Controls  and  Procedures
The  principal  executive  and  principal financial officers of the Company have
evaluated  the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end  of  the  period covered by this report (evaluation date) and have concluded
that  the  disclosure  controls  and procedures are adequate and effective based
upon  their  evaluation  as  of  the  evaluation  date.
There were no significant changes in our controls or in other factors that could
significantly  affect these internal controls subsequent to the date of the most
recent  evaluation.
