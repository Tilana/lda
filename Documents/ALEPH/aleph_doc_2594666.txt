<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Our partnership agreement requires us to distribute
all of our available cash quarterly. Our cash distribution policy reflects a 
fundamental
judgment that our unitholders generally will be better served by our 
distributing rather than retaining our available cash. Our partnership agreement
generally defines available cash as cash on hand at the end of a quarter after 
the payment of
expenses, less the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner to
provide for the conduct of our business, to comply with applicable law, any of 
our debt instruments or other agreements or to provide for future distributions 
to our
unitholders for any one or more of the next four quarters. Our available cash 
also may include, if our general partner so determines, all or any portion of 
the cash on hand immediately prior to the date of distribution of available cash
for the
quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made subsequent to the end of 
such quarter. Because we are not subject to an entity-level federal income tax, 
we expect to have more cash to distribute to our unitholders than would be the 
case if we
were subject to entity-level federal income tax. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt;

such traditional investment capital expenditures, such as the acquisition of a

the minimum

reset such that there will be no incentive distributions paid under the reset 
target distribution levels until cash distributions per unit following this

is the opinion of Andrews Kurth LLP, counsel to our general partner and us, 
insofar as it relates to legal conclusions with respect to matters of U.S. 
federal income tax
law. This section is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Internal Revenue Code&#148;), existing and 
proposed Treasury regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code (the 
&#147;Treasury
Regulations&#148;) and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all 
of which are subject to change. Later changes in these authorities may cause the
tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below.

federal income tax matters affecting us or our unitholders and does not describe
the
application of the alternative minimum tax that may be applicable to certain 
unitholders. Moreover, the discussion focuses on unitholders who are individual 
citizens or residents of the U.S. and has only limited application to 
corporations, estates,
entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, trusts, 
nonresident aliens, U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents 
of the United States or other unitholders subject to specialized tax treatment, 
such as
banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, tax-exempt 
institutions, foreign persons (including, without limitation, controlled foreign
corporations, passive foreign investment companies, foreign pension funds and 
non-U.S. persons
eligible for the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty with the United 
States), individual retirement accounts (IRAs), real estate investment trusts 
(REITs) or mutual funds, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in 
securities, U.S.
persons whose &#147;functional currency&#148; is not the U.S. dollar, persons 
holding their units as part of a &#147;straddle,&#148; &#147;hedge,&#148; 
&#147;conversion transaction&#148; or other risk reduction transaction, and 
persons deemed to
sell their units under the constructive sale provisions of the Internal Revenue 
Code. In addition, the discussion only comments to a limited extent on state, 
local and foreign tax consequences. Accordingly, we encourage each prospective 
unitholder
to consult his own tax advisor in analyzing the state, local and foreign tax 
consequences particular to him of the ownership or disposition of common units 
and potential changes in applicable tax laws. </P>

our characterization as a partnership for tax purposes. Instead, we will rely on

Accordingly, the opinions and statements made herein may not be sustained by a

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">A partnership is not a taxable entity and incurs no
federal income tax liability. Instead, each partner of a partnership is required
to take
into account his share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction of the 
partnership in computing his federal income tax liability, regardless of whether
cash distributions are made to him by the partnership. Distributions by a 
partnership to a
partner are generally not taxable to the partnership or the partner unless the 
amount of cash distributed to him is in excess of the partner&#146;s adjusted 
basis in his partnership interest. Section&nbsp;7704 of the Internal Revenue 
Code provides
that publicly traded partnerships will, as a general rule, be taxed as 
corporations. However, an exception, referred to as the &#147;Qualifying Income 
Exception,&#148; exists with respect to publicly traded partnerships of which 
90% or more of the
gross income for every taxable year consists of &#147;qualifying income.&#148; 
Qualifying income includes (i) income and gains derived from the refining, 
transportation, storage, processing and marketing of crude oil, natural gas and 
products
thereof (including motor fuels), (ii) certain rents from the leasing of real 
property, (iii) interest (other than from a financial business), (iv) dividends,
(v) gains from the sale of real property and (vi) gains from the sale or other
disposition
of capital assets held for the production of income that otherwise constitutes 
qualifying income. We estimate that less than 5% of our current gross income is 
not qualifying income; however, this estimate could change from time to time. 
The portion
of our income that is qualifying income may change from time to time. </P> <P

our items of income, gain, loss and deduction would be reflected only on our tax
return rather than being passed through to our unitholders, and our net income 
would be
taxed to us at corporate rates. In addition, any distribution made to a 
unitholder would be treated as taxable dividend income, to the extent of our 
current and accumulated earnings and profits, or, in the absence of earnings and
profits, a
nontaxable return of capital, to the extent of the unitholder&#146;s tax basis

subject to depreciation
under Section&nbsp;168 of the Internal Revenue Code and whose book basis is in 
excess of its tax basis to be depreciated over the remaining cost recovery

Section&nbsp;1.167(c)-1(a)(6), a Section&nbsp;743(b) adjustment attributable to 
property subject to depreciation under Section&nbsp;167 of the Internal Revenue 
Code, rather than cost recovery deductions under Section&nbsp;168, is generally 
required
to be depreciated using either the straight-line method or the 150% declining 
balance method. Under our partnership agreement, our general partner is

position is not

depreciation or
amortization method and useful life applied to the property&#146;s unamortized 
Book-Tax Disparity, or treat that portion as non-amortizable to the extent 
attributable to property that is not amortizable. This method is consistent with
the methods
employed by other publicly traded partnerships but is arguably inconsistent with
Treasury Regulation Section&nbsp;1.167(c)-1(a)(6), which is not expected to 
directly apply to a material portion of our assets. To the extent this 
Section&nbsp;743(b)
adjustment is attributable to appreciation in value in excess of the unamortized
Book-Tax Disparity, we will apply the rules described in the Treasury 
Regulations and legislative history. If we determine that this position cannot 
reasonably be
taken, we may take a depreciation or amortization position under which all 
purchasers acquiring units in the same month would receive depreciation or 
amortization, whether attributable to common basis or a Section&nbsp;743(b) 
adjustment, based upon
the same applicable rate as if they had purchased a direct interest in our

common units is reduced by his share of our deductions (whether or not such 
deductions were claimed on an individual&#146;s income tax return) so that any 
position we take

his common units, which may cause the unitholder to understate gain or overstate
loss on any sale of such units. Please read &#147;&#151;Disposition of Common
Units&#151;Recognition of Gain or Loss.&#148; Andrews Kurth LLP is unable to 
opine as to whether our method for taking into account Section&nbsp;743
adjustments is sustainable for property subject to depreciation under 
Section&nbsp;167 of the
Internal Revenue Code or if we use an aggregate approach as described above, as 
there is no direct or indirect controlling authority addressing the validity of 
these positions. Moreover, the IRS may challenge our position with respect to
depreciating or amortizing the Section&nbsp;743(b) adjustment we take to 
preserve the uniformity of the units. If such a challenge were sustained, the

deductions. </P>

a greater amount of depreciation deductions and his share of any gain or loss on

disadvantageous if the transferee&#146;s tax basis in his units is lower than 
those units&#146; share of the aggregate tax basis of our assets immediately

made, and should, in our opinion, the expense of compliance exceed the benefit 
of the election, we may seek permission from the IRS to revoke our

make many of the relative fair market value estimates ourselves. These estimates

a sale of units equal to the difference between the amount realized and the

realized will be measured by the sum of the cash or the fair market value of 
other property received by him plus his share of our nonrecourse liabilities.

recognized by a unitholder, other than a &#147;dealer&#148; in units, on the 
sale or exchange
of a unit will generally be taxable as capital gain or loss. Capital gain 
recognized by an individual on the sale of units held for more than twelve 
months will generally be taxed at the U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to
long-term capital
gains. However, a portion of this gain or loss, which will likely be 
substantial, will be separately computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss 
under Section&nbsp;751 of the Internal Revenue Code to the extent attributable 
to assets giving rise
to depreciation recapture or other &#147;unrealized receivables&#148; or to 
&#147;inventory items&#148; we own. The term &#147;unrealized receivables&#148; 
includes potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. Ordinary
income
attributable to unrealized receivables, inventory items and depreciation 
recapture may exceed net taxable gain realized upon the sale of a unit and may 
be recognized even if there is a net taxable loss realized on the sale of a 
unit. Thus, a
unitholder may recognize both ordinary income and a capital loss upon a sale of 
units. Capital losses may offset capital gains and no more than $3,000 of 
ordinary income, in the case of individuals, and may only be used to offset 
capital gains in
the case of corporations. Both ordinary income and capital gain recognized on a 
sale of units may be subject to the NIIT in certain circumstances. Please read

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code, of FATCA, a withholding
agent may be
required to withhold 30% of any interest, dividends and other fixed or 
determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and income from sources within
the United States (&#147;FDAP Income&#148;) or gross proceeds from the sale or 
other disposition

financial institution&#148; or a &#147;non-financial foreign entity&#148; (each 
as defined
in the Internal Revenue Code) unless (a) in the case of a foreign financial 
institution, such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government 
to withhold on certain payments, perform diligence with respect to its account 
holders and
perform reporting with respect to its U.S. account holders (which includes 
certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account 
holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners); (b) in the case of a non-
financial
foreign entity, such entity certifies that it does not have any 
&#147;substantial United States owners&#148; (as defined in the Internal Revenue
Code) or provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying its 
direct and indirect
substantial United States owners; or (c) the foreign financial institution or 
non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these 
rules and provides appropriate documentation. Foreign financial institutions 
located in
jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States 
may be subject to different rules. For purposes of the FATCA rules, a 
&#147;foreign financial institution&#148; is defined broadly to include various 
types of investment
entities, including foreign hedge funds or private equity funds, foreign-broker-
dealers, clearing organizations and investment companies. </P>
