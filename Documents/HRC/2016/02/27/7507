<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo stressed that, since the 
country&#8217;s participation in the first cycle, the Government had made considerable efforts to 
promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. In the political and diplomatic domains, the delegation recalled the initiatives that 
had led to the signing of a number of agreements, including the Peace, Security and 
Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region, of 24 
February 2013, and the Nairobi Declaration of 12 December 2013. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation mentioned the reform of the defence sector. Thanks to this 
restructuring and the support of the special intervention brigade established pursuant to 
Security Council resolution 2098, the Congolese Armed Forces had destroyed the 
Mouvement du 23 mars and re-established the State&#8217;s authority in hitherto occupied areas. 
</p>
<p>8. Regarding justice sector reform, the delegation stated that the Government had 
embarked on an extensive long-term programme, triggered by the entry into force of the 
2006 Constitution. The Acts on the organization and functioning of the Court of Cassation, </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.14-07547 
</p>
<p>the Council of State and the Constitutional Court had been adopted by parliament and 
promulgated by the President, and the establishment of those high courts was imminent. 
</p>
<p>9. Regarding the struggle against impunity, the delegation emphasized that the 
legislative branch had awarded the appeals courts jurisdiction over matters of genocide, war 
crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated by individuals under their jurisdiction or 
that of the <i>tribunaux de grande instance</i> (courts of major jurisdiction). In order to punish 
serious human rights violations committed in the past 20 years, the Minister of Justice and 
Human Rights had drafted a bill on the establishment, organization and functioning of 
specialized chambers, which had been adopted by the Cabinet and transmitted to parliament 
for consideration. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation highlighted the adoption by parliament of the Act on the 
implementation of women&#8217;s rights and equality and the bill on the organization of urban, 
municipal and local elections, which provided for additional seats to be reserved in all 
municipal and local councils for those unelected female candidates who received the 
highest number of votes. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation pointed out that the National Human Rights Commission had been 
established and that the National Assembly was in the process of appointing the 
commissioners. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation stated that war was both a cause and an aggravating circumstance of 
sexual violence because such violence was used to destroy society. In 2009, a national 
strategy against sexual and gender-based violence had been adopted and piloted in the 
Eastern part of the country with a view to being rolled out nationwide. 
</p>
<p>13. The delegation pointed out that the Government had signed a joint statement with 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict in 2013. 
A monitoring plan had been devised and the President would shortly be appointing a 
personal representative on sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation stated that all alleged perpetrators of sexual violence involved in 
cases reported to the judicial authorities were prosecuted. Those convicted of such offences 
were not entitled to parole, a pardon or amnesty. 
</p>
<p>15. Regarding children in armed conflict, the delegation indicated that in 2012, the 
Government and the Task Force on Children and Armed Conflict had agreed on an action 
plan to combat the recruitment and use of children and other serious children&#8217;s rights 
violations committed by the Congolese Armed Forces and the security forces. The 
delegation pointed out that 2,894 children had left the armed forces and armed groups as a 
result. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation called on the international community to support a definitive end to 
the war and cooperate in apprehending and bringing to justice all the perpetrators of serious 
human rights violations who were circulating freely in certain States. 
</p>
<p>17. In response to advance questions from a number of States, the delegation mentioned 
that a bill to incorporate the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court into national 
legislation had been submitted to parliament. 
</p>
<p>18. Among the initiatives taken to facilitate access to justice for women victims of 
sexual violence, the delegation mentioned that free legal aid was available and that mobile 
hearings were held regularly. 
</p>
<p>19. The delegation stated that the Government was making efforts to strengthen the 
judicial system, including by recruiting judges and establishing magistrates&#8217; courts in all 
provinces. Furthermore, witnesses and victims of sexual violence received protection from </p>


<p>GE.14-07547 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>the special police units for the protection of women and children. The delegation added that 
targeted legal provisions still needed to be formulated to better ensure their safety. 
</p>
<p>20. The delegation stated that measures had been taken to improve detention conditions 
and that, thanks to a range of initiatives, malnutrition in prisons was declining. The 
Government had established a refurbishment plan for detention facilities. 
</p>
<p>21. Regarding collaboration with human rights protection and promotion mechanisms, 
the delegation stressed that no requests to visit the country had been denied. The delegation 
specified that all reports to treaty bodies should be submitted by the end of March 2015. 
</p>
<p>22. Regarding the implementation of the recommendations of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the delegation reported that a bill amending 
the Family Code to repeal provisions that were discriminatory towards women was under 
consideration. 
</p>
<p>23. The delegation noted that the process of ratifying the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities was under way, but that the process for the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance had not yet 
begun. Regarding the prevention mechanism provided for under the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention against Torture, the delegation pointed out that, in order to avoid a plethora 
of systems, the mechanism&#8217;s mandate could be entrusted to the National Human Rights 
Commission. 
</p>
<p>24. Regarding the abolition of capital punishment, the delegation confirmed that the 
issue was not officially on the political agenda, but that a de facto moratorium had been in 
force for 10 years. 
</p>
<p>25. The delegation stated that acts of intimidation, death threats, arbitrary arrests and 
other human rights violations against human rights defenders had been reported in the 
conflict areas in the Eastern part of the country and that a bill on the protection of human 
rights defenders had been submitted to parliament, although it had yet to be adopted. 
</p>
<p>26. Regarding the reform of the Congolese Armed Forces, the delegation stated that the 
general plan consisted of three phases, which the Government intended to implement by 
</p><p>2025.

therefore not been adopted.

in order to be recruited into those professions.
