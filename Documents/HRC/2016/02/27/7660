</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i>The present report, submitted in accordance with resolution 19/38, illustrates the 
</p>
<p>negative impact of illicit financial flows on developing countries and in particular the 
extent to which the non-repatriation of funds of illicit origin have an impact on the 
implementation of human rights in the countries of origin. The Independent Expert finds 
that illicit financial flows, including those derived from corruption and embezzlement by 
public officials, have considerable negative impacts on the realization of human rights, 
particularly in developing countries and especially in a context where those countries face a 
financing gap of around US$ 112 billion annually to meet the Millennium Development 
Goals aimed at delivering basic social goods such as education, health care, water and 
sanitation and food security. By reducing the resources available to States to establish the 
conditions for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights through investment in 
social programmes, and to create and strengthen the institutions that uphold civil and 
political rights, illicit financial flows compromise the ability of the affected Governments 
to devote the maximum available resources to the realization of human rights. An 
additional consequence of illicit funds is the further perpetration and promotion of criminal 
activities, including terrorism, which endanger democracy and the realization of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * Late submission. 
</p>

<p>The repatriation of illicit funds makes available much needed additional resources 
for development, poverty alleviation and the fulfilment of human rights. The challenge is to 
ensure the efficient, accountable and transparent use of such assets. In that regard, the 
Independent Expert suggests that a human rights-based approach, with its emphasis on the 
key principles of non-discrimination, participation, accountability and transparency, can 
help ensure that repatriated illicit funds are better utilized and better targeted to sectors that 
can potentially benefit the victims of corruption and other illicit flows, who are usually the 
poor. 
</p>
<p>The Independent Expert concludes that, while official development assistance 
remains an important source of finance for poverty alleviation and development, the 
substantial amounts lost to illicit financial flows, estimated at $946.7 billion in 2011, could 
help the efforts of developing countries to mobilize domestic resources for poverty 
alleviation, development and the realization of human rights, and to reduce their costly 
dependence on external financing.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 19/38, the Human Rights Council requested the Independent Expert 
on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States 
on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights 
to prepare a comprehensive study on the negative impact of the non-repatriation of funds of 
illicit origin to the countries of origin on the application by States of the maximum 
available resources to the full realization of all human rights, in particular economic, social 
and cultural rights, with special attention paid to developing countries and countries with 
economies in transition burdened by foreign debt, and to present a report thereon to the 
Council at its twenty-second session.  
</p>
<p>2. In follow-up to that request, the Independent Expert presented an interim report on 
the subject to the Human Rights Council in March 2013 (A/HRC/22/42 and Corr.1), in 
which he highlighted the scale of the problem, provided an overview of existing initiatives 
to curb illicit financial flows and briefly highlighted the impact of non-repatriation of illicit 
funds on the realization of human rights in the countries of origin. 
</p>
<p>3. In its resolution 22/12, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to assist the Independent Expert in convening an 
expert consultation on the topic. The Council also requested the Independent Expert to 
present a comprehensive study to it at its twenty-fifth session. The consultation, which 
brought together experts in human rights, anti-money laundering, trade and tax issues, as 
well as representatives of States, took place in Geneva on 20 and 21 June 2013. Participants 
shared their perspectives on the following key issues: (a) the impact of illicit financial 
outflows; (b) the main initiatives that had been taken in countries of origin and destination 
to return stolen assets and the main problems encountered in that regard; and (c) the main 
human rights issues relating to the outflow, seizure, freezing and return of stolen assets.  
</p>
<p>4. The Independent Expert is grateful to all the States that participated in the 
consultation, and to the Governments of Guatemala and Switzerland, in particular, for 
sharing information on their national and international efforts to address the problem of 
illicit financial flows. He also thanks the individual experts for sharing their perspectives on 
the content of the final report, and the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative for its comments on 
his interim report.  
</p>
<p>5. The present report builds on the interim report. In order to avoid duplication, the 
present report focuses on the impact of the non-repatriation of illicit funds on the capacity 
of the States of origin to realize human rights and the importance of international assistance 
and cooperation in addressing the problem of illicit financial flows. The report does not 
attempt to be exhaustive in covering all possible types of impact of illicit funds. 
</p>
<p>6. In its resolution 19/38, the Human Rights Council refers to funds of illicit origin 
related to corruption. While corruption represents an important drain on the resources 
available to States for investment in infrastructure and social programmes, it is only a small 
component of the total amount of funds lost.1 Furthermore, as noted in the interim report of 
the Independent Expert, those outflows stem from corruption, embezzlement and tax 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 See, for example, Raymond W. Baker, <i>Capitalism&#8217;s Achilles Heel: Dirty Money and How to Renew 
</i></p>
<p><i>the Free-Market System</i> (Hoboken, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2005), pp. 168&#8211;169. The author 
estimates that less than 3 per cent of illicit funds consists of the proceeds of bribery and theft by 
Government officials. </p>


<p>evasion through trade mis-invoicing and transfer mispricing, with trade mis-invoicing and 
transfer mispricing considered the prime drivers of illicit financial flows. 
</p>
<p>7. During the expert consultation mentioned above, a number of experts suggested that 
the issue of tackling the resource drain affecting many developing countries should be 
expanded beyond a narrow focus on corruption to incorporate illicit financial flows 
stemming from a variety of sources, including tax evasion. The Independent Expert agrees. 
Thus, for the purposes of the present report, the term &#8220;illicit funds&#8221; refers broadly to the 
proceeds of corruption, bribery, embezzlement, tax evasion and other crimes.2  
</p>
<p><b> II. Estimates of illicit financial flows: an update 
</b></p>
<p>8. Estimates of illicit financial flows are a matter of debate.3 Indeed, some have 
questioned the methods used to arrive at those estimates and the strong assumptions upon 
which they are based.4 While the Independent Expert acknowledges that it is difficult to 
calculate the amount of illicit financial flows with any degree of certainty (see 
A/HRC/22/42 and Corr.1, para. 12), he considers that estimates play an important role in 
confirming that the scale of the problem warrants international policy attention.5 Indeed, 
when viewed from the development perspective, the losses are substantial. 
</p>
<p>9. Recent estimates indicate that nominal illicit financial outflows from developing 
countries amounted to US$ 946.7 billion in 2011, up 13.7 per cent from $832.4 billion in 
2010.6 That represented an increase in real terms of about 10.2 per cent per annum.7 Asia 
accounted for 39.6 per cent of total illicit outflows from developing countries. Developing 
Europe and the Western Hemisphere accounted for 21.5 and 19.6 per cent, respectively. 
Average outflows from Africa increased from 3.8 per cent in 2002, reaching a peak of 11.1 
per cent in 2007, before falling to 7 per cent in 2011.8 It is notable, however, that although 
Africa has the smallest nominal share of regional outflows over the period 2002&#8211;2011, it

 The term &#8220;illicit&#8221; should not be conflated with &#8220;criminal&#8221; or &#8220;illegal&#8221;, although in the majority of 
</p>
<p>cases the funds in question will have been obtained in violation of domestic or international criminal 
laws.

<p>had the highest average illicit outflows to gross domestic product ratio (5.7 per cent), 
indicating that the illicit financial outflows had a disproportionate impact on the continent.9  
</p>
<p>10. It is also notable that the amount of illicit financial flows exceeds official 
development assistance and foreign investment inflows.10 In 2009, for example, illicit 
financial flows out of Africa were more than three times the amount of official 
development assistance received.11 
</p>
<p>11. It is difficult to assess whether the rate of international recovery of stolen assets is 
satisfactory, since there is no mechanism to collect comprehensive information on all 
international asset recovery cases.12 According to the Asset Recovery Watch database of the 
Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative, $4 billion in stolen assets has been returned.13 Most of this 
falls under the category of returned proceeds of embezzlement or misappropriation of 
public funds, the return of which is mandatory under article 57, paragraph 3 (a) of the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption. Other returned assets relate to other 
proceeds of corruption, mainly stemming from bribery and related cases 
(CAC/COSP/WG.2/2013/3, para. 88).  
</p><p>12. Asset Recovery Watch records about $1.3 billion in total pending returns. However, 
as the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group on Asset Recovery notes, that figure 
needs to be viewed in context, as it includes more than $400 million in restitution ordered 
in a single case where it is not know whether the defendants have the ability to pay and the 
$356 million judgment awarded by a court in the United States of America to the victims of 
human rights violations that took place during the Marcos era, which is still under appeal 
by the Marcos family (ibid., para. 91).  
13. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, less than 1 per cent of 
illicit financial flows around the world are seized and frozen.14 However, the preliminary 
results of a 2012 survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) and the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative measuring the assets frozen and returned 
between 2010 and June 2012 show that there has been an increase in the volume of assets 
frozen and returned during that period: a total of $27 billion was frozen and about $4 billion 
returned or unfrozen/released. It is notable, however, that this increase was largely 
attributable to action taken in response to Security Council resolution 1970 (2011), which 
ordered the freezing of the assets of Muammar Gaddafi&#8217;s regime held internationally, with 
a total of $24 billion frozen and $3.6 billion returned or subsequently released.15 
14. The estimates of returned assets provided above are restricted to cases of corruption 
and embezzlement and do not cover other forms of illicit financial flows. In assessing 
progress made in asset recovery, however, it is important to understand that as used in the 
Convention against Corruption, the term &#8220;asset recovery&#8221; refers to the recovery of the 
proceeds of corruption and related losses. As such, it is much narrower in scope than the 
flows included under the term &#8220;illicit financial flows&#8221;. It should also be mentioned that part 
of the second cycle of the review mechanism on the Convention, starting in 2015, will 
focus on the implementation of chapter V of the Convention and will thus provide more

<p><b> III. Impact of illicit financial flows on the realization of human 
rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Illicit funds and human rights: making the connection 
</b></p>
<p>15. There is a clear link between illicit financial flows and human rights in that such 
flows diminish the resources available to States for investment in programmes that 
contribute to the realization of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural 
rights. In essence, the failure to counter illicit financial flows and recover stolen assets is a 
denial of access to basic health care, education, safe water and sanitation, adequate housing 
and infrastructure,16 all of which are basic conditions for the enjoyment of human rights.  
</p><p>16. Another way of understanding the link between illicit financial flows and human 
rights is to examine the link between the availability of resources and the capacity of States 
to address extreme poverty, which is generally considered a human rights concern.17 The 
connection between illicit financial flows and poverty is evident from the guiding principles 
on extreme poverty and human rights, which state that: &#8220;States must take deliberate, 
specific and targeted steps, individually and jointly, to create an international enabling 
environment conducive to poverty reduction, including in matters relating to bilateral and 
multilateral trade, investment, taxation, finance, environmental protection and development 
cooperation. This includes cooperating to mobilize the maximum of available resources for 
the universal fulfilment of human rights.&#8221; Thus, the guiding principles establish a link 
between taxation and the mobilization of the maximum available resources. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The obligation to use the maximum available resources 
</b></p>

funds derives from the obligation of States to devote their maximum available resources to

 This is the approach adopted by the International Bar Association. See International Bar Association, 
</p>
<p><i>Tax Abuses, Poverty and Human Rights: A Report of the International Bar Association&#8217;s Human 
Rights Institute Task Force on Illicit Financial Flows, Poverty and Human Rights</i> (London, 2013). 
The guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights (A/HRC/21/39) underscore that poverty 
is a cause and a consequence of violations of human rights and the key human rights principles, as 
well as an enabling condition for other violations. The human rights at issue include the rights to: life 
and physical integrity; liberty and security of the person; equal protection before the law, access to 
justice and effective remedies; recognition as a person before the law; privacy and protection for 
home and family; an adequate standard of living; adequate food and nutrition; water and sanitation; 
adequate housing; the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; work and rights at 
work; social security; and education; as well as to take part in cultural life and enjoy the benefits of 
scientific progress and its applications. Basic human rights principles affected by poverty include 
dignity and the universality, indivisibility, interrelatedness and interdependence of all rights; equal 
enjoyment of all human rights by persons living in extreme poverty; equality between men and 
women; the rights of the child; the agency and autonomy of persons living in extreme poverty; 
participation and empowerment; transparency and access to information; and accountability. </p>


<p>the fulfilment of economic, social and cultural rights.18 Under article 2, paragraph 1, of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, each State party has an 
obligation to take steps, to the maximum of its available resources, to achieve progressively 
the full realization of the rights enshrined in the Covenant.19 The Maastricht Guidelines on 
Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights clarify that a State that does not 
allocate the maximum of its available resources to the realization of these rights would be 
in violation of its obligations (para. 15 (e)).  
</p><p>18. According to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, &#8220;the phrase 
&#8216;to the maximum of its available resources&#8217; was intended by the drafters of the Covenant to 
refer to both the resources existing within a State and those available from the international 
community through international cooperation and assistance&#8221;.20 The Committee on the 
Rights of the Child has expanded the substantive meaning of resources to include human, 
technical, organizational, natural and information resources and underlined the obligation 
of States to contribute to the global or extraterritorial realization of economic, social and 
cultural rights.21 
</p>
<p>19. Government revenue, expenditure policy and international assistance are important 
considerations in assessing the obligation of States to use the maximum available resources 
to realize economic, social and cultural rights.22 One study on the subject has drawn the 
following conclusions: (a) Governments must mobilize domestic resources to their utmost 
ability; (b) Government expenditures must be efficient and effective; (c) failure to tackle 
corruption constitutes a failure to comply with the obligation; (d) funds earmarked in the 
budget for economic, social and cultural rights must not be diverted to non-economic, 
social and cultural rights areas; (e) funds earmarked for economic, social and cultural rights 
must be fully expended for that purpose; (f) Governments that introduce regressive 
measures, such as spending cuts on economic, social and cultural rights, must demonstrate 
that they have used the maximum of available resources to avoid taking such a step; and (g) 
Governments must do all they can to secure international assistance where national 
resources are insufficient to realize economic, social and cultural rights.23  
</p>
<p>20. Nevertheless, whether or not a State is utilizing all resources at its disposal is 
difficult to assess. In assessing the compliance of States with this obligation, the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has employed the following indicators: 
(a) comparing expenditures on realizing economic, social and cultural rights to 
expenditures not related to realizing those rights; (b) comparing expenditures in an area 
(such as health or education) with expenditures in the same area by countries at a 
comparable level of development; and (c) comparing Government expenditure with 
</p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>18
 It is generally recognized that resources (including financial resources) are critical for the realization 
</p>
<p>of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights. However, as the present report 
shows, illicit financial outflows can have serious negative impacts on the level of resources available 
to States for the realization of human rights.

<p>international objectives, such as the target set by the United Nations Development 
Programme that 5 per cent of gross domestic product be spent for social purposes (such as 
basic education, primary health care and basic water).24 
</p><p>21. It should be noted, however, that these indicators focus only on Government 
expenditure and international assistance. They do not provide an indication of what a 
country&#8217;s available resources are, nor do they reveal the difficulties Governments face in 
raising the maximum available resources.25  
</p>
<p>22. Difficulties in mobilizing sufficient resources for the realization of economic, social 
and cultural rights arise at both the domestic and international levels. At the domestic level, 
obstacles include regressive taxation systems, generous tax incentive systems, weak tax 
administration and tax evasion and avoidance schemes.26 At the international level, a key 
obstacle is the volume of funds that countries lose each year through illicit flows.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Capacity of States to realize human rights  
</b></p>
<p>23. It is widely accepted that illicit funds (including the proceeds of corruption, money 
laundering, tax evasion and other crimes) divert resources intended for investment in 
policies and programmes that contribute to the establishment of conditions for the 
realization of economic, social and cultural rights or to establish and strengthen institutions 
for the protection of civil and political rights.27 According to OECD, illicit financial flows 
have a &#8220;damaging impact&#8221; on the ability of developing countries to mobilize their own 
financial resources for investment, and &#8220;the most immediate impact of such illicit flows is a 
reduction in domestic public and private expenditure and investment, which means fewer 
jobs, hospitals and schools, less infrastructure &#8211; and ultimately less development&#8221;.28 
</p><p>24. The diversion of resources due to illicit financial outflows and the non-repatriation 
of those funds reduce the maximum resources available to the countries of origin for the 
progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights. Put differently, illicit 
financial flows undermine the ability of States to comply with their obligation to devote the 
maximum available resources to the realization of human rights, particularly economic, 
social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>25. In its recent study on illicit financial flows, poverty and human rights, the 
International Bar Association made a pertinent observation. It has concluded that &#8220;actions 
of states that encourage or facilitate tax abuses, or that deliberately frustrate the efforts of 
other states to counter tax abuses, could constitute a violation of their international human 
rights obligations, particularly with respect to economic, social and cultural rights&#8221;.29 While 
this observation focuses on tax evasion, the Independent Expert considers that it is equally 
applicable to other forms of illicit financial flows, including those generated through 
corruption, bribery and theft of public funds.

<p>26. The repatriation of stolen assets makes available additional resources for 
development activities. The level of impact repatriated assets can have on human rights is 
however unclear, largely due to the fact that there is a lack of systematic information on the 
effectiveness of repatriated funds in reducing poverty in the countries of origin.30 In 
addition, the evidence from successful cases of asset repatriation indicates that utilization of 
those funds to reduce poverty depends on factors such as political will and assignment to 
priority areas.31  
</p>
<p>27. Nevertheless, it can be argued that repatriated assets have the potential to enhance 
the resources available to States to fund programmes required for the promotion and 
protection of human rights. According to the World Bank, every $100 million in stolen 
assets recovered could fund first-line treatment for over 600,000 persons with HIV/AIDS 
for a year, or some 250,000 water connections for poor households, or full immunization 
for 4 million children.32  
</p>
<p><b> D. The need for a human rights-based approach 
</b></p>
<p>28. It is important to consider efforts to tackle the problem of illicit financial flows and 
recover stolen assets as part of several efforts that States must make in order to comply with 
their human rights obligations, including the obligations to provide international assistance 
and cooperation (A/HRC/19/42 and Corr.1, para. 23) and to utilize the maximum available 
resources for the realization of human rights.  
</p>
<p>29. Although the repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin offers an 
opportunity for the Governments of those countries to invest in infrastructure and social 
programmes that ensure that the full range of human rights are respected, protected and 
fulfilled, the Independent Expert accepts that not all returned funds would automatically be 
channelled to human rights since there are other priorities, such as infrastructure. There is 
also the possibility of mismanagement, misappropriation33 and Government profligacy 
which could erode any positive human rights outcomes or even result in negative human 
rights outcomes. 
</p>
<p>30. In view of the fact that States may not necessarily have the capacity or political will, 
and that funds may be mismanaged or misappropriated, the challenge is to ensure efficient, 
accountable and transparent use of such assets. This underscores the importance of a human 
rights-based approach to dealing with recovered stolen assets (see A/HRC/19/42 and 
Corr.1). In that regard, the Independent Expert considers that a human rights-based 
approach, with its emphasis on the key human rights principles of non-discrimination, 
participation, transparency and accountability, could ensure that returned assets are spent in 
a manner that reflects the public will, meets the needs of society and promotes human 
rights, in particular of the marginalized groups.34 
</p>
<p>31. A review of some case studies concerning the utilization of repatriated funds would 
seem to support this view. The studies indicate that the prudent and effective use of 
recovered assets to fund poverty alleviation programmes requires robust oversight

<p>mechanisms.35 Without such mechanisms, recovered assets can be misappropriated or 
mismanaged. 
</p>
<p>32. Moreover, since recovered assets are not foreseen or public income included in the 
budget, States must allocate them in accordance with their obligation to devote the 
maximum of available resources to the fulfilment of economic, social and cultural rights 
(A/HRC/19/42 and Corr.1, para. 28). 
</p><p>33. During the expert consultation convened by the Independent Expert in June 2013, a 
number of States emphasized that where requested States return funds identified as funds of 
illicit origin to the country of origin, they should do so without any conditions. The 
Independent Expert fully supports that position. The use of returned assets is a matter for 
the sovereign decision of the country that recovers its stolen assets. A State which does not 
own the assets in question cannot claim the right to attach conditions as to their use upon 
return: this would be inconsistent with the right of peoples to self-determination, which 
includes the inalienable right to full sovereignty over all their natural wealth and 
resources.36 
</p>
<p><b> IV. The importance of international assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>34. Illicit financial flows are a global problem, but success in countering them requires 
concerted efforts from the international community, complemented by appropriate domestic 
measures to address corruption, money laundering, corporate tax evasion and avoidance 
schemes and to improve investment codes. That implies a commitment by all States to the 
principle of international assistance and cooperation.  
</p>
<p><b> A. The obligation of international assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>35. Under international law, States have an obligation of international assistance and 
cooperation to support the realization of human rights.37 Article 2, paragraph 1 of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights specifically refers to an 
obligation to take steps, including through international assistance and cooperation, to 
realize the rights enshrined in the Covenant. It thus clearly affirms an obligation to engage. 
Similarly, the Convention on the Rights of the Child enjoins States to take measures to 
implement the economic, social and cultural rights in the treaty to the maximum extent of 
their available resources and, where needed, within the framework of international 
cooperation (art. 4).38  
</p><p>36. The Declaration on the Right to Development also embodies the principle of 
international cooperation. Under article 3, paragraph 1, it indicates that States have the 
primary responsibility for the creation of national and international conditions favourable to 
the realization of the right to development. According to the high-level task force on the 
implementation of the right to development, &#8220;the responsibility for the creation of this 
enabling environment encompasses three main levels: (a) States acting collectively in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>36
 Declaration on the Right to Development, art. 1, para. 2.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>37
 See also the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (art. 28); the Declaration on the Right to 
</p>
<p>Development (art. 3, para. 3); and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights (arts. 22 and 23). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>38
 Articles 24, paragraph 4, and 28, paragraph 3, of the Convention require States to promote and 
</p>
<p>encourage international cooperation in regard to the rights to health and to education, taking particular 
account of the needs of developing countries. </p>


<p>global and regional partnerships; (b) States acting individually as they adopt and implement 
policies that affect persons not strictly within their jurisdiction; and (c) States acting 
individually as they formulate national development policies and programmes affecting 
persons within their jurisdiction&#8221; (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.2, annex, p. 8). 
</p><p>37. The Maastricht Principles on Extraterritorial Obligations of States in the Area of 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also demand that States take measures either 
individually or through international cooperation in order to protect the economic, social 
and cultural rights of people within and beyond their territory.39  
</p>
<p>38. While article 2, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights refers in particular to economic and technical assistance and cooperation, it 
does not limit the undertaking to such measures. Thus, according to the commentary to the 
Maastricht Principles, international assistance must be understood as a component of 
international cooperation: &#8220;International assistance may, and depending on the 
circumstances must, comprise other measures, including provision of information to people 
in other countries, or cooperation with their state, for example, to trace stolen public funds 
or to cooperate in the adoption of measures to prevent human trafficking.&#8221;40 
</p>
<p>39. Based on the above interpretation, the Independent Expert considers that the duty of 
international assistance and cooperation extends to international cooperation in tackling 
factors that facilitate illicit financial flows and in ensuring the recovery of stolen assets. 
That is confirmed by the Convention against Corruption and other instruments on 
corruption, all of which contain provisions on international cooperation and/or mutual legal 
assistance.41 
</p>
<p>40. In relation to the activities of non-State actors, in particular transnational 
corporations, the Maastricht Principles underscore that States &#8220;should cooperate in order to 
ensure that any victim of the activities of non-state actors that results in a violation of 
economic, social and cultural rights has access to an effective remedy, preferably of a 
judicial nature, in order to seek redress&#8221;.42 This requirement is of particular relevance to the 
issue of addressing the negative impacts of tax evasion and avoidance by transnational 
corporations.  
</p>
<p>41. Lastly, where States encourage or facilitate illicit financial flows, or deliberately 
frustrate the efforts of other States to counter such flows, they could be in breach of their 
international human rights obligations, particularly with respect to economic, social and 
cultural rights.43 In that regard, it is notable that the Maastricht Principles underline that 
States that receive a request to assist or cooperate and are in a position to do so must 
consider the request in good faith,44 and respond in a manner consistent with their

<p>obligations. This is of particular importance in relation to requests for repatriation of stolen 
assets or illicit funds. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Recovery and repatriation of stolen assets 
</b></p>
<p>42. The recovery and repatriation of stolen assets to their country of origin is an 
important component of the fight against illicit financial flows.45 In relation to illicit funds 
generated through corruption by public officials, it serves a number of purposes. First, it 
can provide much needed additional resources to the countries of origin for public 
investment. Secondly, by indicating that there are consequences to corruption and the 
proceeds of corruption will not easily be concealed, it can have a deterrent effect on 
corruption and embezzlement by public officials. Lastly, by depriving corrupt officials of 
their loot, asset recovery can provide justice for the victims of corruption.46 
</p><p>43. The recovery of stolen assets is a complex, time-consuming and costly undertaking. 
Obstacles include the challenge of locating the stolen funds, inconsistent legal requirements 
across borders,47 lack of legal expertise in requesting countries, lack of political will in 
requesting and requested countries,48 and lack of coordination between national and 
international agencies. That suggests that international assistance and cooperation is critical 
to the successful recovery of stolen assets.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Tackling secrecy jurisdictions and corporate abuses  
</b>44. As noted in the interim report of the Independent Expert (A/HRC/22/42 and Corr.1, 
paras. 5&#8211;9), a key driver of illicit financial flows and therefore an obstacle to the capacity of 
States to utilize their maximum available resources is the prevalence of tax evasion, in 
particular by multinational companies. This is compounded by a lack of transparency in 
relation to the operations of those entities, the existence of secrecy jurisdictions as well as 
the use of shell companies, anonymous trust accounts, bogus charitable foundations, 
money-laundering techniques and questionable trade practices.49  
</p>
<p>45. According to one recent report, developing countries lose between &#8364;660 billion and 
&#8364;870 billion each year in illicit financial flows, mainly in the form of tax evasion by 
multinational companies.50 The report finds that &#8220;there is a significant discrepancy between 
tough political rhetoric&#8221; from the Governments of the 13 European countries surveyed and 
their actions. All of the countries surveyed were failing to demand sufficient levels of tax 
transparency from companies, the majority were reluctant to establish public access to 
information on the beneficial ownership of companies, trusts or foundations in their

<p>jurisdiction and none supported the equal inclusion of developing countries in 
policymaking on tax evasion in practice. All supported the position of the European Union 
that OECD should be the leading decision-making forum on those issues.51  
</p>
<p>46. It should be noted that OECD lacks global legitimacy in financial governance and, 
in particular, that its resolutions do not take the interests of developing countries 
sufficiently into account.52 
</p>
<p>47. To ensure transparency in payment flows, it is critical that States should require 
transnational corporations to make full disclosure in their annual statements of account and 
financial reports for all subsidiaries and holdings in the countries in which they are 
achieving turnover, earning returns and paying tax. 
</p>
<p>48. The Independent Expert also considers that robust international action is required to 
address the issue of secrecy jurisdictions. Regrettably, existing efforts in that regard by 
organizations such as the Group of 20 have not been very successful.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>49. <b>Illicit financial flows deprive Governments of substantial resources they need to 
fund programmes that contribute to the realization of economic, social and cultural 
rights, and to establish and strengthen the institutions for the protection and 
promotion of civil and political rights. While official development assistance remains 
an important source of finance for poverty alleviation and development, the 
substantial amounts lost to illicit financial flows &#8212; estimated at US$ 946.7 billion in 
2011 &#8212; could help the efforts of developing countries to mobilize domestic resources 
for poverty alleviation, development and the realization of human rights, and to 
reduce their dependence on external financing, which can lead to the erosion of 
ownership of national development agendas and promote a paternalistic or charitable 
attitude towards developing countries. To ensure that repatriated illicit funds provide 
the most benefit for the populations of the countries of origin, such funds should be 
managed and spent in accordance with the principles underpinning a human rights-
based approach; repatriated illicit funds can enhance the maximum available 
resources. 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>In order to assist States in their efforts to counter the problem of illicit financial 
flows and to ensure the successful repatriation of illicit funds, as well as their efficient 
use for the realization of human rights, the Independent Expert recommends that : 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) States should ensure the prompt and unconditional repatriation of funds 
of illicit origin to the countries of origin; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Countries of origin should ensure that decisions concerning the use of 
repatriated assets are taken in accordance with the principles underpinning a human 
rights-based approach and that the assets are used in a manner that reflects the will of 
the population and with particular sensitivity to the situation of marginalized groups; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) States should strengthen efforts under chapter VI of the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption to build the capacity, including through specialized 
training, of investigators, prosecutors and the judiciary in developing countries in the 
areas of anti-corruption, tax evasion and asset recovery;

<p><b> (d) States should establish an intergovernmental forum on tax under the 
auspices of the United Nations to serve as the main decision-making body on 
international tax policies. This would ensure that developing countries participate on 
an equal basis in the reform of existing international tax rules; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) States should consider establishing an intergovernmental forum on illicit 
financial flows under the auspices of the United Nations to further explore policy 
responses to the phenomenon and to coordinate the efforts of the various 
organizations involved in addressing different forms of illicit financial flows; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) States should consider elaborating a comprehensive international treaty 
on issues related to illicit financial flows, such as tax evasion, profit shifting by 
multinational companies and limiting the ability of secrecy jurisdictions to facilitate 
illicit financial flows; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) States should address the obscurity of information on the beneficial 
ownership of companies, trusts and other legal entities through which the proceeds of 
corruption and other illicit funds are often channelled; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) States should enact legislation to address abuses by multinational 
corporations and other business enterprises, such as tax evasion and avoidance, which 
deprive Governments of domestic resources for the implementation of their 
development agendas. Such legislation should, inter alia, require multinational 
corporations to publicly report, on a country-by-country basis, the name of each 
country where they operate and the names of all subsidiaries in each country of 
operation; the financial performance of the corporation or group (including sales, 
purchases, labour costs and profits, and distinguishing between sales within the group 
and to other companies); the value of all their assets in that country and the cost to 
maintain those assets; and full details of tax liabilities (including amounts paid and 
owed); 
 (i) States should undertake further analysis of the negative impact of illicit 
financial flows in the context of the post-2015 development agenda; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) States should reconsider special tax holidays, incentives and rates that 
ultimately reduce the level of resources available to Governments for fulfilling their 
human rights obligations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) States should conduct country-specific analyses of the reasons 
underlying illicit financial flows in order to inform appropriate policy responses; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) States should include information on the amounts lost through illicit 
financial flows, the factors driving such flows and a comprehensive analysis of the impact 
of the flows in their reports to the United Nations treaty bodies and under the universal 
periodic review.
