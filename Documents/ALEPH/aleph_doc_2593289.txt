0.95x.
Financial and Operating Results Overview
The underlying financial performance of VTTI for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016 was
consistent with the performance of the Partnership during the comparative period in 2015.
Mr. Rob Nijst, Chief Executive Officer of VTTI, stated: “VTTI achieved another strong financial
and operating performance in line with expectation for the second quarter of 2016 with close to
full utilization across the portfolio.”
Total operating income for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016, was $30.1 million while net
income was $17.2 million compared to total operating income of $28.5 million and net income of
$20.3 million for the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the second quarter ended
June 30, 2016 was $47.4 million, compared to the second quarter of 2015 of $47.9 million. The
Partnership generated $12.6 million of distributable cash flow(1) for the second quarter ended
June 30, 2016, compared to distributable cash flow of $14.3 million for the second quarter of
2015.
(1) Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. See Appendix A for a
reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.
Cash Distribution
On July 25 2016, the Board declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3204 per unit with respect
to the second quarter of 2016, equivalent to $1.282 per unit on an annualized basis and
representing a 3.1% increase on the quarterly cash distribution of the fourth quarter 2015. The
implied distribution coverage ratio was 0.95x. The cash distribution will be paid on August 12,
2016, to unitholders of record as of the close of business on August 8, 2016.
Financing and Liquidity
As of June 30, 2016, the Partnership had cash and cash equivalents of $14.5 million and total
unaffiliated debt outstanding of $546.7 million (excluding restricted cash and debt held by
affiliates). As of June 30, 2016, there was an undrawn amount of approximately $228 million
available under our €300 million revolving credit facility.
We believe that our current resources, including cash generated by the operations of the
Partnership, are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of our ongoing business.
Outlook
Mr. Rob Nijst, Chief Executive Officer of VTTI commented: “The international storage market
remains supportive of international storage demand with growth expected in global product
consumption and inter-regional flows in the long-term. VTTI B.V. continues to look for additional
expansion opportunities, both from internal organic opportunities and external strategic
greenfield or brownfield acquisitions.”

APPENDIX A—RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA
We define EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax
expense, depreciation and amortization expense, other finance expense, gain (loss) on foreign
currency transactions and gain (loss) on derivative financial instruments (EBITDA); as further
adjusted to reflect realized cash gains on forward foreign exchange contracts, certain other non-
cash, non-recurring items, and to exclude the revenues from the Phase 2 assets of our Malaysian
terminal in excess of the costs incurred to operate Phase 2 which are attributable to VTTI B.V.
(Adjusted EBITDA).
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that management and
external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating
agencies, may use to assess our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded
partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing
methods, and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns
on investment in various opportunities.
We believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to
management in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. GAAP
measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is net income. Our non-
GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as
alternatives to U.S. GAAP net income. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations
as analytical tools because these exclude some but not all items that affect net income. You
should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our
results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined
differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its
utility.
The following table reconciles net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the second
quarters ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Please note that we have revised our historical
methods of calculating non-GAAP financial measures to reflect recent guidance on the
calculation of such measures.

Distributable Cash Flow (“DCF”)
In determining the amount of cash to distribute to our unitholders, the Board of Directors of our
general partner evaluates the amount of distributable cash flow. As used by the Board of
Directors, distributable cash flow represents Adjusted EBITDA after considering certain period
cash payments including maintenance capital expenditures, certain period cash receipts and
other reserves established by the Partnership.
Maintenance capital expenditures represent capital expenditures required to maintain over the
long-term the operating capacity of, or the revenue generated by, our capital assets. Cash
interest expense includes interest expense attributable to our Senior Unsecured Notes, VTTI
Operating Revolving Credit Facility, Related Party MLP Loan Agreement (as defined in our
Annual Report filed on Form 20-F on April 29, 2016), periodic cash settlement amounts for
interest rate swap derivative financial instruments and other cash finance expenses.
Distributable cash flow is a quantitative standard used by investors in publicly-traded
partnerships to assist in evaluating a partnership’s ability to make quarterly cash distributions.
Distributable cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an
alternative to net income or any other indicator of the Partnership’s performance calculated in
accordance with U.S. GAAP.

ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
