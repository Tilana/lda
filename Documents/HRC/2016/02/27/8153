</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children 
visited Thailand from 8 to 19 August 2011, at the invitation of the Government. In the 
present report, the Special Rapporteur highlights the country&#8217;s commitment and progress in 
</p>
<p>combating trafficking in persons, as evidenced by its anti-trafficking legislation, which 
accords with international standards, the effective partnership with civil society 
organizations in investigating trafficking cases, and the high level of regional and 
subregional cooperation in combating trafficking in persons. The Special Rapporteur 
nonetheless expresses concerns with regard to, inter alia, the lack of capacity and 
willingness of law enforcement authorities to properly identify trafficked persons, the 
arrest, detention and summary deportation of trafficked persons, the lack of adequate 
support for the recovery of trafficked persons in shelters, the low rate of prosecution and 
delays in prosecuting trafficking cases, as well as the insufficient efforts made to tackle the 
root causes, such as restrictive immigration policies and the abuse of the human rights of 
migrants. On this basis, the Special Rapporteur makes a number of recommendations to the 
Government, including increasing capacity-building activities for relevant governmental 
officials, staffing the shelters with appropriate psychologists, social workers, health 
professionals and interpreters, strengthening labour protection for all workers, including 
migrant workers, and creating more opportunities for safe labour migration.

<p><b> I. Introduction and methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, conducted an official visit to Thailand from 8 to 19 August 2011, at the 
invitation of the Government. The objectives of the visit were to examine prevalent forms 
of trafficking in persons in the country and to assess the effectiveness of measures taken by 
the Government to combat trafficking in persons and to protect the human rights of 
trafficked persons.  
</p>
<p>2. During her mission, the Special Rapporteur visited Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Mae Sot, 
Samut Sakorn and Songkhla. She met high-level officials of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, the Ministry of Labour, 
the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Justice. She also met with the Deputy 
Commissioner-General of the Royal Thai Police, prosecutors of the Office of the Attorney-
General and members of the judiciary. She also met with representatives of the National 
Human Rights Council in Bangkok. At the provincial level, she engaged with the Provincial 
Operation Centres on Human Trafficking in Chiang Mai, Samut Sakorn, Songkhla and Tak 
Provinces. The Special Rapporteur also met representatives of civil society organizations 
working in the field of trafficking in persons. Lastly, she visited immigration detention 
centres in Bangkok and Mae Sot, as well as shelters for trafficked persons, managed by the 
Government or civil society organizations. The Special Rapporteur expresses her gratitude 
to the Government for its invitation and cooperation, and to the civil society organizations 
for their valuable inputs.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Main findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Migration trends in the Greater Mekong Subregion  
</b></p>
<p>3. Thailand has achieved remarkable economic growth over the past 30 years. With 
rapid industrialization, its labour market faced a serious shortage of low-skilled labour, 
which was filled by a large influx of migrants from neighbouring countries, most notably 
Cambodia, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic and Myanmar. Many also fled these 
countries owing to internal conflict, political instability and human rights violations. Today, 
Thailand is the largest destination country in the Subregion for migrant workers from the 
above-mentioned countries.1  
</p>
<p>4. The majority of migrants in Thailand have irregular migration status, having entered 
the country through irregular means or subsequently become irregular. The entry, 
recruitment and employment of low-skilled migrant workers are poorly regulated under 
Thai law. Migrants are often recruited by unscrupulous brokers, who lure them to Thailand 
with false promises of lucrative employment opportunities.  
</p>
<p>5. In order to promote legal labour migration, the Government entered into bilateral 
memorandums of understanding with Cambodia, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic 
and Myanmar, which facilitate recruitment of migrant workers from these countries. To 
date, 106,733 migrant workers (74,399 Cambodians, 24,464 Laotians and 7,870 Myanmar 
</p>
<p>  
 1  As at the end of 2009, the total number of registered migrants from these countries was 1,314,382, 
</p>
<p>comprising 124,761 from Cambodia, 110,854 from the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic and 
</p>
<p>1,078,767 from Myanmar. These figures do not account for irregular migrants, those completing 
nationality verification or those brought in through memorandums of understanding.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>nationals) have been recruited on the basis of this arrangement. Furthermore, in an attempt 
to regularize the situation of irregular migrant workers already in the country, the 
Government launched a nationality verification process for Cambodian and Laotian 
nationals in 2006 and for Myanmar nationals in 2009, whereby registered migrants from 
these countries already in Thailand may obtain regular migration status and a work permit 
for two years upon verification of their nationality by the Government of their country of 
origin. However, the process has been fraught with difficulties owing to a range of factors, 
including its complexity, its high cost, the lack of adequate information about the process 
and tight deadlines. As a result, while 1,310,690 migrants were said to be eligible under the 
scheme, only 518,831 migrants completed the process as at July 2011. Approximately 
300,000 migrants did not even apply for registration by the initial deadline of 31 March 
</p><p>2010. While the Government of Thailand approved in 2011 the opening of a new migrant 
registration period for all workers from Cambodia, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic 
and Myanmar, it is currently unclear whether, how or when these workers will go through 
the nationality verification process. 
</p>
<p>6. Irregular migrants are in a vulnerable position owing to their migration status, and 
are often exposed to abuse and exploitation, including physical or psychological abuse, 
poor working or living conditions, withholding or non-payment of wages, and excessive 
working hours, as well as arbitrary arrest and extortion by law enforcement authorities. The 
lack of opportunities for safe migration for low-skilled labour, inadequate, ineffective 
regulations in recruitment of migrant workers, deep-rooted discrimination against migrants 
and the absence of mechanisms to protect migrants&#8217; human rights are main factors 
contributing to trafficking in persons in Thailand.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Forms and manifestations of trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p>7. Thailand faces significant challenges as a source, transit and destination country. As 
a source country, Thai nationals are trafficked to countries in different regions, including 
Australia, Bahrain, China, Germany, Israel, Japan, South Africa and the United States of 
America. Conversely, as a destination country, it receives trafficked persons, mainly from 
Cambodia, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam. Trafficked 
persons may also transit through Thailand to destination countries, especially Malaysia and 
Indonesia. 
</p>
<p>8. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur focuses on prevalent forms of 
trafficking in Thailand as a destination and transit country and assesses the effectiveness of 
its counter-trafficking responses within the country. On the basis of this framework of 
analysis, the Special Rapporteur observed that the below forms of trafficking in persons are 
particularly widespread in Thailand.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Trafficking for labour exploitation  
</b></p>
<p>9. The trafficking of men, women and children for labour exploitation is growing in 
scale in various sectors, including agricultural, construction, fishing, seafood processing, 
manufacturing and textile industries. In particular, the trafficking of migrant men and boys 
for labour exploitation on fishing boats is notoriously widespread. Migrants from 
neighbouring countries, most notably Cambodia and Myanmar, are often recruited by 
brokers and trafficked onto fishing boats, which travel throughout South-east Asia and 
beyond. Many of them arrive in Thailand through informal and often clandestine channels, 
such as by crossing rivers by boat or walking through the jungle for days. They often agree 
to have the broker&#8217;s fee deducted from their wages, as they are unable to pay the fee 
</p>
<p>upfront. They are commonly unaware of or misinformed about the type of job that they </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>would engage in or their working conditions. Once in Thailand, they are trapped and forced 
to work on fishing boats to pay off their debts.  
</p>
<p>10. Typical working conditions on fishing boats are inhumane and degrading. The 
Special Rapporteur spoke to a number of migrants from Myanmar, who reported that they 
were forced to work on fishing boats for as long as 18 to 20 hours per day for seven days a 
week, were physically and verbally abused, given very little or inedible food, and were not 
paid at all or paid a meagre amount of money, contrary to what they had been promised. 
Many of the trafficked fishermen allegedly witnessed the killing of their fellow fishermen 
by the boat captains and threatened with death if they did not work hard. Furthermore, they 
complained of lack of access to medical services on the boats, and those who fell ill were 
either beaten so that they would continue working or left to die and thrown overboard. As 
one trafficked fisherman stated, they were treated as &#8220;reusable merchandise rather than as 
human beings&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur also met with migrant women who had been trafficked from 
Myanmar to work in seafood processing, garment and manufacturing factories. The women 
came to Thailand with promises of well-paid jobs on the understanding that they would pay 
back the broker&#8217;s fee with their wages. They inevitably fell into situations of debt bondage 
after their arrival in Thailand. This pattern of abuse is exemplified by a well-reported case 
in which more than 60 migrant workers from Myanmar were trafficked for forced labour in 
a garment factory in the Din Daeng area of Bangkok. Although the migrant workers were 
promised a monthly wage ranging from 7,000 to 10,000 baht (($223 to $319), they were 
paid only 200 baht ($6.40) per month, as they allegedly owed the employer debts of 15,000 
baht ($479) each for the costs of recruitment. The workers were locked inside the factory 
and forced to work from 8 a.m. until midnight.  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur noted with great concern that, in many cases, victims of 
labour trafficking include children from Cambodia, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic 
and Myanmar. The information received suggests that children are trafficked and forced to 
work in a variety of sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing and domestic work. Even 
in the fishing sector, where the work is too strenuous for children, reports suggest that 
migrant children, even those under the age of 15 in some instances, are trafficked to work 
on fishing boats. The Special Rapporteur met with a 15-year-old boy from Myanmar who 
was trafficked to work on fishing boats at the age of 12. His job consisted of lifting boxes 
of fish and pulling the fishing net from dusk until dawn, seven days a week, until he was 
cast off the boat for being too weak to work.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Trafficking for sexual exploitation  
</b></p>
<p>13. Thailand reportedly remains a hub in the Greater Mekong Subregion for trafficking 
in women and children for the purpose of sexual exploitation, although reports suggest that 
it has been significantly reduced over the past decade. The prevalence of tourism and the 
continuing demand for sexual services are some of the underlying factors contributing to 
trafficking in women and children for sexual exploitation. A large number of women and 
children from neighbouring countries, in particular Cambodia, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic 
Republic and Myanmar, and from hill tribes in North and North-eastern Thailand, are lured 
to urban areas of Thailand with the promise of a well-paid job and forced into prostitution. 
The Special Rapporteur learned of a case of nine Shan women from Myanmar who were 
trafficked to Thailand for prostitution. They were told by the broker in Myanmar that they 
would be employed in a sewing factory in Bangkok. Upon arrival in Thailand, however, 
they were detained and told that they would have to provide sexual services. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Other forms of trafficking in persons  
</b></p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur observed that trafficking for forced marriage is also 
emerging in Thailand. For example, she interviewed a widowed woman from Myanmar 
who was sold and trafficked to Thailand to work on a construction site. She was 
subsequently transferred by her brokers to a Myanmar man living in Thailand who locked 
her up in a room, forced her to marry him and treated her as his sex slave.  
</p>
<p>15. Another form of trafficking brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur is 
trafficking for surrogacy. She was informed that 15 Vietnamese women were reportedly 
brought to Thailand by a Taiwanese company that offered surrogacy services online for 
childless couples. The women reportedly came to Thailand on the promise of a well-paid 
job. Upon arrival in Thailand, the women&#8217;s passports were reportedly withheld and they 
</p>
<p>were confined to the company&#8217;s premises against their will. When the authorities raided the 
</p>
<p>premises in March 2011, two of the 15 women had already given birth and seven of them 
were pregnant.  
</p>
<p>16. In addition, children from neighbouring countries, in particular Cambodia, are 
known to have been trafficked for the purpose of forced begging. In 2010, the authorities 
identified two cases of trafficking for forced begging; the traffickers were arrested in both 
cases. In one case, two Cambodian children, both aged 10 years, were promised jobs as 
apple pickers in Thailand, but were forced to work as beggars. They were physically 
assaulted and abused if they did not earn enough to satisfy the traffickers. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legislative, policy and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p>17. Thailand is party to a number of key international human rights instruments, 
including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child. It has also ratified the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), the Abolition of 
Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105) and the Worst Forms of Child Labour 
Convention, 1999 (No. 182) of the International Labour Organization (ILO). Regrettably, 
Thailand has signed but not yet become party to the Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime, Furthermore, it is not party to the International Convention 
on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.  
</p>
<p>18. Despite delaying its accession to the above-mentioned Trafficking Protocol, the 
Government has made conscientious efforts to establish a domestic legal framework that 
clearly defines trafficking in persons and seeks to prevent and combat trafficking in 
persons. Section 6 of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act (2008) defines trafficking in 
persons as the following acts committed for the purpose of exploitation:  
</p>
<p>procuring, buying, selling, vending, bringing from or sending to, detaining or 
confining, harbouring or receiving any person, by means of the threat or use of 
force, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of the giving money or benefits 
to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person in allowing 
the offender to exploit the person under his control.  
</p>
<p>19. In accordance with the Trafficking Protocol, it is considered a trafficking offence in 
cases involving children, even when none of the specified means is used. The Anti-
Trafficking in Persons Act is an important step forward, as it is the first legislation that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>explicitly recognizes trafficking for the purposes of exploitation other than sexual 
exploitation. The crime of trafficking is punishable by imprisonment for a period ranging 
from four to 10 years and a fine from 80,000 to 200,000 baht ($2,557 to $6,393). The Act 
also provides for important protection and remedial measures, including the rights of 
trafficked persons to receive assistance, to seek compensation for damages and to 
temporarily regularize their legal status.  
</p>
<p>20. In addition to the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, other legislation may be invoked 
to prosecute trafficking or trafficking-related offences. The<b> </b>Penal Code<b> </b>punishes offences 
that may amount to trafficking and other forms of exploitation, such as sexual exploitation 
and slavery. Most notably, section 283 punishes anyone who &#8220;procures, seduces or takes 
away&#8221; a person by using deceitful means, threats, violence, unjust influence or coercion in 
order to &#8220;gratify the sexual desire of another person&#8221;. Furthermore, section 312 prohibits 
&#8220;bringing into or sending out of the Kingdom, removing, buying and selling, disposing, 
accepting or restraining any person&#8221; for the purpose of slavery.  
</p>
<p>21. Section 9 of the Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution Act (1996)<b> </b>prohibits 
procuring, seducing or taking away any person for the purpose of prostitution, even with his 
or her consent; offenders are punishable by imprisonment for a term of one to 10 years and 
a fine of 20,000 to 200,000 baht ($639 to $6,393). The Act also prohibits prostitution per se 
and punishes anyone who solicits a person in public places (sect. 5) or who &#8220;associates with 
another person in a prostitution establishment&#8221; for the purpose of prostitution (sect. 6). 
While the person is not guilty of the offence if prostitution is coerced (sect. 6), this 
exemption has not been consistently applied to protect trafficked persons forced into 
prostitution from prosecution.  
</p>
<p>22. The Labour Protection Act (1998) sets out minimum labour protection standards, 
including minimum wages, the limitation of working hours, and the provision of paid leave 
and overtime pay. The Act also prohibits the recruitment of children under the age of 15 
years (sect. 44) and imposes certain safeguards when a child over the age of 15 years is 
hired (sects. 45-52). A major weakness of the Act is that it does not apply to certain 
informal sectors in which trafficked persons are often exploited, such as agriculture and 
domestic work.2 With regard to the fishing sector, the Act does not protect workers on a 
fishing vessel with fewer than 20 crew members or those on a vessel that is outside Thai 
territorial waters for more than one year.3 
</p>
<p>23. The Child Protection Act (2003) establishes the minimum standards for treatment of 
children and provides for welfare assistance available to children in need. The Act prohibits 
exploitative acts often committed in the process of trafficking, such as using or employing a 
child in a way that may be physically or mentally harmful to the child or affect the child&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>growth or development. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Policy framework  
</b></p>
<p>24. Since 2004, Thailand has addressed the fight against trafficking in persons as a 
priority on its national agenda. On 11 May 2010, the Cabinet approved the second National 
Policy, Strategy and Measures for the Prevention and Suppression of Trafficking in Persons 
for the period 2011-2016, which focuses on five target areas: prevention, prosecution, 
protection and assistance, development of policy mechanisms, and development and 
effective administration of information. While the policy is a positive initiative and clearly 
sets out aims, target groups and responsible agencies in each target area, it lacks specific 
</p>
<p>  
 2  Ministerial regulation 9.  
 3  Ministerial regulation 10.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>performance indicators and timelines, which will make effective monitoring and reporting 
very difficult.  
</p><p>25. The Government has also concluded numerous memorandums of understanding at 
the domestic level to promote effective coordination and implementation of measures to 
combat trafficking in women and children. Unfortunately, the memorandums are now out 
of date and out of step with the new legislative framework, as they only cover trafficking in 
women and children.  
</p>
<p>26. Memorandums of understanding have also been concluded at the provincial levels 
on operational procedures for concerned agencies in combating trafficking. The 
significance of these memorandums is that they establish and set out the functions and 
duties of two important coordination mechanisms: Provincial Operation Centres for the 
Prevention and Suppression of Human Trafficking, and the multidisciplinary team (see 
paragraph 27 below). There is, however, a critical need to streamline the memorandums 
with the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, as they do not adopt a consistent definition of 
trafficking in persons or ensure their proper implementation.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Institutional framework  
</b></p>
<p>27. Thailand has consistently adopted a multidisciplinary approach in combating 
trafficking in persons, and established Operation Centres for the Prevention and 
Suppression of Human Trafficking at the provincial and national levels, which coordinate 
activities among the public sector, the private sector and communities, and develop policies 
and measures on prevention and suppression of human trafficking. At the provincial level, 
there are 75 operation centres, each comprising officials of such relevant governmental 
authorities as the Provincial Police, the Provincial Public Prosecutor and the Provincial 
Labour Office, as well as representatives from civil society organizations. Under the 
provincial operation centres, a multidisciplinary team has been established for the purpose 
of conducting rescue operations to release and assist potential or actual victims of 
trafficking. The team comprises public prosecutors, police, administrative officers, 
physicians, social workers, psychologists, lawyers and interpreters. 
</p>
<p>28. The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act further strengthened the institutional framework 
by establishing two inter-agency committees at the national level. The Anti-Trafficking in 
Persons Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, is responsible for formulating strategies 
and measures for the prevention and suppression of trafficking in persons. The Committee 
comprises ministers of key agencies in the fight against trafficking, namely the Minister for 
Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Social Development and Human Security, the Minister for 
the Interior, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Tourism 
and Sports, as well as four experts in the fields of prevention, suppression, rehabilitation 
and international cooperation on trafficking. 
</p>
<p>29. The Coordinating and Monitoring of Anti-Trafficking in Persons Performance 
Committee, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, is primarily responsible for monitoring 
the implementation of operational and coordination plans of relevant Government agencies. 
The Committee comprises high-ranking officials of various Government agencies, 
including, inter alia, the Permanent Secretaries of the Ministry of Social Development and 
Human Security, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, the 
Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Labour, as well as the 
Attorney General, the Commissioner-General of the Royal Thai Police and the Director-
General of the Department for Special Investigations.  
</p>
<p>30. The lead governmental agency in this plethora of multidisciplinary structures is the 
Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, which acts as a secretariat to the 
operation centre at the national and provincial levels, the Anti-Trafficking in Persons </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Committee and the Coordinating and Monitoring of Anti-Trafficking in Persons 
Performance Committee, besides being responsible for providing trafficked persons with 
assistance pursuant to the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act. The Ministry is not adequately 
equipped with financial or human resources to support such high demands, which raises a 
critical need to either simplify and streamline the existing multidisciplinary structures or to 
allocate more resources to the Ministry and build its capacity. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur found it difficult to evaluate how the above-mentioned 
structures work in practice and to what level of effectiveness and efficiency they operate. 
Certainly there are no procedures or systems in place to properly monitor how the State&#8217;s 
various anti-trafficking mechanisms perform. In addition to rationalizing the current top-
heavy and complex structure, consideration should be given to how the country&#8217;s anti-
trafficking machinery can be made more accountable.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Identification of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>32. Investigating officers of the Royal Thai Police have primary responsibility for 
identifying trafficked persons in collaboration with other agencies in the multidisciplinary 
team. The Special Rapporteur found that trafficked persons are often misidentified as 
irregular migrants and, as a result, often arrested, detained and summarily deported. Official 
figures show that only 85 people were identified in 2010 as having been trafficked. On any 
reading of the scope of the problem in Thailand, it is clear that this number represents a tiny 
fraction of the total number of victims. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur heard allegations of deep-rooted corruption at all levels of 
law enforcement, which often hampers the effective identification of trafficked persons. 
She was informed of numerous cases in which police officers at the provincial or local level 
were directly implicated in trafficking in persons or turned a blind eye to the situations of 
trafficked persons. The prevalence of corruption results in deep mistrust of law enforcement 
officers by trafficked persons and those at risk of being trafficked, such as migrants and 
ethnic minorities.  
</p>
<p>34. Moreover, the inadequate capacity of police officers to apply the law and operational 
procedures is also a significant obstacle to the proper identification of trafficked persons. 
While a checklist for identification of trafficked persons exists, it is not explained in a 
simple language and there was no evidence that it is used consistently and systematically by 
law enforcement officials. This problem extends to other governmental authorities that are 
likely to encounter trafficked persons, such as immigration officials. The Special 
Rapporteur found that no effective identification procedures in immigration detention 
centres exist. In many cases, trafficked persons detained in the centres are briefly 
interviewed and summarily deported to their country of origin without any proper 
assessment of whether or not their return would be safe. 
</p>
<p>35. Furthermore, while there is increasing recognition of trafficking for labour 
exploitation, trafficking in persons is still viewed primarily as a problem concerning women 
and children. The information gathered suggests that the majority of trafficked persons 
identified by law enforcement officers are women and girls trafficked into commercial sex 
venues. According to a report of the Anti-Human Trafficking Division of the Royal Thai 
Police supplied by the Government, in 2010, 73 victims of trafficking for prostitution were 
identified, while only 10 and two victims were identified for the purpose of forced labour 
and forced begging, respectively, and none was identified for other forms of exploitation.  
</p>
<p>36. The general failure to identify victims of trafficking for labour exploitation may also 
be due, at least in part, to the fact that labour inspectors are not well equipped to identify 
such victims and have not been included in the multidisciplinary team. Many trafficked </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>persons stated that they had never seen any l inspectors in their workplaces. While it is 
reported that the Department of Welfare and Labour Protection of the Ministry of Labour 
inspected as many as 5,299 establishments in 2011, it is apparent that the Ministry faces 
challenges in conducting inspections in a comprehensive manner, given the lack of 
resources and the proliferation of small establishments, which are difficult to monitor. 
There is also an apparent unwillingness by the Ministry of Labour to intervene in situations 
of trafficking for labour exploitation on the grounds that violence and abuse in workplaces 
should be addressed by the Royal Thai Police rather than by the Ministry of Labour, which 
is exclusively concerned with working conditions.  
</p>
<p>37. In addition, there is a lack of appropriate infrastructures and services designed to 
facilitate the identification of trafficked persons, such as hotlines. The Ministry of Social 
Development and Human Security maintains a &#8220;1300&#8221; hotline, which is open 24 hours a 
day, seven days a week to take reports on a variety of social concerns, such as physical and 
sexual abuse and exploitation, including human trafficking. Regrettably, the hotline is 
available only in Thai and English, notwithstanding the fact that the trafficked persons in 
Thailand mostly speak other languages, such as Khmer, Burmese, Laotian or Vietnamese.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Protection, recovery and reintegration of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>38. While an adequate legal framework exists to protect trafficked persons from further 
harm and to assist trafficked persons in achieving full recovery, the Special Rapporteur 
found that the implementation of the framework remains weak, causing many trafficked 
persons to fall through protection gaps.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Non-criminalization of trafficked persons  
</b></p>
<p>39. Section 41 of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act provides that trafficked persons 
must not be prosecuted for the offence of irregular entry and stay in Thailand, giving false 
information, forging and using a forged travel document, and engaging in prostitution or in 
employment without a work permit. As discussed above, however, the reality is that the 
majority of trafficked persons are routinely misidentified as irregular migrants or criminals, 
and arrested, detained and deported to their countries of origin if they are foreigners. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Rescue operations  
</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur noted that the multidisciplinary teams in different provinces 
have successfully carried out a number of rescue operations in entertainment venues, such 
as karaoke bars. While active investigation of trafficking cases is encouraged, the Special 
Rapporteur was concerned that rescue operations often do not fully respect victims&#8217; human 
rights. In particular, organizations working with trafficked persons noted with concern that 
virtually no interpretation or translation services are offered to the victims with regard to 
why they have been apprehended or what their rights are at the time of the raid and in 
subsequent interviews and detention. Furthermore, it is reported that rescue operations often 
have a discriminatory impact on migrant workers who, when apprehended in raids, are 
often detained against their will in police cells or shelters as witnesses for the prosecution 
of trafficking cases.  
</p>
<p>41. In addition, there are related concerns that media fail to respect the privacy of 
trafficked persons following rescue operations. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, 
notwithstanding the prohibitions under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act to publish 
information or photographs identifying trafficked persons, pictures and details of police 
raids on entertainment venues showing &#8220;rescued&#8221; trafficked persons regularly appear in 
mainstream printed media, television and online. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Support for trafficked persons in recovery and reintegration 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Ministry of Social Development and Human Security has established nine 
shelters, which primarily accommodate Thai and non-Thai trafficked persons throughout 
the country. Four of the shelters were recently specifically designated for men. There are 
also 77 temporary homes throughout the country, where trafficked persons may be 
accommodated for a short period of time before they are remanded to the shelters.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur visited two of the nine shelters: Kredtrakarn Protection and 
Occupational Development Centre in Nonthaburi Province, and the Songkhla Protection 
and Occupation Development Centre for Men in Songkhla Province. The Kredtrakarn 
Centre is the largest shelter in the country and accommodates up to 550 trafficked or 
otherwise exploited women and girls. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, there 
</p>
<p>were 416 residents in total, of these, 186 residents &#8211; 29 Thais, 105 Laotians, 42 people from 
Myanmar and 10 Cambodians &#8211; were identified as victims of trafficking. The Centre 
provides accommodation in dormitories, three meals per day, basic medical care and 
counselling services. The Centre also provides vocational training, such as weaving, dress-
making, handcrafts and massage.  
</p>
<p>44. The recently established Songkhla Centre accommodates trafficked men of all 
nationalities over 18 years of age. To date, most of the residents have been Myanmar 
victims of trafficking for labour exploitation on fishing boats. The Centre provides residents 
with accommodation in dormitories, three meals per day, basic medical care and 
counselling services. The Songkhla Centre also provides vocational training; however, 
unlike Kredtrakarn, it allows residents to work in construction outside the Centre if they 
wish not to take vocational training in it.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the standard of these facilities, which 
were modern and clean. She is, however, concerned that the shelters, particularly 
Kredtrakarn, are tantamount to detention centres and impede the exercise of the right to 
movement and the right to earn income and live a decent life. Other rights potentially 
implicated include the right to leave any country and return to one&#8217;s own country, and the 
right to freedom from sex discrimination and arbitrary detention. 
</p>
<p>46. The stay at Kredtrakarn is often long for the women and girls involved, owing to 
delays in investigation and the prosecution of trafficking cases. Even in cases where a 
trafficked person chooses to be repatriated, the processes of family tracing and repatriation 
may be lengthy. As there is no option for trafficked persons to reside outside the shelter or 
leave Thailand before the authorities repatriate them, trafficked persons are obliged to stay 
at the shelter for a long time, which can be as long as two to three years. Moreover, the 
Kredtrakarn Centre is located on an island and accessible only by boat, which may 
exacerbate the feeling of isolation and loneliness for trafficked persons.  
</p>
<p>47. There is also inadequate professional staffing to provide trafficked persons with 
comprehensive support. Despite the fact that the vast majority of trafficked persons staying 
at the Kredtrakarn Centre are from Cambodia, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic and 
Myanmar, there are no on-site interpreters available to assist trafficked persons on a daily 
basis. Furthermore, there are only five social workers and three psychologists at the 
Kredtrakarn Centre, which seems utterly insufficient for a shelter with a maximum capacity 
of 550 residents. It is also reported that the Centre is not equipped with appropriate health 
professionals able to provide comprehensive health care, including specific medical care for 
women who have been subjected to sexual violence, such as access to emergency 
contraception, examination for sexually transmitted infections and counselling.  
</p>
<p>48. Furthermore, trafficked persons are not provided with suitable educational, 
vocational or employment opportunities while staying at the shelters, notwithstanding the 
fact that their stay may last for years. The children at the Kredtrakarn Centre, for instance, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>only have access to informal education inside the Centre, which effectively precludes them 
from receiving further education after they leave the shelters. The women and girls at the 
Kredtrakarn Centre are provided with vocational training traditionally associated with 
women, such as weaving and massaging, which may not correspond with their ambitions 
and talents, or the needs of the labour market. In addition, trafficked women are deprived of 
opportunities to earn income while staying in the shelter. At the Kredtrakarn Centre, 
products made by the residents are sold at a shop inside the Centre. Trafficked persons are 
said to earn 75 per cent of the price of their products; however, the information received 
suggests that, at most, they only receive 200 baht ($6.40) upon departure. The fact that they 
are unable to leave and the inability of trafficked persons to work and earn a living outside 
the shelter are reported to create a strong disincentive among trafficked persons in Thailand 
to be identified as such. In particular, there have been a number of cases where trafficked 
fishermen refused to be recognized as a trafficked person and/or escaped from the shelters 
so that they could return to work and continue to send back money to their families. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur recognizes that section 37 of the Ant-Trafficking in Persons 
Act provides trafficked persons with the right to temporarily stay and work in Thailand, and 
the Thai Cabinet passed a resolution on 4 May 2010 to give effect to this right. This right 
has not yet, however, been implemented in practice.  
</p>
<p>49. Effectively detained in shelters against their will, many trafficked persons become 
desperate and seek to be repatriated immediately to their countries of origin. This pattern is 
well illustrated by the case of Din Daeng (see paragraph 11 above). While the &#8220;rescued&#8221; 
trafficked women were initially sent to the Kredtrakarn Centre for protection and recovery, 
they were unable to tolerate the conditions at the Centre, and in particular their inability to 
work, and consequently sought desperately to be repatriated immediately to Myanmar. As a 
result, they were transferred to the Bangkok Immigration Detention Centre; at the time of 
the visit of the Special Rapporteur, they were awaiting repatriation. This poses a dilemma 
for the effective prosecution of cases, as trafficked persons may not wish to stay in 
Thailand to give evidence, preferring immediate repatriation. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Investigation, prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>50. Local police may investigate trafficking cases of a local nature, whereas those of an 
interprovincial or transnational nature are investigated by the Anti-Human Trafficking 
Division of the Royal Thai Police at the national level. Where the case concerns a 
transnational organized crime of a complex nature, the Department for Special 
Investigations under the Ministry of Justice may be assigned to investigate the case in lieu 
of or jointly with the Royal Thai Police. In cases of trafficking at sea, the Royal Thai 
Marine Police have authority to board and search vessels in coastal waters, although they 
do not have power to formally investigate and refer cases for prosecution. Once they 
identify cases of trafficking on fishing boats, they refer cases to the local police for further 
investigation and prosecution. 
</p>
<p>51. A number of factors hamper effective and swift investigation of trafficking cases by 
the Royal Thai Police. At the local level, police officials often do not have a comprehensive 
understanding of trafficking in persons and are not adequately trained to identify trafficked 
persons. Furthermore, the investigation and arrest of offenders in trafficking cases seem to 
be skewed towards cases involving prostitution rather than labour exploitation, as 
mentioned above. 
</p>
<p>52. At the local level, the Royal Thai Police are also susceptible to corruption and may 
be directly implicated in the crime of trafficking or shield traffickers from investigation and 
arrest for personal gain. At the national level, while some members of the Anti-Human 
Trafficking Division of the Royal Thai Police have adequate expertise, they are said to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>suffer from low morale and motivation, as there is no rewarding career path for specialists 
in human trafficking. As a consequence, well-trained officers often transfer to another 
division to seek career advancement, which prevents the institutionalization of experience 
and expertise, which is vital for effective investigation. 
</p>
<p>53. With regard to trafficking on fishing boats, investigation of such cases is practically 
non-existent, as the Marine Police are extremely underresourced and unable to maintain and 
operate patrol boats. Even where the Marine Police report cases of human trafficking to the 
local police, the matters are often not further investigated.  
</p>
<p>54. In the light of the limited capacity of the Royal Thai Police, some stakeholders 
expressed views that the Department for Special Investigations has more appropriate 
expertise and should thus play a more active role in investigating trafficking cases. Another 
advantage of the Department&#8217;s involvement is that it investigates cases in close cooperation 
with prosecutors from an early stage, thereby facilitating effective prosecution. 
Recognizing the increasing role for the Department in the field of trafficking, the 
Government recently assigned 50 new staff members thereto to create an anti-human 
trafficking department. It is not yet clear how this new entity will operate in practice and 
coordination with Royal Thai Police. Also, the issue of overlapping responsibility will need 
to be resolved. 
</p>
<p>55. A corollary of the limited level of investigation of trafficking cases is the equally 
low rate of prosecution. For example, of the 79 cases prosecuted in 2010, 56 are still 
ongoing (of the remainder, 18 guilty verdicts were secured and five cases were dismissed). 
While the total prosecution number represents a significant increase over the 22 
prosecutions conducted in 2009, it still appears to be very low vis-&#224;-vis the accepted 
prevalence of trafficking in persons in the country. The low prosecution rate is due to a 
combination of factors, including the relative absence of structures that would encourage 
effective witness cooperation. The lack of adequate training of prosecutors is also a 
contributing factor, although the training is progressively being scaled up. The OAG 
conceded that prosecutors are still in the process of familiarizing themselves with the new 
definition of trafficking in persons under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act. Prosecutors 
reportedly have difficulties in applying the concept of &#8220;exploitation&#8221; under the Act given 
that there is no precedent to guide the interpretation of this concept.  
</p>
<p>56. Delays in prosecution and conclusion of trials are of great concern, as is the 
significant backlog of cases. Trials may also take as long as a few years until a final verdict 
is reached. As an illustration, the Special Rapporteur was informed of a case concerning the 
domestic servitude of a 14-year-old Thai girl. While the defendant was found guilty in 
2006, the verdict was appealed and upheld three years later, in 2009. The verdict was 
further appealed to the Supreme Court; today, the case is still pending. While the Special 
Rapporteur acknowledges that pretrial deposition is possible so that trafficked persons may 
be repatriated before the trial begins, this procedure is not systematically applied in 
practice; indeed, this case illustrates the potential plight of victim-witnesses, who must 
remain in Thailand while their cases make their way through the overburdened legal 
system. Such delays can also act as a strong disincentive to investigators and prosecutors to 
pursue justice against traffickers.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Redress 
</b></p>
<p>57. While mechanisms for trafficked persons to seek compensation exist, victims of 
trafficking rarely receive adequate compensation, or indeed any at all. In the vast majority 
of cases, trafficked persons, if identified, opt not to seek compensation, given the expected 
delays and the small likelihood of success. Trafficked persons rarely have access to the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>necessary support and measures to seek compensation, such as legal aid and interpretation 
services.  
</p>
<p>58. Section 35 of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act explicitly recognizes the right of 
trafficked persons to compensation, and allows prosecutors to seek compensation on their 
behalf in criminal proceedings. It is also notable that the right to temporary stay under 
section 37 of the Act applies to trafficked persons for the purpose of initiating proceedings 
against the trafficker or for claiming compensation. These are important provisions and the 
Special Rapporteur commends them as an example of good practice in the region. To date, 
however, she has not heard of any cases in which compensation has been successfully 
awarded under the Act owing, at least in part, to the fact that prosecutors are not yet 
familiar with the procedures for seeking compensation under the Act.  
</p>
<p>59. Trafficked persons may also seek compensation in criminal proceedings under the 
Criminal Procedure Code. For instance, in the case of the 14-year-old Thai domestic worker 
referred to above (see paragraph 56), the abusive employer was ordered to pay 200,000 
baht ($6,392) in compensation. However, compensation through criminal proceedings is 
still rare and the Special Rapporteur was not informed of any other cases in which victims 
of trafficking were awarded compensation in criminal proceedings. 
</p>
<p>60. In comparison, labour proceedings have been relatively more successful and some 
compensation has been awarded to victims of trafficking. In many of these cases, however, 
the victims of trafficking for labour exploitation receive a woefully inadequate amount of 
compensation for lost wages that does not correspond to the minimum wage. For example, 
in a case concerning nine migrant workers from Myanmar who were trafficked to work on a 
fishing boat in Patani and rescued by a raid on 24 February 2011, the victims were awarded 
a total of 270,000 baht ($8,650) by the Labour Court &#8211; 30,000 baht ($961) each, or an 
average of $50 per month, which is below the minimum wage and does not compensate the 
victims for any other damages incurred.  
</p>
<p>61. It is also noted that cases resulting in the awarding of compensation are limited to 
cases of labour exploitation in sectors other than sexual services. Concerns have been 
voiced that trafficked persons forced into prostitution are often not properly informed of 
their right to compensation, as prostitution is illegal and they thus are considered to be 
undeserving victims.  
</p>
<p>62. In certain circumstances, permanent or temporary residence in itself may be a 
necessary and appropriate form of remedy. This consideration is particularly pertinent in 
the case of Thailand, where trafficked persons returned to their country of origin can be at 
serious risk of being retrafficked to Thailand or of severe violations of their human rights. 
The Special Rapporteur was particularly concerned about numerous reports that trafficked 
persons from Myanmar are often deported through informal checkpoints at the Thai-
Myanmar border to an area controlled by the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA). It 
is reported that the DKBA demand money from the deportees, which reportedly varies 
between 1,000 and 2,000 baht ($32 to $64). Persons unable to pay are subjected to violence 
and forced labour at the hands of the DKBA, or are sold to unscrupulous brokers for 
retrafficking back to Thailand. Credible reports suggest that corrupt Thai immigration 
officials are implicated in this process and that the proceeds collected from the deportees 
are shared among the brokers, the DKBA and the Thai immigration officials. Where such 
risks exist, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that trafficked persons should be provided 
with the opportunity to remain in Thailand on a temporary or permanent basis, as well as 
with appropriate support to be effectively integrated into Thai society.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b> H. Prevention 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Government has taken a number of measures aimed at preventing trafficking in 
persons, primarily in the form of awareness-raising campaigns and publications. It has 
launched several campaigns through such mass media as radio, television and publications 
to raise public awareness about trafficking issues, and distributed information about 
trafficking in Burmese, Lao and Khmer at border checkpoints. Some stakeholders, 
however, expressed concern that these awareness-raising efforts are not appropriately 
targeted at trafficked persons, those at risk of being trafficked or otherwise exploited, their 
employers or workplaces. Furthermore, trafficked persons or those at risk of being 
trafficked or otherwise exploited are not consulted in preliminary analysis, design, 
monitoring or evaluation of these efforts.  
</p>
<p>64. While the Government has made efforts to address some of the root causes of 
trafficking, it has not devoted sufficient attention and resources to this end. Demand for 
cheap and exploitative labour provided by migrant workers, fuelled by the lack of effective 
regulations in recruitment and protection of the work rights of migrant workers, is 
recognized as one of the major causes of trafficking in persons in Thailand.  
</p>
<p>65. Furthermore, while the Special Rapporteur recognizes that the nationality 
verification process (see paragraph 5 above) contains positive elements, the process is 
poorly implemented and has not had the effect of providing protection to many irregular 
migrant workers in Thailand. One positive development in this regard is that, at the time of 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the ad hoc subcommittee for studying the labour 
employment centre for fishery vessels under the Coordinating and Monitoring of Anti-
Trafficking in Persons Performance Committee was considering the establishment of a 
fishery labour coordinating centre to regulate the recruitment of labour in the fishing 
industry. In fact, the Ministry of Labour and the of Social Development and Human 
Security announced several days after the conclusion of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit that 
seven fishery labour coordinating centres would be established in Samut Sakhon, Trat, 
Rayong, Chumphon, Songkhla, Ranong and Satun Provinces. Under the new system, the 
National Fisheries Association would be responsible for assessing demands for labour in 
the fishing sector and liaising with the Ministry of Labour, which would formally recruit 
suitable workers from neighbouring countries. This initiative should be monitored 
carefully, most particularly to assess its impact on exploitative labour practices in the Thai 
fishing industry. 
</p>
<p>66. In addition, the Special Rapporteur observed that a significant number of ethnic 
minorities and children of irregular migrants do not have Thai citizenship or identification 
documents, which increases their vulnerability to trafficking. The lack of citizenship 
significantly restricts their enjoyment of the rights to education, employment opportunities, 
health services and freedom of movement, which encourages them to resort to unsafe 
migration in search of a better life, at the risk of being trafficked. The Government has 
made progressive efforts to address this situation and amended the Nationality Law to grant 
Thai nationality to certain categories of ethnic minorities. Furthermore, the Civil 
Registration Act was amended in 2008 in such a way that all children born in Thailand, 
whether born to Thai citizens or foreigners, receive birth registration, and anyone residing 
in Thailand may request an identification number regardless of their citizenship or 
migration status. While these legislative amendments are positive developments, the 
implementation of the laws needs to be strengthened.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p><b> I. Cooperation and partnership 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Cooperation with civil society 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur commends the robust partnership between the Government 
and the civil society organizations working in the field of trafficking, particularly in the 
context of rescue operations. She was informed of a number of successful rescue operations 
that were led by such organizations with experience and expertise in assisting trafficked 
persons. Some stakeholders, however, claimed that the partnership with the Government 
was limited to just a few organizations. In particular, membership of the Anti-Trafficking in 
Persons Committee and the Coordinating and Monitoring of Anti-Trafficking in Persons 
Performance Committee is only open to few selected organizations, and the selection 
criteria lack transparency.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. International, regional and bilateral cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>68. Thailand has concluded four memorandums of understanding with Cambodia, the 
Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam. All memorandums provide 
for the protection of victims of trafficking, victims&#8217; right to seek compensation, bilateral 
cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers, the return and reintegration 
of victims of trafficking, and the prevention of trafficking. Pursuant to these bilateral 
agreements, specific plans of action and operational procedures have been developed; for 
example, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic and Thailand have endorsed a bilateral 
plan of action and set of guidelines on procedures of victim return and victim rehabilitation, 
especially for women and children. While these memorandums, plans of actions and 
guidelines are certainly important steps, implementation remains weak.  
</p>
<p>69. A positive example of bilateral cooperation is the 5-year project on strengthening the 
capacity of the multidisciplinary team, which is implemented in cooperation with the Japan 
International Cooperation Agency. As part of this project, in June 2011, the Government 
launched multidisciplinary team operational guidelines, which set out the role of the team 
and procedures to be followed in protecting and assisting trafficked persons. 
</p>
<p>70. At the regional level, Thailand is one of the six States of the Greater Mekong 
Subregion participating in the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative against 
Trafficking. Activities of the Initiative process are based on subregional plans of action, 
which are implemented by a task force comprising Government officials, at the national 
level, in partnership with civil society organizations. In addition, Thailand has signed the 
Declaration against Trafficking in Persons, Particularly Women and Children of the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which affirmed regional commitments 
to preventing and combating trafficking in persons. Following the adoption of the 
Declaration, ASEAN took concrete steps in combating trafficking, principally through its 
Senior Officials&#8217; Meeting on Transnational Crime, which pledged to end impunity for 
traffickers and secure justice for victims. Through the Meeting, ASEAN Member States 
have developed a range of common training materials and resources for criminal justice 
officials, including front-line law enforcement, specialist investigators and prosecutors. 
Thailand has participated actively in the development and finalization of these materials 
and resources and is a member of the ASEAN Heads of Specialist Trafficking Units 
Process, which operates under the Senior Officials&#8217; Meeting on Transnational Crime. While 
more work needs to be done in Thailand to integrate ASEAN principles and standards into 
work practices and national training, some important steps have already been taken. For </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>example, Thailand has issued a manual of standard operating procedures on trafficking for 
prosecutors, using the Meeting&#8217;s specialist prosecutor programme materials.4  
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> The Government of Thailand has shown a high level of commitment to 
combating trafficking in persons, as revealed by the domestic legal framework, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>is comprehensive and meets international standards, and the multidisciplinary 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach in combating trafficking in persons, which involves all key Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>agencies and civil society organizations with appropriate expertise. The partnership 
</b></p>
<p><b>between the Government and such organizations, particularly in the context of 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigating trafficking cases, is effective and should be further encouraged. Thailand 
</b></p>
<p><b>has been also actively promoting bilateral and regional cooperation with other 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion.  
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> The Special Rapporteur remains concerned that the implementation of the 
policy and legal framework on human trafficking remains weak and fragmented, 
</b></p>
<p><b>resulting in a gap between laws and policies and the actual experience of trafficked 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons in Thailand. There is also a lack of understanding among public officials 
</b></p>
<p><b>about the forms, manifestations and key elements of trafficking, which results in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>inability of law enforcement officers to identify cases of trafficking effectively and, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>some cases, to distinguish trafficking and prostitution. Trafficking in persons is still 
</b></p>
<p><b>viewed primarily as a problem concerning women and children, even though the Anti-
</b></p>
<p><b>Trafficking in Persons Act correctly identifies trafficking as a problem affecting men, 
</b></p>
<p><b>women and children. Furthermore, corruption in law enforcement, particularly at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>provincial and local levels, is deep rooted and has diluted the efficacy of Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies and programmes in combating human trafficking. As a result, many 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficked persons are not properly identified, leading to cases of wanton arrest, 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention and deportation throughout the country. In addition, the infrastructure and 
</b></p>
<p><b>services required to detect trafficking cases and refer the victims to appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>services (such as hotlines available in languages commonly spoken by trafficked 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons in Thailand) is weak and insufficient for the scale of the problem.  
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> Investigation of trafficking cases is often slow, owing to a variety of factors, 
including the lack of capacity of police officers to identify trafficking cases properly, 
</b></p>
<p><b>corruption and low morale among investigators. In the case of trafficking in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>fishing sector, the Marine Police are extremely underresourced and do not, in any 
</b></p>
<p><b>case, have a mandate to formally investigate possible cases of trafficking. The rate of 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecution of trafficking cases remains very low, perpetuating the impunity of

<p>traffickers and obstructing victims&#8217; access to justice. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> Delays in investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases in courts contribute 
to the long stay in shelters experienced by many foreign victims of trafficking in 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>are not provided with adequate support in their recovery process, such as health care,

</p>
<p><b>psychological counselling, information about their rights in a language they 
</b></p>
<p><b>understand, interpretation services, legal aid and suitable educational and vocational 
</b></p>
<p><b>opportunities. The Special Rapporteur has serious concerns that the stay in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>shelters amounts to detention and, in addition to infringing fundamental human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>relating to freedom of movement and protection from arbitrary detention, presents a 
</b></p>
<p><b>risk to the well-being of trafficked persons. She is also concerned that rescue 
</b></p>
<p><b>operations are not sufficiently victim-centred and may have an adverse impact on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights of trafficked persons and others, such as migrant workers. 
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> Trafficked persons in Thailand very rarely enjoy the right to compensation. 
They are not routinely provided with adequate information about their rights in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>language they understand and the necessary support to exercise them, such as legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>aid and interpretation services. 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> While the Government has actively engaged in awareness-raising campaigns as 
part of efforts to prevent trafficking in persons, the root causes of trafficking, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly the demand for cheap and exploitative labour provided by migrant 
</b></p>
<p><b>workers and the lack of legal protection for these persons, are not being effectively 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressed. This has perpetuated the abuse, exploitation and extortion of migrants by 
</b></p>
<p><b>brokers, employers and law enforcement agents. In particular, the Government is 
</b></p>
<p><b>doing not enough to protect irregular migrants, who are frequently exploited and face 
</b></p>
<p><b>serious violations of their human rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> On the basis of the above conclusions, the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
the Government of Thailand:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ratify the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the International Convention on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the recently 
</b></p>
<p><b>adopted ILO Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Develop and build capacity for systematic data collection, disaggregated 
</b></p>
<p><b>by age and gender. There is a need to design human trafficking interventions on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>basis of accurate data and evidence, as well as to closely monitor and evaluate their 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact and effectiveness; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that the national policy has specific targets, performance 
</b></p>
<p><b>indicators and timelines for implementation, as well as a mechanism that is able to 
</b></p>
<p><b>review and evaluate implementation. Trafficked persons should be consulted and 
</b></p>
<p><b>involved in designing, monitoring and evaluating policies, measures and activities 
</b></p>
<p><b>aimed at combating trafficking in persons and protecting their human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d)  Review existing domestic memorandums of understanding to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>they are in line with the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act and take steps to improve 
</b></p>
<p><b>their implementation with a view to maximizing their contribution to ensuring that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the rights of trafficked persons are protected, respected and enforced; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Allocate sufficient financial and human resources to allow the Ministry 
</b></p>
<p><b>of Social Development and Human Security to perform its functions, including those 
</b></p>
<p><b>relating to coordination, effectively and efficiently; alternatively, streamline existing 
</b></p>
<p><b>multidisciplinary bodies in order to reduce the demands for coordinating these 
</b></p>
<p><b>bodies; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Commit to large-scale capacity-building for all relevant public officials, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including law enforcement, the marine police, naval and immigration officials, judges, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors and labour inspectors, with special focus on increasing the knowledge and 
</b></p>
<p><b>skills of front-line officials to identify, protect and assist trafficked persons. ASEAN 
</b></p>
<p><b>training materials and resources for criminal justice agencies should be integrated 
</b></p>
<p><b>into current systems and institutions. The existing checklist for identifying trafficked 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons should be revised with more simple language, and relevant officials should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequately trained in its use through case studies and examples. Such case studies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>examples should also illustrate the differences between trafficking, migrant 
</b></p>
<p><b>smuggling, illegal migration and prostitution, which are often confused; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Strengthen the capacity of the Anti-Human Trafficking Division of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Royal Thai Police to undertake high-quality, ethical and effective investigations; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>take steps to address problems within the Division, such as the current rotation policy, 
</b></p>
<p><b>that prevent the accumulation of expertise and experience. The role of the Department 
</b></p>
<p><b>for Special Investigations in investigating trafficking cases should be strengthened, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the Government should consider adding the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Department</b>&#8217;s mandated area of work, while establishing a clear and efficient 
</p>
<p><b>division of labour with the Royal Thai Police;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Strengthen the capacity of prosecutors to effectively prosecute 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking cases with due attention to the rights of accused persons to a fair trial and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the rights of victims/witnesses to protection and support; explore ways of enhancing 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation between investigators and prosecutors in order to improve the criminal 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice response; consider the introduction of a system to fast-track trafficking-related 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutions in order to improve the trial process and reduce the burden on 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims/witnesses; and consider the establishment of a specialist prosecutorial capacity 
</b></p>
<p><b>aimed at delivering effective, coordinated and timely prosecution of cases of 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking in persons;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Further strengthen informal (police-to-police) cooperation with other 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries with a view to improving the identification and protection of victims and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>apprehension of suspects. The ASEAN Heads of Specialist Trafficking Units process is 
</b></p>
<p><b>an important mechanism for such cooperation and should be actively supported. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Thailand should also take the lead in promoting more effective legal cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b>arrangements (mutual legal assistance and extradition) with other countries in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>area of trafficking in persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Commit firmly to a policy of zero tolerance of trafficking-related 
</b></p>
<p><b>corruption and complicity by public officials. The Government should prosecute and 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequately punish offenders with a view to dissuade such practices; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Extend protection under the Labour Protection Act to persons working 
</b></p>
<p><b>in sectors known to often employ trafficked persons, such as agriculture, domestic 
</b></p>
<p><b>work and fishing;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Strengthen the role of labour inspectors in identifying trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>in workplaces and preventing exploitative working conditions. Inspectors should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>fully involved in the multidisciplinary team in detecting trafficking cases and 
</b></p>
<p><b>protecting the labour rights of all workers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(m)  Specifically mandate the Marine Police to provisionally identify 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficked persons on fishing boats; initiate essential investigative and victim 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection actions; and refer cases to the special units of the Royal Thai Police and/or 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Department for Special Investigations, as appropriate. The Marine Police should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be thoroughly trained on issues of trafficking in persons in the fishing industry and 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided with adequate resources to carry out its mandate and ensure close </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>cooperation with its counterparts in the Royal Thai Police and the Department for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Investigations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) Establish a national hotline dedicated to taking information on potential 
</b></p>
<p><b>cases of trafficking. It should be staffed by personnel who are adequately trained in 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking issues and able to speak languages commonly spoken by trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>and those who are likely to be in contact with such persons, such as Cambodian, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Laotian, Burmese and ethnic minority languages in Thailand and neighbouring 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(o) Ensure that the national referral mechanism is properly understood by 
</b></p>
<p><b>all stakeholders, including law enforcement and the civil society organizations 
</b></p>
<p><b>involved in Government anti-trafficking initiatives;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(p) Ensure that raids and rescue operations are victim-centred and do not 
</b></p>
<p><b>cause any discriminatory impact on victims and those who are not victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking. Upon being rescued, trafficked persons should be provided with 
</b></p>
<p><b>information about their rights and appropriate counselling in a language they 
</b></p>
<p><b>understand. Furthermore, in accordance with the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims should not be criminalized or penalized, including through detention for 
</b></p>
<p><b>status-related offences such as violations of immigration laws and other crimes that 
</b></p>
<p><b>directly result from their situations as trafficked persons;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(q) E</b>nsure that shelters provide safe space for trafficked persons&#8217; recovery 
</p>
<p><b>and reintegration, and that the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security 
</b></p>
<p><b>provides comprehensive and individually tailored assistance, including language 
</b></p>
<p><b>support, access to medical and psychological care and suitable educational and 
</b></p>
<p><b>vocational opportunities. All victims in shelters should have access to independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal advice, and to social workers, psychologists and interpreters who are trained to 
</b></p>
<p><b>work with trafficked persons;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(r) Give trafficked persons the choice of remaining in a shelter. In the case 
</b></p>
<p><b>of child victims of trafficking, the Government should make available alternative care 
</b></p>
<p><b>arrangements, such as staying with foster parents; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (s) While seeking to fast-track trafficking-related prosecutions, encourage 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors to take pretrial depositions so that trafficked persons are not required to 
</b></p>
<p><b>stay in shelters for prolonged periods; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(t) Ensure that trafficked persons are provided with the necessary support 
</b></p>
<p><b>and assistance to seek remedies, such as legal aid and interpretation assistance;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(u) Consider providing permanent or temporary residence as a form of 
</b></p>
<p><b>remedy where there are risks that the trafficked person may be retrafficked, face 
</b></p>
<p><b>reprisals or be subjected to violations of human rights upon repatriation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Intensify efforts to raise awareness of trafficking in persons among 
</b></p>
<p><b>journalists, and train them in accurate reporting and respect for the privacy of 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficked persons, so that the media do not disseminate information that distorts the 
</b></p>
<p><b>realities of human trafficking and increases stigma for victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(w) In conducting awareness-raising activities, appropriately target specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups at higher risk of being trafficked, such as migrants and ethnic minorities, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>well as employers and brokers;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(x) Intensify its efforts to address the root causes of trafficking in Thailand. 
</b></p>
<p><b>In particular, the Government should review its labour and migration laws to 
</b></p>
<p><b>accommodate the demands for cheap, low- or semi-skilled labour and provide for safe 
</b></p>
<p><b>migration options, as well as eliminate vulnerabilities of migrant workers and their </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/18/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>families to all forms of human trafficking. In this regard, the Government should 
</b></p>
<p><b>consider further extending the nationality verification process to irregular migrant 
</b></p>
<p><b>workers without valid work permits and to those who did not complete the process 
</b></p>
<p><b>before the previous deadline, and ensure that the process is efficient, transparent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cost-effective;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(y) Uphold the principles of equality and non-discrimination in all matters, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in the provision of support and assistance to trafficked persons, and ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the principle of the best interests of the child, enshrined in the Convention on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights of the Child, underlines every policy and individual decision relating to child 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims of trafficking; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(z) Strengthen cooperation with neighbouring countries, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cambodia, t</b>he Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic<b>, Malaysia and Myanmar, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>preventing and eliminating clandestine movements that result in or contribute to 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking in migrant workers and their families, while at the same time ensuring 
</b></p>
<p><b>options for safe migration. The Government should ensure the effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of any bilateral and regional memorandums of understanding that 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide migrants with proper protection, prevent trafficking and ensure the recovery 
</b></p>
<p><b>and reintegration of trafficked persons, including having specific targets, performance 
</b></p>
<p><b>indicators and timelines to monitor implementation. 
</b></p>
