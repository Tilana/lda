ARTICLE II
REGISTRATION RIGHTS
Section 2.01    Shelf Registration.
(a)    Shelf Registration. Within 90 calendar days of the Closing Date, the Partnership shall use
its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file a Shelf Registration Statement with the SEC to
permit the public resale of all Registrable Securities on the terms and conditions specified in this
Section 2.01 (a “Registration Statement”). The Registration Statement filed with the SEC
pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) shall be on Form S-3 or, if Form S-3 is not then available to the
Partnership, on Form S-1 or such other form of registration statement as is then available to effect
a registration for resale of the Registrable Securities, covering the Registrable Securities, and
shall contain a prospectus in such form as to permit any Selling Holder covered by such
Registration Statement to sell such Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act (or any successor or similar provision adopted by the SEC then in effect) at any
time beginning on the Effective Date for such Registration Statement. The Partnership shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Section 2.01(a)
to be declared effective no later than 180 calendar days after the Closing Date (the “Effectiveness
Deadline”). During the Effectiveness Period, the Partnership shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) to remain continuously
effective, and to be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such
Registration Statement is available or, if not available, that another registration statement is
available for the resale of the Registrable Securities until all Registrable Securities have ceased
to be Registrable Securities. The Partnership shall prepare and file a listing of additional shares
with the NASDAQ (or such other national securities exchange on which the Registrable
Securities are then listed and traded) to list the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration
Statement and shall have received approval for such Registrable Securities to be listed on the
NASDAQ (or such other national securities exchange on which the Registrable Securities are
then listed and traded) by the Effective Date of such Registration Statement, subject only to
official notice of issuance. As soon as practicable following the Effective Date of a Registration
Statement, but in any event within three Business Days of such date, the Partnership shall notify
the Selling Holders of the effectiveness of such Registration Statement.
4
Section 2.02    Piggyback Rights.
(a)    Participation. So long as a Holder has Registrable Securities, if the Partnership proposes to
file (i) a shelf registration statement, other than a Registration Statement contemplated by Section
2.01(a), (ii) a prospectus supplement to an effective shelf registration statement relating to the
sale of equity securities of the Partnership, other than a Registration Statement contemplated by
Section 2.01(a), and Holders may be included without the filing of a post-effective amendment
thereto, or (iii) a registration statement, other than a shelf registration statement, in each case, for
the sale of Common Units in an Underwritten Offering for its own account or that of another
Person, or both, then promptly following the selection of the Managing Underwriter for such
Underwritten Offering, the Partnership shall give notice of such Underwritten Offering to each
Holder (together with its Affiliates) holding at least the Piggyback Threshold Amount of the then-
outstanding Registrable Securities (calculated based on the Unit Purchase Price) and such
notice shall offer such Holders the opportunity to include in such Underwritten Offering such
number of Registrable Securities (the “Included Registrable Securities”) as each such Holder
may request in writing; provided, however, that (A) the Partnership shall not be required to
provide such opportunity if, in the aggregate, the Holders do not offer a minimum of the
Piggyback Threshold Amount of Registrable Securities (based on the Unit Purchase Price), and
(B) if the Partnership has been advised by the Managing Underwriter that the inclusion of
Registrable Securities for sale for the benefit of the Holders will have an adverse effect on the
price, timing or distribution of the Common Units in the Underwritten Offering, then (x) if, in the
opinion of the Managing Underwriter, no Registrable Securities can be included in the
Underwritten Offering, the Partnership shall not be required to offer such opportunity to the
Holders or (y) if, in the opinion of the Managing Underwriter, any Registrable Securities can be
included in the Underwritten Offering, then the amount of Registrable Securities to be offered for
the accounts of Holders shall be determined based on the provisions of Section 2.02(b). Any
notice required to be provided in this Section 2.02(a) to Holders shall be provided on a Business
Day and receipt of such notice shall be confirmed by the Holder. Each such Holder shall then
have three Business Days (or one Business Day in connection with any overnight or bought
Underwritten Offering) after notice has been delivered to request in writing the inclusion of
Registrable Securities in the Underwritten Offering. If a Holder’s written request for inclusion is
not received within the specified time, such Holder shall have no further right to participate in
such Underwritten Offering. If, at any time after giving written notice of its intention to undertake
an Underwritten Offering and prior to the closing of such Underwritten Offering, the Partnership
shall determine for any reason to delay or not to undertake such Underwritten Offering, the
Partnership may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to the Selling Holders
and, (1) in the case of a determination not to undertake such Underwritten Offering, shall be
relieved of its obligation to sell any Included Registrable Securities in connection with such
terminated Underwritten Offering, and (2) in the case of a determination to delay such
Underwritten Offering, shall be permitted to delay offering any Included Registrable Securities as
part of such Underwritten Offering for the same period as the delay in the Underwritten Offering.
Any Selling Holder shall have the right to withdraw such Selling Holder’s request for inclusion of
such Selling Holder’s Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering by giving written
notice to the Partnership of such withdrawal at or prior to the time of pricing of such Underwritten
Offering. Any Holder may deliver written notice (an “Opt-Out Notice”) to the Partnership
requesting that such Holder not
5
receive notice from the Partnership of any proposed Underwritten Offering. Following receipt of
an Opt-Out Notice from a Holder, the Partnership shall not be required to deliver any notice to
such Holder pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) and such Holder shall no longer be entitled to
participate in Underwritten Offerings by the Partnership pursuant to this Section 2.02(a).
(b)    Priority. Except as provided in Section 2.04(b) of this Agreement, if the Managing
Underwriter advises the Partnership that the total amount of Common Units that the Selling
Holders and any other Persons intend to include in such offering exceeds the number of
Common Units that can be sold in such offering without being likely to have an adverse effect on
the price, timing or distribution of the Common Units offered or the market for the Common Units,
then the Common Units to be included in such Underwritten Offering shall include the number of
Registrable Securities that such Managing Underwriter advises the Partnership can be sold
without having such adverse effect, with such number to be allocated (i) first, to the Partnership
and (ii) second, to (A) the Selling Holders and Affiliates of the Partnership who have requested
participation in such Underwritten Offering and (B) to the other holders of Common Units (other
than holders of Registrable Securities) with registration rights entitling them to participate in such
Underwritten Offering (if any), allocated among such Selling Holders, Affiliates of the Partnership,
and other holders pro rata on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities or Common Units
held by each applicable Selling Holder, Affiliate of the Partnership or other holder or in such
manner as they may agree.
(c)    Termination of Piggyback Registration Rights. The Holders’ rights under this Section 2.02
shall terminate at such time as the Holders (together with their Affiliates) cease to hold at least
the Piggyback Threshold Amount of Registrable Securities (calculated based on the Unit
Purchase Price).
Section 2.03    Delay Rights.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Partnership may, upon written
notice to (i) all Holders, delay the filing of a Registration Statement required under Section
2.01(a), or (ii) any Selling Holder whose Registrable Securities are included in a Registration
Statement or other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, suspend such Selling
Holder’s use of any prospectus that is a part of such Registration Statement or other registration
statement (in which event the Selling Holder shall discontinue sales of the Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Registration Statement or other registration statement contemplated by this
Agreement but may settle any previously made sales of Registrable Securities) if the Partnership
(x) is pursuing an acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or other similar transaction and
the General Partner determines in good faith that the Partnership’s ability to pursue or
consummate such a transaction would be materially adversely affected by any required
disclosure of such transaction in such Registration Statement or other registration statement or
(y) has experienced some other material non-public event the disclosure of which at such time, in
the good faith judgment of the General Partner, would materially adversely affect the Partnership.
Upon disclosure of such information or the termination of the condition described above, the
Partnership shall provide prompt notice, but in any event within one Business Day of such
disclosure or termination, to the Selling Holders whose Registrable Securities are included in
such Registration Statement and shall promptly
6
terminate any suspension of sales it has put into effect and shall take such other reasonable
actions to permit registered sales of Registrable Securities as contemplated in this Agreement.
Section 2.04    Demand Rights.
(a)    Underwritten Offerings. The Partnership shall, upon the request of one or more Holders
holding, in the aggregate, at least $5.0 million of Registrable Securities (calculated based on the
Unit Purchase Price) (such request, an “Demand Notice” and such electing Holders, the “Electing
Holders”), retain underwriters in order to permit the Electing Holders to effect such sale through
an Underwritten Offering; provided, however, that the Partnership shall not be required to effect
more than one Underwritten Offering during any 12-month period pursuant to and subject to the
conditions of this Section 2.04(a). Upon delivery of such Demand Notice to the Partnership, the
Partnership shall as soon as practicable (but in no event later than one Business Day following
the date of delivery of the Demand Notice to the Partnership) deliver notice of such Demand
Notice to all other Holders, who shall then have five Business Days from the date that such
notice is given to them to notify the Partnership in writing of the number of Registrable Securities
held by such Holder that they want to be included in such Underwritten Offering. For the
avoidance of doubt, any Holders notified about an Underwritten Offering by the Partnership after
the Partnership has received the corresponding Demand Notice may participate in such
Underwritten Offering, but shall not count toward the $5.0 million of Registrable Securities
required under the first sentence of this Section 2.04(a) to request an Underwritten Offering
pursuant to a Demand Notice. In connection with any Underwritten Offering under this Section
2.04, the Partnership shall be entitled to select the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters. In
connection with an Underwritten Offering contemplated by this Agreement in which a Selling
Holder participates, each Selling Holder and the Partnership shall be obligated to enter into an
underwriting agreement that contains such representations, covenants, indemnities and other
rights and obligations as are customary in underwriting agreements for firm commitment offerings
of securities. No Selling Holder may participate in such Underwritten Offering unless such
Selling Holder agrees to sell its Registrable Securities on the basis provided in such
underwriting agreement and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney,
indemnities and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting
agreement. No Selling Holder shall be required to make any representations or warranties to or
agreements with the Partnership or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or
agreements regarding such Selling Holder, its authority to enter into such underwriting
agreement and to sell, and its ownership of, the securities whose offer and resale will be
registered, on its behalf, its intended method of distribution and any other representation required
by Law. If any Selling Holder disapproves of the terms of an Underwritten Offering, such Selling
Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by notice to the Partnership, the Electing Holders and the
Managing Underwriter; provided, however, that any such withdrawal must be made no later than
the time of pricing of such Underwritten Offering. If all Selling Holders withdraw from an
Underwritten Offering prior to the public announcement at launch (the “Launch”) of such
Underwritten Offering, the events will not be considered an Underwritten Offering and will not
decrease the number of available Underwritten Offerings the Holders have the right and option to
request under this Section 2.04(a). No such withdrawal or abandonment shall affect the
Partnership’s obligation to pay Registration Expenses pursuant to Section 2.08; provided,
however, that if all Selling Holders withdraw from such Underwritten Offering after the Launch,
other than as a result
7
of the occurrence of any event that would reasonably be expected to permit the Partnership to
exercise its rights to suspend the use of a Registration Statement or other registration statement
pursuant to Section 2.03, then such Selling Holders shall pay (pro rata on the basis of the
number of Registrable Securities held by each such Selling Holder) for all reasonable
Registration Expenses incurred by the Partnership during the period from the Launch of such
Underwritten Offering until the time all Selling Holders have withdrawn from such Underwritten
Offering.
(b)    Priority. If the Managing Underwriter of any proposed Underwritten Offering that involves
Registrable Securities of Electing Holders pursuant to Section 2.04(a) advises the Partnership
that the inclusion of all of the Registrable Securities that the Selling Holders intend to include in
such offering exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering without being likely to have
an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Registrable Securities offered or the
market for the Registrable Securities, then the Registrable Securities to be included in such
Underwritten Offering shall include the number of Registrable Securities that such Managing
Underwriter advises the Partnership can be sold without having such adverse effect, with such
number to be allocated (i) first, to the Selling Holders, allocated among such Selling Holders pro
rata on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities held by each such Selling Holder or in
such other manner as such Selling Holders may agree, and (ii) second, to the Partnership and
any other holder of securities of the Partnership having rights of registration that are neither
expressly senior nor subordinated to the Holders in respect of the Registrable Securities.
Section 2.05    Sale Procedures.
In connection with its obligations under this Article II, the Partnership shall, as expeditiously as
possible:
(a)    use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and
supplements to a Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as
may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for the Effectiveness Period and
as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement;
(b)    furnish to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably practicable before filing a
Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement or
any supplement or amendment thereto and provide each such Selling Holder the opportunity to
object to any information pertaining to such Selling Holder that is contained therein and make the
corrections reasonably requested by such Selling Holder with respect to such information prior to
filing a Registration Statement or such other registration statement or supplement or amendment
thereto, and (ii) such number of copies of such Registration Statement or such other registration
statement and the prospectus included therein and any supplements and amendments thereto as
such Selling Holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other
disposition of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement or other
registration statement;
(c)    if applicable, use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the Registrable Securities
covered by a Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this
Agreement under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders or,
8
in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the Managing Underwriter, shall reasonably request;
provided, however, that the Partnership shall not be required to qualify generally to transact
business in any jurisdiction where it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action that
would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so
subject;
(d)    promptly notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is
required to be delivered by any of them under the Securities Act, of (i) the filing of a Registration
Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement or any prospectus
or prospectus supplement to be used in connection therewith, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, and, with respect to such Registration Statement or any other registration statement or
any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has become effective; and (ii) the receipt
of any written comments from the SEC with respect to any filing referred to in clause (i) and any
written request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement or
any other registration statement or any prospectus or prospectus supplement thereto;
(e)    immediately notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of (i) the happening of any event as a result of
which the prospectus or prospectus supplement contained in a Registration Statement or any
other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, as then in effect, includes an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any prospectus
contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under which a statement is made); (ii) the
issuance or express threat of issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by
this Agreement, or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; or (iii) the receipt by the
Partnership of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any
Registrable Securities for sale under the applicable securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction.
Following the provision of such notice, the Partnership agrees to as promptly as practicable
amend or supplement the prospectus or prospectus supplement or take other appropriate action
so that the prospectus or prospectus supplement does not include an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing and to take such
other commercially reasonable action as is necessary to remove a stop order, suspension, threat
thereof or proceedings related thereto;
(f)    upon request and subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations, furnish to each Selling
Holder copies of any and all transmittal letters or other correspondence with the SEC or any other
governmental agency or self-regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction (including any
domestic or foreign securities exchange) relating to such offering of Registrable Securities;
(g)    in the case of an Underwritten Offering, use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the
underwriters upon request, (i) an opinion of counsel for the Partnership dated the date of the
closing under the underwriting agreement and (ii) a “comfort” letter, dated the pricing date of such
Underwritten Offering and a letter of like kind dated the date of the closing under the underwriting
agreement, in each case, signed by the independent public accountants who have certified the
Partnership’s financial statements included or incorporated by reference into the applicable
9
registration statement, and each of the opinion and the “comfort” letter shall be in customary form
and covering substantially the same matters with respect to such registration statement (and the
prospectus and any prospectus supplement included therein) as have been customarily covered
in opinions of issuer’s counsel and in accountants’ letters delivered to the underwriters in
Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Partnership and such other matters as such
underwriters and Selling Holders may reasonably request;
(h)    make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings
statement, covering a period of twelve months beginning within three months after the Effective
Date of such Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of
Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated thereunder;
(i)    make available to the appropriate representatives of the Managing Underwriter and Selling
Holders access to such information and Partnership and General Partner personnel as is
reasonable and customary to enable such parties to establish a due diligence defense under the
Securities Act; provided, that the Partnership need not disclose any non-public information to any
such representative unless and until such representative has entered into a confidentiality
agreement with the Partnership;
(j)    use its reasonable best efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant to
this Agreement to be listed on each securities exchange or nationally recognized quotation
system on which the Common Units are then listed or quoted;
(k)    provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement not later than the Effective Date of such registration statement;
(l)    enter into customary agreements and take such other actions as are reasonably requested
by the Selling Holders or the underwriters, if any, in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition
of such Registrable Securities (including, making appropriate officers of the General Partner
available to participate in any “road show” presentations before analysts, and other customary
marketing activities (including one-on-one meetings with prospective purchasers of the
Registrable Securities)), provided, however, that in the event the Partnership is unable to make
such appropriate officers of the General Partner available to participate in connection with any
“road show” presentations and other customary marketing activities (whether in person or
otherwise), the Partnership shall make such appropriate officers available to participate via
conference call or other means of communication in connection with no more than one “road
show” presentation per Underwritten Offering; and
(m)    if requested by a Selling Holder, (i) incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment such information as such Selling Holder reasonably requests to be included therein
relating to the sale and distribution of Registrable Securities, including information with respect to
the number of Registrable Securities being offered or sold, the purchase price being paid therefor
and any other terms of the offering of the Registrable Securities to be sold in such offering, and
(ii) make all required filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment after
10
being notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment.
The Partnership shall not name a Holder as an underwriter as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the
Securities Act in any Registration Statement without such Holder’s consent. If the staff of the SEC
requires the Partnership to name any Holder as an underwriter as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of
the Securities Act, and such Holder does not consent thereto, then such Holder’s Registrable
Securities shall not be included on such Registration Statement and the Partnership shall have
no further obligations hereunder with respect to Registrable Securities held by such Holder.
Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the Partnership of the happening of any event of
the kind described in Section 2.05(e), shall forthwith discontinue offers and sales of the
Registrable Securities by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement until such Selling
Holder’s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by
Section 2.05(e) or until it is advised in writing by the Partnership that the use of the prospectus
may be resumed and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings incorporated
by reference in the prospectus, and, if so directed by the Partnership, such Selling Holder shall,
or shall request the Managing Underwriter, if any, to deliver to the Partnership (at the
Partnership’s expense) all copies in their possession or control, other than permanent file copies
then in such Selling Holder’s possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities
current at the time of receipt of such notice.
Section 2.06    Cooperation by Holders.
The Partnership shall have no obligation to include in a Registration Statement Registrable
Securities of a Holder who has failed to timely furnish, after receipt of a written request from the
Partnership, such information that the Partnership determines, after consultation with its counsel,
is reasonably required in order for the registration statement or prospectus supplement, as
applicable, to comply with the Securities Act.
Section 2.07    Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable Securities.
Each Holder of Registrable Securities that participates in an Underwritten Offering will enter into
a customary letter agreement with underwriters providing such Holder will not effect any public
sale or distribution of Registrable Securities during the 60 calendar-day period beginning on the
date of a prospectus or prospectus supplement filed with the SEC with respect to the pricing of
any Underwritten Offering, provided that (i) the duration of the foregoing restrictions shall be no
longer than the duration of the shortest restriction generally imposed by the underwriters on the
Partnership or the officers, directors or any other Affiliate of the Partnership or the General
Partner on whom a restriction is imposed and (ii) the restrictions set forth in this Section 2.07
shall not apply to any Registrable Securities that are included in such Underwritten Offering by
such Holder. In addition, this Section 2.07 shall not apply to any Holder that is not entitled to
participate in such Underwritten Offering, whether because such Holder delivered an Opt-Out
Notice prior to receiving notice of the Underwritten Offering or because the Registrable Securities
held by such Holder may
11
be disposed of without restriction pursuant to any section of Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or
any successor or similar provision adopted by the SEC then in effect).
Section 2.08    Expenses.
(a)    Expenses. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.04(a), the Partnership shall pay all
reasonable Registration Expenses as determined in good faith by the General Partner, including,
in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the reasonable Registration Expenses of such
Underwritten Offering, regardless of whether any sale is made pursuant to such Underwritten
Offering. Each Selling Holder shall pay its pro rata share of all Selling Expenses in connection
with any sale of its Registrable Securities hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, each Selling
Holder’s pro rata allocation of Selling Expenses shall be the percentage derived by dividing
(i) the number of Registrable Securities sold by such Selling Holder in connection with such sale
by (ii) the aggregate number of Registrable Securities sold by all Selling Holders in connection
with such sale. In addition, except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.08 and 2.09 hereof, the
Partnership shall not be responsible for legal fees incurred by Holders in connection with the
exercise of such Holders’ rights hereunder.
(b)    Certain Definitions. “Registration Expenses” means all expenses incident to the
Partnership’s performance under or compliance with this Agreement to effect the registration of
Registrable Securities on a Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2.01(a) or an
Underwritten Offering covered under this Agreement, and the disposition of such Registrable
Securities, including, without limitation, all registration, filing, securities exchange listing and
NASDAQ fees, all registration, filing, qualification and other fees and expenses of complying with
securities or blue sky laws, fees of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., fees of
transfer agents and registrars, all word processing, duplicating and printing expenses, any

for the Partnership, including the expenses of any special audits or “comfort” letters required by or
incident to such performance and compliance, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of
one counsel for the Selling Holders participating in such Registration Statement or Underwritten
Offering to effect the disposition of such Registrable Securities, selected by the Holders of a
majority of the Registrable Securities initially being registered under such Registration Statement
or other registration statement as contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the reasonable
consent of the Partnership. “Selling Expenses” means all underwriting discounts and selling
commissions or similar fees or arrangements allocable to the sale of the Registrable Securities,
and fees and disbursements of counsel to the Selling Holders, except for the reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel for the Selling Holders required to be paid by the Partnership

Section 2.09    Indemnification.
(a)    By the Partnership. In the event of a registration of any Registrable Securities under the
Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the Partnership shall indemnify and hold harmless
each Selling Holder thereunder, its directors, officers, managers, employees and agents and
each Person, if any, who controls such Selling Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, and its directors, officers, employees or agents (collectively, the “Selling
Holder Indemnified Persons”), against any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities
(including
12
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) (collectively, “Losses”), joint or several, to which such
Selling Holder Indemnified Person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or
threatened, in respect thereof) (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of any material fact (in the case of any prospectus, in light of the circumstances
under which such statement is made) contained in (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes
documents incorporated by reference in) such Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus, prospectus supplement
or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or any free
writing prospectus relating thereto or (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made) not misleading, and shall reimburse each such Selling Holder Indemnified Person
for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating,
defending or resolving any such Loss or actions or proceedings; provided, however, that the
Partnership shall not be liable in any such case if and to the extent that any such Loss arises out
of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission so made in conformity with information furnished by or on behalf of such Selling Holder
Indemnified Person in writing specifically for use in such Registration Statement or such other
registration statement, or prospectus supplement, as applicable. Such indemnity shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Selling Holder
Indemnified Person, and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Selling Holder. The
Parties hereby designate each Seller Holder Indemnified Person who is not a party to this
Agreement as a third-party beneficiary of this Section 2.09 with the right to enforce this Section
2.09.
(b)    By Each Selling Holder. Each Selling Holder agrees severally and not jointly to indemnify
and hold harmless the Partnership, the General Partner, its directors, officers, employees and
agents and each Person, if any, who controls the Partnership within the meaning of the
Securities Act or of the Exchange Act, and its directors, officers, employees and agents the
“Partnership Indemnified Persons”), to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the
Partnership to the Selling Holders, but only with respect to information regarding such Selling
Holder furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in such
Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, any
preliminary prospectus, prospectus supplement or final prospectus contained therein, or any
amendment or supplement thereof, or any free writing prospectus relating thereto; provided,
however, that the liability of each Selling Holder shall not be greater in amount than the dollar
amount of the proceeds (net of any Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the
sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification. The Parties hereby
designate each Partnership Indemnified Person who is not a party to this Agreement as a third-
party beneficiary of this Section 2.09 with the right to enforce this Section 2.09.
(c)    Notice. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the
commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be
made against the indemnifying party hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof,
but such omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it
13
may have to any indemnified party other than under this Section 2.09. In any action brought
against any indemnified party, it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof.
The indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume
and undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party
and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume
and undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified
party under this Section 2.09 for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of
liaison with counsel so selected; provided, however, that, (i) if the indemnifying party has failed to
assume the defense or employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party or (ii) if
the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party
and counsel to the indemnified party shall have concluded that there may be reasonable
defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available
to the indemnifying party, or if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to
conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have the right
to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defense and otherwise to participate in
the defense of such action, with the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel and
other reasonable expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying
party as incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no indemnifying party
shall settle any action brought against any indemnified party with respect to which such
indemnified party is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the consent of the indemnified
party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability or obligation on, and includes a complete
and unconditional release from all liability of, the indemnified party.
(d)    Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.09 is held by a court or
government agency of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to any indemnified party or is
insufficient to hold them harmless in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in
lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
such indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of such indemnified party on the other
in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that in no event shall such Selling Holder
be required to contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of
Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving
rise to such indemnification. The relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the
indemnified party on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether
the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact has been made by, or relates to, information supplied by such party, and the
parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any
other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to
herein. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to in the first
sentence of this paragraph shall be deemed to include any legal and other expenses reasonably
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating, defending or resolving any
Loss that is the subject of this
14
paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)
of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who is not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.
(e)    Other Indemnification. The provisions of this Section 2.09 shall be in addition to any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that an indemnified party may have pursuant to law,
equity, contract or otherwise.
Section 2.10    Rule 144 Reporting.
With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC that may
permit the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the Partnership
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to:
(a)    make and keep public information regarding the Partnership available, as those terms are
understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or any successor or similar
provision adopted by the SEC then in effect), at all times from and after the date hereof;
(b)    file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the
Partnership under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act at all times from and after the date
hereof; and
(c)    so long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish, unless otherwise available
electronically at no additional charge via the SEC’s EDGAR system, to such Holder forthwith
upon request a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Partnership, and such
other reports and documents as such Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule
or regulation of the SEC allowing such Holder to sell any such securities without registration.
Section 2.11    Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights.
The rights to cause the Partnership to register Registrable Securities granted to the Purchasers
by the Partnership under this Article II may be transferred or assigned by any Purchaser to one or
more transferees or assignees of Registrable Securities, subject to the transfer restrictions set
forth in Section 4.10 of the Amended Partnership Agreement, provided, however, that (a) the
Partnership is given written notice prior to any said transfer or assignment, stating the name and
address of each of the transferee or assignee and identifying the Registrable Securities with
respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned and (b) each such
transferee or assignee assumes in writing responsibility for its portion of the obligations of such
Purchaser under this Agreement.
Section 2.12    Limitation on Subsequent Registration Rights.
From and after the date hereof, the Partnership shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding Registrable Securities, enter into any
agreement with any current or future holder of any equity securities of the Partnership that would
allow such current or future holder to require the Partnership to include equity securities in any
15
registration statement filed by the Partnership on a basis that is superior in any respect to the
piggyback rights granted to the Holders pursuant to Section 2.02.

of any obligations under this Agreement.
17
Section 3.06    Specific Performance.
Damages in the event of breach of this Agreement by a party hereto may be difficult, if not
impossible, to ascertain, and it is therefore agreed that each such Person, in addition to and
without limiting any other remedy or right it may have, shall have the right to an injunction or other
equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach, and enforcing
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, and each of the parties hereto hereby waives any
and all defenses it may have on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence of the court to
grant such an injunction or other equitable relief. The existence of this right shall not preclude
any such Person from pursuing any other rights and remedies at law or in equity that such
Person may have.
Section 3.07    Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, including facsimile or .pdf counterparts, each of which counterparts, when
so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts,

Section 3.08    Headings.
The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or
otherwise affect the meaning hereof.
Section 3.09    Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.
This Agreement, including all issues and questions concerning its application, construction,
validity, interpretation and enforcement, shall be construed in accordance with, and governed by,
the laws of the State of Delaware. The Parties hereby submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
any U.S. federal or state court located in Dallas, Texas in any action, suit or proceeding arising
out of or based upon this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Parties
hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which
they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court
or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the Parties
hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Section 3.10    Severability of Provisions.
Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting or impairing the validity or enforceability
of such provision in any other jurisdiction.
Section 3.11    Entire Agreement.
This Agreement is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement and intended
to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties
18
hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises,
warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred to herein with respect to the
rights granted by the Partnership set forth herein. This Agreement, the Purchase Agreement and
the Amended Partnership Agreement supersede all prior agreements and understandings
between the parties with respect to such subject matter.
Section 3.12    Amendment.
This Agreement may be amended only by means of a written amendment signed by the

provided, however, that no such amendment shall materially and adversely affect the rights of
any Holder hereunder without the consent of such Holder.
Section 3.13    No Presumption.
If any claim is made by a party relating to any conflict, omission or ambiguity in this Agreement,
no presumption or burden of proof or persuasion shall be implied by virtue of the fact that this
Agreement was prepared by or at the request of a particular party or its counsel.
Section 3.14    Obligations Limited to Parties to Agreement.
Each of the parties hereto covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no Person other than the
Purchasers (and their permitted transferees and assignees) and the Partnership shall have any
obligation hereunder. Notwithstanding that one or more of the Purchasers may be a corporation,
partnership or limited liability company, no recourse under this Agreement or under any
documents or instruments delivered in connection herewith or therewith shall be had against any
former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager,
member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of the Purchasers or any former, current or future director,
officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate
thereof, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding,
or by virtue of any applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal
liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any former, current
or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member,
stockholder or Affiliate of any of the Purchasers or any former, current or future director, officer,
employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate thereof, as
such, for any obligations of the Purchasers under this Agreement or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection herewith or therewith or for any claim based on, in respect of
or by reason of such obligation or its creation, except in each case for any transferee or assignee
of a Purchaser hereunder.
Section 3.15    Independent Nature of Purchaser’s Obligations.
The obligations of each Purchaser under this Agreement are several and not joint with the
obligations of any other Purchaser, and no Purchaser shall be responsible in any way for the
performance of the obligations of any other Purchaser under this Agreement. Nothing contained
herein, and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the
Purchasers as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of group or entity, or
19
create a presumption that the Purchasers are in any way acting in concert or as a group with
respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Purchaser
shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including, the rights arising out of
this Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to be joined as an
additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.
Section 3.16    Interpretation.
Article and Section references are to this Agreement, unless otherwise specified. All references
to instruments, documents, contracts and agreements are references to such instruments,
documents, contracts and agreements as the same may be amended, supplemented and
otherwise modified from time to time, unless otherwise specified. The words “include,” “includes”
and “including” or words of similar import shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without
limitation.” Whenever any determination, consent or approval is to be made or given by a
Purchaser under this Agreement, such action shall be in such Purchaser’s sole discretion unless
otherwise specified. Unless expressly set forth or qualified otherwise (e.g., by “Business” or
“trading”), all references herein to a “day” are deemed to be a reference to a calendar day.
