current and prospective employees of all backgrounds in such a manner that best adds to 
overall shareholders value and which reflects the values, principles and spirit of the Diversity

making is enhanced through diversity and supports and encourages diversity at all levels of 
the organisation in accordance with the Company’s Diversity Policy.  A copy of the Diversity

and as deemed necessary, the Company, at the direction of the Chairman, may undertake to 
have its performance evaluation process facilitated externally by an appropriately qualified

Company’s objectives and (where appropriate) performance benchmarks and the 
achievement of individual performance objectives.
The Managing Director/CEO reviews the performance of the senior executives annually, 
against agreed KPIs, taking into account achievement and performance towards the

Chairman and senior executives was undertaken by the Company.

the charter of the committee;
(iv)
the members of the committee; and

throughout the period and the individual attendances of the members at those 
meetings; or
(b)

employs to address board succession issues and to ensure that the board has the 
appropriate balance of skills, knowledge, experience, independence and diversity to 
enable it to discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively.

business needs of the Company. New directors are invited to join the Board by the 
chairperson, who makes the invitation based on recommendations made by the Board and 
approved by the Board.
The Company aims to nominate and appoint individuals with diverse skills, values, 
backgrounds and experiences. The Company values this diversity and recognises the 
strengths and opportunities that it may bring to the Board.

by determining whether the director is independent of management and free of any business 
or other relationship that could materially interfere with, or could reasonably be perceived to 
materially interfere with, the exercise of their unfettered and independent judgment. The test 
of whether a relationship or business is material is based on the nature of the relationship or 
business and on the circumstances and activities of the director. Materiality thresholds are 
considered by the Board from time to time.
As stated above, Mr G English is not deemed to be independent.
Ms A McCleary, Mr T Phillips AM and Mr Rix are each regarded as independent as they are

associated with the company’s activities and updating the framework accordingly.
Recommendation 7.3 
 
A listed entity should disclose:
(a)
(b)
if it has an internal audit function, how the function is structured and what role it 
performs; or
if it does not have an internal audit function, that fact and the processes it employs for 
evaluating and continually improving the effectiveness of its risk management and 
internal control processes.
Recommendation followed.  Archer is committed to understanding and managing risk and 
to establishing an organisational culture that ensures risk management is included in all 
activities, decision making and business processes.  The Company does not have a formal 
internal audit function due to its small size.
The Audit & Risk Management Committee meets at least bi-annually to receive and consider 
reports on, and monitor and discuss, known and emerging risk and compliance issues, 
including non-financial operational and other business risks.
The ongoing mitigation and management of key business risks is an item addressed by the 
Board as a whole at each board meeting through discussion, and it is an item of business on 
the agenda of the Audit & Risk Management Committee at least bi-annually.  Operational, 
financial, legal, compliance, strategic and reputational risks continue to be managed 
primarily by the Managing Director/CEO, the Chief Financial Officer and the Exploration 
Manager as a part of the day-to-day management of the Company’s affairs.  Where 
appropriate, these risks are managed with the support of relevant external professional 
advisers.
The Company undertakes an ongoing review of its safety and environmental risks and 
reports on this aspect to the Board on a monthly basis.
Recommendation 7.4   
 
A listed entity should disclose whether it has any material exposure to economic, 
environmental and social sustainability risks and, if it does, how it manages or intends to 
manage those risks.

Recommendation followed. The Company undertakes minerals exploration activities and, 
as such, faces risks inherent to its business, including economic, environmental and social 
sustainability risks, which may materially impact the Company’s ability to create or preserve 
value for security holders over the short, medium or long term.
One of the Company’s core values is safety; it prioritises safety and health to people, the 
environment and community. The Company views sustainable and responsible business 
practices as an important long term driver of performance and shareholder value and is 
committed to transparency, fair dealing, responsible treatment of employees and partners 
and positive interaction with the community.
In addition to the Company’s risk management framework (as described in the Company’s 
Risk Management Policy), the Company undertakes an ongoing review of its safety and 
environmental risks and reports on this aspect to the Board on a monthly basis.
While the Company is committed to continual review of its status with respect of the 
materiality of its economic, environmental and social sustainability risks, and take 
appropriate action to address as circumstances require.
PRINCIPLE 8 – REMUNERATE FAIRLY AND RESPONSIBLY 
 
Recommendation 8.1   
 
The board of a listed entity should:
(a)   have a remuneration committee which:
(i)
has at least three members, a majority of whom are independent directors; and
(ii)
is chaired by an independent director, and disclose
(iii)
the charter of the committee;
(iv)
the members of the committee; and
(v)   as at the end of each reporting period, the number of times the committee met 
throughout the period and the individual attendances of the members at those 
meetings; or
(b)
if it does not have remuneration committee, disclose that fact and the processes it 
employs for setting the level and composition of remuneration for directors and senior 
executives and ensuring that remuneration is appropriate and not excessive.
Recommendation followed. The Company does not have a separate remuneration 
committee due to the current small size of the Company and its operations. The Board as a 
whole has responsibility for the function of the remuneration committee, including the 
performance evaluation and remuneration of the Managing Director/CEO.
The primary function is to consider and recommend compensation arrangements for the 
Managing Director/CEO and senior executives, remuneration policies and practices, 
retirement termination policies and practices, company share schemes and other incentive 
schemes, company superannuation arrangements and remuneration arrangements for 
members of the Board.
The Company’s Remuneration Policy is located on the company’s website at:

  make specific decisions for remuneration of directors and senior officers;

resolve the terms and conditions of employment for the Managing Director/CEO;
  undertake a review of the Managing Director/CEO's performance, at least annually,
including setting with the Managing Director/CEO goals for the coming year and 
reviewing progress in achieving those goals;

report on the decisions for the Managing Director/CEO and senior employees on the 
remuneration to the Managing Director/CEO; and
  develop and facilitate a process for board and director evaluation.
In fulfilling its role of the remuneration committee, the Board may seek to retain professional 
services as it requires, at reasonable market rates, and seek external advice and market 
comparisons where necessary. 
 
 
Recommendation 8.2  
 
A listed entity should separately disclose its policies and practices regarding the 
remuneration of non-executive directors and the remuneration of executive directors and 
other senior executives. 
 
Recommendation followed.  The Company’s policies and practices regarding the 
remuneration of non-executive directors and the remuneration of executive directors and 
other senior executives is set out in the Remuneration Report contained in the Company’s 
Annual Report.  A copy of the Company’s Annual Report is located on the Company’s 
website. 
 
 
Recommendation 8.3 
 
A listed entity which has an equity-based remuneration scheme should:
(a)   have a policy on whether participants are permitted to enter into transactions (whether
through the use of derivatives or otherwise) which limit the economic risk of 
participating in the scheme; and
(b)   disclose that policy or a summary of it.
Recommendation followed.  The Company has an equity-based remuneration scheme.  
The Company’s Securities Trading Policy provides that participants in the scheme must not 
enter into any transaction which would have the effect of hedging or otherwise transferring to 
any other person the risk of any fluctuation in the value of any unvested equity interest.  The 
Securities Trading Policy is located on the Company’s website at:
