NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
JUNE 30, 2016
Note 1 Interim Reporting
While the information presented in the accompanying interim six months consolidated
financial statements is unaudited, it includes all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of
management, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and
cash flows for the interim periods presented in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These interim financial statements
 
follow the same accounting policies and methods of their application as the Company’s
December 31, 2015 annual consolidated financial statements. All adjustments are of a
normal recurring nature. It is suggested that these interim financial statements be read in
conjunction with the Company’s December 31, 2015 annual financial statements.
Operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
the results that can be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Note 2Nature and Continuance of Operations
The Company was incorporated on June 15, 1998 in the State of Nevada, USA and the
Company’s common shares are publicly traded on the OTC Bulletin Board.
Up until fiscal 2014, the Company was in the business of mineral exploration. On May 28, 2014,
the Company formalized an agreement whereby it purchased assets associated with a
smokeless cannabis delivery system. The Company planned to develop this system for
commercial purposes. On December 14, 2014, this asset purchase agreement was terminated.
On January 21, 2015, a majority of the Company’s stockholders approved a consolidation of the
issued and outstanding shares of common stock, on a 10 for 1 basis, thereby decreasing the
issued and outstanding share capital from 113,020,000 to 11,302,000. On March 11, 2015, the
Company effectively changed its name from Madison Explorations, Inc. to Madison Technologies
Inc. and effected the stock consolidation. These financial statements give retroactive effect to
both these changes.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which assumes that the Company
will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next twelve months.
Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these
financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying
values and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a
going concern. At June 30, 2016, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations, has
accumulated losses of $528,517 since its inception and expects to incur further losses in the
development of its business, all of which casts substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to
meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they
come due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern but considers that
the Company will be able to obtain additional funds by equity financing and/or related party
advances. That said, there is no assurance of additional funding being available.
Note 3Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
There have been no changes in accounting policies from those disclosed in the notes to the
audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Form 10-Q – Q2Madison Technologies, Inc.Page 8
Note 4Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company adopts new pronouncements relating to generally accepted accounting principles
applicable to the Company as they are issued, which may be in advance of their effective date.
Management does not believe that any pronouncement not yet effective but recently issued
would, if adopted, have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.
Note 5Notes Payable
The Company has two notes payable to Paleface Holdings Inc. Each note is unsecured and
payable on demand.
a)$25,000 note with annual interest payable at 8%.
As at June 30, 2016, accrued interest on the note was $22,797 (June 30, 2015 - $20,797). The
note payable balance including accrued interest was $47,797 as at June 30, 2016 (June 30,
2015 - $45,797). Interest on the debt for each of the six months ended June 30 was $1,000.
b)$23,150 ($30,000 CDN) with annual interest payable at 5%
As at June 30, 2016, accrued interest on the note was $10,708 (June 30, 2015 - $10,015). The
note payable balance including accrued interest was $33,857 as at June 30, 2016 (June 30,
2015 - $34,294). Interest on debt for the six months ended June 30 was $578 in 2016 and $600
in 2015.
The company also has an unsecured note payable on demand to Gens Incognito Inc. for
$25,000. As at June 30, 2016, accrued interest on the note was $6,202 (June 30, 2015 - $3,194).
The note payable balance including accrued interest was $31,202 as at June 30, 2016 (June 30,
2015 - $28,194)
Note 6Related Party Advance
In 2008 the President advanced the Company $561 repayable without interest or any other
terms. The unpaid balance as at June 30, 2016 is $261. There were no related party transactions
during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Note 7Common Stock
On January 21, 2015, a majority of the Company’s stockholders approved a consolidation of the
issued and outstanding shares of common stock, on a 10 for 1 basis, thereby decreasing the
issued and outstanding share capital from 113,020,000 to 11,302,000. This was effected on
March 11, 2015. This consolidation has been applied retroactively and all references to the
number of shares issued reflect this consolidation.
On June 15, 1998 the Company authorized and issued 5,375,000 shares of its common stock in
consideration of $430 in cash. ($.00008 per share.)
On June 7, 2004 the Company issued 5,907,000 in consideration of $472 in cash. ($.00008 per
share.)
On June 14, 2001 the Company approved a forward stock split of 5,000:1. These financial
statements have been retroactively adjusted to effect this split.
On March 30, 2006 the Company entered into a private placement agreement whereby the
Company issued 20,000 Regulation-S shares in exchange for $50,000. ($2.50 per share).
There are no shares subject to warrants, options or other agreements as of June 30, 2016.
Form 10-Q – Q2Madison Technologies, Inc.Page 9

holder on four different conversion rate: $0.01 debt to 1 common share, $0.045 to 1; $0.005 to $1
and $0.15 to 1. The effect that conversion would have on earnings per share has not been
disclosed due to the anti-dilutive effect.

looking statements are made, without limitation, in relation to Madison’s operating plans,
Madison’s liquidity and financial condition, availability of funds, operating and exploration costs
and the market in which Madison competes. Any statements contained herein that are not

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operation.
The following discussion of Madison’s financial condition, changes in financial condition and
results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2016 should be read in conjunction
with Madison’s unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the three
months ended June 30, 2016.
GENERAL
Madison Technologies Inc. (“Madison”) is a Nevada corporation that was incorporated on June
15, 1998. Madison was initially incorporated under the name “Madison-Taylor General
Contractors, Inc.” Effective May 24, 2004, Madison changed its name to “Madison Explorations,
Inc.” by a majority vote of the shareholders. Effective March 9, 2016, Madison changed its name
to “Madison Technologies Inc.,” by a majority vote of the shareholders. See Exhibit 3.3 –
Certificate of Amendment for more details.
We intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business
opportunities presented to us by persons or firms which desire to seek the advantages of an
issuer who has complied with the Securities Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”). We will not restrict our
search to any specific business, industry or geographical location, and we may participate in
business ventures of virtually any nature. We are considered to be a “shell company”, which is a
company with either no or nominal operations or assets, or assets consisting solely of cash and
cash equivalents. An investment in the shares of a shell company should be considered highly
illiquid given the resale restrictions that apply to them. This discussion of our proposed business
is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of our unlimited discretion to search for
and enter into potential business opportunities. We anticipate that we may be able to participate
in only one potential business venture because of our lack of financial resources.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern
and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of
assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in
operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating
requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of
equity or debt securities.
Form 10-Q – Q2Madison Technologies, Inc.Page 14
Six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015
Our net loss for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 was $23,756 (2015: $37,461), which
consisted of general and administration expenses. We did not generate any revenue during
either six-month period in fiscal 2016 or 2015. The increase in expenses in the current fiscal year
relate to accounting, audit, and legal fees that we have incurred in connection with the filing
obligations with both the SEC and with SEDAR in Canada.
The weighted average number of shares outstanding was 11,302,000 for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2016 and 11,302,000 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As at June 30, 2016, our current assets were $618 compared to $501 in current assets at
December 31, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, our current liabilities were $271,315 compared to
$266,251 at December 31, 2015. Current liabilities at June 30, 2016 were comprised of $112,857
in notes payable and accrued interest, $134,033in convertible notes payable, $26,164 in
accounts payable and $261 related party advance to our director.
Stockholders’ deficit increased from $265,750 as of December 31, 2015 to $270,697 as of June
30, 2016.
As at June 30, 2016, Madison had cash of $618 and a working capital deficit of $265,750,
compared to cash of $501 and working capital deficit of $270,697 as at December 31, 2015.
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
Madison used cash of $20,833 in operating activities during the first six months of fiscal 2016
compared to cash used of $25,838 in operating activities during the same period in the previous
fiscal year. The decrease in the operating activities was principally a result of an decrease in
accounts payable and accruals.
Net Cash Provided (Used in) Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was nil for the first six months of fiscal 2016 as compared
with cash flow from investing activities of nil for the same period in the previous fiscal year.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash flows provided by financing activities were $21,000 for the first six months of fiscal
2016. Madison generated $25,000 from financing activities during the first six months of fiscal
2015 from the proceeds of a note payable.
Plan of Operation
Our plan of operations is to raise debt and, or, equity to meet our ongoing operating expenses
and attempt to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for
growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders. There can
be no assurance that we will successfully complete these transactions. In particular, there is no
assurance that any such business will be located or that any stockholder will realize any return
on their shares after such a transaction. Any merger or acquisition completed by us can be
expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our current
stockholders. We believe we are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the
acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial
concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical
expertise than we have. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management
availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our
competitors.
Form 10-Q – Q2Madison Technologies, Inc.Page 15
We intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business
opportunities presented to us by persons or firms which desire to seek the advantages of an
issuer who has complied with the Securities Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”). We will not restrict our
search to any specific business, industry or geographical location, and we may participate in
business ventures of virtually any nature. This discussion of our proposed business is
purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of our virtually unlimited discretion to
search for and enter into potential business opportunities. We anticipate that we may be able to
participate in only one potential business venture because of our lack of financial resources.
We may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations,
or that desire to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to
expand into new products or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate
purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly owned subsidiaries in various
businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries; though no such opportunities have
been identified at the time of this filing.
We expect that the selection of a business opportunity will be complex and risky. Due to general
economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and
shortages of available capital, we believe that there are numerous firms seeking the benefits of
an issuer who has complied with the 1934 Act. Such benefits may include facilitating or
improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for
incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, providing liquidity (subject to
restrictions of applicable statutes) for all stockholders and other factors. Potentially, available
business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of
development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such
business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We have, and will continue to have,
essentially no assets to provide the owners of business opportunities. However, we will be able
to offer owners of acquisition candidates the opportunity to acquire a controlling ownership
interest in an issuer who has complied with the 1934 Act without incurring the cost and time
required to conduct an initial public offering.
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by, or under the supervision of,
our Board of Directors. We intend to concentrate on identifying preliminary prospective business
opportunities which may be brought to our attention through present associations of our director,
professional advisors or by our stockholders. In analyzing prospective business opportunities, we
will consider such matters as (i) available technical, financial and managerial resources; (ii)
working capital and other financial requirements; (iii) history of operations, if any, and prospects
for the future; (iv) nature of present and expected competition; (v) quality, experience and depth of
management services; (vi) potential for further research, development or exploration; (vii) specific
risk factors not now foreseeable but that may be anticipated to impact the proposed activities of
the Company; (viii) potential for growth or expansion; (ix) potential for profit; (x) public recognition
and acceptance of products, services or trades; (xi) name identification; and (xii) other factors that
we consider relevant. As part of our investigation of the business opportunity, we expect to meet
personally with management and key personnel. To the extent possible, we intend to utilize
written reports and personal investigation to evaluate the above factors.
We will not acquire or merge with any company for which audited financial statements cannot be
obtained within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction.
Management anticipates incurring the following expenses during the next 12 month period:
●
Management anticipates spending approximately $2,500 in ongoing general and
administrative expenses per month for the next 12 months, for a total anticipated expenditure of
$30,000 over the next 12 months. The general and administrative expenses for the year will
consist primarily of professional fees for the audit and legal work relating to Madison’s
regulatory filings throughout the year, as well as transfer agent fees, annual mineral claim fees
and general office expenses.
Management anticipates spending approximately $15,000 in complying with Madison’s
obligations as a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as a
reporting issuer in Canada. These expenses will consist primarily of professional fees relating
to the preparation of Madison’s financial statements and completing and filing its annual report,
quarterly report, and current report filings with the SEC and with SEDAR in Canada.
●
Form 10-Q – Q2Madison Technologies, Inc.Page 16
As at June 30, 2016, Madison had cash of $618 and a working capital deficit of $270.697.
Accordingly, Madison will require additional financing in the amount of $315,079 in order to fund
its obligations as a reporting company under the Securities Act of 1934 and its general and
administrative expenses for the next 12 months.
During the 12 month period following the date of this report, management anticipates that
Madison will not generate any revenue. Accordingly, Madison will be required to obtain
additional financing in order to continue its plan of operations. Management believes that debt
financing will not be an alternative for funding Madison’s plan of operations as it does not have
tangible assets to secure any debt financing. Rather management anticipates that additional
funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of Madison’s common stock.
However, Madison does not have any financing arranged and cannot provide investors with any
assurance that it will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of its common stock to fund
its plan of operations. In the absence of such financing, Madison will not be able to acquire any
interest in a new property and its business plan will fail. Even if Madison is successful in
obtaining equity financing and acquire an interest in a new property, additional exploration on the
mineral property will be required before a determination as to whether commercially exploitable
mineralization is present. If Madison does not continue to obtain additional financing, it will be
forced to abandon its business and plan of operations.
Going Concern
Madison has not attained profitable operations and is dependent upon obtaining financing to
pursue any extensive business activities. For these reasons Madison’s auditors stated in their
report that they have substantial doubt Madison will be able to continue as a going concern.
Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
Madison has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to
have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is
material to stockholders.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Madison is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not
required to provide the information required under this item.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the
time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive
officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our
management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of March 31, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.
Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting during the three-month period ended March 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
