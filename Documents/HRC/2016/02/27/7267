<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its twenty-second session from 4 to 15 
</p>
<p>May 2015. The review of Panama was held at the 5th meeting, on 6 May 2015. The 
</p>
<p>delegation of Panama was headed by the Minister of Labour and Labour Market 
</p>
<p>Development, Luis Ernesto Carles. At its 10th meeting, held on 8 May 2015, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group adopted the report on Panama. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Panama: Germany, Ghana and the Russian 
</p>
<p>Federation.  
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following documents 
</p>
<p>were issued for the review of Panama: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report (A/HRC/WG.6/22/PAN/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) (A/HRC/WG.6/22/PAN/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR (A/HRC/WG.6/22/PAN/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Germany, Liechtenstein, 
</p>
<p>Mexico, Spain, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
</p>
<p>Ireland was transmitted to Panama through the troika. These questions are available on the 
</p>
<p>extranet of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation began its presentation indicating that the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>had been an opportunity to assess the human rights progress in Panama and listen to the 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the international community. 
</p>
<p>6. In less than one year in office, the Government had taken steps towards the full 
</p>
<p>implementation of the human rights obligations of Panama in the areas of freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression, relations with unions and indigenous peoples, the procedure for determining 
</p>
<p>refugee status and matters related to transparency and accountability. 
</p>
<p>7. The Government had focused its efforts on institution-building through a strategy 
</p>
<p>that included the ratification of human rights instruments, the harmonization of national 
</p>
<p>legislation with international obligations, the establishment and renewal of institutions and 
</p>
<p>the implementation of public policies aimed at achieving that goal. 
</p>
<p>8. One of the commitments undertaken by Panama during its first review was to 
</p>
<p>transform the inter-institutional commission set up to prepare its national report into a 
</p>
<p>standing body. In July 2012, by executive decree, the national standing commission for 
</p>
<p>monitoring and ensuring compliance with the human rights commitments of Panama at the 
</p>
<p>national and international level was established. The commission held consultations with 
</p>
<p>key civil society organizations working on human rights for the drafting of the national 
</p>
<p>report for the second review. </p>


<p>9. Also, a subcommission was created to set up the national mechanism for the 
</p>
<p>prevention of torture, also with civil society participation. The subcommission agreed that 
</p>
<p>the national mechanism would be a new independent institution created by law. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation added that, in compliance with universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>commitments, Panama had ratified the convention on statelessness, the International 
</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
</p>
<p>Treatment or Punishment and the Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189) of the 
</p>
<p>International Labour Organization (ILO). Likewise, Panama had accepted the competence 
</p>
<p>of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to receive individual 
</p>
<p>petitions. The debate regarding the ratification of ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples 
</p>
<p>Convention, 1989 (No. 169) was ongoing within a recently established working group 
</p>
<p>comprising representatives of the Government and of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>11. Moreover, under the standing invitation to special procedures mandate holders, 
</p>
<p>Panama had received visits from the Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples and the 
</p>
<p>Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation acknowledged that some reports before the United Nations treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies remained pending. The aforementioned standing human rights commission would 
</p>
<p>draft a workplan to address this issue in the near future. 
</p>
<p>13. The delegation considered that the fight against discrimination should begin by 
</p>
<p>acknowledging its existence. The Government had recognized the persistence of cultural 
</p>
<p>and social attitudes that tended to discriminate against certain groups. In this context, to 
</p>
<p>address the absence of statistical data relating to persons of African descent and the 
</p>
<p>indigenous population, the 2010 census included the option for respondents to self-identify 
</p>
<p>as Afro-descendant or indigenous. Additionally, the Government had adopted extensive 
</p>
<p>legislation on affirmative action to protect the lands, culture and institutions of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples. Also, electoral districts had been designed to facilitate the election of indigenous 
</p>
<p>representatives to the National Assembly. The delegation acknowledged, however, that the 
</p>
<p>enactment of comprehensive legislation prohibiting discrimination on any ground, 
</p>
<p>including race and ethnicity, was still pending. 
</p>
<p>14. Regarding the rights of indigenous peoples, the delegation recalled the restoration of 
</p>
<p>the repealed articles of the General Environmental Law granting indigenous people rights 
</p>
<p>over natural resources on the lands they inhabit, the adoption of legislation on the 
</p>
<p>protection of traditional medicines and the right to consultation, and the recent legislative 
</p>
<p>restoration of the free and informed consent of indigenous peoples in relation to measures 
</p>
<p>affecting them. The delegation recognized, however, that the indigenous population 
</p>
<p>continued to have the highest rates of poverty and extreme poverty. Therefore, the 
</p>
<p>Government was preparing a comprehensive development plan with the participation of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>15. The delegation indicated that the Government had requested the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide technical assistance aimed at training the 
</p>
<p>police in the proper use of force and incorporating in the curriculum of the police institute a 
</p>
<p>human rights approach. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation acknowledged that serious human rights violations were committed 
</p>
<p>during the events of 6&#8211;10 July 2010 in Changuinola. Law 144/ 2015, which was adopted 
</p>
<p>with the consent of the concerned persons, established a series of measures for providing 
</p>
<p>redress to the victims. Furthermore, during the public enactment of the Law, the President 
</p>
<p>of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, apologized on behalf of the State to the victims and people 
</p>
<p>affected by the events. </p>


<p>17. On violence against women, Panama adopted in 2013 a law that criminalized 
</p>
<p>femicide. The State has also taken steps for the implementation of this law, including the 
</p>
<p>appointment of a special prosecutor and the creation and regulation of the National 
</p>
<p>Committee on Violence against Women. The delegation noted, however, that the regulation 
</p>
<p>implementing the law, still pending, would need to be drafted in the near future. 
</p>
<p>18. On the issue of trafficking, measures had been taken to ensure the adequate care of 
</p>
<p>victims in the context of judicial proceedings. Also, the number of specialized trainings had 
</p>
<p>increased for staff in the police, the prosecutors&#8217; offices, the judiciary, the migration office 
</p>
<p>and the health and education ministries. The delegation committed itself to the prompt 
</p>
<p>adoption of the regulation implementing Law 79/2011, to the provision of a budget to the 
</p>
<p>National Commission against Trafficking in Persons and to the building of a shelter for 
</p>
<p>victims of human trafficking, in accordance with international standards. 
</p>
<p>19. Also, as part of a comprehensive public safety policy, the Government was 
</p>
<p>implementing a safe neighbourhoods programme aimed at addressing criminal activity 
</p>
<p>involving gangs through processes and spaces of social integration for young people who 
</p>
<p>belonged to or remained close to them. 
</p>
<p>20. Regarding refugees, the National Assembly passed Law 74/2013 permitting refugees 
</p>
<p>to apply for residence after three years of living on Panamanian soil. The Government has 
</p>
<p>also improved the process for determining refugee status so that it is in accordance with 
</p>
<p>international standards. In addition, the delegation committed itself to the prompt adoption 
</p>
<p>of a decree regulating the mechanism to determine statelessness. 
</p>
<p>21. On immigration, the Government had continued its policy of openness by 
</p>
<p>regularizing the situation of 57,652 foreigners between 2010 and 2014. The delegation 
</p>
<p>recognized that currently the conditions in migration shelters were not adequate. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, the Government was committed to building a new women&#8217;s shelter with the 
</p>
<p>infrastructure necessary to ensure appropriate treatment. Similarly, the conditions in the 
</p>
<p>men&#8217;s shelter were being improved.  
</p>
<p>22. The delegation acknowledged the need for measures to ensure the independence and 
</p>
<p>impartiality of judges. The National Assembly was debating a bill to establish a judicial 
</p>
<p>career and, with the support of civil society, the executive branch had submitted to 
</p>
<p>Congress a bill on community justice. 
</p>
<p>23. With regard to the rights of children, the delegation reported that the Government 
</p>
<p>had recently adopted legislation to raise to 18 years the legal minimum age for marriage 
</p>
<p>and had set up an inter-institutional commission to prepare a draft law on the protection of 
</p>
<p>the rights of children and adolescents. 
</p>
<p>24. The delegation added that a ministry for the environment had recently been 
</p>
<p>established to face the challenge of guaranteeing the right to a healthy environment.  
</p>
<p>25. The delegation reiterated the commitment of Panama to continue to promote 
</p>
<p>compliance with its human rights obligations and take positive measures to ensure the 
</p>
<p>conditions necessary for the full enjoyment of the human rights of every person living in 
</p>
<p>the country. 
</p>

</p>
<p>made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report.

</p>
<p>particularly the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, the </p>


<p>Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the International Convention for 
</p>
<p>the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It highlighted the adoption of 
</p>
<p>laws on benefits for persons with disabilities and the &#8220;El Solca&#8221; software, which permits 
</p>
<p>such persons to be independent in the areas of education, work and social life. Ecuador 
</p>
<p>made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. El Salvador recognized the commitment of Panama to the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>and the breadth of civil society participation in the preparation process. It welcomed the 
</p>
<p>importance given by Panama to the implementation of public policies on the administration 
</p>
<p>of justice, citizen security, trafficking in persons and equal opportunities for women, among 
</p>
<p>others. It underscored the main advances made on issues such as persons deprived of 
</p>
<p>liberty, children, indigenous peoples, refugees, migrants, persons with disabilities and Afro-
</p>
<p>descendants. 
</p>
<p>29. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela valued the efforts of Panama to implement 
</p>

</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture, as well as the decrease in the unemployment rate and extreme

</p>
<p>areas and encouraged Panama to make further efforts, particularly with regard to the 
</p>
<p>situation in detention facilities, domestic violence and the rights of marginalized groups. 
</p>
<p>Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Ghana commended Panama for the creation of the Anti-Discrimination Unit, which 
</p>
<p>deals with cases of racial discrimination against indigenous and Afro-descendant 
</p>
<p>populations, and considered the provision of legal assistance by the office of free legal aid 
</p>
<p>to crime victims, particularly women, a step in the right direction. It noted various 
</p>
<p>innovative steps to render effective judicial services to handle expeditiously a backlog of

<p>52. The delegation outlined a series of social programmes that had been developed by 
</p>
<p>the Government to fulfil its commitment on social inclusion for all citizens. The

</p>
<p>Protocol to the Convention against Torture and to take measures to abolish the practice of 
</p>
<p>employment-related pregnancy tests. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>

</p>
<p>against Torture, the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 
</p>
<p>International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
</p>
<p>and for extending a standing invitation to the special procedures mandate holders of the

</p>
<p>living conditions of persons deprived of liberty. Spain made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>57. Sweden noted that the Family Code and the Civil Code provided for the &#8220;right to 
</p>
<p>correct&#8221; children by using corporal punishment. It stated that child labour was common in 
</p>
<p>Panama, mostly in the agricultural and informal sectors, and that indigenous children were

</p>
<p>Sweden made recommendations. 
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>60. Trinidad and Tobago commended several programmes aimed at promoting and

</p>
<p>recommendations.  
</p>
<p>63. The United States of America welcomed the commitment to ratify human rights 
</p>
<p>agreements and promote equal opportunities for women. Despite the justice system 
</p>

</p>
<p>steps to combat forced labour and trafficking for sex, and encouraged identifying and </p>


<p>protecting victims. It noted the limited rights of asylum seekers, urging Panama to provide

</p>
<p>recommendation that Panama ratify ILO Convention No. 169. It asked about strategies for 
</p>
<p>the birth registration of indigenous, migrant and refuge children. Brazil urged Panama to

</p>
<p>development of a criminal accusatory system and the adoption of legislation on indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; rights. The integration of children and juveniles in conflict with the law should be 
</p>
<p>a priority. Chile made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>74. China commended Panama for strengthening human rights mechanisms, training 
</p>
<p>prison staff on the issue of torture, improving access to justice through the judicial 
</p>
<p>facilitators programme, providing legal support, increasing resources for education,

</p>
<p>on Afro-descendants. Colombia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>76. Costa Rica highlighted the progress achieved by Panama and noted the ratification 
</p>
<p>of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and the International 
</p>

</p>
<p>international commitments and requested additional information on the commission that 
</p>
<p>would monitor compliance with human rights commitments. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>77. Cuba highlighted the preparation of the national report with the participation of the

</p>
<p>the reform of the prison system and meeting the target of reducing by half the proportion of 
</p>
<p>the population living on less than $1 a day. Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>78. Morocco welcomed the institutional and legislative measures taken by the 
</p>
<p>Government for the implementation of the framework for the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights, including the harmonization of the minimum age of marriage, the creation of 
</p>
<p>a national mechanism for the prevention of torture, the adoption of a law establishing a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive system of child protection and the creation of a shelter for victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking. 
</p>
<p>79. The delegation of Panama, responding to questions sent in advance, noted that the 
</p>
<p>Government had been implementing a prison reform since 2010 to reduce overcrowding, 
</p>
<p>train personnel and enhance respect for the human rights of detainees. To this end, in 2011 
</p>
<p>the prison training academy was reopened and the working conditions of the prison staff 
</p>
<p>were being improved. The Government was also committed to adopting a law to 
</p>
<p>professionalize the prison service. 
</p>
<p>80. Likewise, 45 per cent of convicted persons deprived of their liberty were classified 
</p>
<p>and the separation of pretrial from convicted detainees was ongoing. Although the </p>


<p>Government was aware that constructing prisons did not by itself solve the problems of the 
</p>
<p>system, it considered it necessary to improve the prison infrastructure to ensure respect for 
</p>
<p>the human rights of detainees. In this regard, the &#8220;Nueva Joya&#8221; penitentiary, with a capacity 
</p>
<p>of more than 5,000 detainees, was about to open. 
</p>
<p>81. With regard to women deprived of their liberty, the Government had made a 
</p>
<p>diagnosis from a gender and rights perspective and had designed a special programme to 
</p>
<p>assist women in situations of confinement. In the case of juvenile detainees, the 
</p>
<p>Government had given priority to providing them with comprehensive care and improving 
</p>
<p>the infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>82. With regard to the rights of indigenous peoples, the Government was working on a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive development plan in consultation with indigenous authorities. The plan had 
</p>
<p>three components: political, economic and social. The political one was aimed at 
</p>
<p>strengthening the traditional indigenous structures and authorities. The economic 
</p>
<p>component sought to reduce poverty levels and improve the economic conditions of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples by strengthening their production and traditional economic structures. 
</p>
<p>The social axis sought to implement specific programmes to improve the levels of 
</p>
<p>education, culture, health, housing and infrastructure in indigenous territories. 
</p>
<p>83. With regard to the implementation of the adversarial criminal justice system, its 
</p>
<p>application would be extended to a third judicial district, out of four, in September 2015. 
</p>
<p>By September 2016, the system should be in place throughout the country. According to 
</p>
<p>official statistics, the duration of court proceedings applying the new justice system had 
</p>
<p>decreased by 63 per cent and the use of preventive detention had fallen by 60-70 per cent. 
</p>
<p>84. Regarding the questions and recommendations on actions taken to reduce violence 
</p>
<p>against women, Panama had developed regulations, plans, policies and programmes to 
</p>
<p>provide assistance to women facing various forms of violence. 
</p>
<p>85. The comprehensive centres for guidance and care of the Ministry of Social 
</p>
<p>Development provided free, comprehensive and specialized care, psychosocial counselling 
</p>
<p>and legal advice. The National Institute for Women also provided psychosocial and legal 
</p>
<p>support to women victims of domestic and other forms of violence through an 
</p>
<p>interdisciplinary team. Local networks to fight violence against women had also been 
</p>
<p>created, many of them with the support from entities of the United Nations system. Staff 
</p>
<p>working in the judiciary had also been trained, especially officers in contact with women 
</p>
<p>victims and alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>86. The delegation emphasized that Panama was implementing a public policy on equal 
</p>
<p>opportunities for women. An inter-institutional plan was being elaborated, with wide 
</p>
<p>participation of civil society, to implement the policy. 
</p>
<p>87. The statistics system had been strengthened and updated with a gender perspective, 
</p>
<p>and projects for rural women were being carried out to provide access to advice, training 
</p>
<p>and credit, with the aim of promoting economic empowerment.  
</p>
<p>88. Panama thanked the delegations that had intervened during the interactive dialogue 
</p>
<p>in an open and constructive manner on issues that were of interest to the international 
</p>
<p>community and that affected the human rights of the Panamanian people. 
</p>
<p>89. In closing, the delegation manifested that, since 2010, the Government had worked 
</p>
<p>on the implementation of the recommendations it received during its first review. It 
</p>
<p>recognized that the work was not over. The delegation reiterated the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>commitment to protecting human rights. The recommendations received during the second 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review would provide guidance and support to improve the culture of 
</p>
<p>coexistence and understanding, the cornerstones of the promotion of human rights, and 
</p>
<p>contribute to strengthening Panamanian democracy. </p>
