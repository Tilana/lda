Franco-Nevada is the leading gold-focused royalty and stream company by both gold revenue and number of gold
assets. The Company has the largest and most diversified portfolio of royalties and streams by commodity, geography,
revenue type and stage of project.  The portfolio is actively managed with the aim to maintain over 80% of revenue from
precious metals (gold, silver & PGMs).

The Company does not operate mines, develop projects or conduct exploration.  Franco-Nevada’s business model is
focused on managing and growing its portfolio of royalties and streams. The advantages of this business model are:
·                  Exposure to precious metals price optionality;
·                  A perpetual discovery option over large areas of geologically prospective lands with no
additional cost other than the initial investment;
·                  Limited exposure to many of the risks associated with operating companies;
·                  A free cash-flow business with limited cash calls;
·                  A high-margin business that can generate cash through the entire commodity cycle;
·                  A scalable and diversified business in which a large number of assets can be managed with
a small stable overhead; and
·                  A forward-looking business in which management focuses on growth opportunities rather
than operational or development issues.
Franco-Nevada’s financial results in the short-term are primarily tied to the price of commodities and the amount of
production from its portfolio of producing assets.  From time to time, financial results are also supplemented by
acquisitions of new producing assets.  Over the longer-term, results are impacted by the availability of exploration and
development capital applied by other companies to expand or extend Franco-Nevada’s producing assets or to advance
Franco-Nevada’s advanced and exploration assets into production.
Franco-Nevada has a long-term focus in making its investments and recognizes it is in a cyclical industry.  Franco-
Nevada has historically operated by maintaining a strong balance sheet so that it can make investments during
commodity cycle downturns.
Franco-Nevada’s shares are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges under the symbol FNV.  An investment
in Franco-Nevada’s shares is expected to provide investors with yield and exposure to gold price and exploration
optionality while limiting exposure to many of the risks of operating companies. Since its IPO over eight years ago,
Franco-Nevada has
3
increased its dividend annually and its share price has outperformed the gold price and all relevant gold equity
benchmarks.

HIGHLIGHTS
Financial — Three Months
·                  The Company earned 112,787 Gold Equivalent Ounces (“GEOs”)1 compared to 83,040
GEOs in second quarter 2015, an increase of 35.8%;

1  GEOs include our gold, silver, platinum, palladium and other mineral assets. GEOs are estimated
on a gross basis for NSR royalties and, in the case of stream ounces, before the payment of the per
ounce contractual price paid by the Company. For NPI royalties, GEOs are calculated taking into
account the NPI economics. Silver, platinum, palladium and other minerals were converted to GEOs
by dividing associated revenue, which includes settlement adjustments, by the average gold price
for the period. For average commodity prices used in the calculation of GEOs, please refer to
average commodity price tables on pages 8 and 20 of this MD&A.

GUIDANCE
The following contains forward-looking statements about our guidance for 2016. Reference should be made to the
“Cautionary Statement on Forward Looking Information” section at the end of this MD&A. For a description of material
factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements below, please see the
Cautionary Statement and the “Risk Factors” section of our most recent Annual Information Form filed with the Canadian
securities regulatory authorities on www.sedar.com and our most recent Form 40-F filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on www.sec.gov.
Franco-Nevada realized record growth from its mineral assets for the first six months of 2016. Mineral assets contributed
219,408 GEOs with $11.4 million in revenue from Franco-Nevada’s oil & gas assets for the first two quarters of 2016. For
fiscal 2016, Franco-Nevada expects to receive GEOs from its mineral assets in the higher end of the previously
announced guidance range of 425,000 to 445,000 GEOs.  In addition, the Company confirms its previous revenue
guidance range for Oil & Gas of $15.0 million to $25.0 million. Of the 425,000 to 445,000 GEOs, Franco-Nevada expects
to receive 295,000 to 305,000 GEOs under its various stream agreements compared to 222,670 GEOs received for full
year 2015.
In forecasting GEOs for the remainder of 2016, gold, silver, platinum and palladium metals have been converted to GEOs
using commodity prices of $1,325/oz Au, $19.50/oz Ag, $1,050/oz Pt and $600/oz Pd.  For 2016, the WTI oil price is
assumed to average $35 per barrel with a $3.50 per barrel price differential for Canadian oil.  2016 guidance assumes the
continued steady state of operations from our assets.
The Company funded $37.7 million towards the Cobre Panama precious metals stream in second quarter 2016 and has
now funded $376 million of the $1 billion commitment.  The Company expects to fund approximately $120.0 million to
$140.0 million in 2016 of which $35-$45 million will be funded in third quarter 2016.
In addition, for 2016, the Company estimates depletion and depreciation expense to be approximately $250.0 million to
$275.0 million.

Precious metals commodity prices have been in a volatile and declining state for an extended period of time with prices
only recently beginning to recover. The gold price has increased approximately 25% since the beginning of the year.
During the second quarter of 2016, average gold prices traded between $1,213/oz and $1,325/oz with an average price of
$1,259/oz. This compares to an average gold price of $1,193/oz for the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 5.5%, and
$1,181/oz for the first quarter of 2016.  Historically, the price of gold has been subject to volatile price movements over
short periods of time and is affected by numerous macroeconomic and industry factors that are beyond the Company’s
control. Major influences on the gold price include macroeconomic factors such as the level of interest rates and inflation
expectations as well as currency exchange rate fluctuations and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar and the supply of
and demand for gold.
During second quarter 2016, platinum and palladium prices averaged $1,004/oz and $568/oz compared to $1,127/oz and
$760/oz for the second quarter of 2015, decreases of 10.9% and 25.3%, respectively.  Silver prices averaged $17.17/oz
for second quarter compared to $16.41/oz in second quarter 2015.
Commodity price volatility not only impacts overall revenues but also impacts the number of GEOs contributed by non-
gold assets when converting from silver, platinum, palladium and other minerals to gold equivalent ounces.
Despite the volatile commodity prices, our mineral assets continued to deliver strong results as the mineral assets
performed well delivering a significant increase in GEOs over the prior year.  One of the strengths of the Franco-Nevada
business model is that our business is not impacted when producer costs increase. Royalty and stream
payments/deliveries are based on production levels of the underlying operations with no adjustments for the operator’s
operating costs, with the exception of NPI royalties which are based on the profit of the
8
underlying mining operation. During the quarter, NPI royalties accounted for approximately 4% of total revenues.
GEO Production Growth
Gold Equivalent Ounces and Revenue
Franco-Nevada’s revenue is generated from various forms of agreements, ranging from NSR royalties, streams, NPI
royalties, net royalty interests (“NRI”), working interests and other. For definitions of the various types of agreements,
please refer to our most recent Annual Information Form filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or our Form 40-F filed on
EDGAR at www.sec.gov.
Franco-Nevada continued to see significant growth in GEOs with mineral assets contributing 112,787 GEOs in the second
quarter of 2016, an increase of 35.8% over the second quarter of 2015.  Revenue for the quarter was $150.9 million
compared with $109.4 million for the same period of 2015, an increase of 37.9%.
The impact on revenue earned by the growth in the number of GEOs received was further enhanced by higher average
gold and silver prices in second quarter 2016 compared to prior year.

commodity price tables on pages 8 and 20 of this MD&A.
Our portfolio is well-diversified with GEOs and revenue being earned from 43 mineral assets and 59 oil & gas
interests in various jurisdictions.

GEO Reconciliation — Q2 2015 to Q2 2016
GEOs earned from precious metal assets increased by 37.8% to 111,300 GEOs in the second quarter of 2016 from
80,742 GEOs in the second quarter of 2015. Revenue from precious metal assets was $141.2 million in the second
quarter of 2016 compared with $96.4 million for the same period as 2015. The largest component of these increases was
contributed from our Latin America assets which realized a 62.0% increase in GEOs and 71.3% increase in revenue
compared to the prior year as a result of the acquisitions of the Antamina and Antapaccay streams.
11
Quarterly Revenue Breakdown
(expressed in millions)
Overall, GEOs and revenue increases for the quarter are attributable to the following:
·     The Company received 19,581 GEO deliveries from Antapaccay, a stream added in first quarter
2016.  Second quarter 2016 represented the first full quarter of deliveries from the asset.
·     The Company received 11,898 GEO deliveries from Antamina, an asset added to the portfolio in
fourth quarter 2015.
·     The Company received its first full quarter of deliveries from Karma with 2,500 gold ounces being
received.  Deliveries from Karma are fixed in the initial years at a rate of 1,250 ounces per month.
Due to timing of deliveries, the Company expects to receive 5,000 gold ounces in third quarter 2016.
·     Our Sudbury precious metals assets delivered an additional 1,979 GEOs compared to second
quarter 2015.  This increase is due to higher platinum and palladium production at the mines
partially offset by lower gold, platinum and palladium prices on the conversion to GEOs.
·     Goldstrike delivered an additional 3,211 GEOs compared to second quarter 2015 which consists
of both higher NSR and NPI ounces.
·     The above significant increase in GEOs were partially offset by lower GEO deliveries from
Candelaria (-7,945 GEOs) where lower deliveries were expected in 2016, Bald Mountain (-1,391
GEOs) and Stillwater (-1,077 GEOs) in the quarter.
·     During the second quarter of 2016, 1,385,191 ounces of silver were delivered from our
Candelaria, Antapaccay, Antamina and Cerro San Pedro interests which were converted to GEOs.
Other Minerals generated 1,487 GEOs and $1.9 million in revenue.
12
Oil & gas assets generated revenue of $7.8 million for the quarter (99% oil and 1% gas) compared with $10.3 million for
the same period of 2015 (97% oil and 3% gas), a decrease of 24.3%. The decrease is largely due to lower average oil
prices realized in the second quarter of 2016. Production for the quarter was 3.2% lower than the second quarter of 2015.
Revenue from the Weyburn Unit for the quarter decreased to $6.7 million (2015 - $ 8.3 million) with $4.4 million earned
from the NRI (2015 - $5.3 million), $2.0 million earned from the working interest (2015 - $2.5 million) and $0.3 million
earned from the overriding royalties (2015 - $0.5 million). Revenue from the Weyburn NRI was lower due to the decrease in
the average oil price.  Actual realized price from the NRI was C$46.48/boe for the quarter, down 22.8% from the realized
price of C$60.17/boe for the second quarter of 2015.
13
Revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $150.9 million (2015 - $109.4 million) and $282.9 million
(2015 - $218.6 million), respectively, and was comprised of the following:

Revenue
As stated earlier, two of the Company’s primary objectives are to build a diversified portfolio of royalties and streams by
commodity, geography, revenue type and stage of project and maintain precious metals revenue above 80% of total
revenue.  For the second quarter of 2016, precious metals revenue comprised 94% of total revenue compared to 88% in
second quarter 2015.  In addition, the Company generated 84% of revenue from jurisdictions in the Americas, with a long
history of mining.

The increase of $3.7 million is attributable to more stream ounces delivered pursuant to the various stream agreements in
the second quarter of 2016 when compared to 2015.  The
15
ongoing stream cost per ounces are either a fixed amount per ounce delivered (adjusted for inflation each year) or an
amount based as a percentage of spot price of gold or silver. The Company was delivered 81,180 GEOs under its stream
agreements during second quarter 2016 compared to 52,905 GEOs delivered in second quarter 2015.  Oil & gas operating
costs were lower due to production and cost efficiencies implemented by the operators.

(expressed in millions)
Depletion and Depreciation
Depletion and depreciation totaled $68.2 million for the quarter compared to $49.1 million in 2015. The majority of the
increase of $19.1 million is due to the increased depletion associated with the two significant stream acquisitions
completed by the Company in the last 12 months.  During the quarter, the Company recorded $11.9 million in depletion for
Antapaccay and $8.0 million for Antamina.  In addition, $1.7 million incremental depletion for Goldstrike was recorded due
to higher production and the Company recorded $2.1 million in depletion for Karma where initial deliveries were received. 
These increases were partially offset by lower depletion on Candelaria and Bald Mountain due to lower production and
Oil & gas due to the impact of a weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.

Corporate Administration
Corporate administration expenses increased to $5.7 million in the quarter, representing 3.8% of revenue, compared to
$4.1 million in 2015. The increase is primarily due to higher board of directors’ costs as the deferred share units earned by
board members increased in value during the quarter.

Franco-Nevada continued to see significant growth in GEOs contributed with mineral assets contributing 219,408 GEOs in
the first half of 2016, an increase of 30.5% over the first half of 2015.  Revenue for the period was $282.9 million
compared with $218.6 million for the same period of 2015, an increase of 29.4%. Although the number of GEOs
contributed grew, lower average silver, platinum and palladium prices reduced the overall positive impact of this increase
on revenue.
The following table outlines GEOs and revenue attributable to Franco-Nevada for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and

GEO Reconciliation — Six Months 2015 to Six Months 2016
GEOs earned from precious metal assets increased by 31.7% to 215,876 GEOs in 2016 from 163,912 GEOs in 2015.
Revenue from precious metal assets was $267.1 million in 2016 compared with $197.8 million for the same period as
2015. The largest increase came from our Latin American assets.
Overall, GEOs and revenue increases are attributable to the following:
·                  The Company received 28,499 GEO deliveries from Antapaccay. This includes 371,000
silver ounces delivered and sold by the Company.  This is a new asset for 2016.
·                  The Company received 29,679 GEO deliveries from Antamina for the first six months of
2016.
·                  The new stream Karma has delivered three months of fixed ounces thus far in 2016
accounting for 3,750 GEOs.
·                  The Company benefited from the Hemlo NPI contributing an additional 1,559 GEOs in 2016
compared to 2015 due to higher gold prices and stronger production.
·                  Goldstrike delivered an additional 5,752 GEOs compared to the first six months of 2015
which consists of both higher NSR and NPI ounces.
·                  The above significant increases in GEOs were partially offset by lower GEO deliveries from
Candelaria (-11,024 GEOs) where lower deliveries were expected in 2016, Bald Mountain (-2,941
GEOs) and Stillwater (-2,344 GEOs) in the first six months of 2016.
22
·                  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, 3,132,933 ounces of silver were delivered from
Candelaria, Antapaccay, Antamina and Cerro San Pedro interests which were converted to GEOs.
Other Minerals generated 3,532 GEOs and $4.4 million in revenue.
Oil & gas assets generated revenue of $11.4 million for the first six months of 2016 (98% oil and 2% gas) compared with
$15.8 million for 2015 (95% oil and 5% gas), a decrease of 27.8%. The decrease is due to lower average oil prices
realized in 2016. Production for the six months was 3.7% lower than for the same period in 2015.
Revenue from the Weyburn Unit for the period decreased to $9.0 million (2015 - $ 11.7 million) with $5.3 million earned
from the NRI (2015 - $6.8 million), $3.2 million earned from the working interest (2015 - $4.2 million) and $0.5 million
earned from the overriding royalties (2015 - $0.7 million). Revenue from the Weyburn NRI was lower due to the decrease in
the average oil price. Actual realized price from the NRI was C$40.18/boe for the period, down 23.5% from the realized
price of C$52.53/boe for the first half of 2015.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, precious metals revenue was 94% of total revenue compared to 91% in 2015. 
In addition, the Company generated 83% of revenue from the Americas.

The increase of $5.7 million is attributable to more stream ounces delivered pursuant to the various stream agreements in
the first six months of 2016 when compared to 2015.  The Company was delivered 156,474 GEOs under its stream
agreements during first six months of 2016 compared to 106,841 GEOs delivered in the first six months of 2015.  Oil &
Gas operating costs were lower due to production and cost efficiencies implemented by the operators.

Depletion and Depreciation
Depletion and depreciation totaled $133.7 million for the six months compared to $100.8 million in 2015. The increase of
$32.9 million is due in part to the Antamina acquisition ($20.2 million), the Antapaccay acquisition ($17.3 million), and
initial depletion for the Karma stream cost due to the initial deliveries received ($3.2 million).  These increases were
partially offset by lower depletion on Candelaria and Bald Mountain due to lower production and on Oil & Gas due to the
impact of a weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.

Corporate Administration
Corporate administration expenses increased to $11.1 million in the first six months of 2016, from $8.2 million in 2015.
The increase is primarily due to higher board of directors’ costs as the deferred share units earned by board members
increased in value during the quarter.

Finance income is earned on our cash equivalents and/or short-term investments. The increase in finance income is due
to finance income earned from the True Gold additional financing option under the Karma stream agreement.  Interest
income in the amount of $1.0 million has been accrued in 2016 from the Noront loan.
Finance expenses increased due to interest expense associated with the $460.0 million draw down of the credit facility in
Q4 2015.  In addition to the $0.8 million interest expensed, $0.7 million was capitalized to the Cobre Panama stream
interest project.  The
26
amortization expense relates to amortization of the initial set-up costs incurred with respect to the credit facility.
Income Taxes
Franco-Nevada had an income tax expense of $19.4 million (2015 – $20.3 million) for the six months ended June 30, 2016
comprised of a current income tax expense of $17.1 million (2015 - $13.4 million) and a deferred income tax expense of
$2.3 million (2015 – $6.9 million) related to our Canadian and Mexican entities.
Net Income
Net income for the first six months was $72.3 million, or $0.41 per share, compared with a net income of $40.8 million, or
$0.26 per share, for the same period in 2015. Adjusted Net Income was $68.0 million, or $0.39 per share, compared with
$45.8 million, or $0.30 per share, for 2015.  The increase in Adjusted Net Income was driven primarily by higher revenue
due to recent asset acquisitions.

and cash equivalents.  This reflects our business strategy of growing a diversified portfolio and ensuring cash is available
for future acquisitions and dividends. Total liabilities at June 30, 2016 were $52.0 million including current and deferred
income tax liabilities.

Cash provided by operating activities after changes in non-cash assets and liabilities, relating to operating activities, was
$82.3 million and $60.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash provided by
operating activities after changes in non-cash assets and liabilities, relating to operating activities, was $181.4 million and
$129.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increases are attributable to higher
revenues generated in the quarter as a result of recent Antamina and Antapaccay mineral stream acquisitions.
28
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was $6.9 million for the quarter compared to $25.8 million in the same period of 2015.
The decrease was due to the funding of the Cobre Panama stream of $37.7 million being more than offset by proceeds
from the disposition of investments and gold bullion.
Cash used in investing activities was $488.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $46.9 million in
the same period of 2015. The increase was due to the acquisitions of interests in mineral properties in 2016 compared to
2015, in particular the Antapaccay acquisition of $500.0 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $23.8 million for the quarter compared to a use of $24.3 million for 2015.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $381.6 million for the first six months of 2016 compared to a use of $47.9
million for 2015. The increase in cash provided is attributable to the funds raised from the equity issuance of 19.2 million
shares resulting in $883.5 million net proceeds to the Company.  This inflow of funds was partially used to repay the
$460.0 million then drawn on the credit facility.
Cash Resources and Liquidity
Our performance is impacted by foreign currency fluctuations of the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar relative to the
U.S. dollar. The largest exposure is with respect to the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate as we hold a significant
amount of our assets in Canada and report our results in U.S. dollars.  The effect of this volatility in these currencies
against the U.S. dollar impacts our corporate administration, business development expenses and depletion on mineral
and oil & gas interests incurred in our Canadian and Australian entities due to their respective functional currencies. The
Canadian dollar traded in a range of $0.7593 to $0.7972, closing the quarter at $0.7687, and the Australian
dollar traded between $0.7176 and $0.7801.
As at June 30, 2016, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $225.8 million (December 31, 2015 -
$168.0 million).  In addition, we held investments at June 30, 2016 with a combined value of $123.4 million (December 31,
2015 - $94.8 million), of which $91.4 million was held in publicly traded equity instruments (December 31, 2015 - $64.6
million).
Management’s objectives when managing capital are to:
(a)         ensure the preservation and availability of capital by investing in low risk investments with
high liquidity; and
(b)         ensure that adequate levels of capital are maintained to meet requirements.
Franco-Nevada invests its excess funds in term deposits, treasury bills of the U.S. government, Canadian federal and
provincial governments and high quality corporate bonds.  As at June 30, 2016, the majority of funds were held in cash
deposits with several financial institutions. As at June 30, 2016, investments had maturities upon
29
acquisition of 92 days. Accordingly, as at June 30, 2016, the investments were classified as short-term investments.
Our near-term cash requirements include funding of the Cobre Panama commitments, corporate administration costs,
certain costs of operations, payment of dividends and income taxes directly related to the recognition of royalty and
stream revenues.  As a royalty/stream company, there are limited requirements for capital expenditures other than for the
acquisition of additional royalties/streams and working interests’ capital commitments.  Such acquisitions are entirely
discretionary and will be consummated through the use of cash, as available, or through the issuance of common shares
or other equity or debt securities or use of our credit facility. We believe that our current cash resources, our available
credit facility and future cash flows will be sufficient to cover the cost of our commitments under the various stream
agreements, administrative expenses, costs of operations and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.

Cobre Panama Stream Agreement

The Company has funding commitments under the Cobre Panama stream agreement as described in the Guidance
section above.
CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of August 8, 2016, an amount of $1.0 billion, or its Canadian dollar equivalent, is available under our unsecured credit
facility.  Advances under the facility bear interest depending upon the currency of the advance and leverage ratio.  In
2015, Franco-Nevada increased its credit facility from $500.0 million to $1.0 billion and extended the maturity to
November 12, 2020. As of August 8, 2016, U.S. and Canadian dollar advances under the facility would bear interest rates
of 3.95% and 2.90%, respectively. We can also draw funds using LIBOR 30-day rates plus 120 basis points under our
credit facility.
Standby fees of $1.0 million (2015 - $0.7 million), interest of $0.8 million (2015 - $Nil) and amortization of issuance costs
of $0.3 million (2015 - $0.2 million) were incurred and paid for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Company to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s best
knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to previous experience. However, actual outcomes may
differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements.
Our significant accounting policies and estimates are disclosed in notes 2 and 3 of our most recent annual consolidated
financial statements.
32
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE
IAS 12 Income Taxes
IAS 12, “Income taxes” (“IAS 12”) provides guidance on the recognition of deferred tax assets. In January 2016, the
International Accounting Standards board issued amendments to clarify the requirements for recognizing deferred tax
assets on unrealized losses. The amendments clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair
value and that fair value is below the asset’s tax base. They also clarify certain other aspects of accounting for deferred
tax assets. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of IAS 12 on the consolidated financial statements.

3                   In connection with the transaction with Taseko Mines Limited, one special warrant was
granted to Taseko which will be exchangeable into 2,000,000 purchase share warrants once
Taseko’s New Prosperity project gets fully permitted and financed. Each purchase share warrant will
entitle Taseko to purchase one Franco-Nevada common share at a price of C$75.00 per share
before June 16, 2017. New Prosperity’s most recent permit application was denied in 2014.
Franco-Nevada has not issued any preferred shares.
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining Franco-Nevada’s
internal control over financial reporting and other financial disclosure and our disclosure controls and procedures.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS.  Franco-
Nevada’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Franco-
Nevada; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with IFRS, and that receipts and expenditures of Franco-Nevada are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Franco-Nevada; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Franco-Nevada’s assets that
could have a material effect on Franco-Nevada’s financial statements. Internal control over other financial disclosure is a
process designed to ensure that other financial information included in this MD&A, fairly represents in all material respects
the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Franco-Nevada for the periods presented in this MD&A.
Franco-Nevada’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that material
information relating to Franco-Nevada, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to management by others
within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is prepared and that information required to be
disclosed by Franco-Nevada in its annual filings, interim filings or other reports filed or
34
submitted by it under securities legislation is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in securities legislation.
Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may change.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, there has been no change in Franco-Nevada’s internal control over financial
reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Franco-Nevada’s internal control over
financial reporting.
NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per share
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per share are non-IFRS financial measures, which exclude the following from net
income and earnings per share (“EPS”):
·                  Income tax expense/recovery;
·                  Finance expenses;
·                  Finance income;
·                  Depletion and depreciation;
·                  Non-cash costs of sales;
·                  Impairment charges related to royalty, stream and working interests and investments;
·                  Gains/losses on the sale of investments; and
·                  Foreign exchange gains/losses and other income/expenses.
Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per share to evaluate the underlying operating performance of
the Company as a whole for the reporting periods presented, and to assist with the planning and forecasting of future
operating results. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per share allow investors and
analysts to better evaluate the results of the underlying business of the Company. While the adjustments to net income
and EPS in these measures include items that are both recurring and non-recurring, management believes that Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per share are useful measures of the Company’s performance because foreign exchange,
gains/losses on sale of investments and impairment charges do not reflect the underlying operating performance of our
business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per share
are intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts, do not have any standardized meaning under
IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance
with IFRS.

Margin
Margin is a non-IFRS financial measure which is defined by the Company as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.
Management uses Margin to evaluate the performance of the Company’s portfolio and we believe Margin provides a
meaningful measure for investors and analysts to evaluate our overall ability to generate cash flow from our royalty,
stream and working interests. Margin is intended to provide additional information, does not have any standardized
definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance in
accordance with IFRS.

·                  Gains/losses on the sale of investments;

·                  Unusual non-recurring items;
·                  Impact of income taxes on these items.
Management uses Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share to evaluate the underlying operating
performance of the Company as a whole for the reporting periods presented, and to assist with the planning and
forecasting of future operating results. Management believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per
share allow investors and analysts to better evaluate the results of the underlying business of the Company. While the

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This MD&A contains “forward-looking information” and “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of applicable
Canadian securities laws and the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, respectively, which may
include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to future events or future performance, management’s
expectations regarding Franco-Nevada’s growth, results of operations, estimated future revenues, carrying value of
assets, future dividends and requirements for additional capital, mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates,
production estimates, production costs and revenue, future demand for and prices of commodities, expected mining
sequences, business prospects and opportunities. In addition, statements (including data in tables) relating to reserves
and resources and gold equivalent ounces are forward-looking statements, as they involve implied assessment, based on
certain estimates and assumptions, and no assurance can be given that the estimates and assumptions are accurate and
that such reserves and resources and gold equivalent ounces (“GEOs”) will be realized. Such forward-looking statements
reflect management’s current beliefs and are based on information currently available to management. Often, but not
always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”,
“budgets”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “predicts”, “projects”, “intends”, “targets”, “aims”, “anticipates” or “believes”
or variations (including negative variations) of such words and phrases or may be identified by statements to the effect
that certain actions “may”, “could”, “should”, “would”, “might” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward-looking
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results,
performance or achievements of Franco-Nevada to be materially different from any future results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual events or
results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, including, without limitation: fluctuations in the prices of
the primary commodities that drive royalty and stream revenue (gold, platinum group metals, copper, nickel, uranium,
silver, iron-ore and oil & gas); fluctuations in the value of the Canadian and Australian dollar and any other currency in
which revenue is generated, relative to the U.S. dollar; changes in national and local government legislation, including
permitting and licensing regimes and taxation policies and the enforcement thereof; regulatory, political or economic
developments in any of the countries where properties in which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest
are located or through which they are held; risks related to the operators of the properties in which Franco-Nevada holds a
royalty, stream or other interest, including changes in the ownership and control of such operators; influence of
macroeconomic developments; business opportunities that become available to, or are pursued by Franco-Nevada;
reduced access to debt and equity capital; litigation; title, permit or license disputes related to interests on any of the
properties in which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest; whether or not the Company is determined to
have “passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC”) status as defined in Section 1297 of the United States Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; potential changes in Canadian tax treatment of offshore streams; excessive cost
escalation as well as development, permitting, infrastructure, operating or technical difficulties on any of the properties in
which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest; actual mineral content may differ from the reserves and
resources contained in technical reports; rate and timing of production differences from resource estimates, other
technical reports and mine plans; risks and hazards associated with the business of development and mining on any of
the properties in
39
which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest, including, but not limited to unusual or unexpected
geological and metallurgical conditions, slope failures or cave-ins, flooding and other natural disasters, terrorism, civil
unrest or an outbreak of contagious diseases; and the integration of acquired assets. The forward-looking statements
contained in this MD&A are based upon assumptions management believes to be reasonable, including, without limitation:
the ongoing operation of the properties in which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest by the owners or
operators of such properties in a manner consistent with past practice; the accuracy of public statements and disclosures
made by the owners or operators of such underlying properties; no material adverse change in the market price of the
commodities that underlie the asset portfolio; the Company’s ongoing income and assets relating to determination of its
PFIC status; no material changes to existing tax treatment; no adverse development in respect of any significant property
in which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest; the accuracy of publicly disclosed expectations for the
development of underlying properties that are not yet in production; integration of acquired assets; and the absence of any
other factors that could cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended. However,
there can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events
could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements
are not guarantees of future performance. Franco-Nevada cannot assure investors that actual results will be consistent
with these forward-looking statements. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein. For additional information with respect to risks, uncertainties and
assumptions, please refer to Franco-Nevada’s most recent Annual Information Form filed with the Canadian securities
regulatory authorities on www.sedar.com and Franco-Nevada’s most recent Annual Report filed on Form 40-F filed with the
SEC on www.sec.gov. The forward-looking statements herein are made as of the date of this MD&A only and Franco-
Nevada does not assume any obligation to update or revise them to reflect new information, estimates or opinions, future
events or results or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.
