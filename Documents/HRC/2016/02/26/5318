<p><b>Egypt (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement), Uruguay:  draft resolution 
12/&#8230;  Human rights and unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the Purposes and Principles of the Charter of the United Nations,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> all previous resolutions on human rights and unilateral coercive measures 
adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, the Council and the General Assembly,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> its resolution 9/4 of 17 September 2008 and General Assembly 
resolution 63/179 of 18 December 2008,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of the report of the Secretary-General on this issue (A/HRC/12/30),  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>that unilateral coercive measures and legislation are contrary to international law, 
international humanitarian law, the Charter and the norms and principles governing peaceful 
relations among States,  </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated character of all 
human rights and, in this regard, reaffirming the right to development as a universal and 
inalienable right and an integral part of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern </i>at the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on human 
</p>
<p>rights, development, international relations, trade, investment and cooperation,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the final document of the fifteenth summit of the Heads of State and Government 
of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, in July 2009, in which the 
States Members of the Movement decided to oppose unilateralism and unilaterally-imposed 
measures by certain States, which can lead to the erosion and violation of the Charter and 
international law, the use and threat of use of force, and pressure and coercive measures, as a 
means to achieving their national policy objectives, and to support, in accordance with 
international law, the claim of affected States, including targeted States, to compensation for 
damage incurred as a consequence of the implementation of extraterritorial or unilateral coercive 
measures or laws,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>that the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna from 14 to 
25 June 1993, called upon States to refrain from any unilateral measure not in accordance with 
international law and the Charter and that created obstacles to trade relations among States and 
impeded the full realization of all human rights, and also severely threatened the freedom of 
trade, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>that, despite the resolutions adopted on this issue by the 
General Assembly, the Council, the Commission on Human Rights and at United Nations 
conferences held in the 1990s and at their five-year reviews, and contrary to norms of 
international law and the Charter, unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated, 
implemented and enforced by, inter alia, resorting to war and militarism, with all their negative 
implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social development of 
developing countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby creating additional obstacles 
to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of 
other States, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that unilateral coercive measures are a major obstacle to the implementation of 
the Declaration on the Right to Development, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>article 1, paragraph 2, common to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which 
provides that, inter alia, in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon </i>all States to stop adopting or implementing unilateral coercive measures 
not in accordance with international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter of the 
United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations among States, in 
particular those of a coercive nature with extraterritorial effects, which create obstacles to trade 
relations among States, thus impeding the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments, in particular the 
right of individuals and peoples to development; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Strongly objects</i> to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in addition, 
threaten the sovereignty of States and, in this context, calls upon all Member States neither to 
recognize these measures nor apply them, and to take effective administrative or legislative 
measures, as appropriate, to counteract the extraterritorial application or effects of unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Condemns </i>the continued unilateral application and enforcement by certain powers of 
such measures as tools of political or economic pressure against any country, particularly against 
</p>
<p>developing countries, with a view to preventing these countries from exercising their right to 
decide, of their own free will, their own political, economic and social systems;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reiterates</i> its call upon Member States that have initiated such measures to abide by 
the principles of international law, the Charter, the declarations of the United Nations and world 
conferences and relevant resolutions, and to commit themselves to their obligations and 
responsibilities arising from the international human rights instruments to which they are parties 
by putting an immediate end to such measures; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i>, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination, by virtue of 
which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their own economic, social 
and cultural development;  
</p>
<p> 6.<i> Also reaffirms </i>its opposition to any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of 
the national unity and the territorial integrity of a State, which is incompatible with the Charter;  </p>
<p> 7. <i>Recalls </i>that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International Law 
concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of 
the United Nations, and to the relevant principles and provisions contained in the Charter of 
Economic Rights and Duties of States, proclaimed by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in particular article 32 thereof, no State may use 
or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measure to coerce another State 
in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure 
from it advantages of any kind;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Reaffirms </i>that essential goods, such as food and medicines, should not be used as 
tools for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people be deprived of their 
own means of subsistence and development;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Underlines </i>the fact that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major obstacles 
to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and, in this regard, calls 
upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the 
extraterritorial application of domestic laws that run counter to the principles of free trade and 
hamper the development of developing countries;  
</p>
<p> 10 <i>Rejects </i>all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, as well as the 
increasing trend in this direction, including through the enactment of laws with extraterritorial 
application, which are not in conformity with international law;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recognizes </i>that the Declaration of Principles adopted at the first phase of the World 
Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva in December 2003, strongly urges States to 
avoid and refrain from any unilateral measure in building the information society;  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 12. <i>Invites </i>all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Council in the 
field of economic, social and cultural rights to pay due attention, within the scope of their 
respective mandates, to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures;  
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Decides </i>to give due consideration to the negative impact of unilateral coercive 
measures in its task concerning the implementation of the right to development;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Requests </i>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in discharging 
her functions in relation to the promotion and protection of human rights, to pay due attention 
and give urgent consideration to the present resolution;  
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to submit to the Council, at its fifteenth session, an 
analytical report on the impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human 
rights;  
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Decides </i>to examine this question in accordance with its annual programme of work 
under the same agenda item.
