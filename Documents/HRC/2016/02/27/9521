<p><b>IMPLEMENTATION OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 60/251 
OF 15 MARCH 2006 ENTITLED &#8220;HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>Process currently utilized by the International Coordinating Committee 
to accredit national human rights institutions in compliance with the 
Paris Principles and ensure that the process is strengthened with  
appropriate periodic review and on ways and means of enhancing  
participation of national human rights institutions in the work of  
                                             the Commission 
</b></p>
<p><b>Report of the Secretary-General 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102, in 
which the Council decided to request the High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;continue 
with the fulfilment of her activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the 
Commission on Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2 The present report outlines the progress achieved since the last report to the 
sixty-second session of the Commission on Human Rights entitled &#8220;Effective functioning 
of Human Rights Mechanisms: National Institutions and Regional Arrangements&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2006/102).  This report detailed the process currently utilized by the International 
Coordinating Committee of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human 
rights (ICC) to accredit national human rights institutions (NHRIs) as being in compliance with 
the Principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
human rights (the Paris Principles) (General Assembly resolution 48/134, annex). 
</p>
<p>GE.07-10432  (E)    300107 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>3. The last report detailed steps taken toward a more active participation of NHRIs in the 
sessions of the Human Rights Council,<b>1</b> provided an overview of the ICC accreditation process, 
described the composition and work of the ICC Sub-Committee on Accreditation, and discussed 
the proposal for a regular reassessment of NHRIs accredited as Paris Principles compliant to be 
considered at the next session of ICC. 
</p>
<p>4. In accordance with the recommendations of the seventeenth session of ICC in 
April 2006, it was agreed to commence a process of review of NHRIs accredited as being 
compliant with the Paris Principles.  NHRIs accredited with A status, being those found by 
ICC to be compliant with the Paris Principles, are to have their accreditation status reviewed 
every five years.  The process commenced in October 2006.  The proposed schedule for 
re-accreditation adopted at the seventeenth session is attached as an annex to the present report.  
It was also agreed that there would be a continuous review of accreditation of NHRIs every 
five years from the time of that NHRI&#8217;s initial accreditation. 
</p>
<p>5. The first round of re-accreditation reviews were undertaken at the eighteenth session of 
ICC, held in Bolivia on 27 October 2006.  NHRIs in the following countries were reaccredited 
as status A members of ICC:  Argentina, Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, India, Mexico, 
New Zealand and Panama.  Cameroon NHRI was granted accreditation status B.  At the request 
of the French National Commission on Human Rights, the Sub-Committee agreed to defer 
consideration of this re-accreditation application to the next session, due to the fact that a bill to 
amend the enabling legislation of the Commission was being negotiated. 
</p>
<p>6. Also at the seventeenth session of ICC, ICC Sub-Committee on Accreditation was 
requested to prepare a paper to enhance the working methods and accreditation procedures of 
ICC.  A paper was presented to the members of ICC at the eighteenth session for further 
consideration.  Proposals for amendment will be considered at the next session of ICC in 
March 2007. 
</p>
<p>7. Only NHRIs accredited to ICC as being Paris Principle compliant, and ICC, have 
speaking rights before the Human Rights Council. A rigorous system of accreditation and a 
regular process of review therefore help to ensure the credibility of NHRIs speaking before the 
Council.
