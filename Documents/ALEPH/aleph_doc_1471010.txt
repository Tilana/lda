FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This  Quarterly  Report  on  Form 10-Q  contains  forward-looking 
information.  Forward-looking 
information includes statements relating to future actions, prospective products, future performance or 
results of current or anticipated products, sales and marketing efforts, costs and expenses, interest rates, 
outcome of contingencies, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, business strategies, cost 
savings, objectives of management of the Company and other matters.  The Private Securities Litigation 
Reform  Act  of  1995  provides  a  “safe  harbor”  for  forward-looking  information  in  order  to  encourage 
companies to provide prospective information about themselves without fear of litigation, so long as that 
information is identified as forward-looking and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements 
identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in 
the information. Forward-looking information may be included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q 
or  may  be  incorporated  by  reference  from  other  documents  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange 
Commission by the Company. You can find many of these statements by looking for words including, 
for  example,  “believes,”  “expects,”  “anticipates,”  “estimates”  or  similar  expressions  in  this  Quarterly 
Report on Form 10-Q or in documents incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
Except  as  otherwise  required  by  applicable  law,  the  Company  undertakes  no  obligation  to  publicly 
update  or  revise  any  forward-looking  statements,  whether  as  a  result  of  new  information  or  future 
events. 
 
 
The Company has based the forward-looking statements relating to the Company’s operations on 
management’s current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company and the industry in 
which  it  operates.  These  statements  are  not  guarantees  of  future  performance  and  involve  risks, 
uncertainties  and  assumptions  that  we  cannot  predict.  In  particular,  we  have  based  many  of  these 
forward-looking  statements  on  assumptions  about  future  events  that  may  prove  to  be  inaccurate. 
Accordingly,  the  Company’s  actual  results  may  differ  materially  from  those  contemplated  by  these 
forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including, but not 
limited to the following:
future plans and potential for future growth;  
  liquidity, capital resources and capital expenditures;  
  growth in demand for our products;  
  economic outlook and industry trends;  
  developments of our markets;  
  the impact of regulatory initiatives; and  
  the strength of our competitors

NAVA RESOURCES, INC. 
(An Exploration Stage Company) 
NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
December 31, 2009 
 
 
1.   NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS
Nava Resources Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on July 21, 2005 under the laws of the state of Nevada. The 
Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Nava Resources, Canada Inc. (“Nava Resources, Canada”), was incorporated 
in Canada on August 9, 2005. The Company is an Exploration Stage Company. The Company’s principal business 
is the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. The Company has not yet determined whether its properties 
contain mineral reserves that are economically recoverable. 
 
Going Concern 
 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company 
will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not 
generated  revenues  since  inception  and  has  not  paid  any  dividends  and  is  unlikely  to  pay  dividends  or  generate 
earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent 
upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity 
financing  to  continue  operations  and  to  determine  the  existence,  discovery  and  successful  exploitation  of 
economically recoverable reserves in its resource properties, confirmation of the Company interest in the underlying 
properties, and the attainment of profitable operations. As at December 31, 2009, the Company has accumulated 
losses of $100,457 since inception. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the 
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary 
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  
 
Management of the Company has undertaken steps as part of a plan with the goal of sustaining Company operations 
for the next twelve months and beyond. These steps include: (a) continuing efforts to raise additional capital and/or 
other forms of financing; and (b) controlling overhead and expenses. There can be no assurance that any of these 
efforts will be successful.
2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION
3.    CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
These  interim  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting 
principles for financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Item 310(b) of Regulation S. In the 
opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair 
presentation have been included.  Operating results for the six months ended December 31, 2009 are not necessarily 
indicative of the results that may be expected for any interim period or an entire year. The Company applies the 
same accounting policies and methods in its interim financial statements as those in the most recent audited annual 
financial statements, except as discussed in Note 3 below.
In  September  2006,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  SFAS  No.  157,  “Fair  Value 
Measurements”  (“SFAS  157”).  SFAS  157  establishes  a  framework  for  measuring  the  fair  value  of  assets  and 
liabilities. This framework is intended to provide increased consistency in how fair value determinations are made 
under various existing accounting standards that permit, or in some cases require, estimates of fair market value. 
SFAS  157  also  expands  financial  statement  disclosure  requirements  about  a  company’s  use  of  fair  value 
measurements,  including  the  effect  of  such  measures  on  earnings.  This  standard  is  effective  for  fiscal  years 
beginning after November 15, 2007. For nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, the standard is effective for 
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. We have adopted this new guidance 
effective  July  1,  2009.  Adoption  of  this  standard  did  not  impact  our  consolidated  financial  position,  results  of 
operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements 
Liabilities –an Amendment of ARB No. 51”.  This statement amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting 
standards for the Noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This statement 
is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 
and earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company adopted this new guidance effective July 1, 2009. The adoption of 
this statement did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 
In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
–  an  amendment  to  FASB  Statement  No.  133”.   SFAS  No.  161  is  intended  to  improve  financial  standards  for 
derivative  instruments  and  hedging  activities  by  requiring  enhanced  disclosures  to  enable  investors  to  better 
understand their effects on an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Entities are required 
to provide enhanced disclosures about: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; (b) how derivative 
instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations; and (c) 
how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and 
cash flows.  It is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, with 
early adoption encouraged. The Company adopted this new guidance effective July 1, 2009. The adoption of this 
statement did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, “Business Combinations”.  This statement replaces SFAS 141 
and defines the acquirer in a business combination as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in a 
business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control. SFAS 141R 
requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the 
acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. SFAS 141R also requires the acquirer to 
recognize contingent consideration at the acquisition date, measured at its fair value at that date. This statement is 
effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and 
earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company adopted this new guidance effective July 1, 2009. The adoption of this 
statement did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
 
Effective July 1, 2009, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 165, “Subsequent 
Events”  (“SFAS  165”).  SFAS  165  establishes  general  standards  of  accounting  for  and  disclosure  of  subsequent 
events.  The  adoption  of  SFAS  165  has  not  had  any  impact  on  the  Company’s  financial  position,  results  of 
operations, or cash flows.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations
The following discussion of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of 
operations for the six months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 should be read in conjunction with 
our unaudited interim financial statements and related notes for the six months ended December 31, 
2009 and 2008.The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, 
uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in 
these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to, those set 
forth below under the heading "Risk Factors".
Overview of our Business
We  are  an  exploration  stage  company  formed  for  the  purposes  of  acquiring,  exploring  and,  if 
warranted and feasible, developing natural resource properties.  
 
Organization  
 
On  July  21,  2005,  the  Company  was  incorporated  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of  Nevada  for  the 
purpose  of  conducting  mineral  exploration  activities.  We  were  authorized  to  issue  400,000,000 
shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, and initially issued 100,000 shares of common 
stock  to  each  of  Jag  Sandhu,  our  President,  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  a  director,  and  Johnny 
Astorino, our Chief Financial Officer. Said issuances were paid at a purchase price of the par value 
per  share.  Our  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Nava  Resources  Canada  Inc.  (“Nava  Canada”),  was 
organized under the Federal laws of Canada on August 9, 2005. 
 
On  January  4,  2007,  the  Company  obtained  written  consent  from  the  shareholders  to  amend  our 
Articles of Incorporation to change the par value of our common stock from $0.001 to $0.00001 per 
share.  On  February  28,  2007,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  amended  the  Articles  of 
Incorporation changing the par value of the Company’s common stock.  
 
In March 2007 we issued 19,900,000 shares to each of Messrs. Sandhu and Astorino in consideration 
for the payment of par value per share. Mr. Astorino subsequently returned 18,000,000 shares to the 
Company’s treasury for cancellation. 
 
On March 20, 2007, we accepted subscriptions for 874,104 shares of our common stock from 37 
investors. The shares of common stock were sold at a purchase price of $0.15 per share, amounting 
in the aggregate to $131,116. The offering was made to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions 
pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, 
as amended (the “Securities Act”). 
 
On  April  18,  2007,  Mr.  Sandhu  returned  an  aggregate  of  10,000,000  shares  and  Mr.  Astorino 
returned  an  aggregate  of  1,000,000  shares  of  common  stock  to  the  Company’s  treasury  for 
cancellation.
F-12
On June 1, 2007, we accepted subscriptions for 352,000 units from 10 investors. The units were sold 
at  a  purchase  price  of  $0.16  per  unit,  amounting  in  the  aggregate  to  $56,320.  Each  unit  was 
comprised  of  one  share  of  our  common  stock  and  one  warrant.  Each  warrant  entitles  the  warrant 
holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.20 per share. Each warrant 
expired  unexercised  on  June  1,  2009.  The  offering  was  made  to  non-U.S.  persons  in  offshore 
transactions pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Regulation S of the Securities 
Act. 
 
On November 29, 2009 we issued 37,500 shares at $0.01 for exercise of stock options. 
 
Exploratory Activities 
 
In July 2005 we commenced our mineral exploration activities. On October 10, 2006, the Company 
entered  into  an  agreement  with  Jag  Sandhu,  our  President,  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Director, 
pursuant to which the Company obtained an option to acquire a 100% interest in and to the mineral 
claim located in Lillooett Mining Division called the Noel Creek Claim.   On October 2, 2007, the 
option expired due to the Company not making the required payments as per the option agreement.  
 
On  August  28,  2007,  Mr.  Jag  Sandhu,  our  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  a  director, 
acquired  two  claims  for  a  637.39  hectare  (approximately  1575.03  acres)  mineral  concession  on 
Vancouver Island, in the Province of British Columbia, Canada through British Columbia’s online 
staking service. These mineral claims are known as the North 1 and North 2 Claims. On November 
22, 2007, Mr. Sandhu transferred the claims to Nava Canada using British Columbia’s Mineral Title 
Online web site. We intend to conduct exploratory activities with respect to the claims, and if viable 
mineral deposits are discovered, develop and extract such minerals. In addition, as funding permits, 
we may acquire additional properties of interest and either abandon our existing properties or enter 
into agreements to sell all or a portion of those properties.   
 
In  October  2007,  we  engaged  a  professional  mining  engineering  service  and  consulting  firm, 
MineStart  Management  Inc.  (“MineStart”),  to  review  the  geologic  premise  and  information  upon 
which  the  claim  was  staked,  and  to  provide  a  technical  report  as  to  its  merit  as  an  exploration 
prospect, including recommendations on appropriate next steps.  The report on the claims, entitled 
“North 1 and 2 Project – A VMS Investigation” and dated December 7, 2007, describes the mineral 
claim (tenures, location and access) and the regional, local and property geology. It also includes 
relevant  information  on  targeted  deposit  types  and  mineralization,  and  recommendations  with 
associated budgets, regarding the initial strategy that should be followed in exploring the claim.  
 
We performed an exploration program on the North 1 and North 2 Claims in August 2008.   This 
program involved a review of property geology based on government compilations, acquisition of 
relevant  air  photo  coverage  and  a  visit  to  the  property  by  Jag  Sandhu  and  Don  Blackadar.    The 
purpose of this visit was to become familiar with the general layout of the property and related road 
access, and to prospect and collect rock samples in readily accessible areas. Work was concentrated 
in the South West corner of the North 2 claim which was accessible just off of the highway, with 
foot access via an overgrown secondary road leading into the claim.
F-13
The North Claim is primarily underlain by felsic to intermediate volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of 
the middle to upper Devonian Sicker Group (McLaughlin Ridge Formation), which is prospective 
for  Kuroko-type  massive  sulphide  deposits  rich  in  copper,  lead,  zinc,  gold  and  silver.    Outcrop 
exposure in the area prospected was minimal due to overburden cover of bolder till with hardpan 
noted  in  some  rock  cuts.  A  total  of  30  rock  samples  were  taken  for  multi-element  geochemical 
analysis.    These  samples  were  primarily  float  but  several  samples  may  have  been  from  small 
outcrops visible in the road cut.  All samples were of intermediate composition (andesite), ranging 
from  fine  to  medium  grained,  and  relatively  massive  in  texture  (weekly  foliated  in  some  cases), 
possibly representing intermediate tuffs with some intrusive equivalents. Samples were sent to Acme 
Labs  in  Vancouver,  crushed  to  200    mesh,  and  processed  by  Aqua  Regia  digestion  CCP-MS 
analysis.  Gold was also determined by fire assay fusion by ICP-ES. No significant anomalies were 
identified in the pathfinder suite.  However, the first three samples demonstrate a weakly anomalous 
Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag-As-Ba signature, which may be of interest. 
 
History and Geological Setting 
 
Vancouver Island is dominated by rocks of the Wrangellia Terrane, which is interpreted to represent 
a Paleozoic Island Arc assemblage, accreted to the North American content about 100 million years 
ago.  Mid-Devonian volcanic rocks of the Sicker Group, representing the basement of this complex, 
are the oldest rocks on Vancouver Island and are exposed in four major structural uplifts – Buttle 
Lake, Beddington, Nanoose, and Cowichan Lake.  The North Claims lie toward the southeast end of 
the Cowichan Lake Uplift, along the north shore of the east end of Cowichan Lake.  In the Cowichan 
Lake  Uplift,  the  Sicker  comprises  three  distinct  volcanic  /  volcaniclastic  assemblages  –  the  Duck 
Lake  Formation  as  the  oldest  member  and  overlain  by  the  Nitnat  Formation,  which  in  turn  is 
overlain, possibly unconformably, by the McLaughlin Ridge Formation.  
 
Volcanic  rocks  of  the  Sicker  Group  are  highly  prospective  for  economically  viable  volcanogenic 
massive  sulphide  (VMS)  deposits,  which  are  the  primary  exploration  target  on  the  North  Claims. 
  As a group, these deposits are rich in copper and zinc and also carry significant gold and silver 
values.  
 
The  most  significant  mineral  deposit  in  the  Sicker  Group  is  the  Myra  Falls  mine,  a  world  class 
deposit  located  in  the  Buttle  Lake  Uplift.  Other  significant  deposits,  notably  the  Lara  and  Mount 
Sicker  deposits,  are  located  in  the  southeast  part  of  the  Cowichan  Lake  uplift,  several  kilometers 
northeast of the North Claims and separated from the property by a major geologic fault. 
 
Massive  sulphide  mineralization  was  first  discovered  in  the  Sicker  Group  with  the  Mount  Sicker 
discoveries  in  the  late  1800s.   Production  was  from  one  main  ore  body  via  three  separate 
underground mines (Tyee, Lenora and Richard III), which operated for several years. These mines 
were subsequently amalgamated and re-operated as the Twin J mine from 1942 to 1952.  Production 
from the Tyee mine (1901 – 09) totaled 5,840,593 kilograms copper and 13,725,069 grams silver, 
and  762,553  grams  gold  from  152,668  tonnes  mined.   The  Buttle  Lake  mine,  which  has  been  in 
operation since 1966, currently produces approximately 1 million(cid:31)cqui of ore per year.  Over the 39 
years to 2005, the mine yielded 24 million cqui with an average grade of 1.8% copper, 5.0% zinc, 
2g/T gold and 52g/T silver. The Lara deposit, discovered in the mid-1980s, contains a drill indicated
F-14
resource of 528,839 tonnes grading 1.01% copper, 1.22% lead, 5.87% zinc, 100.09 g/T sliver and 
4.73 g/T gold.  
 
Discovery of the Lara deposit and ongoing interest in the nearby Mount Sicker deposits, all of which 
are hosted in felsic volcanic rocks of the McLaughlin Ridge formation, stimulated significant interest 
and exploration activity in the Cowichan uplift during the mid-to late 1980s.  During this period the 
Striker Property, comprising 31 contiguous mineral claims (528 units) and extending along virtually 
the entire north shore of Cowichan Lake, was explored by Utah Mines.  This property is underlain 
predominantly by the Sicker Group, with Nitnat rocks dominant in the western part of the property 
and  McLaughlin  Ridge  sediments  and  volcanics  dominant  in  the  east.   Work  on  this  property  is 
documented  in  a  number  of  BC  government  assessment  reports,  from  which  the  following 
descriptions  are  derived.   McLaughlin  Ridge  rocks,  as  mapped,  divide  grossly  into  3  units, 
dominated  by  diverse  sedimentary  lithologies  with  volcanic  members,  particularly  lower  in  the 
sequence.  Volcanic rocks are described as interbedded lithic and crystal tuff, cherty dust tuff, chert 
and minor lapilli tuff.  The lower unit consists of fine-grained andesitic lithic crystal tuffs and cherty 
tuffs with local coarse lapilli beds and dacitic tuff units.   
 
Exploration on the Striker property included airborne geophysics, with ground follow-ups and grid 
work in selected areas in the eastern part of the property because of the distribution of geophysical 
and geochemical targets. While massive sulphides were not encountered, encouraging mineralization 
of  various  types  was  noted,  including  exhalative  horizons,  which  occasionally  contain  anomalous 
molybdenum, copper and silver.  Significant barium, silver, molybdenum and zinc values are also 
associated with syndepositional pyrite in argillite units and significant gold-silver-copper-zinc values 
are  associated  with  several  structures.   Anomalous  silt  and  heavy  metal  values  (copper-lead-zinc-
silver-gold) were also identified.  The latest assessment report on the Striker property recommended 
further, more detailed work in the eastern part of the property including detailed mapping, sampling, 
trenching and limited drilling.  The North Property occupies a portion of the eastern half of the old 
Striker property. 
 
The Cowichan Lake area generally, has been the subject of mineral exploration since the late 1800s 
and a large number and variety of mineral showings in the area are documented in B.C. government 
Minfile  records.   Massey  and  Friday  (1986)  grouped  Cowichan  area  mineral  showings  into  five 
categories:
1.  Volcanogenic gold-bearing massive sulphides (Sicker Group Kuroko deposits). 
 
       2.  Gold-bearing, pyrite-chalcopyrite-quart-carbonate veins along shears, which are quite common
cutting Sicker Group and Karmutsen Formation sills north of Cowichan Lake.
3.  Epithermal gold-silver deposits within Bonanza Group volcanics. 
 
       4.    Copper  skarns  developed  in  limy  sediments  apparently  interbedded  with  basalts  of  the
Karmutsen formation.
F-15
5.    Copper-molybdenum  quarts  veins  in  granodiorite  and  adjacent  country  rock  on  several 
properties.   Chalcopyrite  and  pyrite,  with  or  without  molybdenite  are  the  principle  sulphides  and 
minor sphalerite, galena and arsenopyrite are also reported. 
 
Property and Claim Position 
 
The North Claim site encompasses two adjoining mineral tenures which form one parcel. The North 
property  is  in  the  Victoria  mining  division  of  British  Columbia  and  lies  on  the  north  shore  of 
Cowhichan lake in southern Vancouver Island about 30km west of the town of Duncan and 10km 
west of the town of Lake cowichan.

Conditions to Retain Title to the Claims 
 
The mineral titles are subject to annual renewal and government permits for specific field work.  The 
claims  are  valid  until  their  next  anniversary  date  of  August  28,  2010.   They  can  be  renewed
F-18
indefinitely by performance and recording of assessment work as defined in the Mineral Act (B.C.) 
or by payment of cash in lieu of work.  Work or cash payment of the equivalent of CAN$4.00 per 
hectare or approximately $2,500 for each of the first, second and third anniversary years, and the 
equivalent of CAN$8.00 per hectare for each subsequent anniversary year is required. Contiguous 
claims may be grouped for purposes of applying the value of work from the site of work to other 
claims.  Failure  to  perform  and  record  valid  exploration  work  or  pay  the  equivalent  sum  to  the 
Province of British Columbia on the anniversary dates will result in forfeiture of title to the claim. 
 
Present Condition of the Claims 
 
The  Claims  were  staked  on  August  28,  2007  by  Mr.  Jag  Sandhu,  our  President,  Chief  Executive 
Officer and a director, on behalf of the Company. Mr. Sandhu subsequently transferred the claims to 
Nava Canada, the current claim holder.  The Claims were staked to acquire a position in the Sicker 
Group, a sequence of volcanic rocks known to be very prospective for the occurrence of polymetallic 
volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits (VMS), commonly referred to as Kuroko type deposits. 
 
Our objective is to conduct exploration activities on the North Claims to assess whether they possess 
evidence of mineralization sufficient to merit further exploration activities.  The North Claims are 
without known reserves.   
 
Competitive Conditions 
 
The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. We are competing with many 
other exploration companies looking for minerals.  We are a very early stage mineral exploration 
company and a very small participant in the mineral exploration business. Being a junior mineral 
exploration company, we compete with other companies like ours for financing and joint venture 
partners.  Additionally,  we  compete  for  resources  such  as  professional  geologists,  camp  staff, 
helicopters and mineral exploration supplies.  
 
Government Approvals and Recommendations 
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations defined in the British Columbia Mineral Tenure 
Act for the Province of British Columbia (the “Act”). The Act sets forth rules for:
(cid:31)
locating claims
posting claims
working claims
(cid:31)
 
  (cid:31)
 
  (cid:31)
 
We also have to comply with the British Columbia Mineral Exploration Code which dictates how 
and where we can explore for minerals.  We must comply with these laws to operate our business.  
Compliance with these rules and regulations will not adversely affect our operations.  In order to 
explore  for  minerals  on  our  mineral  claim  we  must  submit  our  exploration  plan  for  review.   We
reporting work performed
F-19
believe that our exploration plan as described below will be accepted and an exploration permit will 
be issued to our agent or us. The exploration permit is the only permit or license we will need to 
explore for precious and base minerals on the mineral claim.  
 
We will be required to obtain additional work permits from the British Columbia Ministry of Energy 
and Mines for any exploration work that results in a physical disturbance to the land.  Accordingly, 
we  may  be  required  to  obtain  a  work  permit  depending  on  the  complexity  and  affect  on  the 
environment if we proceed beyond the exploration work contemplated by our proposed exploration 
programs.  The time required to obtain a work permit is approximately four weeks.  We will incur 
the expense of our consultants to prepare the required submissions to the Ministry of Energy and 
Mines.   We  will  be  required  by  the  Mining  Act  to  undertake  remediation  work  on  any  work  that 
results in physical disturbance to the land.  The cost of remediation work will vary according to the 
degree  of  physical  disturbance.   No  remediation  work  is  anticipated  as  a  result  of  completion  of 
Stage One and Stage Two of our exploration program. 
 
We  have  budgeted  for  regulatory  compliance  costs  in  the  proposed  exploration  program 
recommended  by  the  MineStart  report.   As  mentioned  above,  we  will  have  to  sustain  the  cost  of 
reclamation  and  environmental  remediation  for  all  exploration  and  other  work  undertaken.   The 
amount of reclamation and environmental remediation costs are not known at this time as we do not 
know  the  extent  of  the  exploration  program  that  will  be  undertaken  beyond  completion  of  the 
recommended exploration program.  Because there is no information on the size, tenor, or quality of 
any mineral resource at this time, it is impossible to assess the impact of any capital expenditures on 
earnings or our competitive position in the event a potential mineral deposit is discovered. 
 
If  we  enter  into  substantial  exploration,  the  cost  of  complying  with  permit  and  regulatory 
environment laws will be greater than in Stages One and Two because the impact on the project area 
is greater.  Permits and regulations will control all aspects of any program if the project continues to 
that stage because of the potential impact on the environment.  We may be required to conduct an 
environmental  review  process  under  the  British  Columbia  Environmental  Assessment  Act  if  we 
determine to proceed with a substantial project.  An environmental review is not required under the 
Environmental Assessment Act to proceed with the recommended Stage One and Two exploration 
programs on our North Claims. 
 
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws 
 
We currently have no costs to comply with environmental laws concerning our exploration program. 
 
We  will  have  to  sustain  the  cost  of  reclamation  and  environmental  remediation  for  all  work 
undertaken  which  causes  sufficient  surface  disturbance  to  necessitate  reclamation  work.   Both 
reclamation  and  environmental  remediation  refer  to  putting  disturbed  ground  back  as  close  to  its 
original  state  as  possible.   Other  potential  pollution  or  damage  must  be  cleaned-up  and  renewed 
along standard guidelines outlined in the usual permits.  Reclamation is the process of bringing the 
land back to a natural state after completion of exploration activities.  Environmental remediation 
refers to the physical activity of taking steps to remediate, or remedy, any environmental damage 
caused, i.e. refilling trenches after sampling or cleaning up fuel spills.  Our initial programs do not 
require any reclamation or remediation other than minor clean up and removal of supplies because of
F-20
minimal disturbance to the ground.  The amount of these costs is not known at this time as we do not 
know  the  extent  of  the  exploration  program  we  will  undertake,  beyond  completion  of  the 
recommended phases.  Because there is presently no information on the size, tenor, or quality of any 
resource or reserve at this time, it is impossible to assess the impact of any capital expenditures on 
our earnings or competitive position in the event a potentially economic deposit is discovered. 
 
Employees 
 
We  currently  have  no  employees  other  than  our  officers  and  directors.  We  intend  to  retain  the 
services  of  geologists,  prospectors  and  consultants  on  a  contract  basis  to  conduct  the  exploration 
programs on our mineral claims and to assist with regulatory compliance and preparation of financial 
statements.
Research and Development Expenditures
We have not incurred any research or development expenditures since our incorporation.
Subsidiaries
Nava Resources Canada Inc. (“Nava Canada”) is a 100% owned subsidiary of Nava Resources Inc.
Patents and Trademarks
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark.
Plan of Operation 
 
Our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to complete the following objectives within the 
time periods specified, subject to our obtaining any additional funding necessary for the continued 
exploration of our mineral claims. We have enough funds to complete our Phase One exploration 
program and possibly Phase Two depending on scope and costs.  
 
1.    Since  the  next  anniversary  date  of  the  Claims  is  August  28,  2010  we  will  need  to  arrange  
exploration work worth approximately $2,500 or pay the Province of British Columbia $2,518 in 
lieu of filing exploration expenses in order to keep the Claims in good standing. 
 
2.  As recommended by MineStart, we commenced the Phase One program starting in June 2008. 
Work performed consisted of a prospecting traverse of about 5.5 kilometers, primarily within North 
2, but overlapping into the southwest corner of North 1.  This represents an area of about 62 ha, 
broadly  prospected.    The  area  prospected  is  covered  by  an  extensive  layer  of  boulder  till,  best 
exposed locally along Youbou Road and in stream cuts.  Outcrops in this area are probably minimal; 
none  were  located  during  the  traverse.    A  total  of  30  samples  were  taken  for  multi-element 
lithogeochemical analysis.  These samples are from both sub-crop (along road cuts close to Youbou 
Road and drainage ways) and float.  All samples are intermediate to possibly mafic in composition, 
weakly  to  moderately  foliated,  and  fine  to  medium  grained,  probably  representing  a  mix  of  fine
F-21
pyroclastics and intrusive equivalents.  Samples exhibited no visible signs of mineralization, veining 
or hydrothermal alteration. 
 
Though not visibly mineralized samples were analyzed geochemically for a multi-element suite (37 
elements) in order to accrue a foundation of lithogeochemical data in anticipation of more detailed 
work, and to test for the presence of anomalous Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag-Au-Ba-As, potential pathfinders for 
Kuroko type environments. Samples were sent to Acme Labs in Vancouver, crushed to 200  mesh, 
and processed by Aqua Regia digestion CCP-MS analysis.  Gold was also determined by fire assay 
fusion by ICP-ES.  No significant anomalies were identified in the pathfinder suite.  However, the 
first three samples demonstrate a weakly anomalous Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag-As-Ba signature, which may be 
of interest. 
 
3.  We will further review the phase one results and decide if we will plan and conduct a Phase Two 
program beginning in April or May 2010.  Timing of this program will to some extent be dependent 
on permitting requirements. This program, estimated to cost from $25,000 to $75,000 depending on 
scope, may include geological mapping, a geochemical survey, trenching, sampling and analysis.  
 
4.    In  the  case  that  the  Phase  Two  exploration  program  takes  place,  we  will  review  its  results  in 
September 2010.  Further work on the property may be undertaken if justified by the results of Phase 
Two. A joint venture relationship may be explored at some future point as justified to offset the costs 
of continued exploration and drilling if warranted. 
 
We may consider entering into a joint venture partnership by linking with a major resource company 
to provide the required funding to complete exploration beyond Phase Two. We have not undertaken 
any efforts to locate a joint venture partner at this point. If we enter into a joint venture arrangement, 
we will assign a percentage of our interest in our mineral claims to the joint venture partner. 
 
5.  On  April  16,  2009,  we  entered  into  a  Strategic  Alliance  with  Fremont  Exploration,  Inc., 
(“Fremont”)  an  Oklahoma  City,  Oklahoma  based  independent  oil  and  gas  exploration  and 
production  company.    The  Strategic  Alliance  will  expose  Nava  to  several  attractive  investment 
opportunities  and  should  allow  Nava  to  accelerate  its  growth  and  value  creation  programs.    The 
initial transaction of the Strategic Alliance is Nava’s commitment to participate with Fremont in the 
exploitation of eight specific well defined production enhancement and/or redevelopment projects in 
Runnels  County,  Texas.    Runnels  County,  Texas  is  located  on  the  Eastern  Shelf  of  the  Permian 
Basin in West Central Texas. The Permian Basin is one of the major oil producing regions of the 
United States. Nava and Fremont have executed a Letter of Intent covering the initial project.  It is 
the  intent  of  both  companies  to  close  this  transaction  as  soon  as  they  can  and  to  commence 
redevelopment activities immediately thereafter.  Nava’s working interest in these eight projects will 
be up to 40%. After completion of the initial eight projects, Nava will have the right but not the 
obligation  to  participate  with  Fremont  in  additional  reserve  and  production  growth  projects  in 
Runnels County, Texas.  
 
6. We will also be evaluating other opportunities that might be brought to our attention.

Revenues
We have had no operating revenues since our inception on July 21, 2005 to December 31, 2009. We 
anticipate that we will not generate any revenues for so long as we are an exploration stage 
company.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses in the six months ended December 31, 2009 decreased to 
$10,004 from $19,232 in the six months ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of reduction 
in exploration costs and professional fees.
Mineral Property Costs
F-23
In the Six months ended December 31, 2009, we incurred nil mineral property costs compared to 
mineral property costs of $4,100 in the six months ended December 31, 2008. We expense our 
mineral property costs as they are incurred.
Rent
Our office space is being provided by our Chief Financial Officer, Johnny Astorino, free of charge. 
There is no assurance that Mr. Astorino will continue to provide the office space free of charge.
Net Loss
As a result of the above, our net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2009 was $9,935 as 
compared to $18,266 in the six months ended December 31, 2008.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2009, we had cash of $95,834 and a working capital of $88,684. During the 12 
month period following the date of this quarterly report, we anticipate that we will not generate any 
revenue. We believe that we have enough cash on hand to complete our Phase One exploration 
program and commence a fairly basic Phase Two program. If the results of the Phase One are 
particularly encouraging, we may wish to raise additional funds for a more in depth Phase Two 
program starting in May 2010. Additional funds will need to be raised to support work that may be 
undertaken subsequent to Phase Two.
If additional funds are required, the additional funding will likely come from equity financing from 
the  sale  of  our  common  stock  or  sale  of  part  of  our  interest  in  our  mineral  claims.  If  we  are 
successful in completing an equity financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution of their 
interest in our Company. We do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors 
with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock 
to fund our exploration activities. In the absence of such financing, our business will likely fail.
Going Concern
We have not generated any revenues since inception. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had 
accumulated  losses  of  $100,457.  Our  financial  statements  contain  additional  note  disclosures 
describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors. Our financial 
statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  related  to  the  recoverability  or  classification  of  asset-
carrying  amounts  or  the  amounts  and  classifications  of  liabilities  that  may  result  should  the 
Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
F-24
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements including arrangements that would affect our liquidity, 
capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United 
States generally accepted accounting principles and are expressed in U.S. dollars. For a change in 
accounting policies, please see Note 3 to our financial statements for our quarter ended December 
31, 2009, which are included in this quarterly report.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
A  smaller  reporting  company,  as  defined  by  Item  10  of  Regulation  S-K,  is  not  required  to  provide  the 
information required by this item.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of December 31, 2009. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures 
were effective as of December 31, 2009.
Management report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our  management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over 
financial  reporting.  Internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  defined  in  Rule 13a-15(f) and  15d-
15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company’s 
principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, 
management  and  other  personnel  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
(cid:31)                     pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that  in  reasonable  detail  accurately  and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(cid:31)                    provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting 
principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  Company  are  being  made  only  in 
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
(cid:31)                     provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of 
unauthorized  acquisition,  use  or  disposition  of  the  Company’s  assets  that  could  have  a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Management  acknowledges  its  responsibility  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal 
controls over financial reporting. We are not in compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
F-25
Act  of  2002,  but  intend  to  commence  shortly  the  system  and  process  of  documentation  and 
evaluation needed to comply with Section 404.
