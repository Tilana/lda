<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report, which covers the period from May 2012 to December 2013, is 
submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 67/152, in which the Assembly 
requested the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed 
Conflict to submit a report to the Human Rights Council on the activities undertaken in 
fulfilment of her mandate, including information on her field visits, and on challenges in 
the children and armed conflict agenda. 
</p>
<p>2. On 10 September 2013, the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict 
gave a briefing1 to the Human Rights Council at the opening of its twenty-fourth session. 
This update provided an overview of the most salient activities undertaken by the Special 
Representative, and of the progress achieved during the period from June 2012 to July 
</p><p>2013. 
</p>
<p>3. In order to align the annual reporting cycle with the voluntary calendar of thematic 
resolutions of the Council, the annual report of the Special Representative for Children and 
Armed Conflict will, as of 2014, be submitted to the Council at its March session. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Progress and challenges in addressing grave violations 
against children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>4. Since the previous report of the Special Representative, progress has been made 
towards the protection of children in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>5. With respect to new commitments made by parties to the conflict in Somalia, that 
country&#8217;s Government signed, on 3 July and 6 August 2012, two action plans to end the 
recruitment and use, as well as the killing and maiming, of children by the Somali National 
Security Forces, in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions. Through the 
action plans, the Government committed to set out disciplinary measures and ensure 
accountability for violations perpetrated by the Somali National Security Forces. Despite 
these commitments, violations by all parties to the conflict in Somalia continue to be 
reported, and little progress has been made in holding perpetrators accountable. 
</p>
<p>6. On 4 October 2012, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
signed an action plan to end the recruitment and use of children as well as sexual violence 
by national security forces. Since then, significant progress has been achieved, with 
hundreds of children being released and reunited with their families. A joint technical 
working group has been established and is being co-chaired by the Government and the 
United Nations, to oversee and support the implementation of the action plans. Directives 
and military orders have been issued to national security forces prohibiting violations 
against children and establishing clear sanctions, and wide dissemination of these is 
ongoing. However, as a result of the renewed hostilities in the eastern provinces between 
M23 and government forces during the reporting period, and the ongoing activity of other 
armed groups, violations against children remain a serious concern, with hundreds of 
children still being associated with armed groups and at risk of grave violations. Girls 
continue to be especially vulnerable, as they are often used as sex slaves while in the ranks 
of armed groups and subsequently face stigmatization and additional violence on returning 
to their communities.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
  Conference room paper entitled &#8220;Oral update of the Special Representative for Children and Armed 
</p>
<p>Conflict&#8221;. </p>


<p>7. As part of the process of implementing the action plan signed by the Government of 
South Sudan on 12 March 2012, the Military Justice and Legal Affairs Directorate has 
issued a military order and a directive to further strengthen the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation 
Army Act (2009) prohibiting the recruitment and use of children and the military use of 
schools. The directive and the military order set out punitive disciplinary measures, both 
administrative and judicial, against any SPLA personnel contravening the above-mentioned 
prohibitions. In May 2012, the SPLA issued a new policy directive on halting the 
recruitment and use of children, in the context of a recruitment campaign. As a result of this 
directive, a total of 450 children (421 boys and 29 girls) who had come for voluntary 
enlistment were turned away. 
</p>
<p>8. Following the Special Representative&#8217;s engagement with the Government of Yemen 
during her visit in November 2012, and in the context of the ongoing support of the United 
Nations for the transition in Yemen, the Government of Yemen undertook a comprehensive 
revision of national legislation related to military laws, along with concrete steps to end the 
recruitment and use of children in its armed forces. Through Cabinet resolution No. 212 
(2012), the Government of Yemen formalized its commitment to end the recruitment and 
use of children by armed forces and groups in conflict, in line with the Paris Commitments 
to protect children from unlawful recruitment or use by armed forces or armed groups. In 
2013, the Government agreed to review the implementation of its commitment to end child 
recruitment in armed conflict, with the adoption of Cabinet resolution No. 1 (2013). 
</p><p>9. During the reporting period, the Security Council Working Group on Children and 
Armed Conflict highlighted the need to end impunity for perpetrators of grave violations 
against children in Sudan (S/AC.51/2012/1), South Sudan (S/AC.51/2012/2), Colombia 
(S/AC.51/2012/4), Myanmar (S/AC.51/2013/2) and Yemen (S/AC.51/2013/3), and in the 
Central African region affected by the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army (LRA) (S/AC.51/2013/1), 
by conducting timely, rigorous and systematic investigations of perpetrators of violations 
and abuses and bringing those responsible to justice.  
10. The Security Council Working Group also highlighted the need to ensure 
accountability for the LRA in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo and South Sudan (S/AC.51/2013/1), and recalled the arrest warrants issued by the 
International Criminal Court for Joseph Kony, Okot Odhiambo and Dominic Ongwen on 
charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, and enlistment 
of children. The Working Group stressed the need to consider a broad range of other 
options to increase pressure on the LRA, as a persistent perpetrator of violations against 
children affected by armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>11. The Special Representative welcomes the designation by the Security Council 
Committee of five additional military leaders in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
pursuant to Security Council resolution 1533 (2004),2 with regard to serious violations of 
international law involving the targeting of children and women in situations of armed 
conflict. The Special Representative also welcomes the Committee&#8217;s call to all armed 
groups to release children in their ranks and to stop any future recruitment.3 Furthermore, in 
its resolution 2127 (2013) on the situation in the Central African Republic, the Security 
Council stressed its intention to consider imposing targeted travel and financial sanctions 
against perpetrators of grave violations against children.

<p>12. This progress notwithstanding, armed conflict still plagues children&#8217;s lives, 
depriving them of their right to life and physical integrity, but also of their basic social, 
economic and cultural rights. Every day in all conflict situations, such as in the Syrian Arab 
Republic, Sudan, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
Afghanistan, thousands of children are being recruited, killed, maimed, abducted, subjected 
to sexual violence, indoctrinated and forced to commit atrocities, denied humanitarian 
access, and deprived of health care. The Special Representative remains concerned by the 
arbitrary arrest, detention, torture and ill-treatment of children, as well as by attacks on 
schools and hospitals despite their protected status under international law, during the 
reporting period. 
</p>
<p>13. While all grave violations remain a serious problem, the Special Representative is 
deeply concerned by ongoing reports of sexual violence committed against children in 
armed conflict. However, in most conflict situations, including in Darfur and in the Syrian 
Arab Republic, sexual violence against children is underreported, due to difficulties in 
accessing areas affected by conflict, and the hesitation of victims to report on sexual 
violence, fearing social exclusion and retribution.  
</p>
<p>14. The Special Representative raised awareness of how sexual violence causes 
irreparable harm and devastating consequences for the physical and psychosocial well-
being of girls and boys. Girls are used as sex slaves or &#8220;wives&#8221; of members of armed forces 
and groups. The Special Representative recognizes that children subjected to sexual 
violence by armed groups play multiple roles, including the role of combatant, and other 
support roles, and require special attention. Victims of sexual violence are least likely to be 
reached for separation, reintegration and legal redress. Therefore, the Special 
Representative continues to advocate for special provisions for victims of sexual violence 
in armed conflict to ensure their access to justice and to proper reintegration assistance.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Working with United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
is a key partner to the Office of the Special Representative, particularly with respect to 
assisting in strengthening coherent monitoring and reporting of the six grave violations, and 
mainstreaming child rights issues in armed conflict into the work of human rights 
mechanisms such as the universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council, the treaty 
bodies and the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>16. OHCHR&#8217;s field presence and its deployment of human rights officers in 
multidimensional peacekeeping operations and political missions continues to make an 
important contribution to the monitoring and reporting of grave violations against children 
during armed conflict, in conjunction with other United Nations and civil society partners.  
</p><p>17. The recommendations by United Nations human rights mechanisms, pertaining to 
the issue of children and armed conflict, are a key advocacy tool in the work of the Special 
Representative. The role of the Human Rights Council is particularly important in 
promoting the development of international norms and standards to protect children&#8217;s rights 
in conflict situations and in ensuring that States apply these. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Representative welcomes the adoption by the Human Rights Council of 
resolution 23/25 on accelerating efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women 
by, inter alia, preventing and responding to rape against girls in conflict. Sexual violence 
against girls has long-term adverse consequences for their reproductive health, which 
include unintended pregnancies, and contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted 
diseases. The Special Representative strongly supports the call for States to put an end to 
impunity and to effectively use all appropriate means to thoroughly investigate and </p>


<p>prosecute those subject to their jurisdiction that are responsible for such crimes. The 
Special Representative also hopes that the Human Rights Council will address the growing 
number of cases of boys subjected to sexual violence in armed conflict. 
</p><p>19. Cognizant of the disproportionate effect of arms transfers in armed conflicts on the 
human rights of children, including the increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence 
against children, the Special Representative appreciates the adoption of Human Rights 
Council resolution 24/35. The Special Representative also welcomes the adoption of 
resolution 22/24 on the situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic and strongly 
supports the urgent call on all parties to refrain from recruiting and involving children in the 
conduct of hostilities.  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Representative echoes the condemnation of all serious human rights 
violations perpetrated against civilian populations, including rape and other forms of sexual 
violence and the recruitment and use of children by armed groups, included in resolutions 
24/27, 24/30, 24/32 and 24/34, which also call for technical assistance and capacity-
building for human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, Yemen and 
the Central African Republic. She further wishes to highlight the call to armed groups to 
release children from their ranks, and urges all parties to the conflicts to cooperate with the 
United Nations and other child protection actors to assist children in reintegrating into their 
communities. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Partnership with regional and intergovernmental 
organizations 
</b></p>
<p>21. As a result of the increasing prevalence of conflicts with a regional dimension, 
regional and subregional organizations have an ever-greater role to play in conflict 
prevention, mediation and peacekeeping. As such, there is a clear need to strengthen 
partnerships in order to broaden the mainstreaming of child protection.  
</p>
<p>22. Working in partnership has been a priority of the Special Representative from the 
outset of her tenure, and continues to be one of the key strategies in her effort to further 
advance the children and armed conflict agenda. 
</p>
<p>23. The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child prohibits the recruitment 
of children by armed forces and groups, and specifically identifies the need to respect 
international humanitarian law with regard to children during armed conflicts. The Charter 
defines children as being under 18 years of age, and was the first regional instrument to 
protect children&#8217;s rights. With a view to building on and formalizing its ongoing 
collaboration with the African Union, the Office of Special Representative signed a 
declaration of intent with the Peace and Security Department of the African Union 
Commission, on 17 September 2013. This declaration of intent sets out joint priorities to be 
achieved in partnership with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) to enhance the 
mainstreaming of child protection within African Union policies and operations. The 
declaration establishes collaboration in the following specific areas: (a) the development of 
a strategy to mainstream child protection concerns in African Union activities; (b) the 
institutionalization of policies and procedures on child protection in accordance with 
regional and international standards, including the development of guidelines and training; 
(c) dedicated child-protection capacity within the Peace and Security Department; and 
(d) the development of a joint programme of work to further the implementation of the 
activities set out in the declaration. In addition, UNICEF, with support from the Office of 
the Special Representative, is in the process of assisting the African Union&#8217;s Peace and 
Security Department with the recruitment of a child-protection advisor, who will serve as 
the focal point for the joint activities set out in the declaration.  </p>


<p>24. As part of this ongoing collaboration, the Special Representative participated in the 
Fourth High-level Retreat on the Promotion of Peace, Security and Stability in Africa, 
organized by the Peace and Security Department of the African Union Commission, where 
she chaired a panel discussion on mainstreaming child protection into mediation processes. 
Furthermore, the Office of the Special Representative provided technical inputs, and 
participated in two workshops: one for the development and the other for the validation of a 
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) strategy and of specific guidelines 
for child protection in DDR processes. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Representative commends the Zero Child Soldier in the Great Lakes 
Region campaign, which was announced in November 2013, during her visit to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, by the International Conference on the Great Lakes 
Region, and has expressed her intention to work closely with its member States to develop 
specific strategies for the subregion. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Representative continued her dialogue with the European Union and 
visited Brussels in June 2013 to discuss ways to ensure better protection for children 
affected by armed conflict. During her visit, she stressed the need for the increased 
application of the European Union Guidelines on Children and Armed Conflict, and 
emphasized the importance of the European Union utilizing all the available tools for the 
protection of children. This includes supporting long-term reintegration programmes for 
children formerly associated with armed forces and groups, and the development of training 
for member States deploying personnel to crisis management operations. She also stressed 
the human rights and political advocacy role of the European Union in addressing grave 
child rights violations. 
</p>
<p>27. The Office of the Special Representative has continued to engage with the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The outcome document of the summit meeting of 
the North Atlantic Council held in Chicago in May 2012 included specific reference to 
children affected by armed conflict. During a visit to NATO headquarters in June 2013, the 
Special Representative launched an online pre-deployment child protection training 
programme. She requested NATO to develop and implement measures to prevent child 
casualties, along with transparent mechanisms for review and investigation. In November 
2012, the NATO Military Committee adopted guidelines to integrate Security Council 
resolution 1612 (2005) and subsequent resolutions into NATO&#8217;s military doctrine, training, 
and operational planning and conduct, that include quarterly reporting on children and 
armed conflict, and the appointment of technical focal points. 
</p>
<p>28. In October 2013, the Special Representative initiated a dialogue with the League of 
Arab States on child protection concerns. During her visit to Geneva in September 2013, 
the Special Representative initiated discussions with the Organization of Islamic 
Cooperation on exploring possible avenues of cooperation. Also in Geneva, the Special 
Representative briefed the African Group of the Human Rights Council on technical 
assistance in the area of legislation and reintegration for children formerly associated with 
armed forces and groups. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Representative welcomes the support provided by the International 
Organization of la Francophonie in the area of translating and disseminating technical 
guidance for reporting on children and armed conflict, for French-speaking audiences. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Ending the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>30. In 2004, the Security Council, in its resolution 1539, requested parties to conflict to 
halt the recruitment and use of children under the age of 18, and to develop action plans 
with the United Nations to separate and release any children associated with armed forces </p>


<p>or groups. To date, a total of 18 action plans have been or are currently being implemented 
by 20 parties,4 resulting in the release of thousands of children. Furthermore, all eight 
government security forces listed in the annexes of the Secretary-General&#8217;s twelfth annual 
report on children and armed conflict (A/67/845) have finalized, or are in the process of 
finalizing, formal commitments to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children in 
armed conflict. This demonstrates the strong support and momentum for the United Nations 
fight to end this practice. 
</p>
<p>31. In an effort to reinforce engagement with concerned Governments and to mobilize 
support and resources, the Special Representative announced on 13 June 2013 the 
development of a strategy to promote the end of the recruitment and use of children by 
government forces listed in the annex to the Secretary-General&#8217;s report on children and 
armed conflict, by 2016. To this end, the Office of the Special Representative and UNICEF 
are developing a global campaign in partnership with key United Nations entities, which 
aims at galvanizing the efforts of Member States, the United Nations system and donors, 
and identifies and develops targeted responses to support capacity gaps at the national level 
with a view towards full compliance by all eight Governments. 
</p>
<p>32. Currently, 46 non-State actors in 14 country situations5 have been listed as parties 
that recruit or use children, or perpetrate other grave violations against children. Out of 
these 46 armed groups, 28 have been listed for more than five consecutive years and are 
considered to be persistent perpetrators.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Representative has engaged with a number of these non-State actors to 
end grave violations against children, and dialogue is currently under way in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Myanmar, the Philippines, Sudan, the Syrian 
Arab Republic and Yemen. Furthermore, seven non-State actors have finalized action plans 
with the United Nations in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Engaging with non-State 
actors requires targeted and multidimensional strategies that are shaped by the specific 
political and military issues at stake and respond to the specific context of the conflict.  
</p>
<p>34. The Office of the Special Representative has prioritized dialogue with non-State 
actors who have shown a willingness to engage with the United Nations to end grave 
violations against children, and with those already engaged in peace processes. Engagement 
with non-State actors is conducted jointly with peacekeeping or political missions, 
UNICEF, and other concerned United Nations entities, with the full knowledge of the 
Government concerned. Challenges remain, however, including access restrictions due to 
security concerns, which limit the ability of the United Nations to systematically engage 
with non-State actors.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Field visits by the Special Representative 
</b>35. The Special Representative has continued to use field visits as one of her key 
advocacy tools to engage with Governments and non-State actors, foster constructive 
relations, and elicit commitments from parties to conflict to end grave violations against 
children. During the reporting period, the Special Representative travelled to Yemen 
(November 2012), the Syrian Arab Republic (December 2012) and Chad (May 2013), made 
a regional visit to Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey (July 2013), 
and travelled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (November 2013), in order to assess 
first-hand the situations of children affected by armed conflict, to advocate for the end of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 In C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, five parties signed two action plans.

<p>violations, and to obtain and facilitate the implementation of commitments from parties to 
protect children, as well as enhanced coordination and humanitarian assistance for 
children, and to follow up on the recommendations of the Secretary-General. In addition, 
the Special Representative visited C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (October 2013). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Yemen 
</b></p>
<p>36. In light of the listing in the &#8220;Report of the Secretary-General on children and armed 
conflict&#8221; of Government forces, Al-Houthi and Ansar al-Sharia for recruiting and using 
children since 2011, the Special Representative&#8217;s visit to Yemen was primarily focused on 
seeking commitments from the Government and the Al-Houthi armed group to end 
violations and to initiate dialogue to develop an action plan. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Representative held meetings with President Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi, 
Prime Minister Mohammed Salem Basindwah and other senior Yemeni officials. During 
her visit, President Hadi issued a statement prohibiting the recruitment and use of children 
by all elements of the country&#8217;s military and security forces.  
</p>
<p>38. Following the Special Representative&#8217;s visit, an interministerial committee 
composed of the Ministers of Defence, the Interior, and Human Rights, and chaired by the 
Minister of Legal Affairs, was established to develop an action plan to end the recruitment 
and use of children in armed conflict. The action plan was drafted with the support of 
UNICEF and was approved by the Cabinet in September 2013. In addition, the United 
Nations provided technical support to the National Dialogue Conference to ensure that the 
definition of a child as being a person below the age of 18 is used with regard to 
recruitment into the national security forces.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Representative also travelled to Sa&#8217;dah to meet with the leader of the 
Al-Houthi armed group; the meeting opened avenues for the United Nations team on the 
ground to engage with Al-Houthi on the issue of the recruitment and use of children.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Syrian Arab Republic 
</b></p>
<p>40. In view of the extensive grave violations committed against children by both the 
Government and armed groups, the Special Representative visited the Syrian Arab 
Republic in December 2012 to directly advocate with the Government and opposition 
forces to end grave violations against children. This visit also aimed to appeal for 
humanitarian support for Syrian children who had sought refuge in neighbouring countries, 
and to raise awareness about grave violations committed against those children. 
</p>
<p>41. At the time of the visit, violations against children were ongoing, and the damage 
and destruction to schools and medical facilities was already extensive, rendering thousands 
of schools and 40 per cent of hospitals non-functional. In Damascus, the Special 
Representative engaged with the Government on a range of issues. These included the use 
of air strikes and heavy weapons in densely populated areas, the targeting and military use 
of schools and hospitals by Government forces, and the humanitarian needs of children 
affected by the conflict.  
</p>
<p>42. As a result of the Special Representative&#8217;s visit, a United Nations country task force 
for monitoring and reporting on grave violations against children was established in the 
Syrian Arab Republic, with the Government&#8217;s consent, on 6 March 2013. However, serious 
security and access limitations have constrained its ability to carry out effective monitoring, 
verification and reporting. On 14 March 2013, the Government shared a report on grave 
violations against children in the Syrian Arab Republic with the country task force, </p>


<p>highlighting measures that it had taken to respond to the impact of the conflict on children, 
including education for displaced children and the rebuilding of damaged schools. The 
Syrian Government adopted a series of legislative reforms, including Law No. 11.2013 
which criminalized all forms of recruitment and use of children under the age of 18 by 
armed forces and armed groups, including taking part in direct combat, carrying and 
transporting weapons or equipment or ammunition, planting explosives, standing at 
checkpoints or carrying out surveillance or reconnaissance, acting as a distraction or human 
shield, or assisting or serving the perpetrators in any way or form. The law entered into 
force on 30 June 2013. The same law increased the sentence for the crime of rape against a 
girl under the age of 15. On 2 April 2013, the Government criminalized the abduction and 
kidnapping of individuals in the context of the crisis by means of legislative decree 
20/2013. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Representative also initiated contacts with Free Syrian Army 
commanders operating in the governorate of Rif Dimasqh and in Homs during her visit. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Regional visit to Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and 
Turkey 
</b></p>
<p>44. In July 2013, the Special Representative was invited to visit Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, 
the Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey to take stock of the security and humanitarian 
challenges presented by the inflow of refugees into neighbouring countries, and the overall 
regional impact of the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic. In all of the four neighbouring 
countries visited, the number of Syrians in urban areas has already exceeded the number in 
camps, with social services capacity reaching critical levels, and increased pressure on host 
communities. The Special Representative commends the efforts of host governments that 
have opened their borders to civilians leaving the Syrian Arab Republic and have provided 
life-saving assistance, and encourages the international community to continue to support 
such efforts. 
</p>
<p>45. Also of concern was the situation of Palestinians who have been forced to seek 
refuge in neighbouring countries after decades of asylum in the Syrian Arab Republic. This 
burden on the already overstretched Palestinian refugee programmes should not be 
neglected, and the Special Representative is working closely with the United Nations Relief 
and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East to ensure that children are 
protected and their rights are respected. 
</p>
<p>46. In the Syrian Arab Republic, where the multiplicity of armed groups in some areas 
of the country has further complicated humanitarian access as well as the overall protection 
of children, the Special Representative continued to engage in dialogue with the parties to 
end grave violations. She called for comprehensive implementation of the new legislation, 
and its application without discrimination to all parties to conflict. Furthermore, she 
advocated with the Government to establish a formal ministerial coordination mechanism to 
prevent and respond to violations against children, and to facilitate the sharing &#8211; within the 
Syrian Government and with the United Nations &#8211; of information on grave violations. The 
release of children arbitrarily detained for their alleged association with armed opposition 
groups was also discussed with Government representatives from various ministries. Since 
then, the Special Representative has received no information on any action taken by the 
Syrian Government regarding children detained for alleged association with armed groups.  
</p>
<p>47. In her interactions with representatives of the Free Syrian Army, the Special 
Representative strongly advocated that they fully respect their obligations under 
international humanitarian law, including by putting an immediate end to grave violations 
against children, take steps to protect children from the impact of military operations, and </p>


<p>undertake investigations into alleged violations. On a positive note, a first meeting between 
the country task force on monitoring and reporting and an interministerial committee took 
place on 12 December 2013, signalling the Government&#8217;s intention to work with the United 
Nations system for the protection of children affected by armed conflict. It is the hope of 
the Special Representative that the Syrian authorities will sustain this engagement.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Chad 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Representative visited N&#8217;Djamena in May 2013 to assess progress in 
implementing the action plan to end the recruitment and use of children by the Chadian 
National Army (ANT), which had been signed by the Government and the United Nations 
in June 2011. In the course of this visit, President Idriss D&#233;by Itno renewed his 
Government&#8217;s commitment to enact a legal prohibition on child recruitment by issuing and 
disseminating clear military instructions banning and penalizing child recruitment and 
ensuring free and regular access by child-protection actors to ANT installations. Acting on 
this commitment, the Government of Chad signed a road map with the United Nations 
outlining ten priority measures to accelerate the implementation of the action plan, 
including five short-term measures to be implemented prior to 31 October 2013. These 
measures included the criminalization of child recruitment, the establishment of an age 
verification mechanism for recruitment into the army, pre-deployment training on child 
protection for all troops, and support for the family reunification and community 
reintegration of children released from the ANT.  
</p>
<p>49. With crucial support from UNICEF, tangible progress has been made and the 
implementation of the measures has advanced well. The process of screening the national 
army was undertaken successfully to exclude the presence of children from its ranks, and 
on 10 October 2013 President D&#233;by issued a presidential directive unequivocally banning 
the recruitment and use of children in the national army and establishing clear penalties for 
violators. 
</p>
<p><b> E.  C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Representative visited C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire on 26&#8211;30 October 2013 on the 
occasion of the Fourth High-level Retreat on the Promotion of Peace, Security and Stability 
in Africa, which was held in Abidjan by the African Union. She took the opportunity to 
meet with the Ivoirian authorities, particularly with the Minister of Defence and the 
Minister of the Interior and Security, as well as with the Office of the Military Prosecutor. 
In addition, she met with the senior leadership of the United Nations Operation in C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire and with members of the country team. Despite significant progress having been 
made with regard to the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict, the Special 
Representative is concerned at the prevalence of impunity for sexual violence against girls, 
and at the obstacles to accessing justice in such cases. The Special Representative calls 
upon international partners in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to intensify their efforts in supporting the 
restoration of a functioning and accessible criminal justice system. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Representative travelled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 
17 to 23 November 2013 to meet with national, provincial and local authorities in Kinshasa, 
Goma, Rutshuru and Beni. In light of the recent military and political developments in the 
east of the country, the Special Representative assessed the situation of children affected by 
armed conflict, and reviewed progress on the implementation of the action plan signed in </p>


<p>October 2012 by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United 
Nations to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children by national security forces, 
and sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Representative conducted this visit with the joint support of UNICEF 
and the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo, and welcomes the release, since the signing of the action plan, of hundreds of 
children from the national security forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, owing 
to stronger cooperation between the Government and the United Nations. The Special 
Representative encourages the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with 
the support of the international community and the United Nations system, to sustain their 
efforts in enhancing age verification procedures and birth registration, as well as in the fight 
against impunity. She further encourages the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo to uphold their commitment to exclude perpetrators of grave violations against 
children from being eligible to integrate into the national security forces or to benefit from 
amnesty, and encourages them to intensify their efforts in holding perpetrators accountable. 
However, the Special Representative remains concerned at cases of children being detained 
without due process by national security forces for their alleged association with rebel 
movements. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Representative also met with victims and civil society representatives to 
assess the existing gaps in responses to violations against children, and to discuss progress 
and challenges in the fight against impunity. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Representative is concerned at the continued threat from the remaining 
armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and at the high numbers of 
children present in their ranks. She stresses the importance of any and all strategies for their 
disarmament and demobilization adequately taking into account the specific protection 
needs of children. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Progress in the development of international law 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Progress in the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children  
in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Special Representative continues to mobilize support for the signing and 
ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict. During the reporting period, she held bilateral 
meetings with Member States that had not ratified and/or signed the treaty, and actively 
briefed regional organizations, civil society, and regional groups on the matter. The Special 
Representative also highlighted the need for Member States to ratify and implement the 
Optional Protocol at the 2013 annual treaty event organized by the United Nations Office of 
Legal Affairs.  
</p>
<p>56. Between June 2012 and December 2013, the Optional Protocol was ratified by 
Cameroon, Indonesia and Nigeria, and was acceded to by Swaziland and Zimbabwe, 
bringing the total number of States parties to 152. To date, a total of 20 Member States have 
signed but not ratified the Optional Protocol. Furthermore, the Special Representative 
welcomes the firm pledge made in December 2013 by Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, 
President of the Federal Republic of Somalia, to adhere to the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child, and hopes that this will translate into ratification of the Convention and its 
Optional Protocols as soon as possible. </p>


<p><b> B. The Arms Trade Treaty 
</b></p>
<p>57. The adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty by the General Assembly in its resolution 
67/234 B of April 2013 constitutes an important opportunity for child protection. The entry 
into force of the Treaty falls in line with the long-standing interpretation by the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child of State parties&#8217; obligations, and is expected to have strong 
potential for generating a positive long-term impact on the situation of children in conflict, 
as it forbids the transfer of arms that could be used in committing attacks directed against 
civilians, including children, or in committing grave breaches of international humanitarian 
law and war crimes as defined by the international agreements to which the State is a party, 
such as the crime of child recruitment under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court. In addition, under the Treaty&#8217;s export assessment provisions, exporting States are 
requested to assess whether arms transfers would directly or indirectly lead to serious acts 
of violence against women and children, including killing and maiming, but also to the 
recruitment and use of children in armed conflict and, if an overriding risk is identified, to 
refrain from exporting. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Lucens guidelines on the military use of schools 
</b></p>
<p>58. Armed forces and armed groups use schools for a variety of military purposes, 
including as barracks, sniper or defensive positions, munitions depots, detention centres, 
recruiting grounds and training facilities. This is particularly true in remote locations, where 
shelter and large structures may be rare. It can involve parts that are central to the 
functioning of schools, such as classrooms, or those that are more peripheral, such as 
playgrounds, and water and sanitation facilities. The Security Council, in its resolution 
1998, explicitly mentions the use of schools for military purposes as a concern and an 
integral part of monitoring and reporting. 
</p>
<p>59. Furthermore, the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack, which was 
created in 2010 and is composed of a number of United Nations agencies and civil society 
organizations, has spearheaded a process, in close consultation with military experts, child-
protection actors, education specialists, and international humanitarian and human rights 
lawyers, to devise guidelines for protecting schools from use by armed forces and armed 
groups, known as the Lucens Guidelines. 
</p>
<p>60. This initiative aims at increasing knowledge and understanding, improving 
monitoring and reporting, and advocating for clear and explicit domestic legislation on the 
interaction of military forces with schools and schoolchildren. Member States are 
encouraged, both in times of conflict and of peace, to support and adhere to this set of 
principles, and to integrate them in a practical way into their national policies and 
legislation, as well as into their military doctrine, manuals and training. While the Lucens 
Guidelines have been produced specifically for application during armed conflict, they may 
also be instructive in other situations, including post-conflict situations with the potential to 
return to armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>61. The Office of the Special Representative has developed, in cooperation with 
partners, an operational strategy to reduce the military use of schools and to mitigate the 
impact of this on children. The strategy aims to address the concern raised by the Security 
Council in its resolution 1998 with regard to the military use of schools and the impact of 
this on the safety of schoolchildren and their teachers and on the right to education. 
Complementing the principles outlined in the Lucens Guidelines, this operational strategy 
provides a number of concrete, practical activities that can be voluntarily undertaken by 
parties to conflict with a view to implementing a voluntary commitment to further refrain 
from using schools for military purposes. The activities proposed in the operational strategy </p>


<p>pave the way for the practical implementation of the Lucens Guidelines by parties to 
conflict, with the support of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>62. It is the Special Representative&#8217;s hope that, through acknowledgement that the 
military use of schools may result in increased risk of attack, consensus will grow to 
address this concern. The Special Representative calls upon Member States to tackle this 
issue by taking concrete and proactive initiatives to protect schools and promote their 
civilian status, through the inclusion of protection elements in military training and doctrine 
and operational planning, as well as the incorporation of the recent Lucens Guidelines into 
national legislation. 
</p>
<p><b> D. International justice 
</b>63. Adherence to international law through the ratification of legal instruments is a 
crucial first step for States to improve the protection of children affected by armed conflict, 
and to address impunity for perpetrators. However, the establishment of national legislation 
and institutions frequently represents an obstacle to the effective implementation of 
obligations in States affected by conflict, owing to their weakened capacity. Even when 
legislation and institutions are in place, the challenge remains to ensure access to 
independent courts so that right holders can enforce respect of their rights. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Representative welcomes alternative strategies, such as mobile courts, 
to support access to justice in remote areas, to tackle impunity and to provide redress for 
victims of grave violations in the aftermath of conflict. Mobile courts have been used 
effectively in several countries such as the Central African Republic, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and Timor-Leste.  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Representative also commends the pilot mobile court scheme initiated 
by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to improve access to 
justice for refugees who have been victims of crime. Such projects have recently been 
initiated in Uganda, in collaboration with the Government of Uganda, and aim to address 
the lengthy wait that refugees face before their cases are heard, and to encourage victims of 
sensitive crimes including rape, sexual assault and domestic violence to report allegations.  
</p>
<p>66. The engagement by the United Nations in favour of strong rule of law at the 
international level is also essential to addressing global accountability challenges. While the 
primary responsibility to ensure accountability for grave violations committed against 
children rests with Member States, the work of international criminal tribunals and courts is 
particularly important to strengthen law enforcement and protection against right violations 
at the international level.  
</p>
<p>67. The Special Representative welcomes the surrender into the custody of the 
International Criminal Court, on 22 March 2013, of Bosco Ntaganda, against whom the 
Court had issued two arrest warrants, on 22 August 2006 and 13 July 2012 respectively. As 
the alleged former Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the <i>Forces patriotiques pour la 
lib&#233;ration du Congo</i>, Mr. Ntaganda is accused of seven counts of war crimes, including the 
enlistment of children under the age of 15, the conscription of children under the age of 15, 
and using children under the age of 15 to participate actively in hostilities, as well as 
murder, attacks against the civilian population, rape and sexual slavery, pillaging, and three 
counts of crimes against humanity allegedly committed in Ituri (Democratic Republic of the 
Congo) in 2002 and 2003. At the time of writing, the hearing for the confirmation of 
charges, which was initially scheduled for September 2013, had been postponed to allow 
the Prosecutor to complete the numerous tasks necessary after the case had been &#8220;dormant&#8221; 
for several years. </p>


<p>68. The confirmation of the conviction of former Liberian president Charles Taylor on 
26 September 2013 by the Appeal Chamber of the Special Court for Sierra Leone sent a 
clear message to leaders across the world that no one is immune from justice. The former 
president was convicted to 50 years in prison on 11 counts of war crimes, including the 
conscription, enlistment and use of child soldiers.  
</p>
<p>69. However, significant progress still needs to be accomplished in prosecuting crimes 
of sexual violence, at both the national and the international level. This need was 
highlighted by Judge Odio Benito in her dissenting opinion in the case against Thomas 
Lubanga Dyilo, in which she argued that by failing to deliberately include the sexual 
violence and other ill-treatment suffered by girls and boys within the legal concept of &#8220;use 
to participate actively in the hostilities&#8221;, the majority of the Chamber was making that 
critical aspect of the crime invisible. Sexual violence is recognized and criminalized under 
the Rome Statute and must be fully acknowledged. The Special Representative for Children 
and Armed Conflict, in close cooperation with the Special Representative on Sexual 
Violence in Conflict, continues to promote and to advocate for accountability for sexual 
violence. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Children&#8217;s basic needs and humanitarian aid in times 
of armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>70. Armed conflict goes hand in hand with the fragmentation of families, the 
disintegration of communities and of the &#8220;social fabric&#8221;, the breakdown of support systems 
and the destruction of health services. Armed conflict affects all aspects of children&#8217;s 
development. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Children&#8217;s access to education in times of armed conflict </b></p>
<p>71. The decline in schooling during periods of armed conflict has dramatic implications 
for countries&#8217; post-conflict recovery. Education is central to sustainable peace, and it is a 
way to teach and transmit reconciliation and forgiveness. And yet, millions of children 
living in conflict-affected countries are being denied access to learning, and their 
fundamental right to education is being violated. Their schools are attacked or occupied by 
armed forces, and teachers are targeted, increasing the risk that students and the educational 
community will never go back to school. In countries such as the Central African Republic, 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, and the Syrian Arab Republic, primary 
school-age children are out of school, and their right to education has been compromised by 
the looting, occupation or destruction of their schools. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Representative is deeply concerned by the fact that education is too 
often treated as a secondary need in situations of emergency. The life-saving and protective 
role of conflict-sensitive education must be fully acknowledged and prioritized, and 
initiatives aiming to ensure that schools are considered as safe spaces, neutral areas, or 
zones of peace should be strongly encouraged, promoted and supported, in order to make 
education the best weapon against ignorance and intolerance.  
</p>
<p>73. The Special Representative emphasizes the need to further coordinate efforts to 
restore schooling for children and rebuild education systems. She highlights the need to 
support countries affected by emergencies, including host countries, in order to ensure 
education for all, with a view to accommodating internally displaced persons and refugees 
in existing schools, by the provision of additional resources and innovative self-learning 
solutions to improve the access to quality education for every child in all circumstances. </p>


<p><b> B. Children&#8217;s access to health care in times of armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>74. Armed conflict has a dramatic impact on children&#8217;s lives. The wounds are not only 
physical, but also psychological, emotional and social. Being a victim of violence, living in 
constant fear, and experiencing extreme hardship, such as lack of shelter and medical 
treatment, can cause severe physical and mental suffering with devastating long-term 
consequences. 
</p>
<p>75. Armed conflict is a major public health hazard, and this is often overlooked. Tens of 
thousands of children die every year as a direct result of fighting. Furthermore, children die 
from malnutrition and disease caused or accentuated by armed conflicts. In many instances, 
conflict kills and injures more children than soldiers. Health professionals are crucial 
advocates for the rights of the child. Humanitarian and human rights organizations, 
including the World Health Organization, Physicians for Human Rights, the Centre for 
Victims of Torture, and the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition, actively advocate for 
the right of children to have access to medical care, especially in times of armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>76. Realities on the ground in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Syrian Arab 
Republic and Yemen indicate that patients, medical facilities, workers and ambulances are 
increasingly being targets of attack. This is a direct violation of the rules and customs 
enshrined in international humanitarian law, and is happening in many conflicts around the 
world. Both the recent initiative by the International Committee of the Red Cross, entitled 
Health Care in Danger, and the recent report by the Special Rapporteur on the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health 
(A/68/297), have emphasized that the provision of medical care has come to the centre 
stage of armed conflict, and is increasingly under attack. 
</p>
<p>77. Hospitals that remain operational during conflict are often looted or forced to close 
down for one or another reason. They run out of medical supplies. Military personnel stay 
close by, or set up check points near hospitals. Medical personnel are sometimes threatened 
and forced to withdraw medical care from patients. In some cases, health services are 
diverted to satisfy military needs. Attacks on hospitals, health workers and patients strike at 
the heart of protection of children affected by armed conflict. Health services save and 
sustain lives. Health services are crucial in order to meet the needs of children in conflict 
situations. Hospitals should have no part in warfare. 
</p>
<p>78. Unfortunately, this principle stands in sharp contrast to reality. The civil war in the 
Syrian Arab Republic is a tragic example that demonstrates how the strongest principles of 
humanity can be trampled on by warfare. A recent report by the Independent International 
Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic dealing with the issue of medical care 
has illustrated how the deliberate targeting of hospitals, medical personnel and transport, 
the denial of access to medical care, and ill-treatment of the sick and wounded have become 
some of the most alarming features of the Syrian conflict. Violence against health care 
workers has a significant compound effect, which causes dramatic increases in the mortality 
rate of patients. The breakdown of medical services disproportionately affects the most 
vulnerable segment of the population, especially children, nursing mothers and the 
disabled.  
</p>
<p>79. These incidents are of grave concern, and constitute a complete disregard for the 
special status of medical facilities, persons and functions, and a failure to protect the 
civilian population, including children. Concerted action by the international community is 
needed in order to highlight and tackle this issue, by strengthening the engagement of 
Member States, the United Nations, humanitarian and human rights organizations, civil 
society partners, the global health community, and above all, the parties to conflict. Medical 
professionals in neighbouring countries also need support, in order to respond to the urgent 
medical needs of persons fleeing conflict, the majority of whom are women and children. </p>


<p><b> IX. Observations and recommendations 
</b>80. <b>The Special Representative reiterates her urgent call upon States to sign and 
ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict; to enact legislation to explicitly prohibit 
and criminalize the recruitment of children into armed forces or groups, and the use 
of children in hostilities; and to establish 18 years as the minimum age for voluntary 
recruitment into the armed forces when depositing their binding declaration (under 
article 3), upon ratification of the Optional Protocol.  
</b>81. <b>Given the resource implications and reporting requirements that ratification 
and implementation entail, the Special Representative encourages initiatives by one or 
more members that have already ratified the Optional Protocol, as well as by regional 
and intergovernmental organizations, to provide guidance and technical assistance to 
those Member States willing to ratify. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Representative reiterates the recommendations made in previous 
reports and in her recent oral update to the Human Rights Council, in which she 
encouraged the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review to systematically 
take into account the concluding observations made by the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child when reviewing a State submission. The Special Representative urges 
State parties to accord priority to the implementation of relevant recommendations of 
the Working Group, with the assistance of the international community as needed. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>During the universal periodic review process, States are urged to include, as 
appropriate, in their recommendations to the State under review, specific references 
to information from the monitoring and reporting mechanism on grave violations 
against children that was established in accordance with Security Council 
resolution 1612 (2005), in addition to the country conclusions adopted by the 
Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, as appropriate. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>States should begin to accord priority to reporting on the implementation of 
the relevant recommendations by the Security Council Working Group in the 
universal periodic review process, with the assistance of the international 
community wherever it is needed. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Representative encourages the Human Rights Council, when 
considering or adopting resolutions on country-specific situations or thematic issues, 
to include recommendations on or references to the protection of children affected by 
armed conflict. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Special Representative also encourages the Human Rights Council to 
continue to include child rights violations in its resolutions establishing or renewing 
the mandates of special procedures.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Representative takes note with appreciation of the attention paid 
by the special procedures mandate holders to including child-protection concerns in 
their work. She encourages the mandate holders to continue to take into account 
the challenges faced by children, during their missions and in their reports and 
recommendations, insofar as they are relevant to their respective mandates, and to 
bring those concerns to her attention.
