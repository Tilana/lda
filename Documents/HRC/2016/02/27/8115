<p><b>  Comments by the Marshall Islands on the report of the 
Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of 
the environmentally sound management and disposal of 
hazardous substances and waste (A/HRC/21/48/Add.1) 
</b></p>
<p>1. The people and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) are 
intimately aware of the numerous and extreme complexities involved in assessing the 
consequences of the nuclear weapons testing program conducted in its territory.  It is not a 
task that can be completed within a period of less than one year and with a country visit of 
just four days to the capital atoll of Majuro.  Accordingly, the RMI greatly appreciates the 
understandings and insights regarding those consequences and their various impacts human 
rights, as contained in the report of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments regarding paragraph 12 
</b></p>
<p>2. The discussion of relocations and evacuations of people as a result of the nuclear 
weapons testing program is incomplete.  For example, there is no mention of Kili in the 
discussion of the people of Bikini.  After spending approximately two years at Rongerik 
Atoll, the people who had been removed from Bikini were indeed relocated to Kwajalein in 
March 1948.  However, they stayed there only until November of that year before being 
relocated again to Kili Island, an isolated single land mass and not an atoll with a lagoon.  
Three families returned to Bikini in 1972 following a partial cleanup of the atoll conducted 
by U.S. agencies but a radiological survey of Bikini in June 1975 determined that food 
plants grown at the atoll contained too much radiation and residents were cautioned not to 
eat locally grown food.  In August 1975, the U.S. announced postponement of the planned 
return of 150 additional Bikinians pending further analysis and evaluation of the results of 
the June survey.  In October 1975, the Bikinians filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in 
Hawaii demanding a complete scientific survey of the atoll.  In April 1977, Bikini Island 
residents were found to have a ten-fold increase in body burdens of Cesium-137 compared 
to a 1974 survey and the elevated dose rates were attributed to use of foods grown on 
Bikini.  Another survey of Bikini residents in April 1978 showed a 75 percent increase in 
Cesium-137 body burdens compared to the previous year and evacuation of those people 
from Bikini began in August of that year with most being relocated to Ejit Island in Majuro 
Atoll.  In October 1978, the Bikinians&#8217; lawsuit was dismissed on condition that the U.S. 
conduct a more comprehensive radiological survey of Bikini and several other northern 
Marshall Islands atolls.  [NOTE:  For reference, see the History webpage at 
http://www.bikiniatoll.com/ and relevant entries in the Marshall Islands Chronology at 
http://www.hss.doe.gov/Healthsafety/IHS/marshall/collection/ihp/chron/] 
</p>
<p>3. It should also be noted that while the inhabitants of Rongelap were indeed evacuated 
in 1946, that was done as a precaution prior to the commencement of the nuclear weapons 
testing program and the detonation of the world&#8217;s fourth and fifth atomic bombs during 
Operation Crossroads that year at Bikini.  In preparation for those tests, U.S. military 
authorities moved the residents of Rongelap, and those of Wotho Atoll as well, to a tent 
camp on Lae Atoll where they stayed for approximately three months before being returned 
to their home atolls in August 1946. 
</p>
<p>4. The people who were living at Rongelap, Ailinginae, and Utrik Atolls at the time of 
the Bravo thermonuclear test on March 1, 1954, were evacuated to Kwajalein Atoll a few </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>days afterward so that they could undergo emergency medical care after being exposed to 
high levels of radioactive fallout from that test.  After approximately three months on 
Kwajalein, and with no cleanup or efforts to reduce radiation levels at the atoll, the Utrik 
people were returned to their home atoll.  Radioactive contamination of Rongelap was 
deemed too high for human habitation at that time and the people who had been evacuated 
from that atoll and from Ailinginae were moved from Kwajalein to Ejit Island in Majuro 
Atoll in June 1954.  After approximately three years at Ejit, and with no cleanup or efforts 
to reduce radiation levels at the atoll, those people were returned to Rongelap in 1957. 
</p>
<p>5. In addition, it should be noted that while the 1985 move from Rongelap to Mejatto 
Island in Kwajalein Atoll may have been done voluntarily, the concerns of the people at the 
time regarding the health risk to themselves and their children and grandchildren from 
continuing to live at the atoll were proven to be valid.  A 1992 Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) between the U.S. government, the RMI Government, and the 
Rongelap Atoll Local Government provided that resettlement of the atoll will occur only if 
<i>no person</i> returning to Rongelap and subsisting on a diet of local foods only will receive an 
annual whole-body radiation dose equivalent of more than 100 mrem above background.  
Environmental studies conducted pursuant to that MOU demonstrated that radiological 
conditions at Rongelap Island and the neighboring islands in the atoll were out of 
compliance with the specified limit and that cleanup and remedial action was necessary in 
order to make those islands safe for human habitation.  Subsequently, the U.S. Congress 
appropriated $45 million to establish a Rongelap resettlement trust fund which has enabled 
a partial cleanup and construction of infrastructure to take place at the main island of the 
atoll to support the return of those who wish to do so.

</p>
<p><b>  Comments on paragraph 13 
</b></p>
<p>6. The relocation of the people of Enewetak to Ujelang occurred in 1947 so that their 
atoll could be used as the test site the following year for the world&#8217;s sixth, seventh, and 
eighth atomic bombs during Operation Sandstone.  U.S. officials represented to the people 
that the relocation would be temporary, in the likely time frame of three to five years, but it 
was not until 1980 that they were returned to live at Enewetak.  The detonation of the 
world&#8217;s first hydrogen bomb vaporized one of the islands in the atoll but other islands were 
also vaporized, in part or in whole, by other tests.  At the time of their removal, the acreage 
of the atoll was 1,919.49 acres but when the people returned to Enewetak after a 33-year 
forced exile, only 815.33 acres were available for their use.  Another 949.8 acres were too 
radioactive for use, and a total of 154.36 acres at six different islands had been vaporized.  
[See http://nuclearclaimstribunal.com/enewetak.htm] 
</p>
<p>7. It may also be noted that three islands at Bikini, comprising 69.67 acres, were vaporized 
as a result of the nuclear tests there. [See http://nuclearclaimstribunal.com/bikinifin.htm] 
</p>
<p>8. As noted in paragraph 4 above, Rongelap Atoll and Utrik Atoll, as well as 
Ailinginae Atoll, were all inhabited at the time of the Bravo thermonuclear weapon test on 
1 March 1954. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments on paragraph 15 
</b></p>
<p>9. The basis is unclear for the statement that the detonations in the Marshall Islands 
accounted for &#8220;80 per cent of all atmospheric tests conducted by the United States.&#8221;  In fact, 
more such above ground open air tests were conducted at the Nevada Test Site in the 
continental United States than the total of 67 in the Marshall Islands.  However, because the 
more powerful atomic and nuclear weapons were brought to the Marshall Islands for </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 
</b></p>
<p>testing, the combined explosive yield of the tests at Bikini and Enewetak was 
approximately 108 megatons, nearly 100 times the 1.1 megaton total of the atmospheric 
tests carried out in Nevada. 
</p>
<p>10. The statement in footnote 9 should be corrected to say that there were 43 nuclear 
explosive tests at Enewetak and to note that &#8220;An additional weapon was detonated at an 
altitude of 86,000 feet from a balloon that was launched from an aircraft carrier located 
approximately 85 miles northeast of Enewetak.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments on paragraph 23 
</b></p>
<p>11. For clarification, it may be noted that the original estimate of 530 &#8220;excess&#8221; (i.e. 
radiation-related) cancers by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) was contained in a 
report prepared in 2004 for the Senate committee, as noted in footnote 15.  The title of that 
paper was &#8220;Estimation of the Baseline Number of Cancers Among Marshallese and the 
Number of Cancers Attributable to Exposure to Fallout from Nuclear Weapons Testing 
Conducted in the Marshall Islands.&#8221;  That paper stated, &#8220;These findings indicate that we 
expect the exposure to fallout to result in about a 9% increase in the total number of 
cancers.&#8221;  [This 2004 report is available online at http://www.yokwe.net/ydownloads/NCI-
report.pdf] 
</p>
<p>12. The 1.6% &#8220;might be attributable to the radiation exposure&#8221; figure resulted from a 
comprehensive effort to revise the 9% estimate. The later and lower estimate was contained 
in a paper entitled &#8220;Projected Lifetime Cancer Risks from Exposure to Regional 
Radioactive Fallout in the Marshall Islands,&#8221; one of several papers published in the August 
2010 special issue of the journal Health Physics, which was dedicated to the subject 
&#8220;Radiation Doses and Cancer risks in the Marshall Islands from U.S. Nuclear Weapons 
Tests.&#8221;  Those papers are not in the public domain due to copyright restrictions but a 
summary is available at http://dceg.cancer.gov/reb/research/dosimetry/1/marshallislands/bg. 
</p>
<p>13. It is not known for certain what prompted the decision to revise/reduce the estimate 
of radiation-related cancers.  At U.S. Congressional hearings held in 2005, NCI researchers 
stated that &#8220;there are a large number of uncertainties associated with our estimates, only 
some of which could be reduced in the framework of a comprehensive study.  In the long 
run, this would require a large, multidisciplinary effort undertaken over several years at 
considerable cost. The decision whether to move forward with such a study must be made 
with the understanding that the likelihood of reducing significantly the uncertainty 
regarding the total number of excess cancers is quite small.  The incremental information 
thus gained would be of little practical significance in terms of public health management 
in the Marshall Islands. The NCI, therefore, does not believe that a comprehensive study 
should be conducted.&#8221;  [See http://legislative.cancer.gov/files/testimony-2005-07-19.pdf] 
</p>
<p>14. An additional observation may be made about the NCI's use of data from soil 
sampling and <i>in situ</i> measurement surveys by the RMI Nationwide Radiological Study 
(NWRS).  That study was conducted during the period 1990-1994 using funds provided to 
the Republic under the Section 177 Agreement specifically for medical surveillance and 
radiological monitoring activities.  The NWRS survey data was presumably made available 
to the NCI by one of its own researchers who was a co-author on all eight of the papers 
published in 2010 and who directed the RMI Nationwide Radiological Study in the capacity 
of Resident Scientist.  When that individual was requested in 1999 to provide the NWRS 
radiological data to the Nuclear Claims Tribunal, he refused to do so unless he was paid 
$25,000 and provided written proof that the RMI national government formally accepts the 
findings of the NWRS. </p>

<p><b>  Comments on paragraph 25 
</b></p>
<p>15. In reference to the statement &#8220;no known independent assessment exists on radiation 
levels in other areas of the Marshall Islands,&#8221; it may be noted the RMI Nationwide 
Radiological Survey mentioned in paragraph 14 above was intended to be independent of 
the U.S. Government and its agencies, which had conducted and controlled the results of all 
previous assessments.  The Section 177 Agreement between the RMI and U.S., intended to 
provide a full settlement of all claims for damage from the nuclear testing program, 
specifically provided that $3 million in annual proceeds from the Nuclear Claims Fund be 
used for conducting medical surveillance and radiological monitoring activities. In 
February 1988, the Marshall Islands Nitijel&#227; (national parliament) adopted a resolution 
requesting the RMI Cabinet to contract with qualified scientists from countries other than 
the United States in order to investigate the levels of radiation on all islands within the 
Marshall Islands.  From 1990 to 1994, the NWRS took <i>in situ</i> gamma spectrometry 
measurements and collected and analyzed soil, plant, and other food item samples from 
every inhabited island and from many of the larger uninhabited islands.  At least one 
measurement or sample was taken at each of 432 of the more than 1,200 islands in the RMI, 
making the NWRS the most comprehensive radiological survey ever in the Marshall 
Islands.  Unfortunately, certain incidents and circumstances relating to the conduct of the 
NWRS raised questions about the completeness, accuracy, and credibility of its December 
1994 Summary Report and at least some of the individuals involved in authoring it and 
another resolution was adopted by the Nitijel&#227; in September 1995 &quot;To declare formally that 
the Republic does not accept as valid or accurate the findings of the Nationwide 
Radiological Study.&quot; 
</p>
<p>16. A relatively limited assessment of radiological conditions at Ailuk Atoll was 
conducted in 2001 in order to determine if any cleanup or remedial action might be 
necessary to avoid a dose exceeding the 15 mrem per year annual limit to the reasonably 
maximally exposed individual, as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
and adopted by the Nuclear Claims Tribunal.  Aerial monitoring shortly after the Bravo test 
on 1 March 1954 had shown that radioactive fallout at that atoll was approximately 
equivalent to that at Utrik and consideration was given at the time to evacuating the people 
from Ailuk.  Ultimately, it was decided not to do so both for a lack of ships, aircraft, and 
other resources and also because the fallout intensities at Ailuk declined compared to those 
at Utrik.  The 2001 survey of the atoll was conducted by independent scientists and funded 
by the Nuclear Claims Tribunal.  It focused on six large islands where people live and/or 
collect significant amounts of food and the results indicated the persistent presence of small 
but measurable quantities of Cesium-137 in soil and various food crop samples.  The data 
collected generally supported the conclusion that residual contamination levels at Ailuk at 
that time satisfied the 15 mrem per year limit without remediation.  However, one 
evaluation procedure identified a small area near the center of the main island where the 
reasonably maximally exposed individual could receive a dose greater than the 15 mrem 
per year criterion.  A lack of resources have precluded any subsequent independent 
assessment of radiation levels in the RMI.

<p><b>  Comment on paragraph 28 
</b></p>
<p>17. In addition to the items mentioned, the traditional Marshallese diet includes 
numerous other seafood items as well as food crops such breadfruit, banana, papaya, etc.  
While some imported food was provided to the people of Utrik and of Rongelap when they 
returned to their contaminated atolls following their exposures to fallout from the Bravo 
test, there was no program to resupply such a dietary supplement on a regular basis. Also, 
with regard to the statement in footnote 22, the evidence that plants take up radioactive 
Cesium-137 from the soil is quite extensive and shows that such uptake continues to occur 
at many islands to this day. </p>

<p><b>  Comment on paragraph 30 
</b></p>
<p>18. Discussion of reproductive problems may have taken place during the site visit of 
the Special Rapporteur and his team to Ejit Island in Majuro Atoll but it should be noted 
that the community presently residing at that island is comprised primarily of the people of 
Bikini, who were moved there when they were evacuated from Bikini in 1978 (see 
discussion in foregoing comments on paragraph 12).  Such problems are known to have 
occurred particularly among women who returned to Rongelap in 1957 and several of those 
women have been living in Majuro since leaving that atoll in 1985.  For the record, it is 
suggested that discussions of their reproductive problems likely took place at a location in 
Majuro other than Ejit Island. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comment on paragraph 40 
</b></p>
<p>19. Regarding the final sentence, the Nuclear Claims Fund has been effectively 
exhausted as its present balance is less than $50,000, an amount slightly less than the total 
owed on award payment checks that remain uncollected due to death of the awardee or 
other reason(s).  The Nuclear Claims Tribunal made its last compensation award and initial 
partial payment in late 2008 and suspended awards and payment shortly thereafter.  It 
remains in operation at a very basic level with two part-time staff supported by funding 
from the RMI Government. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comment on paragraph 42 
</b></p>
<p>20. In addition to the information about the extent of radioactive fallout and the 
advances in science and knowledge of the effects of exposure, the assessment of the full 
impact of nuclear testing on people and the environment necessarily depends on the 
quantification of actual damages by the Nuclear Claims Tribunal.  The amount of the &#8220;full 
settlement&#8221; provided under the Section 177 Agreement was a figure that had no basis in any 
prior effort to assess such actual damages.  In addition, it is inaccurate to say that the RMI&#8217;s 
Changed Circumstances petition &#8220;was rejected in 2004.&#8221;  A report dated November of that 
year presented the U.S. Administration&#8217;s evaluation of the RMI&#8217;s request, concluding that it 
did not meet the criteria of &#8220;changed circumstances&#8221; as required by Article IX of the 
Section 177 Settlement Agreement and that there was no legal basis under the Settlement 
Agreement for considering additional payments.  The U.S. Congress, to which the RMI 
petition and the Administration&#8217;s evaluation of it were submitted and which has the 
authority to appropriate funds, has yet to take any action or make any formal determination 
which can be construed as final in response to the petition. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments on paragraph 50 
</b></p>
<p>21. The &#8220;work-force&#8221; at the primary medical care centers on Ebeye and Majuro is 
&#8220;mainly expatriate&#8221; but includes no American doctors or nurses.  In addition, RMI Ministry 
of Health officials advise that there are 45 beds at the medical center on Ebeye Island and 
90 beds at the hospital in Majuro. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments on paragraph 52 
</b></p>
<p>22. The $600 million figure cited by the U.S. as having been &#8220;spent in various technical 
programmes&#8221; also includes various ex gratia payments, resettlement trust funds, and 
compensation paid from annual proceeds of the Nuclear Claims Fund under the Section 177 
Agreement. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Comments on paragraph 53 
</b></p>
<p>23. The 177 Health Care Program is managed by Trinity Health International, a U.S.-
based organization specifically contracted by the RMI Ministry of Health for that purpose.  
Funding of the program is provided by the U.S. on an annual basis through the Department 
of the Interior.  The Section 177 Agreement states that the program shall provide health 
care related to the consequences of the nuclear testing program, as contemplated in U.S. 
Public Law 96-205.  That law directs that medical care and treatment be provided for the 
people of Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap, and Utrik &#8220;and for the people of such other atolls as 
may be found to be or to have been exposed to radiation from the nuclear weapons testing 
program.&#8221;  Accordingly, individuals to whom the Nuclear Claims Tribunal awarded 
compensation for a medical condition deemed to have resulted from the testing program are 
also enrolled in the 177 Health Care Program for treatment of that particular condition.  In 
addition, the RMI is unaware of any determination to &#8220;exclude people from Rongelap who 
were returned in 1957 until 1985&#8221; from either the Department of Energy or the 177 health 
care programs.  To the contrary, the people who were evacuated on an emergency basis 
from either Rongelap or Utrik following the Bravo test in 1954 are eligible for medical care 
and treatment from both of those programs. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments on paragraph 58 
</b></p>
<p>24. The statement that &#8220;about one-third&#8221; of the island has been remediated refers only to 
the main island of Rongelap which is less than 600 acres in size.  The traditional homelands 
of the people of Rongelap include the other 60 islands in that atoll as well as the 41 islands 
in the neighboring atolls of Rongerik and Ailinginae, comprising more than 2,500 
additional acres.  Accordingly, it should be acknowledged that far less than 10% of the total 
acreage in the three atolls has been remediated. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments on paragraphs 62-65 
</b></p>
<p>25. In March 2004, the U.S. House of Representatives adopted by a 408-0 vote a 
resolution to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Bravo test and to &#8220;recognize more 
than 5 decades of strategic partnership between the United States and the people of the 
Marshall Islands in the pursuit of international peace and security.&#8221;  That Concurrent 
Resolution, H. Con. Res. 364, states that &#8220;the Bravo test and the 12-year nuclear testing 
program has been the defining experience of the modern era for the people of the Marshall 
Islands.&#8221;  The people and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands look 
forward to a time when their experiences will no longer be defined by the nuclear testing 
program but rather by those aspirations memorialized in the Preamble to their Constitution:  
pride in our forefathers and their noble quest to build their own distinctive society;  the 
right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy;  and the 
desire to seek from other peoples the same friendship, mutual understanding, and respect 
for our individual idealism and common humanity that we extend to them.  The Preamble 
also says, &#8220;All we have and are today as a people we have received as a sacred heritage 
which we pledge ourselves to maintain, valuing nothing more dearly than our rightful home 
on these islands.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>26. The RMI acknowledges that the Recommendations in the report of the Special 
Rapporteur will require considerable effort to implement but views those recommendations 
as a detailed way forward to redefining the modern era for the people of the Marshall 
Islands.  Achieving those recommendations is a most worthy goal and the RMI commits 
itself to doing its part and to working cooperatively with the Government of the United 
States and with the international community toward that end.
