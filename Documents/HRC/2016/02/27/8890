</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report is submitted in accordance with decision 9/15 of the Human Rights 
Council. The present Special Rapporteur was appointed with effect from 1 May 2009 and he 
undertook his first mission to Cambodia a month later, from 16 to 26 June 2009. Given the lack 
of time to conduct an in-depth assessment of the situation of human rights in the country so as to 
be able to report about it in a credible manner, the Special Rapporteur decided that he would 
focus his first mission on familiarizing himself with the complex realities of the country, to 
re-establish conditions for a fruitful dialogue with the Government on human rights issues of 
concern, and to look for ways to strengthen cooperation between the Government, civil society 
representatives and the international community around these issues. 
</p>
<p> During his visit the Special Rapporteur met with the Prime Minister and other members of 
the Royal Government, members of the National Assembly and the judiciary, civil society 
representatives, as well as members of the United Nations Country Team and diplomats based in 
the country. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by the openness of his Government 
interlocutors to engage in substantive discussions provided they were conducted in an objective 
and non-partisan manner and with the intention of looking for solutions.  
</p>
<p> A number of issues arose during his visit, namely: freedom of expression, independence of 
the judiciary, land and housing rights in urban and rural areas, and prison reform. Subject to his 
mandate, the Special Rapporteur intends to focus on these substantive issues during future visits. 
</p>
<p> During his mission, the Special Rapporteur invited the Government to clarify its own 
human rights priorities, so that he can take them into account during the implementation of his 
mandate. The Government is yet to respond to this offer and the Special Rapporteur looks 
forward to a response in this regard in order to develop a programme of action around which 
international cooperation could be encouraged. 
</p>
<p> Pending these further discussions, the preliminary view of the Special Rapporteur is that 
while Cambodia has made remarkable progress in a number of areas given its burdened legacy 
and high public expectations, there still are a number of serious challenges in promoting and 
protecting human rights in the country and the Special Rapporteur would like to work with the 
Government to address them in a constructive manner. What is needed in Cambodia is not only a 
formal commitment to human rights on the part of the Government, but their implementation 
through determined action in several key areas. It is in these areas that a meaningful and 
constructive dialogue and cooperation would be needed between the Government, civil society 
and the international community and it is here that the Special Rapporteur hopes to make a 
significant contribution in the years to come. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 9/15, 
in which the Council decided to extend by one year the mandate of the special procedure on the 
situation of human rights in Cambodia through the appointment of a special rapporteur to carry 
out the former functions of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. I was appointed 
by the Council on 25 March 2009 as the new Special Rapporteur to engage in a constructive 
manner with the Government of Cambodia for the further improvement of the situation of human 
rights in the country and to report on the implementation of my mandate to the Council at its 
twelfth session. I undertook my first mission to Cambodia from 16 to 26 June 2009. The present 
report is submitted in accordance with resolution 9/15. 
</p>
<p>2. The human rights situation in Cambodia has been the subject of extensive analysis by four 
former Special Representatives of the Secretary-General, as well as treaty bodies, most recently 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Their observations have outlined and 
illustrated the challenges that Cambodia has faced in promoting and protecting human rights and 
the dignity of each and every individual residing within its borders. The challenges ahead are 
many and of a serious nature, and the Government interlocutors have given the impression that 
they are not shying away from that reality. I intend to build on the work done by my 
predecessors and engage with the Government in a constructive manner aimed at achieving some 
tangible results for the people of Cambodia. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE FIRST MISSION 
</b></p>
<p>3. The purpose of my first mission to Cambodia, conducted from 16 to 26 June 2009, was to 
lay the groundwork for a constructive dialogue with the Government and to explore a 
programme of action to improve the human rights situation in the country. I intended to make the 
first visit an opportunity to become familiar with the human rights situation in the country, to 
establish mutual understanding and channels of communication with the senior members of the 
Government and to listen to people from a broad cross-section of society. 
</p>
<p>4. I was pleased to have the privilege of meeting with H.E. Prime Minister Hun Sen, the 
Foreign Minister, Hor Namhong, the Minister of the Interior, Sar Kheng, the President of the 
Cambodian Human Rights Committee, Om Yentieng, and a number of other senior members of 
the Government, the President of the Supreme Court, leaders of the main opposition party in the 
National Assembly, several ambassadors based in Phnom Penh, the United Nations Country 
Team, the President of the Bar Association, the President of the Press Council, and 
representatives of civil society, indigenous groups and communities affected by land evictions in 
the recent past. 
</p>
<p>5. I was pleased with the cordial reception that I received from members of the Government 
and other stakeholders in the society. There was a general willingness to work with me to 
improve the situation of human rights, and I wish to build on this momentum of cooperation in 
the implementation of my mandate. I also had an opportunity to meet and have a constructive 
dialogue in a spirit of cooperation with the Prime Minister during his private visit to the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in July 2009. I am grateful to the 
Prime Minister for his willingness to cooperate to implement my mandate. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE FIRST MISSION 
</b></p>
<p>6. During my first visit of the country, I was made aware of the positive developments that 
have taken place since 1979 in general and since 1993 in particular, including stability after 
many years of conflict, economic growth and the holding of regular elections, including the one 
that took place in July 2008, which was peaceful. I took the opportunity to underline that the 
challenge for a country such as Cambodia was to continue with the process of reconstruction, 
reform and democratization with the degree of seriousness and sincerity required to implement 
the provisions of international human rights treaties, most of which embody universal values 
and which are part of Cambodian law. In this context, I was pleased to note that there was a 
willingness on the part of the authorities to acknowledge shortcomings and engage in a 
meaningful and constructive dialogue with me concerning change and reform. 
</p>
<p>7. During my meetings with the senior members of the Government, I outlined the 
desirability of fostering an environment of cooperation with the civil society sector, which has a 
crucial role in scrutinizing governmental actions and outlining the shortcomings, in an objective, 
impartial and non-partisan way. In a society still in transition the civil society has a great 
contribution to make in so many areas of activity to complement Government&#8217;s action, maximize 
the potential of the people of Cambodia and realize the enjoyment of their human rights.  
</p><p>8. I stressed that by joining the United Nations and ratifying so many international human 
rights treaties Cambodia undertook to implement human rights standards and accepted the notion 
that the human rights situation in every country is the legitimate concern of the international 
community. I was reassured by the Government&#8217;s receptivity to ideas and its commitment to 
work with my mandate in promoting human rights in the months and years ahead so that tangible 
benefits could be achieved for the protection of these rights in the country.  
</p>
<p>9. However, as of the time of writing this report, I had not received a response to my request 
from the Government concerning the priority areas for dialogue that could form the basis for a 
programme of action. Since returning from my mission to the country, I have joined a number of 
other special procedures mandate holders in expressing concern about the reported instances of 
lawsuits against the opposition party leaders brought by the Government and requested further 
information about such cases. The Government has not yet responded.  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  INITIAL OBSERVATIONS BASED ON THE FIRST MISSION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Major achievements made by Cambodia 
</b>10. Cambodia is a country which still is coming to terms with a tragic past, and the progress 
made thus far is encouraging. The legal, institutional and political systems had to be rebuilt 
effectively from scratch when the country began to pull itself together after 1979. In recent years, 
the country has experienced improved political stability which has allowed rapid economic 
development, thereby bringing more people out of poverty and into a position to better enjoy 
their economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>11. There have been periodic ballots to elect the Government. The latest general election, 
which was peaceful, took place in July 2008. There are several opposition parties in parliament. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Many national and international civil society organizations are operating in Cambodia in all sorts 
of areas of human activity; they support, often substitute for, but also scrutinize governmental 
activity. There are various media organizations, both print and radio, offering their services to 
the people in both Khmer and foreign languages.  
</p>
<p>12. Since 1993, the people have enjoyed an unprecedented degree of freedom of assembly, 
expression and movement, although people need by law to seek permission to hold public 
demonstrations, which is sometimes refused on unspecified security grounds, and arbitrary 
restrictions on travel or holding meetings have sometimes been imposed. The Government has 
responded positively to some of the recommendations made by former Special Representatives 
of the Secretary-General. One such example was the removal of prison sentences as a sanction 
for criminal defamation in 2006.  
</p>
<p>13. The Government has also faced the complex issue of land ownership, including by making 
an effort to improve land tenure security for the population. An ambitious project of land titling 
is under way in mostly rural areas. I was also pleased to see that noteworthy achievements had 
been made by the Royal Government in combating trafficking in human beings, especially 
women and children, for purposes of sexual exploitation by prosecuting offenders of the law 
against trafficking. Equally positive was the measure taken by the Government to close down a 
number of gambling places, although major casinos have remained opened. Efforts of the 
Government to combat HIV/AIDS have been widely commended, as have the mine removal 
efforts. 
</p>
<p>14. The Government has also taken a number of other progressive measures. One such 
measure was a 2006 law designed to combat domestic violence, especially against women. 
Measures such as these seem to have had an encouraging impact on the society. The Government 
has enhanced its engagement with the United Nations human rights treaty bodies. The National 
Assembly has passed a law recently to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The Ministries of the Interior, 
Justice and Social Affairs have also engaged in a constructive dialogue with the Cambodia 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on prison, judicial and other areas of 
reform.  
</p>
<p>15. In sum, Cambodia has made remarkable progress over the last three decades, the last two 
of which with the help of the international community and the United Nations in promoting 
human rights and democratizing the system of governance. A country which was brought back 
from the ashes of a prolonged conflict not long ago is now enjoying high economic growth and 
relative political stability and a great deal of credit for these achievements goes to the leaders in 
Government.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Challenges 
</b></p>
<p>16. In spite of these achievements, one of the major challenges still remaining for the 
Government is the ability to strike a balance between economic development and human rights 
protection, and it is one of the areas to which the Government needs to devote serious attention 
while seeking the help of the international community, including the United Nations human 
rights machinery. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>17. I began to examine the complex issue of land conflicts and sought information and advice 
from a variety of actors, including local communities, non-governmental organizations, 
international organizations, development partners and senior Government officials. Access to 
land in a rural country is of vital importance. I sensed a disconnect between national law that 
recognizes people&#8217;s rights to own land and establishes clear property safeguards, and what 
appears to be widespread land grabbing and alienation, in both urban and rural areas. In the 
current context of economic growth, which has given rise to escalating land values and land 
speculation, evictions of communities which have been living for years in informal settlements 
appear to be commonplace, and mostly without fair compensation, to make way for high-end 
development. I am concerned that this trend undermines the rule of law and jeopardizes people&#8217;s 
livelihoods. 
</p>
<p>18. I have also been informed that in rural areas, indigenous and rural communities are often 
left without recourse to protect their land from being taken by powerful individuals, or for 
mining or land concessions. My initial impression is that there is a need to strengthen the 
implementation of the land law in a fair manner in this domain, both by the administration and 
by the courts. There seems also to be a need to clarify the rationale for and process of eviction 
and resettlement, perhaps through the adoption of binding national guidelines, and devise ways 
to ensure land tenure security for the most vulnerable. This is an area where I will be happy to 
offer my advice and seek to foster cooperation in the search for long-term solutions to this 
painful issue. 
</p>
<p>19. Another issue that arose prominently during my visit was a series of defamation and 
disinformation charges filed by or on behalf of the Government against members of opposition 
parties and other critics of public policies or practices. Several convictions were pronounced. 
Two men, the director of a non-governmental organization and a news editor, both close to the 
main opposition party, have been sentenced to prison terms. A senior leader of the same party, 
Mu Sochua, was stripped of her parliamentary immunity and convicted for having filed a 
complaint for defamation against the Prime Minister. She was not given any opportunity to 
present her case in parliament before action was taken against her. Her supporters were chased 
away by security forces outside the parliament and foreign ambassadors with permanent 
admittance cards to the public gallery were not allowed in. Worse, her lawyer also came under 
pressure for speaking out about the case in public and he eventually withdrew, leaving 
Ms. Sochua without a lawyer to represent her. 
</p>
<p>20. This is a disturbing trend which, if allowed to continue, could seriously undermine the 
exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of expression, which is essential to effective media 
freedom, pluralism, diversity and democratic debate. I have discussed this concern with the 
Prime Minister and hope to pursue my dialogue with him and the Government in order to foster a 
more tolerant environment allowing effective democratic, that is, free, respectful and 
contradictory debate. The treatment meted out to Ms. Sochua&#8217;s lawyer is likely to have a 
detrimental impact on the independence and integrity of the legal profession.  
</p>
<p>21. The challenge for a country such as Cambodia is to continue with the process of reform 
and democratization with the seriousness and sincerity required to implement the provisions of 
international human rights treaties, most of which embody universal values and are part of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Cambodian law. My aim as Special Rapporteur is not merely to criticize the Government for its 
failings, but to offer expert, independent and objective advice to the Government and work with 
it to promote and protect human rights, strengthen the rule of law and foster international 
cooperation for that purpose, and support the efforts of the Government and civil society 
representatives in this regard. I am concerned about the deteriorating situation with regard to 
land evictions and freedom of expression/defamation and look forward to working with the 
Government and the representatives of civil society to address these issues.  
</p>
<p><b>V.  FUTURE APPROACH  
</b></p>
<p>22. I wish to begin a new chapter of cooperation in the promotion and protection of human 
rights in Cambodia. I regard my mandate as part of the United Nations efforts to offer assistance 
to the people and Government of Cambodia. The impression that I formed during my first 
mission to the country was that the Government is willing to work with me, with the civil society 
and the international community in addressing some of the human rights issues facing the nation. 
I have offered my assistance to the Government in identifying the issues and in addressing them 
in a constructive manner and am looking forward to a positive response.  
</p>
<p>23. I hope that both the Government and civil society representatives will find in me a willing 
partner in their endeavours to improve the human rights situation in the country. I also will be a 
willing listener to concerns from both sides and offer my services as an independent and 
impartial special rapporteur of the United Nations, bringing together my own experience of work 
in the fields of international law, human rights law and constitutional law gained over a long 
period of time in both developed and developing countries. My approach would be to work in 
good faith, expecting the same from other sides, and reserve judgement, recognize achievements 
and acknowledge weaknesses honestly where necessary but in a constructive manner.  
</p>
<p>24. I was pleased with the work being carried out by the Cambodia Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to assist the Government and the civil society in 
promoting and protecting human rights in Cambodia. and with the level of cooperation extended 
to me during my visit. I intend to cooperate constructively with the Cambodia Office in the 
implementation of my mandate and hope that the Government will continue to work with this 
Office in several key and sensitive sectors through an approach based on dialogue, cooperation 
and constructive criticism, as this would facilitate immensely my work and that of the whole 
United Nations human rights machinery. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS  
</b></p>
<p>25. <b>In conclusion, I believe that the promotion and protection of human rights in 
Cambodia depends on making real and substantial progress in strengthening the rule of 
law, creating a clearer separation of power between the three main branches of the 
Government, protecting the independence of the judiciary, including that of the 
Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, and addressing issues such as 
conflicts over land, impunity and control of corruption. I intend to focus my attention on 
these substantive issues during my future visits to the country and hope that the 
Government will be willing to engage in a constructive dialogue on these issues. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>26. <b>I was pleased with the opportunity that I had during my visit to outline my intention 
to engage in a constructive dialogue with the Royal Government of Cambodia and to offer 
my assistance in dealing with some of the human rights challenges facing the nation. I 
would be willing to act as a bridge between the Government and the civil society in order to 
foster an environment of cooperation rather than confrontation between them for the 
benefit of the people of Cambodia. I would also be willing to assist the Government in 
promoting a greater degree of clarity in the separation of power between the three main 
branches of the Government, in enhancing the independence of the judiciary, and in 
developing transparent national guidelines on land evictions.
