LKA GOLD INCORPORATED
Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
NOTE 1 -       ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
LKA Gold Incorporated (Formerly LKA International, Inc.)  ("LKA" or the "Company") is currently
engaged in efforts to expand mine production and continues to seek additional investment
opportunities.
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared by LKA
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have
been condensed or omitted in accordance with such rules and regulations.  The information
furnished in the interim consolidated financial statements include normal recurring adjustments
and reflects all adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair
presentation of such financial statements.  Although management believes the disclosures and
information presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, it is suggested that
these interim consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with LKA's most recent
audited financial statements.  Operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31,
2016.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
NOTE 2 -       RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Related Party Debt – Office Space
LKA pays a company owned by an officer and shareholder $1,500 per month for office rent and
expenses.  The affiliated company (Abraham & Co., Inc. a FINRA member and registered
investment advisor) also executes LKA's securities transactions and manages its investment
portfolio.  LKA owed Abraham & Co. $24,000 and $15,000 as of June 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively.
Related Party Debt – Accounts and Wages Payable
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, LKA owes $0 and $309, respectively, for purchases
made on the personal credit card of LKA's President, Kye Abraham.  Additionally, LKA owed Kye
Abraham $100,757 and $75,757 in unpaid salary at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.
Convertible Debentures
On September 29, 2015, LKA issued two convertible debentures (Convertible Debentures), each
in the amount of $125,000, or a total of $250,000 to members of the Koski family, the Company's
largest shareholders.  Principal on the Convertible Debentures is due September 29, 2018. The
Convertible Debentures accrue interest at 7.5% and are convertible at any time into shares of
LKA common stock at $0.50 per share.  Interest is due on a semi-annual basis and LKA is
required to retain a reserve amount of the proceeds to pay the first two semi-annual interest
payments, which, if the Convertible Debentures are converted within one year, will be paid to the
Convertible Debenture holders. As such, LKA has designated $9,375 and $18,750 as restricted
cash at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, LKA paid $9,375 in interest payments on the
convertible debentures.
If any event of default occurs, the interest rate increases to 15% per annum and the conversion
rate shall be decreased to $0.25 per share. As a result of the potential variable conversion rate,
the conversion option embedded in this instrument is classified as a liability in accordance with
Accounting Series Codification Topic 815, "Derivatives and Hedging" (ASC 815) and LKA
recognized a debt discount of $250,000.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, LKA
recognized $624 of interest expense from the amortization of the debt discounts.
LKA incurred $12,500 in debt issuance costs on the convertible debenture issuance. The debt
issuance costs are being amortized over the three year term of the convertible debenture.  During
the six months ended June 30, 2016, LKA recognized $2,075 of interest expense from the
amortization of debt issuance costs.
6
NOTE 3 -       CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES
During October 2015, LKA issued a 7.5% convertible debenture for $50,000 in cash.  The
convertible debenture accrues interest at 7.5% per annum, is unsecured, due in three years from
the date of issuance and is convertible into shares of LKA common stock at any time at the option
of the holder at a rate of $0.50 per share. Interest is due in semi-annual payments and LKA is
required to maintain a reserve of proceeds equal to the first two semi-annual payments.  As such,
LKA has designated $1,875 and $3,750 as restricted cash at June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively.
LKA incurred $2,500 in debt issuance costs on the convertible debenture issuance. The debt
issuance costs are being amortized over the three year term of the convertible debenture.  During
the six months ended June 30, 2016, LKA recognized $415 of interest expense from the
amortization of debt issuance costs.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, LKA paid $1,875 in interest payments on the
convertible debenture.
During April 2016, LKA issued two $50,000 7.5% convertible debentures for $100,000 in cash. 
The convertible debentures accrue interest at 7.5% per annum, are unsecured, due in three years
from the dates of issuance and are convertible into shares of LKA common stock at any time at
the option of the holder at a rate of $0.50 per share. Interest is due in semi-annual payments and
LKA is required to maintain a reserve of proceeds equal to the first two semi-annual payments. 
As such, LKA has designated $7,500 as restricted cash at June 30, 2016.
LKA incurred $10,000 in debt issuance costs on the convertible debenture issuance. The debt
issuance costs were expensed during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
If any event of default occurs on any of the above mentioned convertible debentures, the interest
rate increases to 15% per annum and the conversion rate shall be decreased to $0.25 per share
for all of the convertible debentures. As a result of the potential variable conversion rate, the
conversion option embedded in this instrument is classified as a liability in accordance with ASC
Topic 815, "Derivatives and Hedging" (ASC 815) and LKA recognized a debt discount of
$149,369. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, LKA recognized $2,904 of interest
expense from the amortization of the debt discount.
NOTE 4 -       DERIVATIVE LIABILITY
LKA analyzed the conversion options embedded in the convertible notes payable and
convertible notes payable related party for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815
and determined that the instruments embedded in the above referenced convertible notes should
be classified as liabilities and recorded at fair value due to the potentially variable conversion
prices.
The fair value of the conversion options on convertible notes issued during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 was determined to be $133,150 as of the issuance date using a Black-Scholes
option-pricing model.   Upon the date of issuance of the Convertible Notes, $99,369 was
recorded as debt discount and $33,781 was recorded as day one loss on derivative
liability.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, $134,322 of loss was recorded on mark-to-
market of the conversion options, respectively.

interest rates between 0.73% - 0.96%, (2) lives of between 2.28 - 3.04 years, (3) expected
volatility between 213% - 229%, (4) zero expected dividends, (5) conversion prices as set forth in
the related instruments, and (6) the common stock price of the underlying share on the valuation
dates.
NOTE 5 -      COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Possible Environmental Remediation Liability
In 2002 the Federal Bureau of Land Management (the "BLM") advised LKA of its desire to extend
to the Ute-Ulay Property certain environmental clean-up ("remediation") activities that it is
conducting on neighboring properties that LKA does not own.  The BLM commissioned and
obtained three engineering evaluation and cost analysis ("EE/CA") studies/reports on the Ute-
Ulay and the neighboring public lands in 2002-2006.  These EE/CA studies analyzed the current
environmental state of the Ute-Ulay property and other properties in the area.  The studies
identified a large volume of mine tailings and metals loading of shallow ground water, with
elevated levels of arsenic, cadmium and lead being present.  The BLM's most recent study,
"Value Engineering Study on the Ute Ulay Mine/Mill Site – Final Report" dated January 5, 2006,
projected the costs of remediation and property stabilization on the Ute-Ulay property to be
approximately $2.1 million.  Based upon discussions with Hinsdale County, Colorado officials,
Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment Ute-Ulay project supervisor, the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency's (the "EPA") regional manager, and legal counsel, the actual
costs associated with this effort are expected to be approximately $1.2 million; substantially
below previous BLM estimates.  Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), the EPA may either require a property owner to
perform the necessary cleanup or the agencies may perform the work and seek recovery of costs
against the property owner and previous owners.  While it cannot be determined with absolute
certainty until the project is completed, LKA's status as a "de minimis" participant and the fact that
remediation activities are focused on property located largely outside of LKA's permitted
operating area, LKA management expects this project will have a negligible impact on the LKA's
financial condition.  Accordingly, pursuant to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and all
discussions with the above named agencies to date, LKA management believes it is unlikely
there will be a material impact to its financial statements and no liability for this project has been
recorded as of June 30, 2016. Actual completion of remediation work at the site was completed in
late 2013 by the EPA. The EPA has not yet issued its notice of final determination.
Wastewater Discharge Liability
During the fourth quarter of 2014, LKA received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the Colorado
Department of Health and Environment (CDPHE) for failure to meet certain requirements of the
Company's wastewater discharge permit. During 2015, the Company undertook all corrective
actions specified in the NOV, under CDPHE oversight, and believes it is in compliance with the
terms of its permit. LKA believes it is probable that that there will be a financial penalty assessed,
and that range will be between $75,000 and $150,000.  As a result, LKA has accrued a liability of
$75,000 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 since there is no better estimate of the
amount of loss within this range.
8
NOTE 6 -       GOING CONCERN
LKA's consolidated financial statements are prepared using Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets and
liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  However, LKA has recently
accumulated significant losses and has negative working capital.  All of these items raise
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  Management's plans with
respect to alleviating the adverse financial conditions that caused management to express
substantial doubt about the LKA's ability to continue as a going concern are as follows:
LKA is currently engaged in an intensive exploration program at the Golden Wonder mine with
the objective of returning the mine to a producing status. The exploration program, which began
in late 2008, has involved extensive exploratory mining and drilling for the purpose of identifying
possible new production zones within the mine and on the Company's adjacent property. During
this ongoing evaluation period, bulk sampling, through exploratory mining of high-grade
structures (extensions of the initial ore zone) has yielded over 4,900 ounces of gold resulting in
over $5.1 million in precious metals revenues. Revenues from this selective mining process have
largely funded LKA's exploration program to date. However, until LKA, either on its own or
through the efforts of its partners, can locate another ore body, no conclusion can be drawn about
the commercial viability of the mine.
In order to support continued exploration of the mine, LKA entered into an exploration and option
agreement with Kinross Gold, USA in July, 2015. Additionally, to support general operations, the
Company entered into financing transactions involving the sale of a limited number of convertible
debentures, mostly to existing shareholders, during the year ended December 31, 2015 and the
six months ended June 30, 2016. The Company expects to raise additional funding through
similar financings in the future. If LKA is not successful in the resumption of profitable mine
operations, either from commercial or exploratory mining, it may be forced to continue to raise
additional equity or debt financing to fund its ongoing obligations or risk ceasing doing business.
There can be no assurance that LKA will be able to achieve its business plans, raise any more
required capital or secure the financing necessary to achieve its current operating plan.  The
ability of LKA to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully
accomplish the plan described in the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable
operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Results of Operations
For The Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to The Three Months Ended June 30,
2015
During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not recognize any revenue.
Exploration expenses decreased $246,789, or approximately 96%, from $257,932 in the three
months ended June 30, 2015, to $11,143 in the three months ended June 30, 2016. The
decrease was mainly due to a decrease in contract labor resulting from the reduction of
exploratory mining operations in favor of a detailed geochemistry analysis and follow on drilling
program by the Company's exploration partner, Kinross Gold USA. A surface evaluation of the
Company's claims, conducted by Kinross geologists, has already identified at least three areas
(potential ore bodies) that possess characteristics remarkably similar to those found at the site of
the Golden Wonder's original, high-grade ore shoot. Drilling crews have been retained and
applications filed for permits to drill these targets from the surface. Drilling is expected to
commence during 2016.
Professional fees decreased by $16,107 during the three months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, or approximately 61%, mainly due to a
$13,000 reduction in consulting expenses in 2016 compared to 2015.
General and administrative expenses and officer salaries remained flat in the three months
ended June 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.
We incurred an operating loss of $98,421 during the three months ended June 30, 2016, as
compared to an operating loss of $361,314 in the three months ended June 30, 2015. The
$262,893, or approximately 73% decrease is mainly due to the decrease in mining activities
during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30,
2015.
We incurred total other expenses of $134,402 during the three months ended June 30, 2016, as
compared to $317 in the three months ended June 30, 2015. The $134,085, or approximately
42,298% increase is mainly due to the recognition of $112,297 in loss on derivatives compared
to no derivative loss for the comparable period. Interest expense increased to $22,105 during the
three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $317 in the three months ended June 30,
2015.  The increase is mainly due to the issuance of convertible debentures totaling $400,000
bearing interest at 7.5% per annum and the related debt discount and issuance costs.
Net loss totaled $232,823, or $0.01 per share, in the three months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to a net loss of $361,631, or $0.02 per share in the three months ended June 30, 2015.
10
For The Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to The Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, as a result of discontinuing exploratory mining
operations, we did not recognize any revenue, compared to $115,985 in revenue from gold sales
in the six months ended June 30, 2015
Exploration expenses decreased $544,829, or approximately 94%, from $581,798 in the six
months ended June 30, 2015, to $36,969 in the six months ended June 30, 2016. Again, the
decrease was mainly due to a decrease in contract labor attributed to mining operations.
Professional fees decreased by $14,858, or approximately 30%, mainly due to a $13,000
reduction in consulting expenses in 2016 compared to 2015.
General and administrative expenses decreased by $9,215, or approximately 12% in the six
months ended June 30, 2016, mainly due to decreased travel and business operations expense
due to a reduction of exploration mining activities.
We incurred an operating loss of $215,416 during the six months ended June 30, 2016, as
compared to an operating loss of $668,333 in the six months ended June 30, 2015. The
$452,917, or approximately 68%, decrease is mainly due to the $544,829 decrease in
exploration costs, partially offset by the $115,985 decrease in revenue during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015.
We incurred total other expenses of $197,828 during the six months ended June 30, 2016, as
compared to $786 in the six months ended June 30, 2015. The $197,042, or approximately
25,069% increase is mainly due to the recognition of $168,103 in loss on derivatives compared
to no derivative loss for the comparable period. Interest expense increased to $29,725 during the
three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $786 in the three months ended June 30,
2015.  The increase is mainly due to the issuance of convertible debentures totaling $400,000
bearing interest at 7.5% per annum and the related debt discount and issuance costs.
Net loss totaled $413,244, or $0.02 per share, in the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared
to a net loss of $669,119, or $0.03 per share, in the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Liquidity
Current assets at June 30, 2016 totaled $96,246.  As of that date, we had $72,126 in cash,
$18,750 in restricted cash, $4,375 in prepaid expenses and $995 in accounts receivable, as
compared to $150,068 in cash, $22,500 in restricted cash and $995 in accounts receivable at
December 31, 2015.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, our operating activities used net cash of $171,692,
compared to $467,684 in the comparable 2015 period. Investing activities provided cash of
$3,750 during the period ended June 30, 2016, compared to using cash of $38,055 for the
purchase of fixed assets in the 2015 period.  Financing activities provided $90,000 in cash during
the six months ended June 30, 2016 from the issuance of two convertible debentures compared
to $0 in the comparable 2015 period.
At June 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $700,261, as compared to
$333,340 at December 31, 2015.
Focus Shift
LKA has temporarily shifted its focus from exploratory mining if favor of a more cost effective
surface drilling program to locate additional high-grade ore zones on the Company's mining
claims. The current surface evaluation and anticipated drilling program, to be conducted by the
Company's exploration partner, Kinross Gold, USA, follows up the Company's underground
drilling and 3-D mapping program, conducted in 2014-2015. LKA expects to resume mining
operations when and if new high-grade ore zones are identified.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-
15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  In
addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  The design of any disclosure
controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions.
Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as
of June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as the Company
lacks appropriate segregation of duties and has an insufficient number of employees responsible
for the accounting and financial reporting functions.  A controls system cannot provide absolute
assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
within a company have been detected.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting
Our management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
has concluded that there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
