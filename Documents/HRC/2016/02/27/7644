<p><i>Summary 
</i>In its resolution 21/5, the Human Rights Council welcomed the report of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General on the contribution of the United Nations system as a whole to the 
advancement of the human rights agenda and the dissemination and implementation of the 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1). The 
Council requested the Secretary-General to report to the Human Rights Council at its 
twenty-sixth session on the challenges, strategies and developments with regard to the 
implementation of the resolution by the United Nations system, including programmes, 
funds and agencies, and to make concrete recommendations for action. 
</p>
<p>The present report identifies developments, progress and challenges in advancing 
the business and human rights agenda within the United Nations system. The report finds 
that further action is needed to embed the Guiding Principles in the strategic coordination 
mechanisms of the United Nations system, which requires top-level buy-in and advocacy. 
The report also presents the conclusions from a study carried out by the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the feasibility of a global fund to 
enhance the capacity of stakeholders to implement the Guiding Principles. One finding of 
the study is that there is strong support for such a fund among a broad range of 
stakeholders; however, perspectives differ on the most desirable mandate, governance 
model and sources of funding.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The unanimous endorsement of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights by the Human Rights Council in June 2011 in its resolution 17/4 (hereinafter, the 
Guiding Principles) represented a milestone in the global effort to close governance gaps 
between the scope and impact of economic actors and the capacity of society to manage 
their adverse consequences.1  
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 17/4, the Council requested the Secretary-General to prepare a 
report on how the United Nations system as a whole can contribute to the advancement of 
the business and human rights agenda and the dissemination and implementation of the 
Guiding Principles. In the report (A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1), the Secretary-General 
considered how the business and human rights agenda, and particularly the Guiding 
Principles, could be effectively integrated in United Nations programmes and activities, 
including by embedding the issue in existing system-wide coordination and policy 
structures, and by building the necessary capacity of all actors on the issue of business and 
human rights.  
</p>
<p>3. In the report, it was found that the sheer scale of the business and human rights 
agenda requires concerted efforts from a variety of stakeholders, including coordinated 
efforts by the United Nations system as a whole (A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, para. 92). To 
that end, the report recommended that the business and human rights agenda should be 
embedded throughout the United Nations system at the strategic policy level.  
</p>
<p>4. The Council, in its resolution 21/5, welcomed the report of the Secretary-General 
and underscored the need to adopt a coordinated strategic approach to ensure the integration 
of the business and human rights agenda, particularly the Guiding Principles, into all 
relevant aspects of the work of the United Nations system, and recognized the role of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, her Office, and existing system-
wide policy and coordination mechanisms, in that effort. 
</p>
<p>5. In the same resolution, the Council encouraged all relevant entities of the United 
Nations system to integrate the business and human rights agenda into their activities 
consistent with their respective mandates, including through capacity-building efforts 
directed at all stakeholder groups. The Council also recommended that relevant United 
Nations entities apply the Guiding Principles when formulating and implementing internal 
policies and procedures, including in investment management, procurement and 
partnerships with the business sector, taking into account the recommendations in the 
Secretary-General&#8217;s report. 
</p>
<p>6. The Council requested the Secretary-General to report to the Council at its twenty-
sixth session on the challenges, strategies and developments with regard to the 
implementation of its resolution 21/5 by the United Nations system, including programmes, 
funds and agencies, and to make concrete recommendations for action. The present report is 
prepared pursuant to that request.2  
</p>
<p>7. The first part of the present report examines progress and challenges with respect to 
embedding the Guiding Principles into key coordination mechanisms and processes, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The Guiding Principles are contained in the annex to document A/HRC/17/31.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 A request for input was sent to all United Nations agencies, funds and specialized programmes. All 
</p>
<p>Member States were also invited to submit any information they wished to provide in relation to the 
contribution of the United Nations system to the business and human rights agenda.  </p>


<p>specifically in relation to development coordination, alignment of policies and procedures, 
and the post-2015 development framework. 
</p>
<p>8. A key finding in the 2012 report of the Secretary-General was that the lack of 
capacity of stakeholders at all levels is a significant obstacle to advancing the business and 
human rights agenda and implementing the Guiding Principles (A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, 
para. 62). In its resolution 21/5, the Council requested the Secretary-General to undertake a 
study of the feasibility of establishing a global fund to enhance the capacity of stakeholders 
to implement the business and human rights agenda. The second part of the present report 
presents the findings and recommendations from that study. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background and context  
</b></p>
<p>9. The Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights do not create any new legal 
obligations. Instead, they clarify and elaborate on the implications of existing standards, 
including the obligations of States under international human rights law with respect to 
preventing, mitigating and remediating adverse human rights impacts related to business 
activities. The Guiding Principles comprise three pillars: the State duty to protect human 
rights against infringements of human rights by third parties, including business enterprises; 
the corporate responsibility to respect human rights; and access to effective remedy for 
victims of business-related human rights abuses.  
</p>
<p>10. The Guiding Principles must be implemented comprehensively by both States and 
business enterprises in order to be given proper effect. That requires dedicated efforts at the 
level of individual States and business enterprises, appropriate to their particular 
circumstances. However, other international and domestic actors also have important roles 
in supporting implementation through awareness-raising, capacity-building, advocacy, tools 
development, and standard and policy development in line with the Guiding Principles and 
in accordance with their respective mandates. International and regional organizations 
involved in standard-setting in areas such as trade, investment, development, corporate 
transparency and reporting have particularly important roles to play. 
</p>
<p>11. Human rights, together with development and peace and security, form one of the 
three pillars of the United Nations and, as stated by the Secretary-General, the United 
Nations must play its part, together with other actors, in bridging the gaps between the 
scope and impact of economic actors and the capacity of societies to manage their adverse 
impacts (A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, para. 1). Many of the entities, agencies, funds and 
specialized programmes of the United Nations either work directly with business 
enterprises or in ways that impact the activities of economic actors. Increasingly, business 
is also seen as a partner in tackling global development challenges.  
</p>
<p>12. When the Council endorsed the Guiding Principles in its resolution 17/4, it also 
decided to establish the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises, consisting of five independent experts. The 
Working Group has engaged in outreach to United Nations entities, international and 
regional organizations, States, business organizations, civil society, trade unions, national 
human rights institutions and other actors to disseminate and advocate for the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles.3 The Working Group has also engaged in 
projects with international and local partners to advance the business and human rights 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 See reports of the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and 
</p>
<p>other business enterprises, available from www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Business/Pages/Reports.aspx. </p>


<p>agenda.4 However, the scale of the challenge of implementing the Guiding Principles 
globally is such that it requires coordinated action by all actors, including the United 
Nations system as a whole. The Working Group&#8217;s mandate encourages coordination and 
cooperation with entities in the United Nations systems and other international, regional 
and domestic actors in efforts to build capacity and disseminate the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Convergence of international standards and processes 
</b>13. The unanimous endorsement of the Guiding Principles by the Council and the broad 
support for them from all stakeholder groups, including States, regional and international 
organizations, business enterprises and business organizations, and many civil society 
organizations globally, have established them as a common platform for accountability and 
progress. Global convergence of international standards and processes around the Guiding 
Principles and their core concepts helps to clarify, simplify and reinforce implementation 
by both States and business enterprises.  
</p>
<p>14. It is encouraging to note that, three years after their endorsement by the Council, 
there has been significant convergence around the Guiding Principles at the international 
and regional level (see A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1).5 Efforts to implement the Guiding 
Principles are also being made by international business organizations and individual 
businesses, national human rights institutions, trade unions, civil society and other actors, 
examples of which have been discussed at the two first annual Forums on Business and 
Human Rights.6 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Embedding the business and human rights agenda  
in the United Nations system 
</b></p>
<p>15. Within the United Nations, significant activities to embed the Guiding Principles 
have taken place. As has previously been reported (A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, paras. 13 and 
14), the corporate responsibility to respect human rights as set out in the Guiding Principles 
has been incorporated into the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of 
Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security of the 
Committee on World Food Security, and the revised Sustainability Framework of the 
International Finance Corporation. 
</p>
<p>16. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), 
as the focal point within the United Nations system for advancing the business and human 
rights agenda, has a specific role to support the implementation and dissemination of the 
Guiding Principles, as well as to provide guidance and advice on the interpretation of the 
Guiding Principles to all stakeholders, in collaboration with the Working Group. OHCHR

<p>continues to provide substantive and administrative support to the Working Group, and 
collaborates closely with the Working Group in its own programme on business and human 
rights to ensure the complementarity of efforts and avoid duplication. 
</p>
<p>17. The previous report of the Secretary-General found that the issue of business and 
human rights is not yet part of mainstream United Nations operations, not even within the 
human rights system itself. The report recommended that the Guiding Principles should be 
embedded, where appropriate, in the policy-setting agenda of the Chief Executives Board 
for Coordination and its subsidiary bodies (A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, paras. 28 and 29).  
</p><p>18. In the intervening period, OHCHR has advocated for the integration of the business 
and human rights agenda into key Office-wide efforts, in particular related to the 
sustainable development agenda. OHCHR also organized a high-level panel at the Council 
with representatives from United Nations agencies, funds and specialized programmes, to 
discuss the role of the United Nations system in advancing the business and human rights 
agenda in the context of the post-2015 sustainable development goals. However, owing to 
significant capacity constraints, the efforts have not succeeded in achieving effective and 
appropriate integration of the Guiding Principles and the business and human right agenda 
into key coordination mechanisms. Further work by OHCHR is needed, in particular on 
including the Guiding Principles as a theme in the human rights mainstreaming 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Dissemination and capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>19. OHCHR has continued its efforts to build capacity on the business and human rights 
agenda both within the United Nations system and with external actors. In 2013, OHCHR 
launched an online training tool on the principles for responsible contracts, which were 
addended to the Guiding Principles (A/HRC/17/31/Add.3, annex) and provide practical 
guidance to negotiators of State-investor contracts. OHCHR has also developed a 
comprehensive training package on the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, 
together with a publication that provides introductory guidance to stakeholders through 
responses to &#8220;frequently asked questions&#8221;, which will be launched in 2014. Those efforts 
follow the publication of a booklet containing the text of the Guiding Principles and the 
OHCHR Interpretative Guide on the Corporate Responsibility to Respect Human Rights,7 
which are in high demand by all stakeholders seeking to understand and implement the 
Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p>20. Increasing capacity and interest are also seen at the country level, where several 
OHCHR country offices monitor and address the human rights impacts of business 
activities. OHCHR has also undertaken capacity-building at the country level with 
government officials and other stakeholders upon request. Following observations from 
field offices and a review of global trends in the human rights landscape, the issue of 
human rights in the economic sphere, which includes business and human rights, has been 
selected as one of six thematic strategies for OHCHR for the 2014&#8211;2017 cycle.  
</p>
<p>21. The Office also continues to work closely with the Global Compact, including by 
participating in the secretariat of the Global Compact&#8217;s Human Rights and Labour Working 
Group.8

<p>22. The Global Compact, which is the main platform of the United Nations for engaging 
the business sector, has undertaken significant capacity-building activities through 
webinars, outreach with local networks and the creation of tools. In 2013, the Global 
Compact, in collaboration with OHCHR, revised their joint business learning tool on 
human rights to align it with the Guiding Principles. The Global Compact has continued to 
expand and build on its Human Rights and Business Dilemmas Forum, which is designed 
to stimulate discussion about how to manage challenging human issues to respect and 
support human rights.9 In collaboration with other agencies, it has also continued to put 
together guidance for business enterprises on specific aspects of human rights, including 
human rights of women, children, and indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>23. The Global Compact local networks provide a platform for direct engagement with 
the business sector. Through the local networks, the Global Compact has supported the 
capacity-building of local business enterprises and other stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>24. Other United Nations entities are also undertaking significant capacity-building 
efforts related to their specific mandates. The United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP) Finance Initiative provides guidance to business enterprises in the financial sector 
on their social and environmental responsibilities, including on human rights. The 
Principles for Responsible Investment also provides a platform for building the capacity of 
business enterprises in the financial sector.  
</p>
<p>25. The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) has developed tools and worked on 
capacity-building for States and business enterprises in the area of respecting and 
supporting children&#8217;s rights. In 2013, UNICEF piloted a project with 45 companies and 22 
consultancies to review and begin implementing the Children&#8217;s Rights and Business 
Principles, which in important respects are aligned with the Guiding Principles; it also held 
workshops on children&#8217;s rights and business with more than 50 transnational enterprises 
and 30 international consultancies. UNICEF has also worked to build capacity internally, 
having trained more than 300 staff members globally in corporate social responsibility. The 
designated Corporate Social Responsibility Unit works to raise the profile of children&#8217;s 
rights and business at headquarters level and to support national committees and county 
offices in related activities and engagements. 
</p>
<p>26. However, despite these and other significant activities to build capacity within and 
outside the United Nations system, it is clear that the scale of the efforts made and 
resources available are still insufficient to meet the challenge of implementing the Guiding 
Principles globally. To that end, the possibility of establishing a global fund for enhancing 
the capacity of stakeholders to implement the Guiding Principles is discussed below. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Integrating the Guiding Principles: specific areas of work 
within the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human rights system 
</b></p>
<p>27. OHCHR can play a central role in the implementation of the business and human 
rights agenda and taking appropriate action to support the embedding and integration of the 
Guiding Principles into relevant focus areas of the United Nations system coordinating 
mechanisms (A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, para. 31). OHCHR also has a key role in promoting 
a coherent and consistent understanding of the Guiding Principles through its engagement 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9
 For more information on the forum, see http://human-rights.unglobalcompact.org/. </p>


<p>in a number of processes within and outside the United Nations system to embed respect for 
human rights by business into guidelines and policy documents, and by providing advice on 
interpreting the Guiding Principles in response to requests from stakeholders. However, 
enhanced efforts are still needed in order to provide uniform and clear guidance on 
implementing the Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p>28. In an effort to advance more effective implementation of the Guiding Principles in 
ensuring access to judicial remedy for victims of gross human rights abuses related to 
business, OHCHR in 2014 launched a multi-stakeholder consultative process to provide 
further conceptual and normative clarity on key issues and challenges related to access to 
judicial remedy, focusing in particular on the criminal law system.10 
</p><p>29. OHCHR and the Working Group have engaged with United Nations treaty bodies to 
promote the Guiding Principles. In April 2013, the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
issued its general comment No. 16 (2013) on State obligations regarding the impact of the 
business sector on children&#8217;s rights. Other treaty bodies have also elaborated on the 
implications of the State duty to protect human rights in the context of business activities in 
observations on State parties&#8217; reports. The Working Group is currently collaborating with 
selected treaty bodies to further the understanding of how the Guiding Principles can be a 
tool for treaty bodies in the systematic and comprehensive collection and analysis of 
information on business and human rights in State party reporting and concluding 
observations, consistent with their respective mandates. 
</p>
<p>30. In addition to the Working Group and its specific mandate on the Guiding 
Principles, other special procedures mandate-holders are increasingly also integrating the 
Guiding Principles in their specific analyses of situations at the international or country 
level and in thematic areas. Relevant mandate holders are also increasingly issuing 
communications to States, and in some instances to business enterprises, on situations that 
involve the impacts of business on human rights. These efforts both support the 
identification of specific challenges faced by States and business in different operational 
contexts, in relation to particular issues or particular groups, and provide a means through 
which States and business enterprises can be made aware of their respective obligations and 
responsibilities.11 
</p>
<p>31. The Working Group has undertaken efforts to explore how the universal periodic 
review could take into account the business and human rights agenda, and has also initiated 
a project on national action plans and other strategies at the State level to implement the 
Guiding Principles.12 Information on State implementation of national action plans in 
relation to specific State obligations to protect, respect and fulfil human rights could be 
taken up by stakeholders in the context of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> B. United Nations system in general 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Secretary-General has recognized that greater attention to human rights in the 
United Nations system offers opportunities for integrating the business and human rights 
agenda, and in particular the Guiding Principles, into existing platforms and activities 
(A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, para. 38). Concerted efforts are required for that to be achieved, 
and the Secretary-General is confident that his intention to enhance the United Nations 
partnership capacity would be a big step towards this goal, as it would use the Guiding

<p>Principles as one key element in helping achieve greater accountability, coherence and 
scale &#8211; both globally and at the country level. The Secretary-General is encouraged that 
significant activities to integrate the business and human rights agenda have taken place 
within individual entities with respect to specific aspects of business impacts on human 
rights. A non-exhaustive sample is provided below.  
</p>
<p>33. In 2013, the Global Compact launched a reference guide to the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,13 which also reflects the responsibility to 
respect human rights as set out in the Guiding Principles. In its strategy for 2014&#8211;2016, the 
Global Compact focuses on four priorities: participant engagement, local networks, a global 
portfolio of issues and responsible business in support of United Nations goals and issues. 
These focus areas offer important opportunities for building business capacity on human 
rights.14  
</p>
<p>34. To further the alignment of government legislation, regulations, policies, plans and 
programmes with international standards on children&#8217;s rights and business, UNICEF has 
contributed to the drafting and adoption of official guidance on the subject. UNICEF 
supports the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and plays an important role 
in disseminating and raising awareness around the Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 16. 
UNICEF is in the process of developing technical implementation tools on children&#8217;s rights 
and business for national Governments and a fact sheet on children&#8217;s rights and business for 
national human rights institutions.  
</p>
<p>35. In collaboration with the Global Compact, the United Nations Entity for Gender 
Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) supports the Women&#8217;s 
Empowerment Principles, which offer a platform for business to contribute to the 
advancement of women in the workplace, the marketplace and the community.15 While the 
Women&#8217;s Empowerment Principles were developed for business enterprises, they also 
provide a tool and platform for other stakeholders in their engagement with business.  
</p>
<p>36. UNEP is working on an environment, social and economic sustainability framework, 
which will set minimum standards for sustainability for UNEP and its implementing 
partners, with a view to identifying and managing environmental, social and economic 
issues. The Guiding Principles could be considered along with other relevant principles and 
guidance documents in the process to review the draft.  
</p>
<p>37. UNEP has also initiated a project within the UNEP Finance Initiative, a partnership 
with some 200 financial institutions, to draw up a report to throw more light on situations 
where banks, through their lending or investment activities, can cause, create or have links 
to adverse human rights impacts. The report is expected in 2014. The UNEP Finance 
Initiative has further developed an online human rights guidance tool for the financial 
sector and a briefing for leaders of financial institutions.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Activities at the country level 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Secretary-General has recognized that United Nations resident coordinators and 
country teams can play a strategically crucial role in promoting dialogue among 
Governments, business enterprises and civil society, and by promoting human rights due

or communities are considered, providing technical assistance and supporting relevant 
research (A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, para. 42). The Secretary-General has recommended 
that resident coordinators  take the lead at the national level, in collaboration with OHCHR 
where possible, to integrate the Guiding Principles into relevant activities (ibid., para. 43). 
</p><p>39. In that respect, the Secretary-General notes that some country teams have taken up 
the business and human rights agenda and integrated the Guiding Principles or elements 
thereof into their work, specifically in the context of policies relating to development of the 
extractive industries and potentially adverse impacts associated with that sector. However, a 
coordinated strategy for ensuring that resident coordinators and country teams integrate the 
business and human rights agenda in their work is still lacking and, in its absence, 
integration at the country level still appears to be fragmented. It would be helpful for 
human rights advisers deployed at the request of resident coordinators to receive targeted 
training in business and human rights. However, further coordinated action at the executive 
level of the United Nations will also be needed. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Trade and investment 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Guiding Principles can help to ensure that business-focused trade and 
investment policies and standards contribute to, and do not result in advance impacts on, 
human rights. The former Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of 
human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises recognized in 
particular the issue of State-investor contracts as a key potential lever to identify, prevent 
and mitigate adverse human rights impacts (see A/HRC/17/31/Add.3, annex). 
</p><p>41. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) can 
advance the business and human right agenda by ensuring integration of the Guiding 
Principles into policy guidance and capacity-building efforts. For example, in 2013, 
UNCTAD organized a conference on corporate social responsibility for business 
participants, in which the Guiding Principles were featured.  
</p>
<p>42. Within the United Nations system, the United Nations Commission on International 
Trade Law (UNCITRAL) has a mandate to develop rules and regulations governing 
international trade, in collaboration with the World Trade Organization. UNCITRAL offers 
an important entry point for integrating the Guiding Principles. UNCITRAL also has 
significant technical expertise on the issue of corporate and trade law, and would be well 
placed to take the lead on examining how the Guiding Principles are implemented by States 
through law-making at national levels. UNCITRAL could support activities of the Working 
Group on business and human rights on the issue of State legislative implementation, in the 
context of the Working Group&#8217;s activities on State national action plans for the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles. That could help close a significant information 
gap on the level of implementation of the Guiding Principles, and support capacity-building 
with States.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Labour 
</b></p>
<p>43. The International Labour Organization (ILO) continues to contribute to the 
implementation of all three pillars of the Guiding Principles as part of its specific mandate 
within the United Nations system, drawing on its tripartite structure and standard-setting 
and supervisory machinery. ILO continues to provide technical support on the protection of 
workers&#8217; rights and sustainable enterprise development to its tripartite constituents in its 
member States. It also builds the capacity of employers&#8217; and workers&#8217; organizations on a </p>


<p>large range of issues relevant to the business and human rights agenda, which include rights 
at work, social dialogue and collective bargaining, and occupational safety and health.  
</p>
<p>44. Through its Helpdesk for Business on International Labour Standards, ILO provides 
information and tools for managers and workers interested in aligning corporate policies 
and practices with international standards, including the ILO Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work. An updated leaflet issued by the ILO Helpdesk refers to the 
Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p>45. A particularly noteworthy ILO intervention involves Bangladesh, where ILO 
facilitated a tripartite action plan on fire safety for the ready-made garment sector. Early in 
2014 the ILO-International Finance Corporation Better Work Programme was also 
launched in Bangladesh.  
</p>
<p>46. Collaboration between ILO and human rights mechanisms, including OHCHR, 
could be further strengthened to ensure alignment and bring clarity to the relationship 
between the Guiding Principles and national legislation and ratified ILO conventions. 
Further collaboration at the country level to reinforce capacity could also be explored. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Development 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Secretary-General has previously recommended that the United Nations 
Development Group should take the lead in advancing integration of the Guiding Principles 
into global development efforts, through the human rights mainstreaming mechanism 
(A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, para. 46).  
</p><p>48. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) already supports States in 
their efforts to ground national development programmes and policies in human rights, in 
particular by focusing on the principles of non-discrimination, participation and 
accountability and collaborating with national human rights institutions. There is, however, 
a need to explicitly integrate the business and human rights agenda into UNDP activities 
designed to foster economic growth and private-sector development, to prevent and 
mitigate potential negative impacts. 
</p>
<p>49. In that respect, current work in UNDP to mainstream human rights provides 
important channels for the integration of the Guiding Principles. For example, the 
Programme and Operations Policy and Procedure require that all prospective private-sector 
partners undergo environmental, social and governance screening, using the UNDP risk 
assessment tool, which includes criteria relating to the rights of indigenous peoples. 
Furthermore, in 2013, UNDP launched the Global Initiative for Extractive Industries for 
Sustainable Development. Through the initiative, UNDP will support capacity-development 
for national governance of extractive industries through, inter alia, facilitating and 
convening dialogues on extraction with affected populations, especially indigenous peoples, 
the private sector and Governments. That offers an important entry point for the Guiding 
Principles. 
</p>
<p>50. The World Bank, and its private-sector lending arm, the International Finance 
Corporation, provide other important avenues for advancing the business and human rights 
agenda. The Corporation has already incorporated elements of the Guiding Principles into 
its social and environmental Sustainability Framework. The current review of the World 
Bank&#8217;s social safeguard policies offers an opportunity for integrating key elements of the 
Guiding Principles to prevent and mitigate the risk of negative human rights impacts in 
relation to the Bank&#8217;s lending activities.  </p>


<p><b> G. Humanitarian action 
</b></p>
<p>51. As previously recognized by the Secretary-General, non-State actors, including 
business enterprises, are increasingly involved in post-conflict or disaster construction work 
and integration of the Guiding Principles is therefore relevant to ensure coherence and 
reduce risk of adverse human rights impacts (A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, para. 56). Private-
sector accountability for adverse human rights impacts in situations of conflict, occupation 
or emergency is essential in all cases. The business and human rights agenda is also 
relevant in the context of the development of economic activities aimed at income-
generation for people living in long-term refugee situations. In that context, the Guiding 
Principles should be integrated into relevant partnerships and programmes, including 
through collaboration between the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and 
OHCHR, as relevant. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Aligning United Nations policies and procedures with the 
Guiding Principles 
</b>52. The 2012 report of the Secretary-General noted that like any other organization 
conducting commercial transactions or engaging in partnerships with business enterprises, 
the Guiding Principles should apply to the internal policies and procedures of the United 
Nations, and should be implemented effectively (A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, para. 75). The 
Secretary-General further noted that internal alignment should focus on the responsibility to 
avoid contributing to human rights abuses, or being involved with such abuses through 
relationships with business entities.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Investment management 
</b></p>
<p>53. As noted in the report of the Secretary-General in 2012, the United Nations Joint 
Staff Pension Fund has committed to integrating the ten Global Compact principles in its 
activities and is a member of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment 
(A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, paras. 80 and 81). However, its risk management policy for 
investments does not currently consider human rights or environmental and social risks. 
</p>
<p>54. OHCHR has confirmed that the Guiding Principles apply to financial institutions, 
including private and public institutions engaged in investments and asset management.16 A 
number of good practices exist in this regard, such as exclusion lists for certain high-risk 
activities and industries, undertaking due diligence prior to investments and exercising 
active ownership. Alignment with the Guiding Principles would help to avoid and mitigate 
human rights risks from investment activities and avoid any reputational risks from 
investments entered into in the name of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Procurement 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Procurement Division of the United Nations has undertaken initiatives to 
promote sustainability in procurements, including by raising awareness of the Global

<p>Compact and developing a non-binding Supplier Code of Conduct.17 The Code of Conduct 
references human rights; it does not, however, reference the expected standard of conduct 
of the Guiding Principles, which includes undertaking human rights due diligence and 
addressing adverse human rights impacts. As noted in the 2012 report of the Secretary-
General, a revision of the Supplier Code of Conduct to reflect the Guiding Principles would 
be beneficial in this regard (A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, para. 84).  
</p><p>56. Other United Nations entities, however, also procure goods and services. For 
example, the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) is a central resource for 
the United Nations system for procurement and contracts management and procures for 
both United Nations agencies and external partners. While it uses the non-binding Supplier 
Code of Conduct, it also states explicitly that it &#8220;does business only with those vendors 
sharing its respect for fundamental human rights, social justice, human dignity and equal 
rights of men and women, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.18 That practice 
could be emulated by other agencies involved in procurement activities, where relevant. 
</p>
<p>57. Within private-sector enterprises and a number of State procurement divisions, 
binding codes of conduct for suppliers are now the standard. It would be beneficial for the 
United Nations Office for Partnerships to investigate the extent to which the current code of 
conduct reflects general best practices with regard to managing human rights risks from 
business relationships, and make recommendations to the Secretary-General for possible 
future revisions.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Partnerships 
</b></p>
<p>58. The United Nations is increasingly engaging in partnerships with business 
enterprises for the promotion of the goals and values of the United Nations. That provides 
important opportunities for promoting corporate respect for human rights, but also increases 
the risk of being linked to actors potentially involved in human rights abuses 
(A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, paras. 88 and 90). 
</p><p>59. The Secretary-General&#8217;s intent to enhance the United Nations partnership capacity 
arose from this new reality. The aim is to achieve greater accountability, coherence, 
efficiency and scale, and a more supportive enabling environment for United Nations 
partnership activity. The Guiding Principles would contribute to building a normative 
framework, including, for example, in the updating of guidelines on partnerships, between 
the United Nations and business.  
</p>
<p>60. The Global Compact serves as a key entry point for the engagement of business with 
the United Nations. The Secretary-General notes with appreciation the Global Compact&#8217;s 
efforts to use the annual meetings of Private Sector Focal Points in order to spread 
awareness of the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Capacity-building of relevant actors &#8212; the feasibility of a 
global capacity-building fund on business and human rights  
</b></p>
<p>61. The Secretary-General&#8217;s 2012 report suggested that the need to create a significant 
capacity and funding base to enable large-scale interventions in the area of business and

<p>human rights would require the involvement and support of stakeholders outside the United 
Nations (A/HRC/21/21 and Corr.1, para. 74). The Secretary-General recommended (ibid., 
para. 101) that, given the scale of the implementation challenge and the resource 
implications of meeting it:  
</p>
<p>The feasibility of establishing a global fund on business and human rights linked to 
the United Nations, with multi-stakeholder engagement, should be considered. The 
primary purpose of such a fund would be, both within and outside of the United 
Nations system, to enhance the capacity of stakeholders seeking to advance the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p>62. In response to the request from the Council in its resolution 21/5, the Secretary-
General undertook feasibility study, the full version of which is contained in an addendum 
to the present report, with the aim of advancing multi-stakeholder dialogue and action 
concerning a new fund in the area of business and human rights. The main findings from 
the study are presented below. 
</p>
<p>63. The study reviews a variety of existing United Nations funds in the area of human 
rights, including voluntary funds that focus on providing financial support to civil society 
actors who assist victims of human rights violations, voluntary funds to support OHCHR 
activities at Headquarters and in the field, and other funds, including the Special Fund 
established by the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. All funds administered by OHCHR are 
governed in accordance with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations and 
may receive voluntary contributions from Governments, intergovernmental and non-
governmental organizations and other private or public entities.19  
</p>
<p>64. The study also examines other funds managed by other United Nations entities, for 
example the United Nations Democracy Fund, established to strengthen the voice of civil 
society, promote human rights and encourage participation in democratic processes. 
Another model is provided by the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund, which provides 
resources to the United Nations Secretariat and agencies for the implementation of projects 
developed in identified priority countries.  
</p>
<p>65. The experience of these and other United Nations trust funds should inform further 
dialogue amongst Member States and other actors concerning the potential for a new 
dedicated fund to advance implementation of the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p>66. In addition to established voluntary trust fund mechanisms, the United Nations has 
continued to expand the reach and impact of its work through the creation of new public-
private partnerships aimed at advancing key international objectives, for example, in the 
area of public health with the establishment of funds such as the Global Fund to Fight 
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization. 
Those approaches should also be considered. 
</p>
<p>67. Based on informal consultations, written inputs20 and a formal consultation during 
the second annual Forum on Business and Human Rights in December 2013, the study 
finds that there is broad support from all stakeholder groups for the proposal that a new 
fund in the area of business and human rights would be a potentially useful mechanism. 
However, there is also a diversity of views concerning potential priorities and governance 
</p>
<p>

 A summary of all voluntary funds administered by OHCHR is available from:

</p>

<p>arrangements, which will require careful consideration and further dialogue involving all 
stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>68. Most stakeholders who participated in the consultation process favour a mandate 
that would support a broad range of capacity-building activities at local, national and 
international levels across all stakeholder groups.  
</p>
<p>69. With respect to the types of activities such a fund could support, nearly all 
submissions noted the value of awareness-raising and training activities on the Guiding 
Principles for different stakeholder. However, there was less agreement on other issues, 
including: whether the mandate of the fund should be broadly focused on all three pillars of 
the Guiding Principles or whether it should be focused on one particular pillar or issue; 
whether it should primarily support projects, including ongoing projects of the Working 
Group, or whether it should also support dissemination of documents in multiple languages 
and the participation of a broader range of stakeholders in United Nations meetings related 
to business and human rights; and whether it should support one-off activities or focus 
exclusively on projects that are replicable and could be scaled up in the future. 
</p><p>70. With respect to the aim of mainstreaming the Guiding Principles throughout the 
United Nations system, most submissions noted that, while OHCHR and other United 
Nations actors would be critical partners in ensuring the effective implementation of a fund 
in the area, priority should not be given to building the capacity of the United Nations, as 
that could draw resources away from other actors with limited ability to access funding 
through other means. It was noted, however, that a fund should facilitate the engagement of 
United Nations country teams and all other components of the United Nations system in 
capacity-building efforts relating to business and human rights, especially in developing 
countries.  
</p>
<p>71. Stakeholder views concerning the most effective and appropriate governance 
mechanism for a proposed new fund varied considerably. A majority of submissions 
indicated that OHCHR should be a key actor in administering a fund in this area. Some 
stakeholders also stated that the Working Group should play a central role in shaping a 
fund&#8217;s strategic approach. Several submissions also stressed the importance of ensuring an 
efficient governance structure and limiting administrative costs. 
</p>
<p>72. There is less agreement among stakeholders concerning the extent to which a fund in 
this area should follow established United Nations voluntary trust fund models. Some 
submissions indicated that multi-stakeholder governance, with special emphasis on the 
participation of business in decision-making, was of importance in engaging a significant 
number of businesses as financial contributors to a fund and ensuring its long-term impact. 
It was suggested, for example, that a multi-stakeholder advisory board could be established 
to provide overall strategic guidance, but it should not have authority for decision-making 
on individual projects to be supported or in matters relating to who can contribute or benefit 
from funding. Others proposed a &#8220;board of trustees&#8221; model based on established OHCHR-
administered voluntary trust funds. 
</p>
<p>73. With respect to monitoring and evaluation, in some submissions, it was suggested 
that grants could potentially be effectively administered and evaluated through existing 
United Nations agencies, including at national level, in order to minimize overhead costs. It 
was also suggested that an external evaluation of a fund after five years of operations 
should be planned from the outset. 
</p>
<p>74. On the subject of funding sources, stakeholders in their submissions were largely in 
agreement that a new fund in the area should be able to accept financial contributions from 
any actor, including States, businesses, philanthropic organizations and individuals. The 
importance of ensuring full transparency of donors and allocation of resources to individual </p>


<p>projects was also widely highlighted as being key to establishing and maintaining a fund&#8217;s 
legitimacy and independence.  
</p>
<p>75. Several different funding governance models were suggested. To avoid potential 
conflicts of interest involving individual donors, some stakeholders favoured a model 
whereby governance and resource allocation would be completely independent from donors 
to a fund. Other stakeholders suggested that involving donors more directly was necessary, 
both to attract donations, in particular from the private sector, and to ensure effective 
decision-making and long-term impact. Some suggested that all contributions should be 
non-earmarked to prevent the necessity of limiting the percentage of overall funding from 
any individual donor. Others suggested that further consideration should be given to the 
possibility of earmarked funding given the potential for attracting more donors to specific 
aspects of a fund&#8217;s mandated activities. 
</p>
<p>76. With respect to the issue of donors providing resources for a fund in addition to their 
commitments in other areas, some stakeholders suggested that competition for limited 
resources was inevitable and therefore not a matter for further discussion. Others proposed 
that more consultation was needed in order to determine the extent to which significant 
additional financial resources could be secured to support a new fund. From that viewpoint, 
it was stressed that resources for a fund focused on the implementation of the Guiding 
Principles should not jeopardize the maintenance of existing funding levels for ongoing 
human rights activities in other areas. The diversity of views of stakeholders on that issue 
indicates that more consultation is needed to clarify outstanding questions relating to 
funding sources.  
</p>
<p>77. As the Council moves forward in its deliberations, it is noteworthy that there appears 
to be broad agreement among stakeholders that a new fund would be a useful mechanism to 
advance implementation of the Guiding Principles and that such a fund should be able to 
accept financial contributions from any actor, including States, businesses, philanthropic 
organizations and individuals. There is also broad agreement on the importance of ensuring 
full transparency of donors and allocation of resources to individual projects as key to 
establishing and maintaining a fund&#8217;s legitimacy and independence.  
</p>
<p>78. However, as the consultation process has indicated, there remains a diversity of 
views on a number of core issues, such as the desirable scope of a potential fund&#8217;s mandate, 
criteria for eligibility and governance models, which can only be resolved through further 
study and multi-stakeholder dialogue.  
</p>
<p>79. More focused dialogue involving all actors is needed in order to make progress. It is 
therefore recommended that the High Commissioner for Human Rights lead a multi-
stakeholder consultation process, with the aim of developing further recommendations 
concerning the establishment of a new fund on implementation of the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p>80. The process should involve all relevant stakeholder groups, including 
representatives of Governments, the private sector, civil society and grass-roots 
organizations and the Working Group and other relevant experts from within and outside 
the United Nations system. The experience of existing United Nations trust funds, public-
private partnerships and other funding models administered through multi-stakeholder 
governance structures should inform the process. Existing venues for consultation, such as 
the Forum on Business and Human Rights, should be utilized to test preliminary proposals 
with a broad stakeholder base.  </p>


<p><b> IX. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>81. <b>Notable efforts have taken place within individual United Nations agencies, 
funds and programmes to integrate the business and human rights agenda, in 
particular the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, into their work as 
relevant. A number of resident  coordinators and country teams have also taken up 
the agenda in their work at the national levels. However, overall, the United Nations 
appears to be lagging behind some other international and regional organizations in 
integrating the business and human rights agenda and implementing the 
recommendations made by the Secretary-General in 2012. Further coordinated efforts 
are needed at the executive levels of the Organization to ensure that the United 
Nations approaches this task in a systematic and strategic manner. The following 
recommendations are made in that context. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The business and human rights agenda of the United Nations and the Guiding 
Principles should be embedded throughout the United Nations systems, including 
agencies, funds and specialized programmes at the strategic policy level. As the focal 
point for the business and human rights agenda within the United Nations system, 
OHCHR has a mandate to mainstream the Guiding Principles in the United Nations 
system through engagement with system-wide coordination mechanisms and the 
United Nations Development Group human rights mainstreaming mechanism, which 
should also be seized of this agenda, as well as other mechanisms identified in the 
present report.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>OHCHR should increase its efforts to disseminate and promote capacity-
building within the United Nations system at the field level, including through efforts 
alongside United Nations country teams to build capacity. In order to do so, ways in 
which to secure sufficient funding to support increased efforts should be explored. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>OHCHR should continue to serve as the focal point for providing uniform 
advice, guidance and clarification on issues relating to the interpretation of the 
Guiding Principles to all stakeholders both inside and outside the United Nations 
system, in collaboration with the Working Group on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>OHCHR should increase its efforts to provide public training materials and 
other resources on the Guiding Principles to support implementation by both States 
and business enterprises. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>All United Nations agencies, funds and specialized programmes should review 
the relevance of the Guiding Principles to their mandates and activities, and should 
embed the Guiding Principles in their policies and processes where relevant. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>United Nations resident coordinators and country teams, given their critical 
role in many countries, should increase their efforts to ensure the coordination of 
business and human rights and the integration of the Guiding Principles into planning 
and advocacy efforts at the national level, including, where relevant, into national 
development assistance frameworks, and, wherever possible, with the engagement of 
national human rights institutions and Global Compact local networks in those 
efforts.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Organization&#8217;s approaches to investment management, procurement and 
partnerships with the business sector should be reviewed to ensure that they meet 
current, globally recognized good practices with regard to the identification and 
management of human rights risks, as reflected in the Guiding Principles. The </b></p>


<p><b>Organization should look to external entities for examples of good practice in that 
regard.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Global Compact provides a key platform for engaging with the private 
sector and sharing of knowledge and best practices among business enterprises on the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles. The Global Compact should engage 
systematically through its local networks to identify implementation challenges, 
potential tools and good practices, and to disseminate learning and facilitate sharing 
of experiences. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>UNCITRAL is well placed to review the extent to which the Guiding Principles 
are incorporated into national legislation and regulations governing business conduct. 
UNCITRAL is encouraged to collaborate in that regard with the Working Group on 
the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
enterprises.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Member States 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Member States, in compliance with their responsibility to ensure policy 
coherence as set out in the Guiding Principles, should ensure that they consistently 
engage with the United Nations in such a way as to encourage the integration of the 
Guiding Principles within the United Nations system, and do not constrain it. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Issue of a global fund to support capacity-building of all actors to implement the 
Guiding Principles 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Secretary-General notes that stakeholders across categories express 
support for a new global fund to enhance the capacity of stakeholders to implement 
the Guiding Principles. However, there is still a need to consult further with 
stakeholders to explore differing views of the desirable mandate, governance structure 
and sources of funding for a fund in that area. </b> 
</p>
<p>93. <b>It is recommended that OHCHR leads a multi-stakeholder consultation process 
to develop concrete proposals for a new fund in the area, and to present specific 
models for consultation with all stakeholders at the third annual Forum on Business 
and Human Rights in December 2014. The consultations should involve all relevant 
stakeholder groups, including representatives of governments, the private sector, civil 
society and grass roots organizations and the Working Group on the issue of 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises, and other relevant experts 
from within and outside the United Nations system. </b> 
</p>
<p>94. <b>Following those consultations, OHCHR should organize an expert-level 
meeting in early 2015 to develop a concrete recommendation for the structure and 
mandate of a fund, to be proposed to the Council in June 2015 for its consideration. </b>
