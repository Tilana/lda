<p><i>Summary 
</i> Extrajudicial killings by the police are a pervasive problem around the world. One 
of the most important causes of continued police killings is impunity for past killings. As 
part of a system of accountability for addressing impunity, countries should consider 
creating external police oversight mechanisms, which can provide an important 
complement to internal police investigations, internal discipline, the criminal justice 
system, and legislative oversight. This report examines the obstacles to effective external 
oversight, and proposes guidelines for governments on the creation and operation of 
effective external mechanisms.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 10 February 2010, video footage was broadcast showing police and army 
officers in Nigeria forcing a number of unarmed men to lie on the ground before shooting 
them in the back. One of the officers can be heard asking his colleague to shoot a man in 
the chest rather than head, so that he can take the victim&#8217;s hat.1 On 27 June 2007, Brazilian 
police swept through the <i>Complexo do Alem&#227;o</i> favela in Rio de Janeiro in a raid lasting 
eight hours and resulting in 19 deaths; many of the victims showed signs of having been 
extrajudicially executed, including gunshot entry wounds in the back of their bodies and 
point-blank shots.2 A central component of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate is the 
investigation of cases like these &#8211; alleged unlawful killings by police. Police killings take 
many forms, from the use of excessive force during otherwise lawful law enforcement 
operations, to those committed by specially formed police death squads carrying out 
clandestine illegal murders for profit or otherwise. 
</p>
<p>2. In his many country fact-finding investigations, the Special Rapporteur has observed 
the numerous factors that contribute to the commission of these killings. One of the most 
important is impunity for past police killings. Common measures aimed at curbing police 
killings, such as increased police training, will be insufficient if they are not implemented 
in conjunction with attempts to secure accountability. Impunity can result from poorly 
structured and ineffective police internal affairs mechanisms, non-existent forensic 
capacity, inadequate witness protection programs for those reporting abuse, inept criminal 
justice systems, and deficient commissions of inquiry. One crucial factor contributing to 
impunity that stands out from the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s many investigations is the lack of 
any, or any effective, dedicated external civilian oversight of the police force.  
</p>
<p>3. Without external oversight, police are essentially left to police themselves. Victims 
are often reluctant even to report abuse directly to police, for fear of reprisals, or simply 
because they do not believe a serious investigation will result. Especially in cases of 
intentional unlawful killings, purely internal complaint and investigation avenues make it 
all too easy for the police to cover up wrongdoing, to claim that killings were lawful, to fail 
to refer cases for criminal prosecution, or to hand down only minor disciplinary measures 
for serious offences. Importantly, external oversight also plays a role in increasing 
community trust of the police service, and can thereby increase public-police cooperation 
and improve the effectiveness of the police force&#8217;s ability to address crime. 
</p>
<p>4. Recently, increasing numbers of countries have created specialized external police 
oversight mechanisms to address the deficiencies inherent in purely internal investigations 
and discipline. While this is an important development, it is not enough that such agencies 
are created. In theory, they are set-up to reduce impunity where the existing system of 
accountability is inadequate. In practice, however, far too many external mechanisms are 
not given the investigatory powers, political support, human and financial resources, 
powers of recommendation and follow-up, and financial and operational independence 
from the executive and police necessary to truly be effective. Without these basic elements, 
an external agency will be little more than a paper tiger &#8211; set up as a buffer to civilian 
complaints, but with no real impact on police violence. 
</p>
<p>5. This report examines the key aspects of effective external police mechanisms, and 
the difficult issues that arise in attempting to design a successful agency. There is no one 
model of external oversight that is appropriate or necessary for all states. Instead, there is a

<p>range of options, from dedicated police ombudsmen, to police complaint bodies, national 
human rights commissions, and/or providing oversight powers to public prosecutors. 
Drawing upon the experience of the Special Rapporteur, as well as detailed studies on 
specific oversight mechanisms, the report provides general guidelines for the creation of an 
effective external agency.3 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to Sarah Knuckey and Anna de Courcy Wheeler 
for their excellent work in the preparation of this report. He is also grateful Lars Dabney, 
Ryan Ghiselli, and Alana Parker for additional research. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The persuasive problem of police killings and their causes 
</b></p>
<p>7. Extrajudicial executions and other grave human rights abuses by members of a 
state&#8217;s police force have been an issue of concern in nearly all of the countries visited by 
the Special Rapporteur, including Nigeria4, Kenya5, Brazil6, Guatemala7, the Central 
African Republic8 and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.9 They have also been the 
basis of many communications to a wide range of Governments, including those of 
Australia,10 Armenia,11 Bahrain,12 Bangladesh,13 China14, Ethiopia,15 India,16 Maldives,17 
Mozambique18, Myanmar,19 Nigeria20, Pakistan,21 and Sri Lanka.22 
</p>
<p>8. While not all killings by police are unlawful, the circumstances in which the police 
may use lethal force are strictly circumscribed by international human rights law. In short, 
the police may only intentionally use lethal force where it is necessary to protect life. The 
relevant law has been set out in detail in previous reports by the Special Rapporteur.23 
</p>
<p>9. Unlawful police killings are not confined to countries in particular regions, with 
particular political systems or lower levels of prosperity. The most common forms of police 
killings occur due to excessive use of force in law enforcement operations, including during 
attempts to arrest suspected criminals,24 crowd or riot control25, and purported &#8220;shoot-outs&#8221; 
</p>
<p>  
 3 Specific examples are taken from the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s country fact-finding missions, and a 
</p>
<p>detailed study carried out by the Special Rapporteur on the external police agencies in over 15 
countries.

<p>with alleged armed criminals (sometimes called &#8220;encounter killings&#8221;).26 Some killings are 
motivated by personal monetary gain: the Special Rapporteur has reported on police 
killings occurring at police checkpoints, where attempts at extortion can escalate into 
extrajudicial executions.27 Others occur in the context of poorly planned and unlawful 
policing policies and operations, for example, where police engage in heavily militarized 
operations without adequate safeguards or community support.28 In some countries, police 
engage in &#8220;social cleansing&#8221;, intentionally killing suspected criminals or members of poor 
or marginalized communities.29 In extreme cases, the police operate as part of a formal 
death squad or militia.30 Killings also occur as a result of torture, or the denial of life-saving 
treatment while the victim is in police custody.31 Other killings by police occur outside the 
context of any purported official police activity, and result from off-duty police officers 
acting as vigilantes or hired killers.32 
</p>
<p>10. The experience of the Special Rapporteur indicates that there are many factors in 
different contexts that can cause the police to unlawfully kill, rather than to arrest suspects 
and provide real security for citizens. Causes and enabling conditions can be historical, 
institutional or structural, legal, or political. 
</p>
<p>11. A lack of proper police training, particularly concerning weapons use, less than 
lethal measures, and training in human rights33, can make police officers more likely to 
resort to the use of deadly force.34 Killings can also result from the lack of appropriate 
weaponry or other equipment, especially in the riot or crowd control context.35 Domestic 
legal frameworks for the use of force which are either overly permissive, legalising the use 
of lethal force in instances where it is not necessary to protect life or unclear regarding the 
line between necessary and excessive force, similarly may make police more likely to 
kill.36 Poor pay for police can also lead to corruption and violent activity, including by 
providing an incentive for police to act as hired killers.37 
</p>
<p>12. Democratic police forces emerging from periods of violence, instability or violent 
dictatorship can be especially prone to continued violent tactics and policies. In particular, 
countries with a history of militarized police force can have high levels of police violence. 
The presence of a military rather than civilian ethos within a police force contributes 
significantly to the number of human rights violations committed by that force. The 
militarisation of a police force can be due to, for example, the incorporation of former 
rebels or members of the military into the police force as part of a peace agreement; the 
inheritance of a militarised police force from a colonial power; or the use of the police in

<p>quasi-military roles in countries where there is little security or respect for the rule of 
law.38 
</p>
<p>13. High numbers of police killings are also often seen in countries with high crime 
rates, and especially where there are high levels of violent or street crime, and where there 
are organised or semi-organised violent gangs or militias. While police forces face many 
challenges in insecure environments, some governments and police forces fail to prepare 
appropriate crime-control strategies, and instead opt to use unlawful, short-term and heavy-
handed tactics against alleged criminals. Killings can also be encouraged where there is 
high level political or public support for violent policing. Senior police officers or officials 
can contribute to the number of police killings by tacitly approving of or openly 
encouraging them.39 
</p>
<p>14. In some contexts, institutionalised racism or ethnic discrimination can result in the 
use of more violence against certain groups by the police.40 In others, individuals perceived 
to be members of a political, religious, or ethnic rival group may be intentionally targeted 
by the police.41 Politicised policing often results when members of the police force have 
strong allegiances to a particular political leader or party, and where command and control 
is not sufficiently independent.42 
</p>
<p>15. Deaths can also result from the police failure to observe due diligence standards in 
the custodial setting: in certain cases, improper care or abuse during custody can lead to 
deaths for which police officers are responsible.43 
</p>
<p>16. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s many country fact-finding missions, he has observed 
that one of the most important causes of police killings worldwide is impunity &#8211; the failure 
to properly investigate, prosecute, convict and punish police responsible for extrajudicial 
executions or other human rights abuses. There are often many cumulative causes of 
impunity, and they are generally mutually reinforcing and extraordinarily difficult to break 
without addressing them together in a coordinated, system-wide reform approach. Impunity 
can often begin with the police perpetrators covering up the incident, often claiming that the 
killing was conducted lawfully (e.g. in self-defence) against a threatening criminal.44 Weak 
or unobserved crimes scene and incident reporting procedures police can make it easy for 
police to make false claims.45 Corrupted, under-resourced, or insufficiently independent 
police internal affairs office result in failures to appropriately investigate potential police 
wrong-doing.46 A lack of independent forensic analysis offices can also contribute to 
</p>
<p>  
 38 In addition to feeding into diminished regard for the human rights of suspects and civilians, the 
</p>
<p>militarisation of police forces can also pose a problem when attempting to establish some form of 
accountability through external oversight. Civilian oversight bodies are more likely to be strongly 
resisted by police forces with a militaristic tradition or culture. Andrew J. Goldmsith, &#8220;Police 
Accountability in Colombia&#8221;, in Andrew J Goldsmith and Colleen Lewis, Civilian Oversight of 
Policing (2000), p. 189. See also Niels Uildriks and Piet van Reenen, &#8220;Human Rights Violations by

<p>failures to investigate available physical evidence.47 No existing, or weak external oversight 
or complaint mechanisms mean that there will be no check on internal mechanisms 
(discussed in detail below). Where prosecutors are in a position to prosecute police crimes, 
they may be too reliant on internal police investigations, or to under-resourced, susceptible 
to bias or threats, or lack sufficient legal power to successfully prosecute.48 Police impunity 
can also result from corrupt or inept criminal justice systems.49 Inadequate witness 
protection programs for those reporting and testifying against police abuse can contribute 
significantly to impunity for police killings.50 Victims are often reluctant to report abuse 
directly to police for fear of reprisals, or because they do not believe that a serious 
investigation will result.51 
</p>
<p><b> III. The need for accountability and external civilian oversight 
</b></p>
<p>17. International human rights law requires that police killings are thoroughly 
investigated, and that the police responsible for unlawful actions are prosecuted and 
convicted.52 This is required both to: (a) fulfil the state&#8217;s obligations to provide 
accountability in the individual case and justice for the victim and their family; (b) as well 
as to fulfil the state&#8217;s due diligence obligations to prevent future violations: if violations are 
left unpunished, a culture of impunity forms, which in turn encourages further violations.53

 52 Article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights protects the rights to life, which 
</p>
<p>is also protected in Article 2(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms, Article 4(1) of the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights, and Article 
2 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. The duty to investigate is an inherent part of 
the right to life. Human Rights Committee General Comment 31 emphasises the need for states 
parties to the ICCPR to &#8220;exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate and redress the harm 
caused&#8221; by violations of the right to life&#8221;. In <i>Herrera Rubio v Colombia</i> the Human Rights 
Committee confirmed that this duty arises in relation to killings by both state agents and private 
actors. Judgment, 2 November 1987. Regional courts have similarly emphasised the duty to 
investigate as an essential part of state obligations relating to the right to life. See, for example, 
<i>McCann and Others v. The United Kingdom</i>, (Application no. 18984/91), Judgment, Strasbourg, 27 
September 1995, para. 161: &#8220;[the right to life] requires by implication that there should be some form 
of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force &#8230; 
The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic 
laws which protect the right to life, and in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their 
accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility&#8221;; and <i>Vel&#225;squez-Rodr&#237;guez v. Honduras,</i> 
Judgment, 29 July 1988, para. 176-177: &#8220;The State is obligated to investigate every situation 
involving a violation of the rights protected by the Convention. If the State apparatus acts in such a 
way that the violation goes unpunished and the victim&#8217;s full enjoyment of such rights is not restored 
as soon as possible, the State has failed to comply with its duty to ensure the free and full exercise of 
those rights to persons within its jurisdiction.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 53 The Inter-American Court of Human Rights noted this danger in the <i>Case of Myrna Mack-Chang v. 
Guatemala: </i>&#8220;In cases of extra-legal executions, it is essential for the States to effectively investigate 
deprivation of the right to life and to punish all those responsible, especially when State agents are 
involved, as not doing so would create, within the environment of impunity, conditions for this type 
</p>
<p> </p>

</p>
<p>18. International law requires that investigations are effective, comprehensive and 
independent, as well as prompt and transparent. Specific standards of investigation have 
been developed in international documents, as well as regional human rights court 
jurisprudence. The UN Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-
legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions provide guidance regarding the investigation of 
extrajudicial executions where government officials such as police are involved. Principle 9 
provides that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There shall be thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of 
extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, including eases where complaints by 
relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above 
circumstances. Governments shall maintain investigative offices and procedures to 
undertake such inquiries. The purpose of the investigation shall be to determine the 
cause, manner and time of death, the person responsible, and any pattern or practice 
which may have brought about that death. It shall include an adequate autopsy, 
collection and analysis of all physical and documentary evidence and statements 
from witnesses. The investigation shall distinguish between natural death, accidental 
death, suicide and homicide. 
</p>
<p>19. Principle 10 provides: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The investigative authority shall have the power to obtain all the information 
necessary to the inquiry. Those persons conducting the investigation shall have at 
their disposal all the necessary budgetary and technical resources for effective 
investigation. They shall also have the authority to oblige officials allegedly 
involved in any such executions to appear and testify. The same shall apply to any 
witness. To this end, they shall be entitled to issue summonses to witnesses, 
including the officials allegedly involved and to demand the production of evidence. 
</p>
<p>20. The Model Protocol for the Legal Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and 
Summary Executions (the &#8220;Minnesota Protocol&#8221;) was drafted to supplement the UN 
Principles and also emphasises the need for thorough and impartial investigations; it also 
provides guidelines on how to conduct such investigations, including information on, for 
example, gathering evidence at the crime scene and the processing of evidence.  
</p>
<p>21. Regional human rights courts have repeatedly found that the general duty to 
investigate violations of the right to life, incorporates specific requirements that the 
investigations are both effective and independent. Failure to meet these standards will result 
in a violation of the right to life.54  
</p>
<p>22. In order to be &#8220;effective&#8221;, the purpose of an investigation must be to secure the full 
implementation of the domestic laws that protect the right to life, and in those cases 
involving state agents or bodies, to ensure accountability for deaths for which they are 
responsible.55 Investigations must be capable of leading to &#8220;a determination of whether 
</p>
<p>  
of facts to occur again, which is contrary to the duty to respect and ensure the right to life.&#8221; Judgment, 
25 November 2003, para. 156.

Bulgaria</i> (Application no. 38361/97), Judgment, 13 June 2002. 
</p>
<p> 55 <i>Finucane v. The United Kingdom,</i> (Application no. 29178/95), Judgment, 1 July 2003. The case 
concerned the death of Patrick Finucane who was killed by the Ulster Freedom Forces (UFF). A 
subsequent investigation undertaken by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) resulted in no 
convictions despite evidence indicating army, police, and RUC collusion with the UFF. The wife of 
Patrick Finucane appealed to the ECtHR, alleging that there had been no effective investigation, and 
the Court found a violation of Article 2 on this basis.  </p>

them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, <i>inter alia</i>, eye-witness

<p>23. In order to be &#8220;independent&#8221;, there must be &#8220;practical independence&#8221; and a &#8220;lack of 
hierarchical or institutional connection&#8221; between investigators and those implicated in 
abuses.61 Thus, there must be both independence in law and in fact.62 Investigators may not 
only or heavily rely on information provided by those implicated in abuses,63 and the 
&#8220;investigation&#8217;s conclusions must be based on thorough, objective, and impartial analysis of 
all relevant elements.&#8221;64  
</p>
<p>24. Police investigations and police internal affairs offices, together with the criminal 
justice system are essential parts of the system of accountability that a state must put in 
place to meet its obligations to effectively investigate. Police internal investigations and 
discipline are essential to foster an internal culture of accountability, discipline and respect 
for laws within the police force. It can also offer swift resolution for complainants, and 
offer expertise and resources at the investigatory stage.65 In addition, officers may be more 
likely to cooperate with other police officers during internal investigations.66

international obligations. Internal police disciplinary mechanisms can be inadequate, not

<p>just because they might be poorly structured or under-resourced, but because by their nature 
they are susceptible to bias.67 Where police are allowed to effectively police themselves, as 
in any system of purely internal accountability, there is a strong temptation to &#8220;look after 
one&#8217;s own&#8221;. Police internal review is vulnerable to bias in all countries, but especially 
where there is minimal respect for the rule of law, where senior officers fail to push the 
important of accountability, and where corruption is rampant. In cases of alleged unlawful 
killings, purely internal complaint mechanisms may make it all too easy for police to cover 
up wrongdoing,68 to claim that killings were lawful,69 to fail to refer cases for criminal 
prosecution,70 or to hand down only minor disciplinary measures for serious offences.71 
Victims and marginalised groups also often have deep mistrust of internal police 
disciplinary processes, and so many incidents may go unreported for fear or retribution or 
simply non-action. Criminal justice systems can be overly reliant on police internal 
investigations,72 particularly where, as is often the case, prosecutors have insufficient 
powers to conduct their own primary investigations. Legislative oversight, while also 
important, can depend too heavily on the political climate and political will.  
</p>
<p>26. External civilian oversight of the police can, where set up appropriately, be an 
important complement to these other mechanisms, and can help fill the gaps in a country&#8217;s 
system of accountability by avoiding some of the inherent or likely inadequacies of other 
mechanisms. External civilian oversight mechanisms can take numerous forms, but broadly 
speaking can be divided into two categories: (a) agencies exclusively dedicated to police 
oversight (e.g. a police ombudsman, or a police complaints body, or a police oversight 
agency); or (b) those which oversee police activities as part of a broader mandate (e.g. 
general ombudsmen, usually established to investigate human rights violations or cases of

 72 A particularly illustrative case is that of <i>Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria,</i> where the court found that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;the investigating authorities did not examine relevant matters such as the fact that the victims were 
known to be unarmed and represented no danger to anyone, still less whether it was appropriate to 
dispatch a team of heavily armed officers in pursuit of two men whose only offence was to be absent 
without leave. In short, there was no strict scrutiny of all the material circumstances &#8230; A number of 
indispensable and obvious investigative steps were not taken &#8230; Moreover the investigator and the 
prosecutors ignored highly relevant facts&#8230; and, without seeking any proper explanation, merely 
accepted [the accused's] statements and terminated the investigation. The investigator and the 
prosecutors thus effectively shielded [the accused] from prosecution&#8230; [S]uch conduct on the part of 
the authorities &#8230; is a matter of grave concern, as it casts serious doubts on the objectivity and 
impartiality of the investigators and prosecutors involved.  
</p>
<p>   The Court reiterates in this connection that a prompt and effective response by the authorities 
in investigating the use of lethal force is essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence 
to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts.&#8221;  </p>

<p>government maladministration; or national human rights commissions or institutions; in 
some countries, public prosecutors may have some police oversight powers). Where 
countries have established dedicated police complaints mechanisms, they have often been 
set up in response to protracted and serious police abuses or following periods of violence, 
as seen in Northern Ireland, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana.73  
</p>
<p>27. Independent mechanisms can be given a range of powers (discussed in detail in part 
IV). Depending on the country, they may be able to receive complaints about police abuse, 
investigate allegations of police abuse, refer cases for internal police discipline, refer cases 
to the public prosecutor, impose disciplinary measures, conduct broader studies on police 
conduct, and/or propose police service reforms to the police or the government.  
</p>
<p>28. As a complement to internal disciplinary mechanisms, external oversight can 
provide an important, independent check on purely internal accounts. In providing an 
alternative forum to which affected citizens may complain about police abuses, external 
oversight gives individuals access to justice that otherwise would often be unavailable to 
them. It can improve the relationship between the police and public, increasing community 
trust in the police force.74 It can also provide the sort of independent and unbiased 
investigations into allegations that would otherwise be unlikely.75 External mechanisms can 
also be important in exposing harmful police practices and in highlighting the shortcomings 
of internal regulation. Through this they can contribute to efforts aimed at the improvement 
of internal disciplinary measures, as well as influence broader reforms in police policy that 
encourage respect for human rights.76 As explained by the Council of Europe 
Commissioner for Human Rights:77 
</p>
<p>29. An independent and effective complaints system is essential for securing and 
maintaining public trust and confidence in the police, and will serve as fundamental 
protection against ill-treatment and misconduct. An independent police complaints body 
(IPCB) should form a pivotal part of such a system.

external control&#8221;. The commentary to Article 59 states that &#8220;&#8230;state control over the police must, in 
an open democratic society, be complemented by the means for the police to be answerable to the 
public, that is the citizens and their representatives. Police accountability vis-&#224;-vis the public is a 
crucial condition for making co-operation between the police and the public a reality. There are 
several means of rendering the police accountable to the public. Accountability can be direct or 
channeled through bodies representing the public. Generally, openness and transparency of the police 
are, however, basic requirements for accountability/control to be effective&#8221;. </p>

<p><b> IV. Principles to guide police external oversight and obstacles to 
effective oversight 
</b></p>
<p>30. While states are not required to adopt any one particular model of external oversight, 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s experience indicates that if oversight is to be effective, it should 
be created and should operate according to certain general principles. The most successful 
external mechanisms will have adequate powers to carry out comprehensive investigations 
of police abuses, will be sufficiently independent from the police and the government, will 
be adequately resourced, will operate transparently and report regularly, will have the 
support of the public and the government, and will involve civil society in its work. This 
section explores the varieties of oversight mechanisms in many different countries, 
examines the various obstacles to their effectiveness, and sets out what a mechanism needs 
to be most effective.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Powers 
</b></p>
<p>31. An external oversight mechanism should be provided sufficient powers to actually 
be able to effectively reduce impunity for police abuses. Without adequate mandated 
power, such mechanisms risk being used as mere a buffer against civilian concern and 
anger, rather than as effective agents for accountability.  
</p>
<p>32. At its most basic, an external mechanism is authorised to receive complaints about 
police abuses. This is generally seen as a necessary first step to overcome blocks in police 
internal affairs, and to provide witnesses and others an alternative avenue to which to direct 
complaints. It should be clear in the organisation&#8217;s mandate that it can receive complaints 
from any relevant person, including witnesses, victim&#8217;s family members, police themselves 
or other officials. It may be in important in some contexts that police are either legally 
permitted or required to report serious matters (such as all deaths in police custody or due 
to police action).78 For reporting requirements to be effective, there will normally need to 
be a penalty for officers who fail or delay to refer or report cases to the external agency.79  
</p>
<p>  
 78 For example, the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman, reformed following the 1998 Belfast 
</p>
<p>Agreement and the Patten Report (a study on policing in Northern Ireland), can receive complaints, or 
other matters of inquiry, from the Secretary of State or the Chief Constable, or may come directly 
from a member of the public. The Ombudsman is a non-departmental public body intended to provide 
an independent, impartial police complaints system. In 2007 the Ombudsman recommended that 
police officers should be granted the specific power to bring the Ombudsman&#8217;s attention to the 
suspected misbehaviour of other police officers: Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland, 
<i>Developments in Police Complaints &#8211; 7 Years On; Overview of Trends and Patterns in Police 
Complaints, 2000 &#8211; 2007</i>. The Police (Northern Ireland) Act (2000) also created the Northern Ireland 
Policing Board, primarily charged with setting goals and policies the Police Service of Northern 
Ireland (PSNI). See Ellison, Graham, &#8220;A Blueprint for Democratic Policing Anywhere in the World?: 
Police Reform, Political Transition, and Conflict Resolution in Northern Ireland&#8221;, <i>Police Quarterly</i> 
(2007); Human Rights Watch, <i>Northern Ireland: Human Rights and the Patten Report</i>, (September 
1999).  
</p>
<p>   In South Africa, police are required to report deaths in custody or police killings to the 
Independent Complaints Directorate. 
</p>
<p> 79 For example, external agency investigators in South Africa have stated that there needs to be specific 
legislation which makes delaying reporting a punishable offense, as this has been a serious issue: 
Independent Complaints Directorate, <i>An Investigation into Deaths as a Result of Police Action in 
Kwazulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Gauteng</i> (South Africa, 2007). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>33. The minimum action taken by an external organisation in response to complaints is 
to record and track them. Some oversight offices use this power to great effect: the S&#227;o 
Paulo, Brazil ombudsman (<i>ouvidoria</i>)80 has attempted to maximize the efficacy of its 
oversight by tracking homicides which indicate the involvement of death squads, and in 
turn using this to expose impunity for police killings.81 The strength of this should not 
depend on personality &#8211; the organisation&#8217;s mandate should require it to keep 
comprehensive records, and track specific abuses as appropriate in the country context. In 
many contexts &#8211; especially where citizen fear of the police is high, or where their 
knowledge or access to an oversight body is likely to be minimal &#8211; it will also be important 
that the organisation can monitor abuses on its own initiative and not only those specifically 
reported to it.  
</p>
<p>34. While recording is important, in that it provides a record of alleged abuses, bodies 
unable to take further action are often severely hampered. After receiving a complaint or 
otherwise being made aware of an alleged case of abuse, many organisations are 
empowered to seek information from police about the investigations they have undertaken 
on a particular case, or they may request that the police or police internal affairs investigate 
a particular complaint. This can provide an important additional level of scrutiny. However, 
without more, there may be little positive effect. Without their own independent 
investigatory powers, external oversight bodies are forced to rely upon police 
investigations, which can be inadequate or nonexistent as a result of police bias or 
corruption. The chairperson of the Police Complaint Agency in Trinidad and Tobago 
summed up this problem when explaining that &#8220;complainants&#8230;view the role of the 
authority merely as a &#8216;post box&#8217;, receiving complaints, forwarding them to the Police, 
receiving reports and forwarding them to the complainants.&#8221;82 In Kenya, the Police 
Oversight Board has no investigative powers &#8211; it is restricted to receiving and evaluating 
complaints.83 In Sri Lanka, investigations are also delegated back to the police;84 such 
</p>
<p>  
 80 Although Brazil has made significant progress in emerging from many years of military rule, large 
</p>
<p>cities like Rio de Janerio and S&#227;o Paulo experience major threats to public security as a result of 
violent crime, much of it linked to drug trafficking. However, the police response also threatens 
security: over 11,000 police killings have been committed between 2003 and 2009. Such killings 
often occur in the context of militarized operations aimed at removing suspected criminal gangs from 
<i>favelas</i>. Police officers have also engaged in killings as part of illegal armed militias and death 
squads. See A/HRC/14/24/Add.4. Specialised police <i>ouvidorias</i> are relatively new in Brazil, and as of 
2008 had been established in 14 states. They are not mandatory for states under federal law. In most 
states the <i>ouvidoria</i> is an executive agency or sub-agency hierarchically independent from the police. 
Its director (the Ombudsman or Ouvidor) is usually appointed by the governor, and its organization 
housed within the Secretariat of Public Security. Unlike other countries that have created external 
police oversight mechanisms, the <i>ouvidorias</i> have no independent power to investigate or determine 
sanctions: Jorge Zaverucha, &#8220;O papel da ouvidoria de pol&#237;cia,&#8221; <i>Sociologias,</i> Vol. 10, No. 20 (2008), p. 
2. Uniquely, Brazil&#8217;s public prosecutors (<i>Minist&#233;rio P&#250;blico</i>) also have extensive powers oversight of 
the police. See further Human Rights Watch, <i>Lethal Force: Police Violence and Public Security in 
Rio de Janeiro and S&#227;o Paulo</i> (December 2009); Julita Lemgruber, <i>Civilian Oversight of the Police in

<p> 83 Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, &#8220;Kenya needs an independent and effective police 
oversight board&#8221; (12 September 2008). The Police Oversight board was established in September 
2008 by the Minister of Internal Security in Gazette Notice No 8144 as part of a wider attempt to 
foster a culture of accountability within the police force. Currently the Kenyan Police forces fall

</p>
<p>delegation significantly diminishes the ability of external oversight agencies to act as a 
check on police internal investigations, and can negatively impact upon public perceptions 
of the agency, especially where the oversight agency is also unable to supervise police 
internal investigations. Similar problems are evident with the state police ombudsmen in 
Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. An organisation may not even necessarily have the power to 
require the police to respond to their referrals or requests. In Brazil, police ombudsmen 
(&#8220;<i>ouvidorias</i>&#8221;) may request further police investigations if they find the first one 
inadequate, in which case, the internal affairs department usually formally accepts the 
request, but there is no guarantee that the further investigation will take place.85  
</p>
<p>35. In addition to the basic power to seek further information from the police, many 
organisations are permitted to simply refer cases to the public prosecutor&#8217;s office. Brazil&#8217;s 
<i>ouvidorias </i>may elect to forward a complaint to the office of the prosecutor, although this 
can carry its own set of complications, such as an unreceptive or resistant prosecutor&#8217;s 
office, or the risk of antagonizing the police who may see this as by-stepping procedures.86 
Nevertheless, some <i>ouvidorias </i>have adopted the practice of forwarding the most severe 
cases to the prosecutor before its oversight process vis-&#224;-vis the internal affairs division has 
run its course.87 The Sao Paulo <i>ouvidoria</i> has developed a partnership with the State 
Prosecutor&#8217;s office, sending police reports of &#8220;resistance killings&#8221; (killings by police 
reported by them to have been lawful, such as those reported to have occurred as part of a 
shootout between police and criminal gangs), which it deems questionable, to the human 
rights aide of the Attorney General in order to bring suspicious cases to the attention of the 
Prosecutor.88 
</p>
<p>36. Stronger organisations have the specific authority to initiate and conduct their <i>own</i> 
investigations into allegations of police abuse, although widely varying investigatory 
powers are provided in different countries. It is not enough to equip an external oversight 
agency with the general authority to conduct investigations of the police &#8211; it must be given 
sufficient and specific supporting investigatory powers to enable a full and effective 
investigation to be undertaken. A number of agencies are given the general power to 
&#8220;investigate&#8221; or &#8220;inquire&#8221;, or its mandate gives it &#8220;all the powers necessary to investigate&#8221;. 
General provisions are often not appropriate because they are open to widely different 
</p>
<p>  
under an overlapping rubric of three oversight mechanisms: the Police Oversight Board, the Public 
Complaints Standing Committee (PCSC), and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. 
The PCSC is an executive-controlled mechanism that can receive complaints against any public 
officers, including the police. The Kenyan National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) has a 
much broader mandate. Police misconduct is a priority on their agenda, but they are severely 
understaffed for the volume of complaints they receive, and members have also received serious 
threats for investigating the police. The KNCHR has also pushed for the establishment of a dedicated 
and effective police oversight body: KNCHR, Presentation to the Presidential Police Reforms Task 
Force (June 2009). See, generally: Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, The Police, The People,

<p>interpretations of the scope of permitted power, and the exercise of specific powers under a 
general authority may be contested.89  
</p>
<p>37. Specific supporting powers include the power to subpoena documents, obtain search 
warrants, protect witnesses, and compel police cooperation. Without these powers, an 
agency&#8217;s investigations will often be inadequate. The strongest mechanisms can be given 
quasi-police investigator or prosecutor powers. The South African Independent Complaints 
Directorate (ICD)90 may review police investigations to ensure they have been conducted 
properly, but the ICD also frequently uses its mandate to do its own investigations.91 The 
ICD can conduct its own independent investigations into cases of police misconduct, either 
in response to the receipt of a complaint, referral by the Minister of Safety and Security or a 
provincial executive, or upon its own initiative. Investigation of misconduct and referrals 
are left to the discretion of the ICD, although, importantly, investigation is mandatory for 
deaths in custody or deaths resulting from police action. The power to independently 
investigate is important in helping prevent police officers from successfully covering up 
evidence of human rights abuses, and it allows the ICD to investigate abuses which may 
otherwise go unreported by an uncooperative police station. Section 50(4) of the Police Act 
(South Africa) requires all government organs to provide such assistance as may be 
reasonably required for the effectiveness of the ICD.92 Designated members of the ICD are

example, they have the power to investigate crime scenes), to subpoena witnesses and 
evidence, the power to arrest, and powers of search and seizure.93 
</p>
<p>38. Similarly, the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland has &#8220;all the powers and

 90 The Independent Complaints Directorate was established in 1997 as an external oversight agency, 
</p>
<p>during South Africa&#8217;s transition from apartheid to democracy. It was created as a mechanism for 
investigating and deterring human rights abuses by the South African Police Services: South African 
Police Service Act (1995). The creation of the ICD was one part of a set of policing reforms which 
aimed to prevent human rights violations by the police and to improve police-community relations.

have contributed to &#8220;significant improvements &#8230; in respect of the outlook and performance 
of police officers&#8221;.95 In contrast, the Police Complaints Authority in Lesotho has been 
hampered by its lack of investigatory powers; the Authority has noted that its efficacy is 
limited by the Police Act which gives it no powers of search and seizure.96 Without 
auxiliary powers, a mandate which empowers an external oversight agency to undertake 
investigations is often rendered meaningless.97 
</p>
<p>39. Police cooperation with an external oversight agency is essential to its proper 
functioning &#8211; hostility and obstruction from a police force can significantly limit the ability 
of an oversight agency to properly investigate complaints. In Brazil, the police forces have 
been accused by the <i>ouvidorias</i> of obstructing investigations.98 The Jamaican Police Public 
Complaints Authority&#8217;s investigations are hindered because it lacks the power to compel 
suspect police officers to cooperate by giving statements.99 In Sri Lanka, police hostility 
translated into open threats and physical intimidation of the staff of the Human Rights 
Commission during a visit to a police station.100 
</p>
<p>40. A number of countries have attempted to address this by compelling police 
cooperation by law. In Northern Ireland, the Chief Constable and the Policing Board are

relationship between the Ombudsman&#8217;s Offices and the Civil and Military Police is marked by 
tension and conflict. The Ombudsman&#8217;s Offices generally accuse the Internal Affairs Offices of 
stonewalling and glossing over investigations in order to safeguard the name of police institutions. 
The Internal Affairs Offices, in turn, accuse the Ombudsman&#8217;s Offices of referring complaints with 
no probable cause which they frequently claim are the result of attempts at revenge against police 
officers.&#8221;

<p> 99 Susan Goffe, <i>Complaints Against the Police: The Jamaican Experience &#8211; An NGO Perspective,</i> 
Jamaicans for Justice (November 2003), p. 5. The Jamaican Constabulary Force (JCF) is the primary 
body responsible for policing in Jamaica. In a 2001 report, members of inner city communities 
described the police as a force to be feared, rather than serving a protective purpose. The IACHR has 
noted that a significant number of police killings occur in circumstances consistent with extrajudicial 
executions, and that victims are often unarmed young men or boys from inner city areas. The Police 
Public Complaints Authority was established in 1993 under the Police Public Complaints Act with a 
mandate to monitor and supervise investigations by the police into complaints concerning police 
killings and other serious injuries. It has the power to both review police investigations and to initiate 
its own investigations, and may submit reports to the Commissioner of Police and the Director of 
Public Prosecutions where investigation suggests that criminal proceedings may be pursued. It also 
monitors and reviews internal investigations to ensure they are undertaken effectively. See further

<p>required by law to cooperate with the Police Ombudsman. Cases involving police 
&#8220;obstruction&#8221; or &#8220;perverting (or attempting to pervert) the course of justice&#8221; can be referred 
by the Police Ombudsman to the Public Prosecutor. The South African ICD can compel 
police to provide information necessary for the external investigation (failure to comply 
constitutes misconduct)101 and can compel the cooperation of police officers during the 
investigation.102 The El Salvadoran police oversight agency, the <i>Procuradur&#237;a para la 
Defensa de los Derechos Humanos</i> (PDDH), has the right to all police documentation 
relating to an allegation of misconduct. If the police fail to supply the necessary 
documentation, the PDDH may, by law, uphold the complaint on the assumption that the 
allegation is true.103 However, both the South African and El Salvadoran agencies have 
nevertheless reported cooperation problems. The South African ICD has reported 
&#8220;numerous instances of hindrance and non-compliance&#8221; and non-cooperation with ICD 
information requests, on the part of the South African Police Force.104 In El Salvador, the 
PDDH, faced a similar problem &#8211; the lack of police cooperation was cited by the 
ombudsman as one of the factors that hampered her ability to effectively investigate 
complaints regarding police behaviour.105 Police non-compliance may need to be strictly 
enforced; and high-level political support for oversight can also encourage improved 
cooperation. 
</p>
<p>41. It can also be important to investigation effectiveness that the agency have the 
necessary power to provide or make available witness protection for complainants or other 
individuals cooperating with its investigations.106  
</p>
<p>42. Important obstacles to external mechanism effectiveness often arise after it has 
completed its investigation. Many mechanisms have no real &#8220;teeth&#8221;, even where their 
investigations found strong evidence of police wrong-doing. The ability to fully investigate 
and report on incidents and complaints, even with complete independence, means little if 
the authority lacks the capacity to ensure that the police, prosecutors and/or executive act 
on the basis of their findings.107 Currently, many civilian oversight mechanisms have weak

<p>   (a) protecting the identity and integrity of complainants; and

 107 The Police Public Complaints Authority (PPCA) in Jamaica, for example, lacks any power to 
</p>
<p>investigate whether the police have followed up on its reports and recommendations, a factor 
consistently cited in discussions of the PPCA&#8217;s shortcomings. Goffe, Susan, Watching the watchdogs:

<p>powers in this respect.108 Brazilian <i>ouvidorias</i>&#8217; lack of binding authority to require that the 
police investigate a matter further significantly undermines their capacity to promote 
accountability.109 In Zambia, the Police Public Complaints Authority is similarly 
constrained &#8211; though it may make recommendations to the Inspector-General of Police, 
these recommendations are non-binding.110 The Kenyan Police Oversight Board has no 
enforcement powers, and can only make non-binding recommendations to the 
Commissioner of Police.111 
</p>
<p>43. At a minimum, a mechanism should be mandated to recommend disciplinary 
measures for a police perpetrator, and, where appropriate, recommend that the prosecutor 
initiate criminal proceedings. In South Africa, ICD investigations may lead to a 
recommendation to the public prosecutor for criminal prosecution, a referral to police 
internal affairs, or further inquiry. The Jamaican Police Public Complaints Authority has 
the power to both review police investigations and to initiate its own investigations, and 
may submit reports to the Commissioner of Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions 
where investigation suggests that criminal proceedings may be pursued. It does not have the 
authority to determine whether criminal charges or disciplinary action are pursued. Stronger 
mechanisms are able to enforce disciplinary recommendations. In Northern Ireland, the 
Chief Constable has a legal duty to comply with the recommendations given by the 
Ombudsman. The Ombudsman may also, where a criminal offence is suspected, refer the 
case directly to the Director of Public Prosecutions.112 Similarly, in the Philippines, the 
decisions made by the People&#8217;s Law Enforcement Board (PLEB) concerning the suspension 
of a police officer are binding on the police, and though they may be appealed to the 
appellate courts, they are rarely overturned.113 
</p>
<p>44. The ability to influence broader police policy can also be a powerful tool in a 
civilian oversight agency&#8217;s efforts to promote accountability. An external agency can often 
be well-placed to propose reforms directed at having a long-term deterrent effect. Many 
external oversight agencies have a mandate which is limited to review and investigation of 
individual complaints. However, some have more general powers to suggest or assist in 
determining security police and law. 
</p>
<p>45. In South Africa, the ICD may make recommendations to address policing policies or 
procedures. Recommendations may, for example, ask that policies or training programs be

<p>implemented to curb police misconduct.114 The reputation of the ICD is such that the 
National Commissioner can seldom simply ignore these recommendations.115 However, the 
ICD has complained that it lacks the requisite power to ensure that recommendations are 
implemented, since there are no means of enforcement; nor do the South African police 
have to respond to ICD recommendations.116 In Northern Ireland, the Policing Board has a 
critical in determining police policy, contributing to the Annual Policing Plan and 
overseeing its implementation.117 In addition it possesses the authority to dismiss the head 
of police if they find their proposals for policy reform are not being effectively 
implemented.118 The effectiveness of the Board in reversing former trends of police 
impunity has been widely applauded.119 In S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil the <i>ouvidoria</i> has made a 
number of policy recommendations that have been implemented by police, most notably, a 
recommendation to implement a &#8220;shoot to disable&#8221; rather than a &#8220;shoot to kill&#8221; policy, 
which may have contributed to a reduction in killings.120 Such powers can help an external 
oversight mechanism contribute to tackling the root causes of impunity and extrajudicial 
executions by police, rather than restricting the body to the handling of individual 
complaints. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Resources 
</b></p>
<p>46. An external agency must be adequately resourced and funded. There should be 
sufficient resources to employ skilled investigators, and the agency should have the 
financial capacity to undertake serious investigations.121 Adequate resources are essential to 
allowing an agency to fulfil its mandate, and can impact upon the independence of the body 
which, if under-resourced, may be forced to rely on the police for investigative services.122  
</p>
<p>47. In many countries where mechanisms for external oversight are created, the practical 
impact of such bodies is limited due to chronic under-resourcing. The Jamaican Police 
Public Complaints Authority has been beset by operational difficulties, and its inability to 
make a significant impact on the high number of police killings has been attributed by its 
chief to, in large part, a lack of funding.123 Similarly, the Salvadoran police oversight

</p>
<p>agency (the PDH) has been unable to fully investigate the large number of complaints it 
receives partly because of financial constraints.124 In Nigeria, the Police Service 
Commission has the legislative potential to be a very effective civilian oversight institution, 
but it is far from realising its potential due, in part, to a lack of financial and other 
resources, which also exacerbate a lack of independence from the police and politicians.125 
Agencies in countries where civilian oversight has been considered successful overall, such 
as South Africa and Northern Ireland, tend to be more well-funded. Yet, even so, the South 
African Independent Complaints Directorate has stated that due to under-staffing, it has not 
always been able to manage the entire influx of complaints it receives.126  
</p>
<p>48. Because of the role that external agencies can play in tackling impunity, they are a 
worthwhile investment of state resources. However, external review can be an expensive 
undertaking, particularly where oversight mechanisms operate completely independently of 
the police by employing professional investigators and conducting inquiries separate from 
internal police processes. In weighing up the costs and benefits, countries should also bear 
in mind not only the importance of the rights at stake, but that the financial cost of 
continued police violence is also high. For example, between 1995 and 1998, 1,489 civil 
claims were brought against the South African Police Service on the basis of excessive use 
of force, and the police service disbursed over 50 million Rand in settlement and 
remedies.127 Where the funding of oversight mechanisms is difficult because of the 
country&#8217;s limited financial resources (e.g. in the context of developing, post conflict, or 
fragile states) the international community can play an important supporting role. 
</p>
<p>49. One way in which limited resources can be used more efficiently by an agency is 
through selective oversight. Some agencies limit their work by dealing only with the most 
serious cases of police misconduct, such as extrajudicial executions, and otherwise act as a 
watchdog over internal reviews, conducting their own investigations only where internal 
review is deemed to have failed. The Independent Police Complaints Commission in the 
United Kingdom, for example, only investigates the most serious complaints and 
allegations of misconduct against the police, and automatically investigates death or serious 
injury. An agency may also be to divert certain types of complaint, such as those which do 
not involve the use of force, for mediation, which offers a more expeditious and less 
expensive means of dispute resolution.128 
</p>
<p>50. Human resources have proved to be as important as financial resources in allowing 
oversight bodies to fulfil their mandates. Skilled investigators and support staff are essential 
if an agency is to provide effective oversight. Highly skilled and dedicated staff in the 
Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, for example, have been able to undertake 
detailed and effective investigations that exposed police killings and police death squads in 
Nairobi.129 In contrast, the Salvadoran ombudsman has indicated that their investigations

<p>have been impeded by &#8220;the office&#8217;s shortage of qualified personnel and total lack of staff 
with expertise in policing.&#8221;130 In the hiring of external oversight mechanisms staff, expertise 
and professionalism should be encouraged. However, in some countries &#8211; where, for 
example, the country is newly emerging from conflict &#8211; skilled investigators and managers 
may not be readily available. In such cases, a lack of civilian expertise can severely hamper 
the operation of an oversight agency. External oversight agencies can work to overcome 
this by providing professional education and training for staff. In South Africa, the ICD 
sought to address the lack of investigative skills among its staff through training, with help 
from the US Department of Justice International Criminal Investigation Training Assistance 
Program.131 Civil society members may also provide a pool of expertise for oversight 
agencies, either by providing training or as staffing candidates with experience of human 
rights investigation.132 While foreign aid targeted towards improving policing is usually 
directed at the police force itself (e.g. in providing technology, expertise and training, as 
seen in Colombia133 and Haiti134), the international community can also improve police 
accountability by extending assistance programs to external oversight agencies. 
International actors can play a much-needed role by providing training, experts or other 
external agency development assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Independence 
</b></p>
<p>51. The independence of a civilian oversight mechanism is essential to its successful 
functioning. Without full operational and hierarchical independence from the police, an 
external mechanism is vulnerable to the same dangers of bias and corruption inherent in 
police internal investigations. Similarly, effectiveness also depends on the agency&#8217;s 
freedom from executive or political interference.  
</p>
<p>52. Independence from the police has a number of different aspects. To avoid the risk 
and appearance of potential bias, the membership of an external agency should not include 
any members of the police force. Where it is necessary in a particular context for a police 
investigator to be seconded to an external agency or otherwise provide investigation 
expertise, extra precautions should be taken to ensure that this does not undermine the 
agency&#8217;s independence or collapse the separation between external oversight and police 
internal affairs. The agency&#8217;s offices should also be physically separated from the police. 
Until August 2004, the Jamaican Police Public Complaints Authority was housed within a 
police department, which may have deterred complainants and hampered its ability to act 
independently.135

<p>53. Independence can be threatened at a deeper structural level where the agency has the 
same reporting lines as the police force (e.g. where both the police and the external agency 
report to the government&#8217;s minister for security). An external agency would find it difficult 
in some countries to provide independent oversight in these circumstances, and especially 
where, for example, the minister and the chief of police jointly supported overly aggressive 
or militarized policy tactics and strategies. In South Africa, where the ICD reports to the 
Minister for Safety and Security (to which the police also report), debate has ensued about 
whether there is a conflict or potential for undue influence.136 Parliamentary proposals to 
strengthen independence have included efforts to relocate the ICD under the Ministry of 
Justice and to hold the ICD directly accountable to parliament,137 although none of these 
have yet taken effect. Where, in a particular country context, it is most appropriate for the 
police and the external agency to report to the same minister, independence can be 
encouraged by requiring that minister to table the agency&#8217;s reports before, as relevant, the 
country&#8217;s parliament, national assembly, or senate. 
</p>
<p>54. In order to provide effective oversight, an agency will generally need the powers 
(discussed above) to conduct its own independent investigations. Without the legal power 
to independently investigate, or without adequate resources and properly trained staff, an 
external agency&#8217;s oversight can be vulnerable to police influence. In South Africa, for 
example, due to funding deficits, the ICD has been forced to rely upon the South African 
Police Services for forensic, medical and ballistic evidence and analysis, reducing its 
functional independence from the police.138 In contrast, the Police Integrity Commission of 
New South Wales, Australia maintains strict functional independence in its investigations. 
Strong independence can have downsides, however. Increased independence from the 
police can lead to increased antagonism and less cooperation from them. Though highly 
independent oversight bodies tend to receive more complaints from witnesses than those 
with closer ties to the police, they also frequently have difficulty accessing police evidence 
or records. As Rachel Neild notes, &#8220;this prompts some experts to argue that civilian review 
officials must see themselves as being in a partnership with police.&#8221;139 While external 
mechanisms and the police should have the same general aims (e.g. providing security and 
accountability for citizens), and should operate with mutual respect, a close &#8220;partnership&#8221; 
approach would generally undermine a crucial objective of the external mechanism &#8211; to 
provide oversight and review of police conduct. In addition, as Neild states, if a &#8220;review 
body seeks to work intimately with the police, it can often jeopardize its credibility with the 
community&#8221;.140 To reduce the risk of police service capture of external agencies, where a 
government seeks to establish an effective external mechanism that is highly independent 
from the police, it is essential not only that it be adequately resourced in order to avoid 
undue reliance on police expertise, but also that it be given the power to compel police 
cooperation. A strong mechanism will have a mandate that explicitly refers to its 
independence from the police service.

<p>55. Political interference with the operation of civilian oversight mechanisms can 
severely hamper their ability to function. Political pressure is most often exercised through 
funding pressures or control over hiring and dismissal. 
</p>
<p>56. Agency members should be democratically appointed. Where agency members are 
appointed solely by a politician, the body is left open to accusations of being politically 
influenced and motivated. (An example is provided in Kenya, where the fact that the 
Internal Security Minister is the sole authority to hire or fire the members of the Police 
Oversight Board has resulted in significant criticism). One way of combating this can be to 
require cross-party consultation, or agreement, before appointments are made. In both 
Northern Ireland and South Africa, appointment of senior level members requires 
consultation with a number of bodies, including parliamentary committees. In Northern 
Ireland, The Ombudsman is appointed for a period of 7 years, on recommendation from the 
executive, in accordance with appointment guidelines set by the Commissioner for Public 
Appointments141, and with no possibility of re-appointment. The potential Ombudsman 
must go through a consultative vetting process involving independent assessors measuring 
merit, and must declare any political activities from the preceding five years. The 
Commissioner of Public Appointments may issue a public notice if adequate selection 
procedures have not been followed. In Brazil, the S&#227;o Paulo <i>ouvidoria </i>has often been 
praised for its efforts, while the Rio de Janeiro <i>ouvidoria </i>has been criticised. Part of the 
difference may be attributed to different appointment procedures: the <i>ouvidoria </i>in S&#227;o 
Paulo is selected from a shortlist of nominations provided by the State Council for the 
Defence of the Rights of the Human Person, which has 80% representation from civil 
society;142 but the <i>ouvidoria </i>in Rio de Janeiro is selected by the State Security Secretary, 
who also controls the police force, diminishing its independence. In Kenya, the Police 
Oversight Board has been established as a &#8220;semi-autonomous body answerable to the State 
through the Minister&#8221;. It therefore reports to the Minister of Internal Security rather than 
directly to Parliament. The Kenya National Commission for Human Rights has expressed 
concern that this severely compromises the operational independence of the Police 
Oversight Board from the executive.143 
</p>
<p>57. Tenure of appointment is also important to ensure that members feel confident in 
asserting their independence and that they can be critical, where appropriate and necessary, 
of officials or government policy. 
</p>
<p>58. Independence also requires that individual members of the oversight body operate 
with independence from political or other inappropriate personal affiliation, and do not 
operate in a way that is biased, discriminatory or corrupt. Oversight agencies should also 
take steps to ensure that their staff do not become corrupt. In South Africa, the discovery of 
a corrupt investigator at the ICD led to his dismissal and criminal charges against him. 
These preventative actions and measures of redress can help to preserve the integrity of 
external oversight mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>59. Independence can be undermined where the agency is not set up by legislation or 
required by a country&#8217;s constitution. The Police Oversight Board in Kenya, for example, 
while being an important step towards accountability, suffers from an important flaw in this 
respect. It was established not by act of parliament or by constitutional amendment, but by

<p>gazette notice by the Minister for Internal Security.144 The gazette notice can easily be 
repealed by the Minister merely by a similar notice in the gazette. 
</p>
<p>60. Financial independence from the executive is key to ensuring the overall 
independent functioning of an external oversight mechanism. For example, despite 
guarantees built into the appointment process and tenure of the S&#227;o Paulo <i>ouvidoria</i>, the 
office still remains vulnerable to political influence as there are no budget guarantees, 
rendering the office completely financially dependent on the Ministry of Public Security. In 
Cameroon, where budget allocation is not under democratic control, the Human Rights 
Commission, which is mandated to investigate police misconduct and which is subject to 
close Presidential control, had its funding cut for two years following its criticism of 
government abuses.145 Subsequently, it has avoided investigating and reporting cases of 
human rights violations by security agencies; instead focusing on human rights promotion 
activities. By contrast, in Uganda, the Human Rights Commission, which oversees police 
human rights violations within its broader mandate, is allocated its budget by Parliament. 
Its financial independence is guaranteed by the Constitution146 and Parliament is required 
by law to ensure its resources are sufficient to promote its proper functioning.147 To create a 
strong external agency, funding should be placed under parliamentary or democratic control 
(ie., the budget should be voted by the country&#8217;s legislative organ), with inbuilt guarantees 
as to the minimum size of the annual budget, and the time at which it will be disbursed 
(rather than have such decisions left to the whim of the executive). In addition, subject to 
necessary auditing, the agency&#8217;s &#8220;budget should be self administered without 
interference&#8221;.148 
</p>
<p><b> D. Transparency and reporting 
</b></p>
<p>61. Transparency and public reporting are of vital importance to the long-term success 
of an external civilian oversight agency. 
</p>
<p>62. Regular and comprehensive reporting serves both to help make the agency 
accountable to the public, and also can have a significant impact on the accountability of 
security forces for extrajudicial killings. Reporting requirements should be set out in the 
legislation setting up the external agency, so that performance is less tied to personality. 
Regular reports should be provided by the agency on its activities to its responsible minister 
or to the government&#8217;s legislative organ, and also made publicly available. The agency 
should also maintain a website with easily accessible information for the public on the work 
of the agency, how to make complaints, and data on police abuses or other relevant studies. 
The <i>ouvidoria </i>of S&#227;o Paulo has been especially successful in maintaining detailed, 
disaggregated annual data on police abuses, which has been helpful in providing more 
accurate information on police involvement in organized crime.149 This information, in turn,

<p>can facilitate policymaking and generate public demand for a more accountable police 
force.150 In general, police violations should be as publicly reported as possible, taking into 
account the need for confidentiality and witness protection. 
</p>
<p>63. The agency should also ensure that it responds in a timely fashion to citizen 
complaints, and that it communicates investigation progress or outcomes to the relevant 
individuals. In Brazil, a survey of complainants found that 62% were not satisfied by the 
work of the ombudsman, a result which can be explained in part by the fact that 56% of 
those surveyed did not know the results of their complaint.151 Similar problems have arisen 
in the Philippines. The availability of information to the general public on the People&#8217;s Law 
Enforcement Boards appears to be limited; and there is no provision in the constituting acts 
for publication of Board reports or conclusions in matters heard.152 
</p>
<p>64. To promote transparency, information about the financing of the agency should be 
made widely available, in a form which is easily accessible to the public, with all expenses 
included in the budget.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Community and political support and civil society involvement 
</b></p>
<p>65. An external oversight mechanism will be more successful where it has community 
and political support, and where it involves civil society in its work. 
</p>
<p>66. In many countries emerging from long periods of instability, or where street or 
violent crime levels are high, politicians and the public may support a &#8220;tough approach to 
crime&#8221;, including violent policing methods. This can be seen in the calls for an &#8220;iron fist&#8221; 
(<i>mano dura)</i> response to crime throughout much of Latin America.153 A Latinobar&#243;metro 
poll showed that 47% of interviewees in Guatemala supported the use of <i>mano dura</i>, while 
in Honduras 55% accepted the uses of extralegal actions by police to curb crime.154 In 
Brazil the slogan &#8220;a good criminal is a dead criminal&#8221; has been used in political campaigns, 
reflecting the high level of support for violent police practices and the perception that 
support for human rights is synonymous with weak anti-crime efforts.155 A continent-wide 
study of police oversight in Africa reported that police inability to stem high rates of crime

<p>have led to similar calls for tougher policing tactics, and support for the ever-increasing 
number of armed vigilante groups.156 In South Africa, in late 2008, the Deputy Safety and 
Security Minister urged police to adopt a &#8220;shoot-to-kill&#8221; policy with respect to suspected 
criminals,157 an approach supported more recently by the country's police minister.158 
</p>
<p>67. These views can lead to deep antagonism towards the work of police external 
oversight agencies. In South Africa, for example, a recommendation by the ICD that police 
officers recorded assaulting suspects be prosecuted met with hostility from the public.159 
The government, the agency, civil society and international actors will often need to take 
positive steps to promote human rights based policing. It is understandable that citizens 
threatened by daily violence and rising crime have demanded that their government take 
steps to increase security. However, human rights violations and abuse by the police against 
&#8220;suspected criminals&#8221; and others is not the answer. Citizens do not have to tolerate regular 
abuses of their rights in the name of security. Violent policing methods are not only 
unlawful, but also counter-productive. Innocent citizens inevitably get caught up in the 
police violence. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s country missions, he has repeatedly met 
family members of innocent individuals killed by the police. Violent policing, in the long-
term, deeply corrodes public trust and confidence in the police force, undermines the 
development of the criminal justice system, and is often accompanied by regular police 
corruption and extortion. Abusive policing methods do not guarantee human security &#8211; in 
democratic societies, effective policing is based on respect for human rights and 
cooperation with the public.160 Democratic, human-rights based policing methods 
encourage greater co-operation between the public and the police, which can in turn assist 
police in their investigations.161 Officials should undertake to promote these views, and 
explain the role of external agencies in promoting accountability and security.  
</p>
<p>68. At a more straightforward level, the external agency will often need to conduct 
significant community outreach so that citizens are aware of its role. Where an agency is 
unknown or not trusted, complaints will be reported to the police or often not at all; at best 
this contributes to inefficiency in the accountability system, and at worst it potentially

<p>enhances opportunities for police corruption and bias in the handling of the complaint.162 
External oversight agencies should also ensure that they conduct outreach to and seek 
support from communities affected by police killings, in particular those which are 
marginalised. In Brazil, for example, several of the <i>ouvidoria</i> offices were found to be 
failing to reach out to poorer members of the community (who are especially affected by 
violent policing in <i>favelas</i>), and in India, complaints have been directed at the Human 
Rights Commissions for giving less attention to complaints individuals perceived to be of 
&#8220;lower caste&#8221;.163 This undermines the work of oversight agencies and limits their success in 
providing accountability. External oversight mechanisms should work to ensure that 
minority groups, women and other sidelined communities are included in the work of the 
agency, and ensure their representation within agency staff.  
</p>
<p>69. Civilian oversight bodies should also strive to create an environment conducive to 
active civil society participation in their work, and in the broader aim of increasing police 
accountability. In Colombia, failure to engage with civil society and gain the support of 
human rights groups has been pointed to as one of the factors which contributed to the 
failure of the National Police Commissioner.164 whose office was disbanded less than four 
years after it was created.165 In contrast, in Peru, the government has involved civil society 
in oversight of the police in a relatively formal way, by forming agreements with NGOs to 
monitor the police, and other security agencies, as well as allocating ombudsmen to deal 
with complaints.166 In S&#227;o Paulo, campaigning by civil society and human rights groups 
played a key role in supporting the <i>ouividora</i> and advocating greater accountability for 
police abuses. 
</p>
<p>70. Oversight bodies should consult with civil society on a regular basis, especially 
where civil society has greater community outreach or monitoring capacity than the agency 
itself. Civil society organisations are often well-placed to provide valuable expertise, 
training, research and input on reform policies. Especially where external agency resources 
are scarce, civil society can aid in outreach efforts, or bring abuse allegations to the 
attention of the agency. Greater civil society participation can also improve community 
support for an agency, by providing a bridge between the oversight body and the 
community it serves, particularly where the oversight mechanism is newly established and 
has yet to gain the trust of citizens. In order to maximise the potential input of civil society 
actors, external police oversight bodies should create mechanisms by which civil society 
suggestions and reforms can be heard and incorporated into policies and practice.

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>International human rights law requires governments to provide accountability 
for unlawful killings and other human rights abuses committed by the police. Those 
responsible must be investigated, prosecuted, convicted and punished. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Accountability is provided by a system which generally includes police internal 
affairs, the criminal justice system, and legislative oversight. External civilian 
oversight is also important. It might include an external complaints body, a police or 
general ombudsman, a police oversight board or a national human rights commission, 
or a combination thereof. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Because of the inevitable bias inherent in internal police investigations and 
internal disciplinary mechanisms, all governments should consider creating an 
external police oversight agency. 
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> The most successful external police oversight mechanisms will take account of 
the following general guidelines: 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Powers 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The mechanism should be authorised by legislation to receive complaints from 
any person. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Police should be required by law to report all deaths in police custody or due to 
police action to the external agency, and there should be penalties for delayed 
or non-reporting. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The agency should be required to record and track complaints and abuses and 
keep comprehensive records. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The agency should be authorised to undertake investigations into complaints 
received. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The agency should have the power to compel police cooperation with its 
investigations, and should have full investigatory powers, similar to those of a 
police investigator. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The agency should have the power to refer cases for criminal prosecution to the 
public prosecutor and suggest disciplinary measures to the police department. 
A strong agency will be able to enforce proposed disciplinary measures. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>An agency should be able to provide or refer witnesses to witness protection 
where necessary. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>An agency should be able to propose general reform measures on policing to 
the police force and the government. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Resources 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The mechanism should be adequately resourced and funded, and be provided 
sufficient funds to allow it to carry out comprehensive investigations and hire 
skilled staff. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Independence 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The mechanism should have full operational and hierarchical independence 
from the police, and be free from executive or political influence. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Police members of an external agency should generally be avoided. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/24/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p> <b>29 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The agency should generally have different reporting lines than the police 
department. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The agency should be constitutionally entrenched, or created through 
legislation (not executive order). 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The agency&#8217;s members should be democratically appointed following 
consultation with or approval by the legislature, and have security of tenure. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Financial independence should be secured by having the agency&#8217;s budget 
approved by the legislature, with statutory guarantees for the size and 
disbursement timing of the annual budget. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Transparency and reporting 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The mechanism should be required to issue regular reports to the government 
and the public on its activities. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>It should maintain a website with easily accessible information. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>It should respond in a timely fashion to citizen complaints. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>It should maintain detailed data on police abuses. Civilian oversight 
mechanisms are uniquely placed to conduct statistical or general reviews of 
patterns in police killings, including their causes, and should do so.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Its budget and expenses should be publicly reported. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Community and political support and civil society involvement 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The government should publicly supports the work of the agency. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Both the government and the agency should conduct community outreach to 
explain the agency&#8217;s role and the importance of police accountability. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The external mechanism should consult with and seek the support and 
involvement of civil society organisations in its work. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>When establishment of an external agency is being considered, domestic civil 
society and international actors can assist by encouraging the government to create an 
agency in accordance with the above general guidelines. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The international community should encourage governments to create external 
police oversight mechanisms. Existing agencies can be supported where appropriate 
by providing funding, training, experts or other assistance. Donor governments and 
agencies sometimes prioritize support for police training and neglect police 
accountability. While human rights training is important in reducing police killings, it 
is insufficient on its own. External oversight agencies should not be neglected and 
should receive the political and financial support necessary to tackle impunity.
