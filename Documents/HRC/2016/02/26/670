<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> its resolutions 16/11 of 24 March 2011, 19/10 of 22 March 2012 and 
</p>
<p>25/21 of 28 March 2014 on human rights and the environment, and relevant resolutions of 
</p>
<p>the Commission on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> General Assembly resolutions 60/251 of 15 March 2006 and 65/281 
</p>
<p>of 17 June 2011, and Human Rights Council resolution 16/21 of 25 March 2011, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>and 5/2 on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the Council, of 
</p>
<p>18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his or her duties in 
</p>
<p>accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also </i>the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012, and its outcome document, &#8220;The 
</p>
<p>future we want&#8221;, which reaffirmed the principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment 
</p>
<p>and Development, including principle 7, and aiming to contribute to follow-up processes, 
</p>
<p>including the realization of sustainable development goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable 
</p>
<p>development, that the right to development must be fulfilled in order to meet the 
</p>
<p>development and environmental needs of present and future generations equitably, and that 
</p>
<p>the human person is the central subject of development and should be an active participant 
</p>
<p>in and the beneficiary of the right to development, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
</p>
<p>interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that sustainable development and the protection of the environment can 
</p>
<p>contribute to human well-being and to the enjoyment of human rights,

</p>
<p>and use of natural resources and the unsound management of chemicals and waste may 
</p>
<p>interfere with the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and that 
</p>
<p>environmental damage can have negative implications, both direct and indirect, for the 
</p>
<p>effective enjoyment of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing further</i> that, while the human rights implications of environmental 
</p>

</p>
<p>most acutely by those segments of the population already in vulnerable situations, 
</p>
