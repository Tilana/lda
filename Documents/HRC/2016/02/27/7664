<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Observations by Myanmar on the Report of the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar 
(A/HRC/25/64) 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Prisoners of conscience 
</b></p>
<p>1. Paragraph 4 of the Report contains the allegations of continued detention of 
prisoners of conscience and continued arrest and imprisonment for their peaceful political 
activities. 
</p>
<p>2. The President&#8217;s Office issued a pardon under Order No (51/2013) on 30 December 
2013, in order to remove the offenses that were thought to be tied with politics for those 
convicted and prosecuted in connection with other offensives. The order further enabled all 
cases, under seven laws, being heard by respective courts to be dropped immediately and 
all ongoing investigations to be closed without any further action.  
</p>
<p>3. These allegations are unfounded. Nobody is in prison on political grounds. 
Maintenance of law and order is a key responsibility of the government. Legal action is 
taken against those who violated the existing laws.  
</p>
<p>4. It is, in fact, the three locally-recruited INGO workers were arrested and detained 
under Section 436 of the Penal Code for their involvement in arson attacks on Bo Hmuu 
Village and Waitharli Village in connection with the communal violence that occurred in 
Rakhine State in June 2012. They had been employed as driver, security staff and food 
distributor, respectively.  Tun Aung was sentenced under several charges which includes 
the falsification of national registration certificate, among others. Kyaw Hla Aung was 
charged under Section 148/333/150 of the Penal Code for his involvement in inciting a 
violent attack on the civil service personnel who were conducting the population 
verification pilot project in Thetkaipyin village in Sittway in April 2013.  
</p><p>5. Than Shwe was detained for his involvement in a mob attack on a police station near 
Ohn Taw Gyi village in Sittway Township, arson attacks on four office buildings and 
inciting the mob on 9 August 2013. He is facing five charges at Sittway Township Court. 
The allegation that he is detained because he tried to meet with the Special Rapporteur is 
not true.       
</p>
<p><b> II. Conditions of detention and treatment of prisoners 
</b>6. Paragraph 8 of the Report contains the allegations of ongoing practice of torture in 
places of detention and the absence of accountability.  
</p>
<p>7. The Report acknowledges the use of CCTV cameras in city police stations of 
Myanmar. By using CCTV cameras, families and communities can watch interrogations 
and it would be able to record and use in courts as evidences if necessary. In case of the 
individuals mentioned in Paragraph 8, disciplinary actions were taken against the 
responsible police personnel. Section 300 of the Penal Code states: &#8220;Whoever, in the 
absence of any circumstance which makes the act of one of culpable homicide not 
amounting to murder, causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or 
with intention of causing bodily injury as in fact is sufficient in the ordinary course of 
nature to cause death, commits the offence to murder&#8221;. According to Section 300, the case 
would have to send to the civil court in addition to the police court. The cases mentioned in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/64/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>. </b>3 
</p>
<p>the Report were inconsistent with the definition of Section 300 of the Penal Code. The 
Police disciplinary law includes sections with regard to the criminal acts and crimes with 
sufficient evidence have been sent to the civil court to charge in accordance with the 
committed crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>8.  Since August 2012, all publications have been exempted from pre-publishing 
censorship. In September 2012, the Press Council, comprising representatives of media 
personnel and journalists, was formed to coordinate media-related matters before a new 
media law is enacted. In January 2013, the government dissolved the Press Scrutiny and 
Registration Board. Publication of private daily newspapers has begun since April 2013. 
Currently, there are eighteen private dailies in the country. Twelve foreign news agencies 
have opened offices in Myanmar. No restrictions are imposed on the use of internet. People 
from Myanmar are now increasingly using social media. The most important indicator of a 
modern democratic society, the freedom to openly discuss and debate politics, is growing as 
every individual is now able to express their opinions freely through the news media and 
social networks. 
</p>
<p>9. The Government of Myanmar is aware of the concerns of domestic media 
organizations, including the Myanmar Press Council (Interim), and international media 
organizations over the government&#8217;s investigation of five journalists. The journalists in 
question enjoy all their legal rights during the investigation period. The judiciary will 
adjudicate an independent and fair trial on the said journalists in accord with the judicial 
principles. 
</p>
<p>10. The allegations contain that are contain in Paragraph 21 are not true. For instance, 
during the protest against the visit of the OIC delegation on 15 November, protestors held 
banners without obtaining a prior permission from the local authorities though they were 
allowed to stage protest peacefully. A case has been file against those who used such 
banners without prior permission. This response also answers allegations that are contained 
in Paragraph 45 of the Report.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Situation of ethnic border areas 
</b>11. Paragraphs 34 and 35 contain allegations of sexual violence against Kachin women, 
47 cases of gang rape and human rights violations accompanying military offensives and 
the absence of accountability. 
</p>
<p>12. Members of the military need to strictly abide by both the military and civilian laws. 
Prosecutions against perpetrators have been conducted both at the military courts and civil 
courts. As a party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, Myanmar has incorporated relevant 
provisions of the conventions into its Military Code of Conduct. There is zero tolerance 
policy against any sexual misconduct for the military personnel. From January to December 
2013, 8 military personnel who committed rape cases were sentenced by the military courts 
for their absence from the relevant military units without leave and for drunkenness and 
they were discharged from the military. Then, they were sent to the civil courts to face the 
rape charges. Severe punishments were given to them ranging from seven years 
imprisonment to death penalty. It is unfortunate that the figures contained in Paragraph 34 
of the Report have never been verified with the Government. 
</p>
<p>13. It is regrettable that the Report ignores the reports and complaints made by Shan 
Ethnic Affairs Group during his last visit to Kachin State. Local Shan community has been 
threatened by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in different ways including attacks </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/64/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>4<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>against the villages, forced recruitments of Shan youths, collecting money from the 
villagers even after agreements have made with the Government after two rounds of peace 
talks not to commit such acts. The local Shan community staged protests against the KIA in 
December 2013 to stop the forced recruitment of the young people. These incidents are too 
obvious to be ignored. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Situation in Rakhine State  
</b>14. Paragraph 42 alleges no improvements in the human rights situation in Rakhine 
State. It also alleges that there is no clear action at the State and Union level to address the 
widespread discrimination and human rights violations occurring there. Paragraph 44 
contains allegations of the violations of the right to freedom of movement, access to 
healthcare, education, livelihoods and places of worship. 
</p>
<p>15. It is very unfortunate that the Report could not reflect the situation objectively, 
thereby misleading the readers. There is no restriction on the freedom of movement of the 
IDPs. Security presence in IDP camps is simply to prevent recurrence of communal 
violence while the level of distrust between the two communities is still high. The two 
communities are staying separately because they feel that they are safer that way. It will 
take time for both communities to heal themselves to relieve from mental trauma. It needs 
to wait for a reasonable time until both communities regain mutual understanding and trust. 
Neither the government nor others can force them to live side-by-side. The Government, 
together with religious and community leaders, has encouraged and facilitated interfaith 
dialogues and community dialogues in Rakhine State since June 2012. IDPs have access to 
places of worship and no restriction are imposed on them.   
</p>
<p>16. The Government established a Central Committee for Implementation of Stability 
and Development in Rakhine State (CCISD) on March 23, 2013. CCISD is chaired by 
Vice-President Dr. Sai Mauk Kham and its subcommittees are headed by six Ministers. Six 
subcommittees on the rule of law, security and law enforcement, immigration and 
verification of citizenship, social and economic development, temporary resettlement and 
rehabilitation, cooperation with UN agencies and international organizations and strategic 
planning have been implementing the policies adopted by the CCISD, the recommendations 
of the Rakhine Investigation Commission and other necessary actions. Regrettably, the 
steps taken by the Government have been ignored totally by the Report.    
</p>
<p>17. It is regrettable that the figures contained in Paragraph 44 of the Report have never 
been verified with the Government.  
</p>
<p>18. It is very unfortunate that the Special Rapporteur could not see the situation from the 
perspective of independence and impartiality although the Government has extended its 
cooperation and invited him 9 times to see the reality through his visits to the country. The 
Special Rapporteur not only shied away verifying the allegations, but he himself also has 
involved in fabricating claims to mislead public opinion. Successive reports fail to mention 
the feelings and concerns of the Rakhine community. 
</p>
<p>19. In this connection, Myanmar would like to highlight some missing points in the 
Report which were mentioned in the Communique issued by Heads of Missions of the 
European Union in Yangon after their visit to Rakhine State in February 2014 as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;4. It emerged clearly from the discussions that both Buddhist and Muslim 
communities have suffered tremendous trauma in recent months. Both communities 
live in poverty and fear. Despite some radical voices, the mission understands that 
what both sides have in common is the aspiration of achieving security, peace and 
prosperity in Rakhine State. Confidence and trust should be restored to create the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/64/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>. </b>5 
</p>
<p>basis for a lasting solution through reconciliation, the respect for the rule of law and 
eventually economic development.  
</p>
<p>5. In meetings with Rakhine Buddhists, the mission was struck by the pride with 
which they spoke about their history. They also talked about the perceived threat to 
their identity and to what they consider their territory, mentioning what they 
perceive as an imbalanced population growth. The mission took note of their request 
that all people of Rakhine State should respect the rule of law, in particular the 1982 
Citizenship Law. Rakhine Buddhist interlocutors also stressed that all people of 
Rakhine State should participate in the Government's initiatives such as the 
verification exercise and the census.&#8221;    
</p>
<p>20. In connection with the alleged incident in Du Chee Yar Tan village in Maung Taw 
Township, the Rakhine Investigation Commission and the Myanmar National Human 
Rights Commission visited the village in January and in February 2014.  
</p>
<p>21. The Rakhine Investigation Commission found only evidences for the murder of 
Police Sgt Aung Kyaw Thein; those who were allegedly killed do not actually exist in Du 
Chee Yar Tan village and the nearby areas. One lady falsely claimed herself as a witness 
who saw her one of her relatives killed. However, it is found out that her relative was only 
detained, not killed. There were also no evidences of recent burial at the burial ground. The 
allegation that Bengalis who were killed in the conflict were buried there is totally wrong. 
The commission only found the burial ground covered with bushes.   
</p>
<p>22. The Myanmar National Human Rights Commission reaches the conclusion: &#8220;The 
news of killing of 8 Bengalis and 40 Bengalis did not emerge in the Ducheeratan village 
tract and it is therefore concluded that the said news is unverifiable and unconfirmed.&#8221; 
Furthermore, the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission states: &quot; As a result of the 
investigations by District Administrator and Township Medical Officer, it was also learnt 
from two doctors of the MSF that their clinics did not treat such patients.&quot; Full statement of 
the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission can be found in the 15 February 2014 
issue of the New Light of Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>23. Furthermore, an independent investigation commission with ten members was 
formed by the President on 6 February 2014 to investigate the reports in connection with 
the reports on Du Chee Yan Tan village. The commission submitted its report to the 
President directly on 28 February 2014. The report has not been released to the public yet. 
</p>
<p>24. In Paragraph 48 of the Report, the Special Rapporteur mentions that the domestic 
investigations have so far failed to satisfactorily address these serious allegations. He goes 
on to recommend that the Human Rights Council works with the Government to establish a 
credible investigation. These observations by the Special Rapporteur are obviously 
prejudiced. It is to be construed that he is prejudging the report of the independent 
investigation commission formed by the President even before it is released. We will not 
take his recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Paragraph 49 of the Report shows that the Special Rapporteur does not have a 
sufficient understanding about the background of the 1982 Myanmar Citizenship Act. 
Therefore, we are glad to provide the following points for his information; 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  The Union Citizenship Act and the Union Citizenship (Election) Act were 
enacted in 1948. The latter aimed at the foreigners residing in the territory of 
Myanmar to be able to choose their citizenship. Its validity ended in 1950. At the 
time of independence in 1948, there were a large number of foreigners and mixed-
bloods residing in Myanmar.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/64/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>6<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  Since the Union Citizenship Act 1948 was drafted during the time of the 
independence struggle, with limited influence of Myanmar people, it could not 
safeguard the national interest.  
</p>
<p>&#8226;  To address the loopholes of the Union Citizenship Act 1948, the Government 
sought suggestions and recommendations from the people in 1976. The new 
Citizenship Law was enacted in 1982 after six years of comprehensive review and 
discussions. 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  Section 3 of the 1982 Citizenship Act stipulates: &#8220;Nationals such as the 
Kachin, Kayah, Karen, Chin, Burman, Mon, Rakhine or Shan and ethnic groups as 
have settled in any of the territories included within the State as their permanent 
home from a period anterior to 1185 B.E., 1823 A.D. are citizens.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  Section 6 of the 1982 Citizenship Law stipulates: &#8220;A person who is already a 
citizen on the date this Law comes into force is a citizen.&#8221; Therefore, persons of 
Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, Nepali, Bengali decent, etc who became Myanmar 
citizens in accordance with the 1948 Union Citizenship Act  and the Union 
Citizenship (Election) Act continued to be recognize as Myanmar Citizens.  
</p>
<p>&#8226;  In addition to that, Section 23 of the 1982 Citizenship Law stipulates: 
&#8220;Applicants for citizenship under the Union Citizenship Act, 1948, conforming to 
the stipulations and qualifications may be determined as associate citizens by the 
Central Body.&#8221; and Section 42 of the said law stipulates: &#8220;Persons who have entered 
and resided in the State anterior to 4th January, 1948, and their offsprings born 
within the State may, if they have not yet applied under the Union Citizenship Act, 
1948, apply for naturalized citizenship to the Central Body, furnishing conclusive 
evidence.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>&#8226;  The 1982 Citizenship Act was born out of necessity, without targeting on any 
particular group. It has no ethnic, religious and cultural dimensions. 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  A population verification pilot process took place in April 2013 in Rakhine 
State. However, some groups made unreasonable demands that they be registered as 
&#8220;Rohingya&#8221;. They launched a violent attack on the public servants who were 
carrying out the pilot process. 
</p>
<p>&#8226;  It is crucial for the Bengali community to cooperate with the population 
verification pilot process since it is a starting point for resettlement, access to 
livelihoods and access to citizenship, among others. 
</p>
<p>26. Paragraph 51 of the Report contains wrongful conclusions alleging that the pattern 
of widespread and systematic human rights violations in Rakhine State may constitute 
crimes against humanity. This is too pessimistic a view incompatible with his status. It is 
regrettable that he is not mindful enough to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting 
moment.  
</p>
<p>The term &#8220;Rohingya&#8221; 
</p>
<p>27. The term &#8220;Rohingya&#8221; has never existed in our national history. It has also been the 
case with the censuses taken during the colonial period as well as those taken in 1973 and 
</p><p>1983. The said term is maliciously used by a group of people with ulterior motives. The 
people of Myanmar never recognizes it. Those who are not among the list of over 100 
ethnic groups of Myanmar, according to the country&#8217;s Constitution and official documents, 
have always been classified according to their ethnic roots as &#8220;Chinese&#8221;, &#8220;Indian&#8221;, 
&#8220;Bengali&#8221;, etc. For instance, Myanmar citizens of Chinese descent are mentioned on their 
national identification card as &#8220;Chinese/Myanmar.&#8221; </p>

</p>
<p>28.  Due to the limited time to respond to the Report, we are not able to visit other 
paragraphs yet. But, it should not be construed that we accept them. We still have 
reservations to some other elements in the Report.
