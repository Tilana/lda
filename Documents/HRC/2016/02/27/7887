</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report contains an analysis of the progress made in implementing the 
recommendations made by the former Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, Philip Alston, following his official visit to Albania from 15 to 23 
February 2010 (A/HRC/17/28/Add.3). During his visit, the previous mandate holder 
documented the phenomenon of blood feud killings, as well as deaths resulting from a 
pervasive level of domestic violence. He also examined killings which had occurred in the 
past and stressed the need to ensure accountability for them. His recommendations aimed at 
further decreasing the level of extrajudicial killings in Albania, fighting impunity and 
improving the overall functioning of the justice system. 
 Within the period under review, killings due to domestic violence continued to 
persist. Blood feud killings also continued to occur, although the lack of reliable data 
renders it difficult to refer to concrete figures and the dynamics of the phenomenon. 
</p>
<p> The Government of Albania has taken a number of steps, in particular in the field of 
the fight against domestic violence. While some results can be witnessed, efforts to combat 
domestic violence need to be further intensified. In the area of blood feud killings, serious 
research and statistical surveys remain necessary in order to understand the phenomenon 
and establish its scope and manifestations in Albania. 
</p>
<p> With regard to the delivery of justice for past violations of the right to life, the 
Special Rapporteur welcomes the cooperation of Albania with the European Union Rule of 
Law Mission in Kosovo on the investigation of allegations of crimes that may have

be also taken to establish the truth and ensure accountability for the killings and other 
violations committed during the communist regime. 
</p>
<p> In the field of justice and anti-corruption reform, important measures aimed at 
restricting the immunity of high-level officials, and some steps to ensure the independence

</p>
<p><b> I. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraph 8 of its resolution 17/5, the Human Rights Council urged States to, 
inter alia, cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions in the performance of his tasks, supply all necessary information 
requested by him, and ensure appropriate follow-up to his recommendations and 
conclusions, including by providing information on the actions taken on those 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur shares the views of the previous mandate holder on the 
importance of follow-up reports as an essential element of his work after the conduct of 
country visits and the formulation of recommendations on the protection of the right to life. 
Follow-up reports offer the opportunity to examine the progress made in respecting the 
right to life and the status of implementation of the respective recommendations within a 
certain time frame, thus ensuring continuity in the efforts to uphold human rights in the 
country visited. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with the established practice,1 the present report concerns the follow-
up to the recommendations made by the previous mandate holder, following his visit to 
Albania in 2010.  
</p>
<p>4. The report was prepared on the basis of all available information, including that 
requested from the Government and other actors, on the measures that had been taken to 
implement the recommendations formulated by the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessor. 
Information on the non-implementation of recommendations was also sought. Further 
information was gathered on the current situation concerning extrajudicial executions in the 
country, including on the extent to which the situation has improved, deteriorated or 
remained the same since the visit took place. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to all stakeholders who contributed 
to the preparation of the present report. He is particularly grateful to the Government of 
Albania for the information provided on measures taken to implement the recommendations 
made by his predecessor. 
</p>
<p>6. The present report was finalized on 9 April 2013. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>7. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur analyses the steps taken by Albania to 
implement the recommendations made by the previous mandate holder, following his visit 
to the country from 15 to 23 February 2010. The findings of the visit and the 
recommendations thereof were contained in the country visit report (A/HRC/17/28/Add.3), 
presented to the Human Rights Council at its seventeenth session. 
</p>
<p>8. In the country visit report, the previous mandate holder acknowledged the progress 
made by Albania in the field of human rights protection and rule of law. In parallel, he 
highlighted the major challenges that persisted in the country, such as corruption, limited 
resources and a tense political situation. With respect to the right to life, the previous 
mandate holder drew attention to the phenomenon of blood feud killings, as well as to the 
pervasive level of domestic violence against women, which had resulted in victims&#8217; deaths. 
</p>
<p>                                                          
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
  In 2006, the previous mandate holder initiated the practice of preparing follow-up reports on country 
</p>
<p>visits to examine the extent to which States implement recommendations formulated in the country 
visit reports. The practice has been followed by the Special Rapporteur on a regular basis. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>5 
</b></p>
<p>He also examined killings which occurred in the past, in particular the killings and related 
disappearances following the armed conflict in Kosovo2 and during the communist era, as 
well as the unlawful deaths that occurred after an explosion at an Albanian military 
ammunition base in G&#235;rdec in 2008. The previous mandate holder concluded that there was 
a need to ensure accountability in all cases of killings, in particular those perpetrated in the 
past. He put forward a series of recommendations to further decrease the current level of 
extrajudicial killings in Albania, fight impunity and improve the overall functioning of the 
justice system. 
</p><p>9. The Special Rapporteur would like to take note of the information received 
regarding recent unlawful deaths in Albania that were not addressed in the country visit 
report, and therefore will also not be examined in this follow-up report. In particular, he 
was informed of deaths that occurred in the context of a demonstration held on 21 January 
2011 by the Albanian Socialist Party in Tirana, in front of the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office. As a 
consequence of clashes between the demonstrators and law enforcements officers, four 
persons were fatally shot.3 On 7 February 2013, two senior members of the Republican 
Guard, charged with murder, were reportedly acquitted by Tirana District Court. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that an appeal has been filed by the prosecution to challenge the 
acquittal decision, as well as that reports indicate risks of improper influence on the 
investigation, prosecution and trial processes. He therefore underscores the importance of 
ensuring impartial, thorough and prompt proceedings, with the aim to bring all those 
responsible to justice. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Killings related to blood feuds 
</b></p>
<p>10. In the country visit report, the previous mandate holder analysed in detail the 
phenomenon of blood feuds and related killings, which were defined by him as 
premeditated revenge killing by a member of a murder victim&#8217;s family, committed to 
allegedly restore honour lost as a result of the initial killing. The practice of blood feuds 
derives from a set of culturally embedded rules, known as <i>Kanun</i>. The Special Rapporteur 
found at the time of his visit that, while the killings had decreased steadily, the phenomenon 
had not yet been eliminated. It had particularly negative consequences on the families of the 
murderer, who often chose to isolate themselves for fear of lethal reprisal. 
</p>
<p>11. To facilitate the efforts of the Albanian authorities to further reduce and eliminate 
blood feuds and related killings, the previous mandate holder put forward a series of 
recommendations which focused on the need to strengthen policy coordination, gather 
reliable statistical data and conduct comprehensive research on the scope and roots of the 
phenomenon in Albania, as well as to develop outreach and relevant education activities. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Continued occurrence of blood feud killings 
</b></p>
<p>12. At present, blood feuds and related killings appear to still occur in Albania and 
constitute an issue of concern. The lack of comprehensive and fully reliable statistical data 
</p>
<p>                                                          
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 In the present report, all reference to the term &#8220;Kosovo&#8221;, whether to the territory, institutions or 
</p>
<p>population, should be understood to be in full compliance with Security Council resolution 1244 
(1999) and without prejudice to the status of Kosovo. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
  The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights conducted a visit to Albania, from 13 to 15 
</p>
<p>February 2011, to examine the human rights aspects of the events of 21 January 2011. His findings 
are presented in his special report of 22 February 2011, available from 
https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1750237&amp;Site=CommDH&amp;BackColorInternet=FEC65B&amp;Back
ColorIntranet=F EC65B&amp;BackColorLogged=FFC679. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.4 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>renders it difficult to refer to concrete figures of the current scope of the phenomenon and 
analyse its dynamics. In parallel, information received from various sources confirms that 
such killings still affect the population in some parts of the country, in particular in the 
northern areas of Albania.4 Some families still opt for self-isolation due to fear of reprisal. 
</p>
<p>13. According to the information provided to the Special Rapporteur by the Government 
of Albania, the official statistics of the General Directorate of State Police indicate that five 
blood feud killings and five revenge motivated killings occurred in 2010; five blood feud 
killings and four revenge motivated killings took place in 2011; and two blood feud killings 
and two revenge motivated killings were registered in the first six months of 2012. 
According to the same source, as of early April 2013, there were 67 self-isolated families 
due to blood feuds, and 33 children not attending school for the same reason. Of those 
children, 23 were registered in the region of Shkodra, in northern Albania. 
</p>
<p>14. Furthermore, the current statistical data gathered by the Ministry of Justice from 
district courts, as made available by the Government of Albania, indicate that 50 cases of 
revenge and blood feud killings were filed with the courts in the period from January 2010 
to June 2012. A total of 24 cases were filed in 2010, 17 cases were filed in 2011, while the 
first six months of 2012 registered 9 cases. From the point of view of the Government, 
these figures from the Ministry of Justice indicate a trend of reduction of blood feud crimes 
during the last two years. However, it is unclear to the Special Rapporteur to what extent 
the statistical data provided on cases in courts reflect the actual situation of blood feud-
related killings in the country. He recalls in this regard the comments made by his 
predecessor on the challenges to accurately define the extent of the phenomenon, due to the 
parallel use of several differing definitions and the fragmentation of statistical data, as well 
as to the possible underreporting by both affected families and officials. 
</p>
<p>15. According to credible information received by the Special Rapporteur, blood feud 
killings continue to occur in part due to a tendency of the judiciary to impose lighter 
sentences on perpetrators, despite the fact that the Criminal Code of Albania provides for 
serious penalties for blood feud murder or threat. This aspect is a valid concern in cases of 
domestic violence deaths as well and therefore will be developed in more detail in chapter 
IV of the present report. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur received further information that current blood feud killings 
sometimes no longer follow the traditional pattern established by the Kanun rules, which 
reportedly authorize the killing of male members of a family, and strictly forbid killing 
women and children. In the current context, following a conflict situation, there are cases 
where a person may feel vindicated in killing the other individual or any member of his 
family, including women and children. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes with 
concern the reported killing, in a blood feud, of a 14-year-old girl in May 2012.5 
</p>
<p><b> B. Measures to define the phenomenon of blood feud killings 
</b></p>
<p>17. The former mandate holder stressed the vital need of measures to study the 
phenomenon of blood feud killings in Albania, through the elaboration of a single 
definition, comprehensive collection of statistical data, and conduct of interdisciplinary 
research. The current Special Rapporteur concurs with his predecessor on the importance of 
such steps that would enable the authorities in Albania to identify the causes, scope and 
consequences of the phenomenon, as well as create a solid basis for the elaboration of 
effective measures to end such killings.  
</p>
<p>                                                          
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 See, inter alia, the concluding observations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child on Albania

</b></p>
<p>18. During the period under review, the recommendation that the National Institute of 
Statistics conduct a statistical survey and analysis, using uniform and meaningful 
definitions of the blood feud phenomenon, was not implemented. At the time of drafting the 
present report, there was not yet a verifiable and reliable source of statistical data on blood 
feuds in Albania. Furthermore, the Albanian State Police and non-governmental 
organizations continued to use different methodologies and, as a consequence, report 
different figures of instances of blood feuds and related killings. 
</p>
<p>19. In parallel, the Albanian State Police launched, in June 2012, a database of persons 
directly involved in blood feuds. According to the information received, the database 
covers the entire country, and includes all physical persons directly identified as involved in 
a blood feud. The database contains information both on cases submitted to the court and 
cases that are not followed up through official channels. It is regularly updated. The State 
Police, the Prosecutor-General&#8217;s Office, the representatives of the courts, and the People&#8217;s 
Advocate are reported to have access to this database. The Special Rapporteur welcomes 
this initiative, and encourages the Albanian authorities to develop it further in order to reach 
a comprehensive and reliable statistical source, accessible to all relevant State entities for 
the purpose of coordination and exchange of information.  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur also underlines that the Government of Albania should 
prioritize measures on elaborating a uniform and meaningful definition of blood feuds, 
which should be used by all stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>21. With regard to the recommendation encouraging sustained interdisciplinary research 
on the issue of blood feuds, the Special Rapporteur has not received any information that 
would indicate any follow-up. He was however informed that, at the time of drafting the 
present report, the People&#8217;s Advocate of Albania was in the process of preparing a report on 
blood feuds. 
</p>
<p>22. In the country visit report, disputes related to property rights were evoked as a 
potential major cause of blood feuds which needed further study. Neither at that time, nor at 
present, have there been attempts to collect data and analyse the correlation between 
property disputes and blood feuds. The Special Rapporteur therefore would like to reiterate 
the need to research this aspect. In the meantime, he takes note of reports that some 
progress has been achieved by Albania in the field of property rights, while challenges 
persist regarding the completion of the land registry and the unresolved claims for 
compensation for and restitution of property confiscated under the communist regime.6 
Given the potential link between the situation of property rights and blood feud killings, the 
Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue with firm steps to reform this 
area. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Policy coordination and outreach 
</b></p>
<p>23. With regard to policy coordination, the previous mandate holder mentioned the 
creation in 2005, by the Government, of a high-level coordination committee on blood 
feuds, with the aim of developing a national strategy on the fight against blood feuds and 
coordinating the activities of the authorities in this field. Concluding at that time that the 
committee had achieved very few results in its work, the Special Rapporteur recommended 
that its secretariat be established. At the moment of drafting the present report, the 
secretariat of the committee has yet to be established. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>24. The need for a more proactive role of the State in reaching out to the families 
involved in blood feuds, and in the related reconciliation processes, was also emphasized in 
the country visit report. The underlying reasons consisted of the need to reduce the 
influence of the extralegal processes of delivering justice and redress. Education on the 
individual foundations of human rights, as opposed to the principle of collective 
punishment under the Kanun, was particularly recommended not only for the families 
involved in blood feuds, but also for the society at large. 
</p>
<p>25. According to the information received, the current data of the Ministry of Education 
and Science indicates that 60 children from self-isolated families participate in educational 
programmes. There are 35 teachers and psychologists visiting children in their homes. The 
ultimate objective of the Ministry is to bring these children physically back to regular 
school classes. 
</p>
<p>26. In the meantime, it is noteworthy that the Deputy Minister of Education and Science 
announced, on 20 December 2012, a pilot programme for the establishment of an online 
communication platform for children isolated by blood feud. The platform would enable the 
respective children to participate in classes and follow classroom discussions online.  
</p>
<p>27. With regard to human rights education of the society at large, the Government 
informed the Special Rapporteur that Law No. 69 of 21 June 2012 on the pre-university 
educational system in Albania stipulates in its general principles that &#8220;in the pre-university 
educational system, the human rights and freedoms in general, and particularly the 
children&#8217;s rights, are respected, protected and promoted&#8221; (art. 6.12). The Ministry of 
Education and Science reportedly instructed that the subject of blood feud and revenge 
must be considered and discussed at the level of pre-university education, with an 
unequivocal condemnation of the phenomenon of collective punishment. Teachers were 
trained and modules for them were prepared on the manner in which to address in the 
classroom the issue of blood revenge. According to the information from the Government, 
the process is ongoing, in particular at the Regional Educational Directorates and local 
Educational Offices located in the districts affected by blood feuds. While welcoming the 
steps taken to include human rights and measures to fight the mentality of collective 
punishment and blood feuds at the level of pre-university education, the Special Rapporteur 
would like to stress the need to include these subjects in the educational curricula at all 
levels of the education system in Albania, in line with the recommendation made by his 
predecessor in 2011. 
</p>
<p>28. The Government of Albania also informed the Special Rapporteur that two training 
events are planned to be held by the Magistrate School in Tirana, in June 2013, with the 
aim of increasing the knowledge and professional skills of judges and prosecutors on issues 
related to revenge, blood feud and victim protection. The Special Rapporteur further takes 
note of the Government&#8217;s comment that the People&#8217;s Advocate Office has been actively 
involved at central and local levels in awareness-raising activities and actions to eradicate 
blood feuds in Albania. 
</p>
<p>29. Finally, the previous mandate holder recommended international donors to be more 
discerning in their funding programmes, in a context where a limited number of domestic 
groups tended to overstate the magnitude of the problem of blood feuds in Albania in order 
to enhance their funding prospects. The Special Rapporteur regrettably received insufficient 
information to assess the level of implementation of this recommendation. In parallel, he 
takes note of the information that the European Union funding programmes currently do not 
support activities related to the blood feud phenomenon in Albania. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> IV. Killings in the context of domestic violence 
</b></p>
<p>30. The previous mandate holder raised concerns about the level of domestic violence in 
Albania, which was widespread and resulted in a number of killings and murder threats, in 
particular of and against women. While acknowledging the efforts of the Government to 
address the problem, he concluded that much further work needed to be undertaken, in 
particular in terms of strengthening prevention mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>31. According to the official data provided by the Government of Albania, 29 cases of 
murder occurred within the family in 2011, 15 of the victims being women; and 26 cases of 
murder within the family were registered in 2012, with 28 victims, of whom 16 were 
women. In parallel, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) 
Presence in Albania reported that the number of women who have been victims of violence 
by their husbands, partners or other family members has increased in the period under 
review, with at least 23 women murdered in 2012. Moreover, the killings of the majority of 
them occurred in a brutal manner. At least two pregnant women were killed in 2012.7 The 
poor economic situation and alcohol abuse appear to constitute the main factors leading to 
domestic violence. The case of the killing of Servete Karoshi by her husband in September 
2011 was widely reported. It appears that Ms. Karoshi had reported the violence against 
her, but was not provided with effective means of protection, which eventually led to the 
breach of protection orders by her husband and her subsequent killing.8 Such a situation 
reinforces the urgent need to continue work on strengthening the implementation and 
effectiveness of the measures taken to prevent and punish crimes related to domestic 
violence.  
</p>
<p>32. In parallel, the number of reported incidents of domestic violence continued to 
increase during the period under review. The Albanian State Police registered 2,526 
reported incidents of domestic violence in 2012, which was an increase of 345 cases 
compared to 2011. 9  According to Amnesty International, 1,683 incidents of domestic 
violence were reported in the first nine months of 2011, which was an increase of 260 
incidents from the same period in 2010; 82 per cent of the victims were women. It is 
alleged however that most of the incidents, including those involving violence against 
children, remained unreported.10 
</p>
<p><b> A. Strengthening legal and policy frameworks related to domestic violence  
</b></p>
<p>33. In the period under review, the Government of Albania has taken a number of 
significant measures to strengthen the legal and policy frameworks on the prevention of, 
and fight against, domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>34. In a very positive step, on 19 December 2011 Albania signed the Council of Europe 
Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic 
Violence. The Albanian Parliament approved the ratification of the Convention in 
November 2012, and it entered into force in the country in February 2013. As a State party 
to the Convention, Albania is required to take a series of legislative and policy measures to

<p>improve the prevention of violence against women, including domestic violence; to 
improve the protection of victims; to prosecute perpetrators; and to put in place 
comprehensive, multidisciplinary policies to end violence against women and domestic 
violence. The Convention also requires the adequate allocation of human and financial 
resources to effectively implement the necessary policies to end all forms of violence 
against women. It also calls on State parties to collect national data and support research, to 
recognize and support the role of non-governmental organizations, and to encourage the 
media to set guidelines and self-regulatory standards to help prevent violence against 
women and to respect the dignity of women who are victims of such violence.  
</p>
<p>35. The Government of Albania informed the Special Rapporteur that, in the framework 
of the obligations arising from the Convention, a study was under preparation on &#8220;mapping 
and evaluating costs for providing services to victims of domestic violence&#8221;, with the 
support of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of 
Women. 
</p>
<p>36. At the national level, Law No. 10329, amending Law No. 9669, dated 18 December 
2006, on measures against domestic violence, was adopted on 30 September 2010. The law 
is aimed at addressing the challenges identified in the implementation of previous laws and 
regulations related to domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>37. In June 2011, the national strategy on gender equality, violence against women and 
domestic violence was endorsed for the period from 2011 to 2015. The Government of 
Albania has started implementing the strategy,11 in accordance with the plan of action 
prepared to this end. Furthermore, a national referral mechanism (NRM) was established on 
17 February 2011, with measures to protect, assist and support victims of domestic 
violence.  
</p>
<p>38. With a view to facilitating access to justice for victims of domestic violence and 
other vulnerable persons, the State Commission for Legal Aid was established within the 
period under review. Relevant by-laws were adopted in 2011 and 2012 to render the 
Commission fully functioning, and to improve access to free legal aid. 
</p>
<p>39. With regard to the punishment of the crimes of domestic violence, on 1 March 2012, 
the Albanian Assembly adopted Law No. 23/2012, introducing amendments to the Criminal 
Code, which are aimed at, inter alia, addressing domestic violence. The qualification of 
domestic violence as a criminal offence, as well as specific criminal offences related to 
domestic violence and stronger penalties &#8211; up to five years of imprisonment &#8211; were 
introduced. Among them, the offence of serious threat of murder, with a penalty of up to 
three years of imprisonment, is stipulated. The new amendments provide also for the 
introduction of a security period during which a convicted offender cannot enjoy early 
release on parole if the crime has been committed, among others, against children, pregnant 
women or persons who cannot defend themselves, or against persons of the same family.  
</p>
<p>40. According to the information received from the Government, the Ministry of Justice 
is in the process of working on proposals for additional amendments to the Criminal Code 
and the Criminal Procedure Code which would envisage stronger penalties for other 
criminal offences related to domestic violence.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Implementation results and challenges  
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the series of legal and policy measures 
undertaken by the Albanian authorities to tackle the problem of domestic violence. 
However, bearing in mind the serious persistence of the problem, including in terms of 
</p>
<p>

<p> 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>11 
</b></p>
<p>killings and death threats, he would like to stress the crucial need to focus on the 
implementation of these and other measures.  
</p>
<p>42. As a positive example, the OSCE Presence in Albania informed the Special 
Rapporteur of a change witnessed in the attitude of police officers in the process of 
handling domestic violence cases, which may be partly due to the training received in the 
last years by the special police units in charge of domestic violence. The number of 
immediate protection orders issued against perpetrators has also significantly increased.12  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur takes note in this regard of the information provided by the 
Government on the fact that, at the time of drafting the present report, 100 police officers, 
as well as 1,800 health and social workers, have been trained on issues related to domestic 
violence. Moreover, the State Police is currently implementing Action Plan No. 3731/1 of 
23 September 2011, devised under the national strategy on gender equality, violence 
against women and domestic violence, and containing, inter alia, provisions on immediate 
assistance for victims as well as related training programmes. In the Government&#8217;s view, 
the amendments made to the Criminal Code in March 2012 have also led to better 
protection of the victims, and to the increase in the number of arrests made, from 63 
perpetrators arrested in 2011 to 119 perpetrators arrested in 2012. 
</p>
<p>44. At the same time, a change in attitude is still needed among prosecutors and judges, 
who apparently tend to consider domestic violence as a private family matter, and therefore 
may impose lighter penalties for the crimes perpetrated in this field. In this regard, the 
OSCE Presence in Albania informed the Special Rapporteur that perpetrators in cases of 
domestic violence are often not properly prosecuted and punished by the courts. For 
instance, the classification of a crime as a simple murder, rather than as a murder resulting 
from domestic violence, may lead to the possibility that the perpetrator receives a lighter 
punishment.13 Amnesty International further reported that, in 2011, courts rarely imposed 
imprisonment sentences for those who violated the terms of protection orders, which is 
punishable with fines or up to two years of imprisonment.14 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur would like therefore to underscore the significance of proper 
crime classification by the prosecution offices, and proper punishment by the courts, as 
vital elements to contribute to the prevention and decrease of killings resulting from 
domestic violence. He was informed in this context of the need for training of judges and 
prosecutors on issues related to domestic violence, in particular in the light of the adoption 
of the new amendments to the Criminal Code.15 The Government of Albania informed the 
Special Rapporteur that some training of judges and prosecutors on gender equality and the 
fight against domestic violence had taken place in 2012, and additional sessions were 
planned in 2013. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Albanian authorities to pay further 
increased attention to the need to train judges and prosecutors in this area. 
</p><p>46. With regard to the mechanisms of assistance and support for the victims of domestic 
violence, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur of the establishment of the NRM 
in 24 municipalities. According to the progress report of the European Commission for 2012, 
progress in strengthening the NRM network is ongoing, although at a relatively slow pace.16 
</p>
<p>47. The first national shelter for victims of domestic violence opened in April 2011 at a 
non-public location at the outskirts of Tirana, and is currently operational. At the time of 
drafting the present report, there was thus one national shelter in Albania with a reported 
capacity to host a total of 30 persons, namely victims and their children. According to

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>Government information, another public entity in Tirana and seven non-public entities also 
provided residential services for victims of domestic violence: two in Tirana, and one each in 
Berat, Korca, Elbasan, Vlora and Gjirokastra. At the same time, credible sources informed the 
Special Rapporteur of the very limited hosting capacity of the centres, such as a reported 
capacity of 21 persons in the shelter in Elbasan, and of 20 persons in the shelter in Vlora. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the current figures on shelter capacity, 
which indicate the very insufficient capacity of the existing shelters to host victims, 
compared to the level of reported incidents and the prevalence of domestic violence in 
Albania. While welcoming the creation of the first national shelter, he urges the Albanian 
authorities to intensify efforts to establish additional shelters and significantly increase their 
hosting capacity.  
</p>
<p>49. Furthermore, the current public funding of shelters appears to be very limited 
compared to the needs in this area. The European Commission reports, for instance, that the 
national shelter still relies largely on external funding.17 Additional information received by 
the Special Rapporteur from credible sources indicates that the annual budget for the 
national shelter is very low compared to its needs. It is reported that the Government of 
Albania limits its funding of the shelter to the payment of the salaries of the staff, the costs 
of maintenance of the shelter, and the supply of food and other subsistence means to 
survivors. It relies in parallel on United Nations agencies in terms of support for 
infrastructure, regulatory framework and capacity-building. In the area of the fight against 
domestic violence in general, the Government reportedly limits its funding to the salaries of 
the staff and very few operational expenses. 
</p>
<p>50. Another concern reported by various sources indicates an insufficient level of 
professional preparation of the staff from the system of assistance, including shelters, who 
are not sufficiently specialized and are frequently unaware of the policies conducted by the 
central authorities. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern the 
developments of 2011 at the national shelter for victims of domestic violence, when victims 
reported that they had been mistreated and verbally abused by the director of the shelter. In 
another incident, a victim was not provided with a security escort to accompany her and her 
children to school, and was subsequently attacked and seriously injured by her former 
husband. Non-governmental organizations, as well as the People&#8217;s Advocate, called for the 
director&#8217;s dismissal, as well as for proper investigation and liability measures. While the 
director was removed from her post, it is regrettable that not only were other measures of 
investigation and accountability not taken, but also that the respective person was appointed 
in another official management position. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur takes note 
of the information provided by the Government of Albania regarding the training sessions 
undertaken in 2011 and 2012 for the staff of the national shelter, and calls upon the 
authorities to intensify preventive as well as accountability measures for any reported 
omissions or violations committed by the staff of shelters. 
</p>
<p>51. Shortcomings are also reported in the functioning of the newly established legal aid 
system. For instance, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights raised with 
the Government of Albania the following challenges: a very low number of applications 
and processed requests by the State Commission for Legal Aid; administrative obstacles for 
some categories of population to apply for legal aid; a very limited number of lawyers 
providing legal aid; as well as lack of transparency in their selection and the fees received 
by them; and lack of the possibility for the courts to exercise discretion on exemptions or 
reduction of court fees in order to enable vulnerable persons to seek justice.18

</b></p>
<p><b> C. Awareness-raising and role of the media 
</b></p>
<p>52. A series of awareness-raising campaigns have been undertaken in Albania since 
2010 on matters related to domestic violence. The increase in the number of reported cases 
of domestic violence to the police is believed to be, at least partly, a result of awareness-
raising campaigns.  
</p>
<p>53. As part of the annual global campaigns to fight violence against women (16 Days of 
Activism to End Violence against Women), the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and 
Equal Opportunities, together with United Nations agencies and partner non-governmental 
organizations, conducted in December 2012 a campaign against domestic violence, entitled 
&#8220;Violence is crime. Act now. A real man never hurts a woman.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>54. Another example is the &#8220;Bus Art&#8221; campaign, organized in 2012 by the OSCE 
Presence in Albania, in cooperation with the Tirana Police and the Municipality of Tirana. 
Posters aimed at preventing and combating domestic violence, as well as at encouraging 
reporting of instances of domestic violence, were placed on urban buses in Tirana. 
</p>
<p>55. However, the Special Rapporteur takes note of the information received that efforts 
in this field need to be further intensified. For instance, the OSCE Presence in Albania 
reported on the need to develop significantly campaigns that would address men, stressing 
that domestic violence cannot be tolerated and that it constitutes a severely punishable 
crime. It also shared its views that, in order to make the society at large more aware of the 
risks of domestic violence, there is a need to include such issues in elementary school 
education curricula, so that the younger generation is educated to have a zero tolerance 
against violence in general and domestic violence in particular.  
</p>
<p>56. With regard to the recommendation of the previous mandate holder on the 
responsibility of the media in reporting on domestic violence, the Special Rapporteur notes 
that the media coverage of domestic violence issues has increased during the period under 
review. However, some media appear not to respect the law on data protection, by 
disclosing personal data, or images of the faces or homes of the victims and their children. 
Furthermore, the manner in which cases of domestic violence are reported frequently 
includes an attempt to justify the violence and shift the blame to the victim and her or his 
behaviour. The Special Rapporteur shares, in this respect, the views of the OSCE Presence 
in Albania that journalists should receive adequate training on the manner of reporting news 
on domestic violence.19 He takes note of the information provided by the Government of 
Albania on a study conducted in 2012 on media monitoring in relation to human rights, 
non-discrimination and gender equality policies, and hopes that its findings will enable the 
authorities to design appropriate training for the media workers in this field. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Killings and disappearances following the conflict in Kosovo 
</b></p>
<p>57. The previous mandate holder mentioned in his report allegations made regarding the 
abductions of a few hundred people by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), following the 
armed conflict in Kosovo from 1998 to 1999, as well as the transfer of those persons to 
alleged KLA camps in Albania, where some were victims of, inter alia, organ trafficking, 
and some were killed. Referring to the investigations conducted at that time by the 
European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) and the Council of Europe, he 
recommended that the Government of Albania cooperate fully with EULEX and other 
independent investigation mechanisms in this field. 
</p>
<p>

  Submission from the OSCE Presence in Albania. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>58. Following the adoption of Senator Dick Marty&#8217;s report, entitled &#8220;Inhuman treatment 
of people and illicit trafficking in human organs in Kosovo&#8221;, by the Committee on Legal 
Affairs and Human Rights of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe 
(PACE), PACE adopted on 25 January 2011 resolution 1782 on investigation of allegations 
of inhuman treatment of people and illicit trafficking in human organs in Kosovo.20 In the 
resolution, PACE, inter alia, invited EULEX to persevere with its investigative work in the 
field of the alleged serious crimes that may have occurred after the conflict in Kosovo, and 
invited the Albanian authorities to cooperate unreservedly with EULEX on this matter. 
</p>
<p>59. As a consequence, EULEX, with the full support of all European Union member 
States, decided to establish in 2011 the Special Investigative Task Force (SITF) to pursue 
an impartial and professional investigation into the allegations contained in the Council of 
Europe report. The SITF was consequently formed in September 2011, and Ambassador 
Clint Williamson was appointed as the Lead Prosecutor for the SITF in October 2011. The 
SITF is based in Brussels and consists exclusively of international staff.  
</p>
<p>60. While part of the administrative structure of EULEX, the SITF is given full 
autonomy for its investigative and prosecutorial functions. It has the authority to conduct 
investigations both inside and outside Kosovo, including on the territory of Albania. Its 
investigations are currently ongoing. 
</p>
<p>61. During the period under review, the Government of Albania continued to reject the 
allegations of organ trafficking and related crimes that allegedly occurred on its territory 
following the armed conflict in Kosovo, and in particular the content of Mr. Marty&#8217;s report. 
</p>
<p>62. In parallel, Albania took a number of steps to demonstrate its readiness and 
willingness to cooperate fully with EULEX in the process of investigation of the allegations 
raised in the PACE resolution. Albania voted in favour of PACE resolution 1782, and 
reiterated at a high level its willingness and openness to cooperate fully with the SITF and 
EULEX, including by creating all necessary facilities for this investigation.21 
</p>
<p>63. In a very important development, the Albanian Parliament unanimously adopted on 
10 May 2012 Law No. 53/2012 on jurisdictional relations in criminal matters with the 
Special Investigative Task Force of EULEX, which enables EULEX to carry out 
investigations on the territory of Albania and provides for full judicial cooperation from the 
Albanian authorities. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur takes note in this context that the European Commission 
acknowledges the fact that &#8220;Albania has cooperated fully with EULEX to allow full 
investigation of allegations raised in the resolution adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly 
of the Council of Europe&#8221;.22 He welcomes the steps taken by the Albanian authorities to 
advance cooperation with EULEX during the period under review, and encourages them to 
continue to cooperate fully with EULEX and other independent mechanisms on the 
investigations conducted in these allegations.

<p>Albanian military ammunitions base in G&#235;rdec on 15 March 2008. The explosion resulted 
in the death of 26 persons, hundreds of individuals injured or left homeless and grave 
destruction of property. In this regard, he recommended full investigation and prosecution 
of all those involved. 
</p>
<p>66. The verdict of the District Court of Tirana, as a first-instance court, in the G&#235;rdec 
case was delivered on 12 March 2012. The charges by the Prosecution Offices included, 
among others, the offence of murder, brought against four defendants.23 Prison sentences 
ranging from 6 to 18 years were given to 5 of the 29 accused individuals, while the other 
accused persons received lower sentences or were acquitted.24 Following appeals from both 
the Tirana Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the defendants, the Court of Appeals of Tirana started 
hearings in the appeal proceedings on this case on 31 October 2012.25 On 13 February 
2013, the Court issued its ruling, upholding the decision of 12 March 2012 by the District 
Court of Tirana. The sentences for the main defendants were reduced to between 5 and 12 
years of imprisonment, and one defendant was acquitted. On the basis of the Prosecutor&#8217;s 
appeal, four other defendants, who were previously acquitted, were sentenced to between 
one and eight years of imprisonment. At the time of drafting this report, the Government of 
Albania informed the Special Rapporteur that the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office was 
challenging this ruling before the Supreme Court.  
</p>
<p>67. According to reports of various stakeholders,26  the trial at the District Court of 
Tirana, launched in 2009, registered a number of serious flaws which cast doubt on the 
proper respect of the principle of fair trial. The excessive length of the trial, due in 
particular to unjustified delays and postponements of proceedings, as well as frequent 
absences of the parties involved, are the main elements that raised concerns in this regard. 
According to the Albanian Helsinki Committee, of the approximately 200 hearings held in 
this trial, 70 featured the absence of the defence lawyers or of the defendants, and 36 
featured the absence of witnesses, thus leading to numerous postponements of sessions. 
Other reasons for the postponement of the hearings included reaching the end of official 
work hours, failure to constitute the panel of judges, and the request of the prosecution to 
postpone the session.27 
</p>
<p>68. In parallel, concerns have been expressed regarding failures to prosecute the official 
holding the post of Minister of Defence at the time of the incident for his alleged 
responsibility in the explosion. Given the fact that the respective person became a Member 
of the Albanian Parliament in 2009, the Supreme Court of Albania dropped charges against 
him due to the applicable parliamentary immunity. It is reported that, during the period 
under review, the Prosecutor-General&#8217;s Office did not seek a renewed lifting of his 
immunity.28 However, it is noteworthy that the Constitutional Court of Albania overturned 
in May 2012 the decision of the Supreme Court. By consequence, the Supreme Court is 
currently expected to reconsider the matter. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur will continue to follow closely the G&#235;rdec case. He strongly 
encourages the Albanian authorities to take note of the concerns expressed, and ensure that 
prompt, impartial and effective judicial proceedings are conducted, with the aim of bringing

<p><b> VII. Communist-era executions and other violations 
</b>70. After analysing the need to establish the truth and ensure accountability on the 
numerous killings and other serious human rights violations that occurred in Albania during 
the communist regime, the previous mandate holder recommended that a national 
commission be established to investigate those crimes. As an interim measure, the newly 
established Institute for the Study of Crimes and Consequences of Communism (ISKK) in 
Albania should have been granted comprehensive access to all sources of information about 
that era, including to the archives of the communist-era security services, as well as the 
power to refer cases to the prosecution. 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur regrets that, according to the information received, almost 
no specific developments have taken place during the period under review to implement the 
recommendation of his predecessor. He takes note however of the information provided by 
the Government of Albania that one of the current main activities of the ISKK consists of 
collecting evidence from survivors of the communist regime, as well as conducting 
extensive research in the archives of the former Albanian intelligence agency. 
</p>
<p>72. Credible reports received furthermore suggest that the transparency and efficiency of 
the work of the ISKK could be further strengthened by facilitating public access and 
strengthening transparency on its activities, and by considering possibilities for the public 
to participate in the Institute&#8217;s work. 
</p>
<p>73. In parallel, the Special Rapporteur takes note of the very tense situation that has 
emerged in Albania on the issue of financial compensation for victims of the communist 
regime. Complaints regarding the limited implementation of the 2007 law on the 
compensation of those formerly politically convicted by the communist regime, and other 
related laws and requests, have led to a very tense 31-day hunger strike by those formerly 
convicted, which took place in Tirana, from 22 September to 22 October 2012. It is 
reported that, during the period of the hunger strike in Tirana, two individuals set fire to 
themselves, one of whom subsequently died. 
</p>
<p>74. In accordance with the 2007 law on compensation, financial compensation by the 
Government of Albania is provided for surviving former political prisoners of the 
communist regime; for the families of the victims executed; and for persons who were 
interned or deported to camps. For instance, family members of those who were killed as a 
result of political persecution are entitled to receive 2,000 Albanian leks daily, for a period 
of eight years. Given the compensation rates established, as well as the number of eligible 
persons, this law is faced with challenges of implementation. Information received by the 
Special Rapporteur suggests, at the same time, that the successful implementation of the 
law may reduce tensions in Albanian society.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Justice system reforms 
</b>75. The country visit report highlighted to a large extent the weaknesses of the criminal 
justice system in Albania at every stage of the judicial process, which considerably 
undermined public trust in the capacity of the Albanian judiciary to deliver justice. 
Corruption among the judiciary and high officials, and improper influence on the judiciary, 
constituted serious impediments in the efforts to ensure accountability in cases of killings 
and related violations. To this end, the former mandate holder put forward several </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>17 
</b></p>
<p>recommendations aimed at strengthening the independence and impartiality of the judiciary 
in Albania, as well as at ensuring the criminal accountability of high officials and judges. 
</p><p>76. As general developments, during the period under review, Albania adopted a judicial 
reform strategy and a plan of action thereto, which the authorities started implementing. An 
anti-corruption strategy continued to be implemented, in accordance with the relevant plan 
of action adopted for the period from 2011 to 2013; however, the European Commission 
reported a slow pace in this regard.29 
</p>
<p>77. The present chapter will not present an exhaustive overview of the measures and 
developments that have occurred in the field of the judiciary and the fight against 
corruption in Albania during the period under review.30 It will focus solely on examining 
follow-up to the specific recommendations made by the previous mandate holder. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Independence and impartiality of the judiciary 
</b>78. One of the recommendations in the country visit report suggested that the 
Government of Albania adopt, through legislation, criteria and procedures to ensure the 
professionalism, independence and integrity of judges. Given the concerns surrounding 
transparency in the process of appointment of judges at the Constitutional Court and the 
Supreme Court, as well as their independence, the adoption of changes applicable to these 
two courts should have been particularly prioritized. 
</p>
<p>79. In this regard, a package of new rules on the transfer of judges, based upon their 
merits and other objective criteria, was adopted in September 2012. According to the new 
rules, the High Council of Justice will decide upon the transfer of judges, based on a system 
of evaluation that will take into account competences, professional experience, age and 
other elements related to the place of duty or family circumstances. 
</p>
<p>80. However, the process of appointment of judges at the Constitutional Court and 
Supreme Court still raises concern, in a context where the reform of the relevant procedures 
and legal acts is still pending.  
</p>
<p>81. Measures to reform the functioning of the Supreme Court are more advanced. In this 
respect, a draft law amending Law No. 8588 of 15 March 2000 on the organization and 
functioning of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Albania was finalized. The draft law 
defines, inter alia, the procedures for the appointment of the members of the Supreme Court 
through the establishment of criteria on the professionalism and integrity of the members, 
as well as measures to improve the status of judges at this court. In parallel, no such criteria 
and procedures are established with regard to the appointment of the Chairperson of the 
court.31 According to the information received from the Government, the Parliament of 
Albania is at the final stage of adoption of the amendments to Law No. 8588. 
</p>
<p>82. With regard to the Constitutional Court, the Ministry of Justice has launched a 
process to amend Law No. 8577 of 10 February 2000 on the organization and functioning 
of the Constitutional Court, as well as a set of internal regulations of the court. The 
respective amendments are not yet finalized, which regrettably perpetuates the situation 
described in the country visit report, with some members of the court continuing to hold 
their positions, despite the expiration of their mandate.

 Submission from the Albanian Helsinki Committee. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the measures taken to establish objective criteria 
and transparent procedures of appointment and transfer of judges in Albania, and invites the 
Albanian authorities to address in a comprehensive manner the reform of all other aspects 
related to the independence, professionalism and integrity of the judiciary. At the same 
time, he would like to underline that there is an urgent need to complete modifications to 
the organization and functioning of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court, in 
order to ensure the independence, professionalism and integrity of their members, as well as 
of their respective chairpersons. Last but not least, the effective and swift implementation 
of the legal measures taken will constitute the ultimate test of the Albanian efforts to ensure 
the independence and impartiality of its judiciary at all levels. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Aspects related to the criminal justice system 
</b>84. To ensure a proper accountability process in criminal justice matters, as well as to 
deter further corruption risks, the previous mandate holder recommended that the Albanian 
authorities amend the Criminal Procedure Code so as to enable the Prosecutor-General&#8217;s 
Office to commence investigations of high officials, without the need to first lift their 
immunity. 
</p>
<p>85. In an important development, the Albanian Parliament adopted on 18 September 
2012 Law No. 88/2012, which introduced amendments to the Constitution of Albania. The 
constitutional amendments provide for the restriction of the general immunity from 
criminal investigation and prosecution of all elected officials, including Members of 
Parliament, Members of the Government, the People&#8217;s Advocate, and other high-level 
officials, as well as of judges, including those at the Supreme Court and the Constitutional 
Court. According to the new provisions, investigation and prosecution of high officials and 
judges can proceed without prior authorization. 
</p><p>86. To give full effect to these amendments, the Albanian Code of Criminal Procedure 
still needs to be amended. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of these 
important constitutional amendments, and encourages the Albanian authorities to proceed 
swiftly with the necessary modifications in the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
</p>
<p>87. Another recommendation highlighted the need for a sound collection of statistical 
data on criminal justice matters, and the development of the statisticians&#8217; capacity to 
collect, analyse and report data related to criminal justice in accordance with internationally 
accepted standards. 
</p>
<p>88. While the Special Rapporteur did not receive information that would enable him to 
analyse the level of follow-up to this specific recommendation, he was informed that the 
capacity to collect sound statistical data is still very limited in Albania. The Albanian 
Helsinki Committee, for instance, reported that while the courts are equipped with 
electronic systems of case management, the data in the Prosecutor-General&#8217;s Office is still 
recorded and kept manually. According to the same source, the Ministry of Justice has a 
system of collection and analysis of data, although this data is not complete and the system 
is not aligned to the international standards on data collection and reporting. 
</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur also received information that, upon a request by the 
European Union, the Ministry of Justice established a working group to facilitate the 
collection of statistics regarding corruption and organized crime. The working group aims 
at harmonizing statistics coming from the Prosecutor-General&#8217;s Office and the Albanian 
State Police as well as from the Ministry of Justice.  </p>

<p><b> IX. Conclusions 
</b>90. <b>During the period under review, Albania continued to be faced in particular 
with an unabated level of domestic violence, resulting in killings and murder threats. 
The Government has taken a significant number of measures to prevent domestic 
violence and to ensure support and protection to victims, thus following up on some of 
the recommendations formulated after the visit in 2010. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
view, this demonstrates the commitment of the authorities to fight domestic violence. 
However, these efforts should be considerably intensified and should prioritize proper 
implementation.  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>With regard to the blood feuds, such types of killing continued to occur in 
Albania during the period of review. While acknowledging some steps taken by the 
Albanian authorities in terms of education and outreach in this field, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to refer to the pressing need to profoundly and 
comprehensively study the phenomenon. Research and statistical surveys still need to 
be undertaken with a view to understanding the roots, manifestations and scope of the 
blood feuds in Albania, and proposing a single definition to be used by all 
stakeholders in the country. In parallel, the effective functioning of the judiciary and 
proper implementation of legislation and policy measures should constitute 
imperative priorities in the efforts to eliminate this phenomenon. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Albania has also undertaken some measures to follow up on the 
recommendations related to ensuring accountability and redress for the violations of 
the right to life that occurred in the past. The Special Rapporteur welcomes in 
particular the signs indicating cooperation of the authorities with the European Union 
Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo and the Special Investigative Task Force regarding 
the investigations into the allegations of killings and other serious violations that 
allegedly may have occurred on the territory of Albania following the armed conflict 
in Kosovo. He encourages the Government of Albania to continue its commitment to 
cooperate fully in this area. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>In parallel, the Special Rapporteur regrets that few meaningful steps have been 
taken to shed light and ensure accountability in the cases of killings and other serious 
crimes that occurred during the communist regime.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>In the present report, the Special Rapporteur also analysed follow-up to the 
recommendation on the need to investigate, and ensure accountability for, the 
casualties that occurred during the explosion in G&#235;rdec in 2008. He takes note of the 
judicial proceedings conducted, while strongly encouraging the Government to 
address the concerns expressed regarding fair trial irregularities, as well as the need 
to bring to justice all those responsible. 
</b>95. <b>Albania has also taken some encouraging steps to improve its criminal justice 
system. The Government should effectively pursue reform in this area. Ensuring the 
independence of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court should constitute a 
priority in this regard. </b></p>

<p><b>Appendix 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of follow-up to each recommendation</b>a<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Blood feuds </b> 
</p>
<p><b>  </b>1.<b> While blood feud killings will soon be largely a thing of the past, a belief in the 
practice of vindicating honour and blood outside the regular legal system remains well 
entrenched in certain parts of the society. Its elimination will require additional 
measures to those taken to date. The Government&#8217;s understandable desire to see 
blood feuds as a purely historical artefact should not blind it to the need to consider 
taking measures such as: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Establishing the secretariat long envisaged but not created for the 
coordination committee on blood feuds. As a matter of priority, the Government 
should, through the National Institute of Statistics, conduct a statistical survey and 
analysis, using uniform and meaningful definitions of the blood feud phenomenon and 
its prevalence and manifestation in Albanian society;  
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Encouraging sustained interdisciplinary research on the issue of blood 
feuds, including its root causes and means of ending both killings and self-isolation, a 
task perhaps best entrusted to a new national institute of criminology; 
</b></p>
<p>The information provided is insufficient to assess the level of implementation of this 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Consulting leading scholars and religious leaders to determine how best 
the Government might (i) conduct outreach to end self-isolation of families in blood 
feuds, (ii) facilitate more effective forms of reconciliation by community leaders of 
stature, and (iii) ensure mediators have no potential conflict of interest of any kind in 
the issue;  
</b></p>
<p>While steps have been taken to implement point (i) of this recommendation, the 
information provided is insufficient to assess the level of implementation of the 
other aspects of this recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b>(d) Ensuring that educational curricula at all levels include an emphasis on 
individual human rights and specifically rebut the collective punishment message sent 
by the relevant parts of the <i>kanun</i>.  
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation is partly under implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> </b> 2.<b> International donors should be more discerning in their funding programmes, 
and should be as concerned about broader issues of violence and problematic 
traditions of collective punishment as they are about the &#8220;exotic&#8221; notion of blood feud 
killings.</b> 
</p>
<p>The information provided is insufficient to assess the level of implementation of this 
recommendation. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b> B. Domestic violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>3.<b> The Government should follow through on its assurances to fund programmes 
and shelters. Domestic violence programmes will need to be long-term to erode the 
deep-seated patriarchal views facilitating violence and to increase victims&#8217; access to 
justice. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation is at an initial stage of implementation and in need of 
intensified efforts. 
</p>
<p><b>  </b>4.<b> The media should be more responsible in its coverage of domestic violence 
issues. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Disappearances and killings after the Kosovo war 
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>5.<b> The Government of Albania should cooperate fully with EULEX and other 
independent investigations into abuses by the KLA on Albanian territory, including 
by providing access to Albanian territory for the purposes of evidence-gathering and 
excavation and by responding to EULEX requests for judicial assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation is under implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> D. G&#235;rdec 
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>6.<b> The Prosecutor-General should ensure that the events leading to the G&#235;rdec 
explosion are fully investigated, that all responsible parties prosecuted, and where 
necessary, requests for the lifting of immunities are made. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation is partly under implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Communist-era abuses 
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>7. <b>The Government should establish a national commission to conduct an 
independent, systematic and sustained investigation of communist-era abuses. In the 
interim, it should give the proposed institute for the study of communist-era abuses 
comprehensive access to all sources of information about that era and enable it to 
make effective use of its power to refer specific cases to the Prosecutor. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has to date been implemented in a very limited manner. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Justice system and anti-corruption reforms 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b> 8.<b> The Government should adopt, through legislation, criteria and procedures to 
ensure the professionalism, independence and integrity of judges, especially in relation 
to the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation is at an initial stage of implementation. 
</p>
<p><b>  </b>9.<b> The Government should amend the Criminal Procedure Code to enable the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to commence investigations of high officials, including ministers 
and judges, without first having to have their immunity lifted. Immunity need only be 
lifted once the Prosecutor has sufficient evidence to warrant charges. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/47/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>This recommendation is under implementation. 
</p>
<p><b>  </b>10.<b> The Government should develop the capacity and expertise of statisticians and 
analysts at the National Institute of Statistics and in the relevant ministries to collect, 
analyse and report on criminal justice-related data in accordance with internationally 
accepted standards.
