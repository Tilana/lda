<p><b>  18/&#8230; Panel on the promotion of multiculturalism as a means of

</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the pledge made by all States under the Charter of the United Nations to 
promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the 2005 World Summit Outcome adopted by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 60/1 of 16 September 2005, in which the Assembly emphasized the 
responsibilities of all States, in conformity with the Charter, to respect human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind, and acknowledged the 
importance of respect and understanding for religious and cultural diversity throughout the 
world, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the resolve expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, 
adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 55/2 of 8 September 2000, to take 
measures to eliminate the increasing acts of racism and xenophobia in many societies and 
to promote greater harmony and tolerance in all societies, and looking forward to its 
effective implementation at all levels, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that the landmark importance of the Vienna Declaration and Programme 
of Action in the pursuit of the universal promotion and protection of human rights is 
strengthened by its evolutionary character, which seeks to respond to contemporary 
challenges, including the preservation of the multicultural and tolerant ethos of 
international order and respect for religious and cultural diversity, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that both the formal and societal rejection of multiculturalism has 
underpinned the rise in xenophobia, violence and discrimination, as demonstrated by recent 
events in various parts of the world, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to acknowledge the existence of national, ethnic, 
linguistic and religious diversity, and to ensure that the rights of individuals to retain their 
culture and values should go hand in hand with enjoying full access to, participation in and 
adherence to constitutional principles and commonly shared values prevailing in society; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to adopt policies that ensure non-discrimination and 
equitable access to social, political and economic rights, thus reducing pressures for social 
conflict based on disadvantage and inequality; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Decides</i> to convene, within existing resources, at its twentieth session, a 
panel discussion on the promotion of multiculturalism as a means of protecting human 
rights and combating xenophobia, discrimination and intolerance; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to liaise with relevant special procedures and treaty bodies, States and other 
stakeholders, including relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, with a view to 
ensuring their participation in the panel discussion; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a report on the 
outcome of the panel discussion in the form of a summary.
