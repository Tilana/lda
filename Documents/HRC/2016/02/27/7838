<p><b>  Report of the Independent Expert on the situation of human 
rights in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Doudou Di&#232;ne</b>* 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 This report is the outcome of the Independent Expert&#8217;s fourth visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
from 28 April to 4 May 2013. Its main aim is to evaluate the implementation of the 
recommendations made to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire by the various United Nations mechanisms, 
including those made by the 2011 international commission of inquiry. This report also 
presents an update on the human rights situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire for the period 13 October 
2012 to 31 May 2013. 
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert&#8217;s visit coincided with regional and local elections and 
allowed him to observe the current drive towards democracy. He noted that these elections 
were largely a technical success, which was testament to the authorities&#8217; better use of 
democratic mechanisms. Nevertheless, the boycott of the elections by opposition parties, 
particularly the Front Populaire Ivoirien (FPI), weakened the elections&#8217; legitimacy. 
 The Independent Expert observed that opposition parties continue to show mistrust 
for the Government, despite its calls for dialogue. He calls on the Government to continue 
this dialogue in a frank and sincere manner, including all political parties in the democratic 
process in order to encourage more peaceful participation in the next elections in 2015, and 
to consider the need to reform the Independent Electoral Commission and update the 
electoral roll. 
</p>
<p> In terms of security, although the number of attacks originating outside the country 
decreased significantly between January and April 2013, in the Independent Expert&#8217;s view 
the situation remains fragile owing to numerous internal factors, such as the activities of 
militia in the west of the country and the delays in disarming former fighters. Moreover, the 
violence committed by the dozos and the Forces R&#233;publicaines de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (FRCI) 
remains a significant internal security threat.

</p>
<p> The Independent Expert draws the authorities&#8217; attention to the need to speed up the 
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process, carrying it out fairly, dealing with 
the ex-combatants&#8217; frustrations and guaranteeing them a dignified reintegration into 
society, without letting it become a cover for impunity for perpetrators of serious human 
rights violations. 
</p>
<p> During his visit, the Independent Expert noted the Government&#8217;s efforts to reduce 
human rights violations, particularly with regard to the violence committed by the FRCI 
and the dozos. The provisional release of detainees with ties to the old regime has helped 
calm things down, but the various legal proceedings now under way still give an 
impression of a two-tier justice system. 
 Some of the authorities&#8217; actions, if not managed and corrected right from the start, 
could compromise the ongoing process of democratization. This is particularly the case 
with regard to illegal arrest and detention, bans on opposition rallies and the arrest of 
journalists for reasons that are sometimes unclear. 
 The Independent Expert visited Odienn&#233; and Bouna and asked about the detention 
conditions of high-profile detainees such as Simone Gbagbo, Michel Gbagbo and former 
Prime Minister Pascal Affi N&#8217;Guessan. The Independent Expert notes that the transfer of 
certain detainees to the Sainte Anne-Marie International Polyclinic is an encouraging step 
towards recognizing their right to health. The same recognition should be extended to their 
right to be either tried or released. 
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert emphasizes the sensitive role of the Dialogue, Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission in repairing the fabric of society, which has been torn apart by 
10 years of crisis against a backdrop of worsening ethnic divisions. The Independent Expert 
believes that the Commission&#8217;s mandate, which expires in September 2013, should be 
renewed. 
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert has noted that the significant increase in the economic 
growth rate of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire is not reflected in the daily lives of Ivoirians.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 20/19, 
whereby the Council renewed the Independent Expert&#8217;s mandate for one year and invited 
him to present his recommendations at its twenty-third session. 
</p>
<p>2. This report reviews the numerous recommendations made to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and the 
international community by the United Nations Security Council, the Human Rights 
Council and the 2011 international commission of inquiry, as well as the Independent 
Expert&#8217;s previous recommendations. It presents a factual update based on the Independent 
Expert&#8217;s fourth visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire from 28 April to 4 May 2013, and also covers the 
period between October 2012 and May 2013. This report is based on information collected 
from Government authorities, United Nations agencies, national and international non-
governmental organizations, and detainees, and on the recommendations made in the 
Independent Expert&#8217;s previous report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/22/66). It also 
contains recommendations, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 20/19. 
</p>
<p>3. The Independent Expert wishes to express his gratitude to the Ivorian Government, 
which facilitated his stay in the country and his meetings with national and local authorities. 
He met the Prime Minister; the Minister of Economy and Finance; the Minister of Justice, 
Human Rights and Public Freedoms; the Minister of State; the Minister of the Interior and 
Security; and the Minister for defence at the Office of the President. 
</p>
<p>4. The Independent Expert also met with the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, the 
Chairperson of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the investigating judge 
of the first chamber of the Abidjan military court, magistrates of the special investigation 
unit, the head of the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Authority (ADDR) 
and the head of the Operational Decisions Coordination Centre. 
</p>
<p>5. The Independent Expert also met with the Deputy Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and the various departments of the 
United Nations Operation in C&#244;te d'Ivoire (UNOCI). 
</p><p>6. The Independent Expert expresses his gratitude to the head of the UNOCI Human 
Rights Division and his team who, in addition to organizing an excellent itinerary for the 
visit, contributed essential information to this report. 
</p>
<p>7. The Independent Expert met with the technical and financial partners of C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire, among them the United Nations system and several diplomatic missions to the 
country, including those of the African Union, the European Union, Ghana, Canada, 
France, the United States of America and Senegal. 
</p>
<p>8. The Independent Expert visited the interior of the country, notably Odienn&#233;, where 
he met with Simone Gbagbo, and Bouna, where he enquired about the detention conditions 
of around 15 detainees who had been arrested in Liberia. He also met with the former Prime 
Minister and Secretary-General of the Front Populaire Ivoirien (FPI), Pascal Affi 
N&#8217;Guessan, and the former Minister of Defence, Lida Kouassi. At the National Surveillance 
Directorate (DST), the Independent Expert met Charles Bl&#233; Goud&#233;, leader of the Young 
Patriots. The Independent Expert also went to the Sainte Anne-Marie International 
Polyclinic, where he asked about the detention conditions of Simone Gbagbo, Genevi&#232;ve 
Yobou Bro-Greb&#233;, Kuyo T&#233;a Narcisse and Michel Gbagbo. 
</p>
<p>9. This visit, which took place immediately after the regional and local elections of 21 
April 2013, allowed the Independent Expert to evaluate the status of the current democratic 
process, particularly through his meetings with civil society and human rights NGOs. He 
also met with the leaders of a range of political parties, including the FPI, the Parti </p>


<p>GE.13-15028 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>D&#233;mocratique de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Rassemblement des R&#233;publicains de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and 
Libert&#233; et D&#233;mocratie pour la R&#233;publique.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Outcome of the International Conference on Impunity and 
Equitable Justice in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
</b>10. Held in Yamoussoukro from 21 to 23 February 2013 at the initiative of the 
Independent Expert, the International Conference on Impunity and Equitable Justice in 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire brought together 42 national and international participants to discuss 
transitional justice and combating impunity. The conference was organized jointly with the 
Ivorian Government, the Dialogue Commission, the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights and the International Commission of Jurists, with the support of UNOCI 
and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>11. The participants represented Government bodies responsible for justice and human 
rights (the Ministry of Justice, Human Rights and Public Freedoms and the Ministry of 
Defence, represented by the prosecutor of the military court), the Dialogue Commission, 
civil society actors and international partners such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty 
International, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the International 
Commission of Jurists, the International Federation for Human Rights, the Rassemblement 
africain pour les droits de l&#8217;homme, the International Center for Transitional Justice (ICJT) 
and the International Criminal Court (ICC).  
</p><p>12. The participants examined examples of impunity that have occurred since 1990, 
including the post-election crisis, and analysed the Government&#8217;s responses. They also 
highlighted the most appropriate judicial principles and measures to combat impunity and 
promote equitable justice, based on Ivorian and international law. The Conference also took 
on board the lessons learnt in other countries that have faced similar situations, such as 
Peru, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
Senegal, with the Hiss&#232;ne Habr&#233; case. 
</p>
<p>13. The Independent Expert wishes to thank the following people for their presence at 
the conference: Albert Gerard Koenders, Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
for C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and head of UNOCI; Gn&#233;n&#233;ma Mamadou Coulibaly, Minister of Justice, 
Human Rights and Public Freedoms; and Charles Konan Banny, Chairperson of the 
Dialogue Commission, head of the Human Rights Division of UNOCI and regional prefect 
for the Yamoussoukro district. 
</p>
<p>14. After discussions focused on the situation of victims, recommendations were made 
to the Government, the Dialogue Commission, civil society, the Security Council and the 
ICC. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Update on the general situation in the country 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Organization of regional and local elections 
</b></p>
<p>15. The organization of the latest local and regional elections by the Ivorian 
Government, without external assistance, was a technical success free from major incidents, 
representing significant progress in the country&#8217;s democratic reconstruction. The 
Independent Expert noted that the electoral process had three main characteristics: the non-
participation of opposition parties, notably the FPI and Liberty and Democracy for the 
Republic; a high number of independent candidates; and the verbal abuse and physical 
violence within some parties and particularly within the ruling coalition. The non-</p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.13-15028 
</p>
<p>participation of the FPI, in addition to being regrettable in principle, signals an urgent need 
for an inclusive, democratic multiparty system based on the existence and strength of 
democratic political parties. Although a number of parties aligned themselves with 
traditional parties after the results were announced, the rise of the independents at these 
elections can be considered an indicator of the country&#8217;s renascent democracy and the 
dynamic political reconstruction of its political parties. The violence between the coalition 
parties in power illustrates this political reconstruction, but also the prevalence of a culture 
of violence that could weaken the gains made in terms of institutional democracy. Partisan 
interference by some area commanders carrying out the security functions of the State 
during the election process, although infrequent, illustrates the need for greater vigilance in 
order to guarantee the political neutrality of the apparatus of State, particularly regarding 
security. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Security situation 
</b></p>
<p>16. With the exception of large-scale attacks on State security institutions, the 
Independent Expert noted a slight improvement in the country&#8217;s security situation. Acts of 
violence in Abidjan are generally confined to petty crime. However, attacks on property are 
increasing in the communes of Cocody and Yopougon, accounting for 50 per cent of 
robberies in Abidjan, with an average of four or five per day. The murders reported are 
carried out using combat weapons that probably originated in the post-election conflict. 
</p>
<p>17. The FRCI continue to engage in activities that should be the preserve of the police 
and the Gendarmerie, again raising doubts about their training, integration and conversion 
to a truly republican armed force. The dozos, or traditional hunters, remain determined to 
replace the existing authorities. However, the absence of significant acts of violence by the 
dozos during the regional and local elections shows how much progress has been made 
through the Government&#8217;s policy of restoring the dozos to their cultural role and traditional 
territories. This trend should be bolstered not only by prosecuting proven acts of violence 
but also by a national strategy to make legal provision for traditional cultural institutions. 
The presence of armed groups in protected forests makes for continuing insecurity. The 
delicate question of the link between rural land and ethnicity only exacerbates the 
perception of a lack of security, a perception confirmed by numerous reports received by 
the Independent Expert regarding the occupation on appropriation of large tracts of land, to 
the detriment of local communities. This sensitive question should be dealt with urgently in 
political, legal and cultural circle in accordance with a number of principles, namely the 
overriding importance of coexistence and reconciliation, the democratic inclusion of the 
communities concerned and the prosperity of all through the overall growth of the Ivorian 
economy. 
</p>
<p>18. The Independent Expert has received information indicating that hold-ups and 
roadblocks have decreased considerably, but have not been completely eradicated. The risk 
is greater in some regions of the country, such as the western region near the border with 
Liberia, which remains a major security challenge for the authorities. However, these 
threats are no longer likely to destabilize the State. 
</p>
<p>19. The authorities have informed the Independent Expert of the various measures that 
are being taken to mitigate the security problem, including the creation of the Security 
Operations Command Centre, which comprises various security forces (police, gendarmerie 
and army) and which should help the country to confront its security challenges. The 
authorities have also announced the installation of security cameras on the capital&#8217;s main 
roads, the launch of an anti-racketeering campaign in the security forces, and the 
eradication of indiscriminate roadblocks. </p>


<p>GE.13-15028 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Attempts to restrict public freedoms  
</b></p>
<p>20. The Independent Expert notes that recent contradictory decisions and events 
illustrate the weakness of public freedoms in the country. The arrest of Ousmane Sy 
Savan&#233;, head of a pro-Gbagbo press group, for breaching State security, and his release 
after more than a year in detention, as well as the decision of the National Press Council to 
suspend the weekly B&#244;l&#8217;Kotch publication for eight editions following its publication of 
articles hostile to those in power, illustrate the urgent need for national dialogue on the role 
and responsibilities of the press in the construction of a democratic multiparty system. 
</p>
<p>21. In some instances, security operations have led to serious human rights violations, 
notably unlawful detention and inhuman or degrading treatment carried out by some 
members of the security forces. 
</p>
<p>22. The decision of the Abidjan prosecutor&#8217;s office to refuse the Ivorian Civil Society 
Federation access to its administrative premises following an internal dispute &#8212; despite a 
court decision &#8212; is likely to raise doubts about the willingness in some quarters of 
government to guarantee freedom of association. Civil society should be strong, 
independent and have sufficient resources to play a central role in guaranteeing a 
democratic multiparty system, a role that should have full political recognition and 
appropriate legal protection. 
</p>
<p>23. The Independent Expert has been informed of a number of measures likely to restrict 
political parties&#8217; activities. On several occasions, campaigners have been arrested and then 
freed, without any charge being made against them, or else accused of the generic offence 
of breaching State security. In other cases they have been banned from demonstrating, 
under various pretexts. The most striking example is the Ministry of the Interior ban on the 
FPI rally planned for 16 March 2013. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Implementation of recommendations made to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
and the international community 
</b></p>
<p>24. Since the beginning of the post-election crisis, several recommendations have been 
made to the Ivorian authorities by the Security Council, the Human Rights Council, the 
2011 international commission of inquiry and the Independent Expert. These 
recommendations relate to several areas, including democratic governance and the 
consolidation of the rule of law; national reconciliation and peacebuilding; and the 
promotion of economic and social rights. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Democratic governance and rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>25. Recommendations have been made to the Government concerning the drawing up of 
a consensual democratic charter and the establishment of independent and impartial 
institutions and mechanisms in the areas of elections, financing of political parties, equal 
access to information and communication, and respect for basic freedoms. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Political dialogue and electoral process 
</b></p>
<p>26. Political dialogue is a fundamental condition for the socioeconomic recovery of C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire. Its ultimate goals are to make the national democratic framework the only credible 
forum for political debate, remove all legitimacy from the use of violence and foster a 
culture of peace. Although the implementation of a permanent framework for dialogue with 
the participation of most political parties represents a decisive step in this regard, the non-</p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.13-15028 
</p>
<p>participation of the main opposition party, the FPI, reflects the extent of the political 
fragmentation resulting from the protracted political crisis in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. Given their 
potential for political rebuilding, the regional and local elections are a worrying sign that 
this fragmentation may turn into political polarization. The election schedule, particularly 
the 2015 presidential elections, could well encourage political competition rather than 
political reconciliation and democratic reconstruction, and a return to the political power 
games of the past, the root causes of the violence and longevity of the crisis. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
and in particular its political classes, is therefore at a crossroads between the acquisition and 
retention of power by one political party, and reconciliation and prosperity for its people. 
During his meetings with the main political figures, the Independent Expert noted tensions 
surrounding these two historic options within each political party. The time has come to 
take bold initiatives that, by combining an ethical political approach and a vision for the 
nation, will avoid the repetition of recent history, marked as it has been by conflict and 
division. 
</p>
<p>27. The Independent Expert reiterates his concerns regarding two aspects of the electoral 
process, namely the electoral roll, which has not been updated for more than five years, 
thus violating the right to vote of more than a million voters who have come of age, and the 
structure of the Independent Electoral Commission. 
</p>
<p>28. Some of those whom the Independent Expert met expressed reservations about the 
Government&#8217;s real desire to engage in sincere political dialogue. They accuse the 
authorities of using the subject as bait to win over the international community, without 
truly intending to comply with Security Council resolution 2062, which calls for enhanced 
political dialogue and relevant electoral reforms. 
</p>
<p>29. During his meeting with FPI leaders, the Independent Expert was informed of their 
concerns regarding electoral violence, the tribalization of the army and the problem of exile 
return. They also complain that their property has been confiscated and their assets frozen. 
To date, the FPI claims to have recorded around 668 civil and military prisoners. 
</p>
<p>30. As prerequisites to dialogue with the Government, the FPI continues to demand a 
summit meeting between President Alassane Ouattara and former President Laurent 
Gbagbo, a general amnesty, the holding of peaceful elections and reform of the Independent 
Electoral Commission. 
</p>
<p>31. The Independent Expert notes a number of critical issues requiring urgent action: 
there is no consensual legal framework for the functioning of political parties in C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire, no agreed status for the opposition and no legislation on the financing of political 
parties. The recommendation on the drawing up of a consensual democratic charter is 
particularly pertinent in this context. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Administration of justice and combating impunity 
</b>32. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has been encouraged to create and restore competent judicial, police 
and prison administration institutions, provide sufficient human and material resources to 
the justice system and improve the detention system by releasing perpetrators of minor 
offences and trying other detainees promptly and in accordance with recognized due 
process. 
</p>
<p>33. The Independent Expert recalls that justice is at the heart of democratic 
reconstruction and reconciliation. Its central role both reflects a return to the rule of law and 
underpins the public&#8217;s trust in the legal institutions that are being set up. 
</p>
<p>34. The Independent Expert notes that judicial institutions are being established. The 
Ivorian Government has implemented a justice sector policy to strengthen the independence 
of the judiciary and reform legislation, the Supreme Court, the Supreme Council of Justice </p>


<p>GE.13-15028 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>and the administration of justice, as well as to provide material support for registries and 
introduce a code ethics for judges. 
</p><p>35. Although under Ivorian law witnesses are obliged to cooperate, there is no provision 
for their protection. The Independent Expert recalls that victims and witness protection is 
vital to the successful administration of justice. 
36. The Independent Expert notes that the special investigation unit is prepared to 
follow up the report of the national commission of inquiry, in accordance with the 
recommendations made to the Government. The instigation of legal proceedings against 
those responsible for human rights and international humanitarian law violations, from 
across the political spectrum and including individuals seen to be close to those currently in 
power, is a recommendation made regularly by the Human Rights Council, the 2011 
international commission of inquiry and the Independent Expert. The various arrests made 
following the post-election crisis continue to give the impression of a two-tier justice 
system. The Independent Expert reiterates that violations were committed by both sides 
during the Ivorian crisis, and the exhumation of bodies following the post-election crisis 
marks the start of psychological and non-material reparation for victims. However, the 
Independent Expert has noted that most of the inquiries commissioned are still at the 
preliminary stage, particularly those concerning the Nahibly camp and the mass graves at 
Du&#233;kou&#233;. 
</p>
<p>37. The Independent Expert is concerned by the rotation of judges during the judicial 
year, which can have considerable consequences for the situation of detainees. 
</p>
<p>38. The tendency to arrest individuals on the generic charges of breaching State security 
and later release them may harm the authorities&#8217; credibility. 
</p>
<p>39. The Independent Expert recalls the importance of having a protection mechanism for 
witnesses and victims during the current legal proceedings and the next public hearings of 
the Dialogue Commission. The Independent Expert has been informed that the international 
partners of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire are willing to help in this, draw up a strategy and plan for 
investigations and establish a special registry. 
</p>
<p>40. The investigating judge of the first chamber of the Abidjan military court indicated 
that his court, which is also competent to try offences committed by gendarmes and police 
officers, is currently investigating more than 100 offences committed during the post-
election crisis; there are also several cases of violations committed by the Forces 
R&#233;publicaines de Cote d&#8217;Ivoire (FRCI). The judge recalls that many of the FRCI members 
who committed offences do not have identification numbers because of their background 
(former members of the Forces arm&#233;es des Forces Nouvelles or ex-militia members). He 
has therefore decided to prosecute them under article 6 of the Code of Military Procedure as 
&#8220;persons who, while not legally or contractually connected to the Armed Forces, are 
brought or kept under their control and serve with them&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>41. Despite the assurances given by the authorities, the needs relating to military justice 
are vast. The Ivorian Code of Military Justice does not meet international standards on fair 
trial, notably as regards the role of the Minister of Defence in proceedings. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Situation of detainees 
</b></p>
<p>42. It has also been recommended that the Ivorian Government allow detainees to 
receive visits from organizations responsible for monitoring detention centres and ensuring 
that the detention conditions for former senior officials and other detainees are brought into 
line with international standards. The UNOCI Human Rights Division has noted an 
improvement in the detention conditions at the Campagnie territoriale de Korhogo. 
Nevertheless, two civilians were apparently still being detained there at the time of the </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.13-15028 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert&#8217;s visit. Detainees at the National Surveillance Directorate are still 
incommunicado and do not receive visits from their families or lawyers and detentions in 
FRCI camps continue. 
</p>
<p>43. The Independent Expert notes that assize courts in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire have not been 
established in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
Due process, particularly regarding the rights to a defence and appeal, is not properly 
observed. Judicial authorities therefore face a difficult choice over how to reconcile the 
need to defuse the explosive situation of prison overcrowding with the fact that the assize 
courts do not yet meet international standards. 
</p>
<p>44. In Bouna, the Independent Expert visited around 15 detainees extradited from 
Liberia who have been detained since June 2012. These detainees complain of poor 
detention conditions, the absence of defence lawyers and being detained in cells for 
convicted prisoners. 
</p>
<p>45. Also in Bouna, the Independent Expert visited former Prime Minister Affi 
N&#8217;Guessan, who condemned the irregular conditions of his unlawful detention, which has 
lasted two years. He firmly believed that the serious crisis facing C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire can only be 
completely resolved with the cooperation of all political forces in the country. The former 
Minister of Defence, Lida Kouassi, claimed to have been arrested in Togo, beaten and 
forcibly repatriated. Both of these detainees are forced to use their own resources to obtain 
food and health care. The Independent Expert believes that the recent decision of the 
Ivorian Government to allow a delegation of FPI leaders to visit these two detainees in 
Bouna is a positive step that will encourage political dialogue. 
</p>
<p>46. At the Sainte Anne-Marie International Polyclinic, the Independent Expert met with 
Kuyo T&#233;a Narcisse, former chef de cabinet of President Laurent Gbagbo; Michel Gbagbo, 
son of the former President; Genevi&#232;ve Yobou Bro-Greb&#233;, former leader of Femmes 
Patriotes (Women Patriots); and Simone Gbagbo. At the time of the visit, these detainees 
were receiving treatment for their medical conditions. Kuyo T&#233;a Narcisse claimed to have 
been transferred to the Polyclinic on 12 April 2013 with bullet wounds and injuries 
resulting from his mistreatment on arrest. Mr. T&#233;a Narcisse, who apparently is also of 
French nationality, cannot receive visits from his family or friends. Michel Gbagbo claims 
that the only reason for his arrest was his relationship to his father. Genevi&#232;ve Yobou Bro-
Greb&#233; condemns the conditions of her detention, which began on 12 April 2011. She was 
severely beaten during her arrest and requires rehabilitation because of her injuries. The 
Independent Expert met with Simone Gbagbo for the third time in Odienn&#233;, and then again 
the next day at the Polyclinic, where she had been transferred for medical reasons. Ms. 
Gbagbo, who said that she was relieved to have been moved to the hospital, claims that her 
detention, which began two years ago, is illegal and demands to be either tried or released. 
She is awaiting a decision from the Government on whether she will be tried in C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire or transferred to the ICC. 
</p>
<p>47. The Independent Expert believes that the decision to transfer these four detainees to 
Abidjan for medical care is a conciliatory measure. However, this acknowledgement of 
their right to health should be followed up by recognition of their right to a defence and trial 
or release. The accused persons whom the Independent Expert met during this visit claim 
that they were not informed of the charges made against them. 
</p>
<p>48. At the National Surveillance Directorate, Charles Bl&#233; Goud&#233; told the Independent 
Expert that he had begun a hunger strike eight days earlier in protest at his detention 
conditions, which he considers inhumane. He is locked up for 24 hours a day and cannot 
receive visits of any kind. The Director justified his incommunicado detention, as well as 
that of Colonel Abbei, as being for their own safety and because of the seriousness of the 
charges against them. The Directorate is responsible only for the physical detention of these </p>


<p>GE.13-15028 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>detainees, who are under the jurisdiction of the public prosecutor&#8217;s office. The Independent 
Expert recalls the need to grant full respect for their rights, improve their detention 
conditions, specify their legal status and try them in accordance with due process. 
</p>
<p>49. The Independent Expert congratulates the Ivorian authorities for their full and 
unstinting cooperation in allowing him to access and meet with these detainees. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Promotion and protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Ivorian Government was asked to develop a human rights promotion, training 
and awareness-raising programme. Practical efforts have been made to protect human 
rights, notably in dealing with civilian detainees held in military detention centres. The 
number of human rights violations attributable to the FRCI, including arrests for crimes 
against State security, declined considerably from January to April. Clashes with the 
general public still occur, however, particularly in Nahibly and Port-Bou&#235;t, where the FRCI 
continue to interfere in land disputes. The Independent Expert welcomes the establishment 
of a joint body by the chief of staff of the Armed Forces and the UNOCI Human Rights 
Division to monitor FRCI violations. 
</p>
<p>51. The Independent Expert notes that the vast majority of victims of human rights 
violations still do not obtain reparation and are not represented by defence lawyers. 
Nevertheless, he has been informed of several joint initiatives taken by the Government and 
the country&#8217;s international partners to strengthen citizens&#8217; access to justice, for example by 
establishing legal clinics in six regions of the country and by training judges. 
</p><p>52. The Independent Expert notes with satisfaction the recent establishment of the 
National Human Rights Commission, even though it has existed in law since December 
2012. The establishment of this institution is important to the credibility of the ongoing 
democratic reconstruction process. The Commission&#8217;s balanced membership in terms of 
institutional representation, gender and areas of expertise in human rights is an encouraging 
sign that it will function properly. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Combating sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>53. It was recommended that the State should provide victims of sexual violence with 
medical and psychological assistance and means of reparation, and prosecute perpetrators. 
The Independent Expert notes an increase in acts of sexual violence, particularly gang 
rapes, rapes of minors and rapes in school. Although rape is classified as an offence in 
Ivorian legislation, the fact that the assize courts have not been sitting has led the courts to 
reclassify the offence as &#8220;indecent assault&#8221;, which carries trifling penalties. The need to 
produce evidence of rape also poses a major obstacle. The Independent Expert wishes to 
remind the State that, although medical certificates play an important role in the 
prosecution of rape cases, they are not essential. He deplores the fact that police officers 
and officers of the criminal investigation service insist on seeing a medical certificate to 
take victims&#8217; complaints. Despite efforts by the judiciary, female genital mutilation still 
takes place, due to the pervasiveness of cultural attitudes. It appears that no specific training 
on dealing with cases of sexual violence has been provided to the police, the gendarmerie 
or the Armed Forces, and that no legal aid has been provided to the victims. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. International human rights commitments 
</b></p>
<p>54. To date, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has signed a large number of relevant human rights 
instruments, and these are awaiting ratification by parliament. The UNOCI Human Rights 
Division has informed the Independent Expert that, with parliament, it has developed a 
strategic plan on ratification. The Independent Expert notes with satisfaction that human 
rights training has been incorporated into the education system. He now urges the </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.13-15028 
</p>
<p>Government to improve implementation at the national level of rights guaranteed at the 
international level. 
</p>
<p>55. In this regard, implementing the recommendation to issue a standing invitation to 
the Human Rights Council special procedures mandate holders to visit C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire could 
send a strong signal about the Government&#8217;s efforts to promote human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Reform of the security sector 
</b></p>
<p>56. With regard to security, it was recommended that C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire should quickly 
disarm anyone who is not part of the defence and security forces, exclude from those forces 
anyone responsible for human rights violations, promote human rights training and ensure 
the punishment of proven human rights violations and the success of the disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration process. 
</p>
<p>57. The Independent Expert recalls that reform of the security sector is not only a 
precondition for meeting all political, economic and social challenges, but will also be a 
decisive factor in the renewal of the social contract, which has been profoundly weakened 
by years of social fragmentation during the protracted crisis. Giving full weight to the 
significant fact that the FRCI is a combined force made up of two former enemy armies, the 
National Armed Forces of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and the Forces Nouvelles, the Government should 
vigorously pursue its efforts to fuse it into a single military entity, notably by thoughtfully 
and proactively including all ethnic groups, both in recruitment and in promotion.  
</p>
<p>58. The clarification and sharing of responsibilities among the police and the 
gendarmerie in matters of public security, and the Armed Forces in matters of defence, 
must be done on a national basis. In this context, denying legal status to non-legitimate 
actors and groups, such as the dozos, in matters of security is an important aspect of 
building security credibility with the general public. The Government should also complete 
the process of getting the FRCI into barracks.  
</p>
<p>59. The ultimate goal &#8212; a solid guarantee of a peaceful society &#8212; is republican, 
democratic and non-partisan armed forces and security forces that will serve the Ivorian 
people exclusively. It is critical that politicians show a sense of political ethics and realize 
what a serious impact of any attempt to exploit the security forces for partisan purposes 
would have. The Independent Expert notes with interest and hope, however, the far-
sightedness of the chief of staff&#8217;s moves to provide human rights training to the Armed 
Forces. One notable example is the issuance of certificates by the chief of staff and the 
director of the UNOCI Human Rights Division to the Ivorian soldiers in the International 
Support Mission to Mali. The Independent Expert suggested that this human rights training 
should be supplemented with training in intercultural and interreligious dialogue, 
particularly in the context of the growing fragmentation and ethnic and religious intolerance 
in the Sahel-Sahara region. Enrolment in the army and security forces should be an 
opportunity for soldiers with a background in the rich cultural and ethnic diversity of C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire to learn about interculturality and multiculturalism. In this regard, the Independent 
Expert offers to share his own experience as former director of intercultural and 
interreligious dialogue at UNESCO.  
</p>
<p>60. On 8 August 2012, the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire established the Disarmament, 
Demobilization and Reintegration Authority to reintegrate approximately 65,000 former 
combatants. The capacity of the public sector to absorb these former combatants is limited, 
however. They will be recruited into security-related services, namely water and forest 
services, customs and prison services. The vast majority should be absorbed by the private 
sector, and the most highly qualified directed into technical field. There is a risk, therefore, 
that barely contained frustrations might find an outlet in desperate acts that undermine 
security. The Independent Expert points out that the reintegration of former combatants </p>


<p>GE.13-15028 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>requires a parallel social policy to get young people into the labour market, so that 
unemployment, which is associated with political tension, does not become a breeding 
ground for political exploitation. 
</p>
<p>61. In this regard, the Independent Expert was informed of serious incidents in Bouak&#233;, 
started by former combatants dissatisfied with their conditions of reintegration and the 
assistance provided. On 11 April 2013, about 200 of them reportedly blocked the southern 
entrance to the city for several hours. The Government should give due weight to this 
serious incident and respond firmly, while at the same time fully recognizing its social 
dimension and the potential impact on a newly restored but still fragile security situation, 
the aim being to achieve social calm and provide an object lesson in democracy and respect 
for human rights. The Independent Expert has received mutually corroborating information 
about the disappearance &#8212; or kidnapping according to some witnesses &#8212; of one of the 
leaders of this demonstration. He hopes that this disappearance can be satisfactorily 
resolved in a way that will reassure the demonstrators and prevent any taint falling on the 
process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, thereby keeping the private 
partners so vital to the process on board. The chair of the Disarmament, Demobilization and 
Reintegration Authority, who is discharging this great responsibility with vision and skill, 
should continue to have the necessary means to cope with the challenges he is facing. The 
State of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire needs 90 billion CFA francs for the reintegration of demobilized 
combatants. Furthermore, this process is closely linked with the reform of the security 
sector. 
</p>
<p>62. The Independent Expert has received reports of attempts at manipulation that could 
compromise the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, with former 
area commanders allegedly showing bias when selecting beneficiaries. The Independent 
Expert believes that the entire programme needs to be under the direct control and 
supervision of the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Authority. The 
Independent Expert has received reports that former area commanders accused of serious 
human rights violations have been promoted within the ranks of the army. 
</p>
<p>63. The Independent Expert notes that the disarmament process is facing many technical 
and political obstacles, including the traceability of weapons in circulation and the lack of a 
database on the real situation of former combatants. 
</p>
<p><b> B. National reconciliation and peacebuilding 
</b></p>
<p>64. Several recommendations have been made to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire on national 
reconciliation, such as incorporating the concept of cultural, ethnic and religious pluralism 
into the Constitution, implementing a national reconciliation programme, publishing a 
white paper on human rights violations between 2002 and 2011, identifying memory sites 
symbolizing the violations committed during the crisis, ensuring the proper functioning of 
the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission and taking due account of the Ivorian 
people&#8217;s values of peaceful coexistence in the reconciliation process. 
</p>
<p>65. The Independent Expert notes that progress has been made in discharging the 
mandate of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission. About 37 local 
commissions have been established. With more than 48,000 persons having testified, the 
quantitative phase is complete and will be followed by the qualitative phase, during which 
decisions will be taken about what period and what sector of the population to cover. The 
manner in which the Commission has discharged its mandate in remote areas of the 
country, working with all sectors of society, shows awareness of the need to restore the 
peaceful coexistence of the Ivorian people and replace multiculturalism with 
interculturalism in order to repair the social fabric. Diplomats and civil society </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.13-15028 
</p>
<p>organizations have nevertheless emphasized that more community and religious leaders 
need to be involved in the reconciliation process. 
</p>
<p>66. The Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission has informed the Independent 
Expert that it has created a reliable database that will make it possible to hold public 
hearings within the next few months. The Commission is also looking into the root causes 
of the crisis. The Independent Expert is concerned about the fact that the Commission&#8217;s 
mandate will expire in September 2013. 
</p>
<p>67. The Independent Expert points out that human rights should embrace Ivorian 
cultural values, which have provided a solid foundation that has kept the Ivorian people 
from slipping into genocide. There is reportedly a tendency for some religious 
denominations to preach radical sermons, sometimes discriminating against women, which 
runs counter to the secular nature of the State of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. 
</p>
<p>68. The Independent Expert wishes to emphasize the role of children in the 
reconciliation process, and he agrees with the approach taken by the representative of the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, who suggested that &#8220;play 
areas could become reconciliation areas&#8221;. Schools should be put to use to help rebuild 
citizenship. 
</p>
<p>69. The Independent Expert notes the important fact that exiles whose lands have been 
transferred to newcomers are trying to return. Although the Government has stressed that 
soldiers and civilians occupying public buildings and property belonging to exiles are being 
evicted, the Independent Expert regrets that no far-reaching measures have been taken to 
allow exiles to return their illegally occupied land, particularly in the western parts of the 
country, and this constitutes a serious infringement of the right to housing and property. 
The tension between exiles and new occupants negatively impacts community cohesion and 
the reintegration of exiles into the social life of the country. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Promotion of economic and social rights 
</b></p>
<p>70. Recommendations were also made to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire with regard to economic and 
social development, equality among regions and communities, and measures for women 
and children, the main victims of the crisis. 
</p>
<p>71. The Independent Expert believes that the promotion of civil and political rights is 
closely linked with economic and social rights. In his view, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire urgently needs to 
work to achieve stability and social peace in order to foster a climate conducive to 
investment and economic and social progress, which is essential for meeting the 
population&#8217;s basic needs. 
</p>
<p>72. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has shown a growth rate of more than 8 per cent, but this growth has 
yet to improve the daily lives of the Ivorian people. According to the World Bank 
representative in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, this runaway growth, which is driven by public investment 
in large-scale State infrastructure projects, is far from robust. The private sector appears to 
be ready to invest in the country but is holding back due to the uncertain security situation. 
The World Bank representative in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire said that the unemployment rate is around 
49 per cent. According to the United Nations Development Programme, each year more 
than 30,000 jobs are created in the formal sector, but more than 200,000 new graduates 
enter the labour market. This situation raises the key issue of young people&#8217;s access to 
employment. 
</p>
<p>73. Basic social services are still difficult to access. The sustainability and continuity of 
health services are not guaranteed. The health-care facilities were damaged during political 
and military clashes after the 2010 elections. The maternal and infant mortality rate is 500 </p>


<p>GE.13-15028 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>per 100,000 births. Only 10 per cent of Ivorians are covered by social security. As for 
education, classrooms are overcrowded, holding as many as 120 students. The 
announcement of budget allocations for specific social needs is an important step but must 
be put into practice. 
</p>
<p>74. The Ivorian authorities informed the Independent Expert that a national social 
development strategy has been established. Nevertheless, Ivorian civil society organizations 
and development partners are concerned about the centralist nature of the social measures 
being taken. They report that actions are too heavily focused on the west, when social 
problems are also evident in the north. A strategic plan at the communal and regional levels 
could encourage decentralized governance and allow the communities to act as stakeholders 
in the process; it would also prevent further widening of the disparity between regions, 
especially in the north and the east of the country. The consequences of the expansion of 
Abidjan on the population&#8217;s socioeconomic conditions must be dealt with. There is 
reportedly noticeable economic and social tension in the northern part of the country, 
particularly during pastoralists&#8217; seasonal migration. 
</p>
<p>75. The Independent Expert notes the commitments made to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire by its 
economic partners at the meeting held in Paris in December 2012 and believes that those 
commitments urgently need to be fulfilled in order to foster the economic and social 
recovery that is essential for sustainable democratic and social reconstruction. 
</p>
<p>76. The Independent Expert has received reports of illegal exploitation of children, 
notably in mines. Children returning from asylum countries always have problems with 
civil registration. As to the education system, school violence persists. The Independent 
Expert has noted an increase in the number of rapes in school; that leads to teenage 
pregnancy. Women&#8217;s participation in the political process remains very low. 
</p>
<p>77. The Independent Expert notes the process under way to draft a new rural land law to 
replace that of 1998. Given this issue&#8217;s central importance in Ivorian society and the serious 
consequences that follow when it is exploited for political purposes, it should be addressed 
in a holistic manner, focusing on three major issues: common economic prosperity, 
coexistence and reconciliation, and democratic reconstruction. 
</p>
<p>78. The various calls for illegally occupied property to be evacuated have not yet 
produced the expected results. The abusive exploitation of the country&#8217;s natural resources 
and the occupation of sacred forests by armed gangs are likely to have serious ramifications 
for the environment and ultimately for the exports so necessary to the country&#8217;s balance of 
trade, notably cocoa. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Specific recommendations to the international community 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Independent Expert notes with satisfaction that the international community 
continues to provide C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire with substantial assistance in various areas &#8212; re-
establishment of the rule of law, national reconciliation and economic and social 
development &#8212; in particular by assisting the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission, strengthening the judiciary and the security apparatus, promoting human 
rights and contributing to the country&#8217;s economic recovery. A stronger commitment from 
the private sector is particularly needed at this stage. However, the Independent Expert 
regrets that his many calls to lift the arms embargo on Cote d&#8217;Ivoire have gone unheeded. 
</p>
<p>80. Thus far, the relevant United Nations bodies have not made public the report of the 
international commission of inquiry established by the Commission on Human Rights in 
2004; that report could help in the unbiased search for truth in the ongoing transitional 
justice process and the fight against impunity. </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.13-15028 
</p>
<p>81. UNOCI, by virtue of its mandate to build peace and support the judiciary and the 
security sector, is still a key tool for the rebuilding of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. The Independent 
Expert notes the felicitous intersection of his mandate with that of UNOCI, which, 
particularly through its Human Rights Division, continues to work with the United Nations 
system, the Government and civil society in the area of training and capacity-building. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The growing dangers in the Sahel-Sahara region, especially Mali, and the 
entrenchment of cultural and religious fragmentation and social division throughout 
the region should impel political players in Ivorian society to take the urgent steps 
needed to make democratic reconstruction, national reconciliation and economic and 
social development the best possible defence against these forces.</b> 
</p>
<p>83. <b>C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire can be considered both a country and a region by virtue of its 
geography, population, economy and history, and serves as a model country not only 
because of its economic and social prosperity, but also because of its capacity for 
national reconciliation and for the pluralistic democratic rebuilding of a society 
deeply fragmented by a protracted crisis. The institutional bases needed to rebuild a 
collapsed State are in place, and economic and social recovery is on the horizon, but 
the problems of deep political fragmentation and weakened security remain. The 
establishment of an inclusive democracy based on a fair justice system, a human 
rights culture that influences the whole of society and the renewal of peaceful 
coexistence are the major challenges that must be met to achieve the necessary 
national catharsis of consciousness. A national vision focusing on the best interests of 
the Ivorian people and a new political ethic should prevail over party political power 
struggles.</b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>The Independent Expert believes that a political dialogue, which everyone he 
has consulted considers urgent, could be structured around the following main issues: 
the legal status of the opposition (financial and material resources, freedom of 
expression and assembly, etc.), the joint development of a democratic charter, the 
reform of the Constitutional Court, the reform of the Independent Electoral 
Commission and the electoral roll and the question of rural landownership. Two 
major factors give this dialogue particular urgency: the election schedule, and 
particularly the 2015 presidential elections, and the rising tensions in the Sahel-
Sahara region.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The following recommendations made by the Independent Expert are, for the 
most part, the outcome of the International Conference on Impunity and Equitable 
Justice in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, held in Yamoussoukro from 21 to 23 February 2013.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>With regard to national mechanisms on impunity and transitional justice, the 
Independent Expert recommends that the Government:</b> </p>


<p>GE.13-15028 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ensure that mechanisms to combat impunity are in line with 
international human rights standards and norms, and in practice reflect local 
specificities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure efficient and effective collaboration and coordination among the 
various national bodies responsible for combating impunity and providing 
transitional justice, without detriment to their individual mandates (the Dialogue, 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the special investigation unit and the military 
court); 
 (c) Strengthen the sharing of experiences and information among all 
national bodies dealing with impunity and transitional justice, including the former 
national commission of inquiry, and in particular the various investigation reports, 
the pattern of human rights violations, exhumation work and the national 
commission&#8217;s database, while maintaining the confidentiality of the information in 
question; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Strengthen collaboration among national and international mechanisms 
to combat impunity and particularly between the International Criminal Court, the 
special investigation unit and the military court; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Improve communication, information and awareness-raising among the 
population about the mandates, missions and specific activities of the various national 
bodies dealing with impunity and transitional justice; 
 (f) Ensure that the material, temporal and territorial competence of the 
judicial and extrajudicial transitional justice mechanisms is as broad as possible, so 
that they may fulfil their mandates effectively and without discrimination, and in 
particular review the temporal competence of the special investigation unit, whose 
mandate covers only the post-election period;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Extend the mandate of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission if it has not completed its work by September 2013; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Ensure that the mandates of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission and the new National Programme for Social Cohesion are clearly defined 
and that their work and resources are coordinated. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>With regard to legal proceedings, the Independent Expert recommends that the 
Government:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Make full use of the many reports issued by national and international 
NGOs and international commissions of inquiry throughout the crisis in order to 
initiate proceedings to identify the perpetrators of serious human rights violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) In accordance with international law, either try or release persons who 
have been detained for more than 2 years since the post-electoral crisis; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Prosecute all perpetrators of serious crimes, regardless of their status or 
ethnic, religious or political affiliation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Strengthen the independence of judges and prosecutors and provide the 
judiciary with the necessary means to effectively carry out its duties; 
 (e) Rule out the application of general amnesty laws in the fight against 
impunity, especially for international crimes such as genocide, crimes against 
humanity and war crimes, which are not subject to statutory limitations, and also for 
serious human rights violations; in this regard, amend the amnesty ordinance of 2007 
to bring it into line with international law; </b></p>


<p><b>18</b> GE.13-15028 
</p>
<p><b> (f) Prosecute all violations, including those carried out before the post-
electoral crisis, by lifting the restrictions on prosecution by State authorities; in this 
regard, authorize the special investigation unit to go back to 2002 and deal with the 
most serious human rights violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Draft and publish a strategy and action plan for the special investigation 
unit; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Adopt an open criminal policy for the Ministry of Justice, Human Rights 
and Public Freedoms as an expression of the State&#8217;s political will to combat impunity; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Amend the Criminal Code to ensure that serious crimes against 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law are not subject to 
any statute of limitations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Establish a mechanism to protect victims, witnesses, judges, lawyers and 
human rights defenders; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Bring Ivorian law into line with all the State&#8217;s obligations under the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) In accordance with the Rome Statute, fulfil the obligation to cooperate 
with the International Criminal Court by responding to summonses issued by that 
court, either by handing over the wanted persons to The Hague or by challenging its 
competence where the Ivorian judiciary is already seized of cases involving the same 
crimes and provides all guarantees of a just and fair trial; 
 (m) Improve the effectiveness of investigations and prosecutions, particularly 
by strengthening the capacities of public prosecutor&#8217;s offices, courts and tribunals and 
by making the necessary legislative reforms; 
</b></p>
