<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In resolution 63/178, the General Assembly reaffirmed its request to the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, in mainstreaming the right to development, to 
undertake effectively activities aimed at strengthening the global partnership for development 
between Member States, development agencies and the international development, financial 
and trade institutions, and to reflect those activities in detail in her next report to the Human 
Rights Council. The General Assembly also requested the Secretary-General to submit a report 
at its sixty-fourth session and an interim report to the Council on the implementation of 
resolution 63/178, including efforts undertaken at the national, regional and international levels 
in the promotion and realization of the right to development, and invited the Chairperson of the 
Working Group on the Right to Development to present a verbal update to the Assembly at its 
sixty-fourth session. At its eleventh session, the Human Rights Council was notified that 
pursuant to the above-mentioned resolution, the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner 
would submit a consolidated report to the twelfth session of the Council. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report is submitted in accordance with the above-mentioned requests. 
</p>
<p><b>II. ACTIVITIES OF THE OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH 
COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS RELATING TO THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has 
continued to provide organizational, substantive and analytical support to the open-ended 
Working Group on the Right to Development, which is mandated to monitor and review progress 
made in the promotion and implementation of the right to development, providing 
recommendations and further analysing obstacles to its full enjoyment. 
</p><p>4. OHCHR has also continued to provide similar support to the high-level task force on the 
implementation of the right to development, established in resolution 2004/7 of the Commission 
on Human Rights and decision 2004/249 of the Economic and Social Council. The objective of 
the task force is to provide the necessary expertise to the Working Group to enable it to make 
appropriate recommendations to various actors on the issues identified for the implementation of 
the right to development. The task force comprises five experts nominated by the Chairperson of 
the Working Group on the Right to Development. 
</p>
<p>5. The criteria adopted by the Working Group in 2006 for the periodic evaluation of global 
partnerships for development, as identified in Millennium Development Goal 8, from the 
perspective of the right to development (the right to development criteria) and their subsequent 
application, refinement and progressive development constitute important steps in the 
operationalization of the right to development, reflecting the concrete and pragmatic approach 
taken by the Working Group in its deliberations. The efforts to operationalize the right to 
development through the progressive development of the criteria have contributed to the creation 
of an environment conducive to undertaking activities aimed at strengthening global partnerships 
for development between Member States, development agencies and international development, 
financial and trade institutions. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>A. Implementation of the recommendations of the Working 
Group on the Right to Development at its ninth session 
</b></p>
<p>6. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 9/3, which endorsed the 
recommendations of the ninth session of the Working Group on the Right to Development, 
OHCHR has assisted the task force in the implementation of the relevant recommendations. 
</p>
<p>7. The Working Group recommended that under phase II (2008) of its three phase workplan, 
the task force continue dialogue with the African Peer Review Mechanism, the joint Economic 
Commission for Africa/Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development-Development 
Assistance Committee (ECA/OECD-DAC) Mutual Review of Development Effectiveness, the 
Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, and the Cotonou Agreement; give priority to access to 
essential medicines in developing countries and for this purpose conduct a desk review of the 
Intergovernmental Working Group on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property 
(IGWG); and apply the criteria to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria 
(Global Fund) and the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases 
(TDR). The task force was also requested to invite the Common Market of the South 
(MERCOSUR) to consider entering into a dialogue, subject to an agreement on the scope of 
such a dialogue. 
</p>
<p>8. For phase III (2009), the Working Group recommended that the task force consider the 
thematic issues of debt relief and transfer of technology. On debt relief, the task force was 
requested to engage in a dialogue with the institutions responsible for the Heavily Indebted Poor 
Countries Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, subject to their agreement, and on 
technology transfer, to examine the Clean Development Mechanism of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Development Agenda of the 
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). 
</p>
<p>9. OHCHR provided organizational, research and analytical support to the technical missions 
conducted by the high-level task force to open a dialogue with IGWG, the Global Fund and 
TDR. OHCHR also supported the technical mission to follow-up on its dialogue on the 
Cotonou Agreement with the Directorates-General for Trade and Development of the 
European Commission and the Secretariat of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. 
In the context of these dialogues, OHCHR commissioned and directed research on the 
application of the right to development criteria to the partnerships concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Fifth session of the high-level task force on the 
implementation of the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>10. The fifth session of the high-level task force was held from 1 to 9 April 2009 in Geneva. 
The task force has continued to facilitate a constructive dialogue amongst all participants, 
including task force members, experts who have prepared commissioned studies, representatives 
of institutional members of the task force, and representatives of organizations involved in the 
selected partnerships. Member States and non-governmental organizations participated as 
observers. The task force considered the status of implementation of its workplan for the period 
2008-2010 endorsed by the Human Rights Council in resolution 9/3 and in this context, reviewed </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the global partnerships mentioned in paragraph 7 above. The task force also held a preliminary 
discussion on the global partnerships in the thematic areas of debt relief and transfer of 
technology mentioned in paragraph 8. 
</p>
<p>11. Building on lessons learned through the dialogues with several global partnerships, the task 
force substantively reviewed and substantially refined the right to development criteria, 
conceptualized around the key attributes of (a) comprehensive human-centred human 
development; (b) the enabling environment; and (c) social justice and equity. The interim draft 
list of criteria was shared with the Working Group as work in progress in order to benefit from 
views of Member States. 
</p>
<p>12. The task force recommended a continued dialogue with partnerships already reviewed and 
specific activities related to additional development partnerships. 
</p>
<p>13. The report of the task force (A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/2), including its conclusions and 
recommendations, was submitted to the tenth session of the Working Group on the Right to 
Development. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Tenth session of the Working Group on the Right to Development 
</b></p>
<p>14. The tenth session of the Working Group on the Right to Development was held from 22 
to 26 June 2009. The Working Group considered the report of the fifth session of the high-level 
task force, including the assessments of the selected global development partnerships and their 
linkage with the revised right to development criteria, while providing comments on the revised 
criteria submitted by the task force. 
</p>
<p>15. In its conclusions and recommendations the Working Group requested the task force to 
focus on the refinement of the criteria and the elaboration of corresponding operational 
subcriteria to be submitted to the Working Group at its next session in 2010. It also 
recommended that in further refining the criteria and preparing the sub-criteria, the task force 
undertake some activities relating to global partnerships in the area of technology transfer, such 
as consultations to gather information on the WIPO Development Agenda and a review of the 
UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism, including in connection with mitigation of and 
adaptation to climate change. The Working Group also recommended that at its next session, the 
task force devote time to examine the experience of the institutions and procedures that address 
the issue of debt relief, including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the 
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. 
</p>
<p>16. The report of the Working Group (A/HRC/12/28), including its conclusions and 
recommendations, will be submitted to the twelfth session of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Assessment criteria for the implementation of the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>17. OHCHR, together with the Program on Human Rights in Development at the 
Harvard School of Public Health and the Measurement and Human Rights Program at the 
Harvard Kennedy School of Government, coorganized, in January 2009, an expert meeting on 
methodological issues of qualitative and quantitative tools for measuring compliance with the 
right to development. The meeting provided an opportunity for academics, international experts </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and practitioners to debate political and methodological challenges in measuring compliance 
with the right to development. It also facilitated expert assessments of the existing right to 
development criteria with a view to revising them and making them operational and reflective of 
standards of qualitative and quantitative evaluation used in international institutions and 
recognized by leading social scientists. Thus the outcome of this meeting fed into the work of the 
high-level task force in the refinement of the criteria. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Financing for development 
</b></p>
<p>18. OHCHR, in cooperation with the Center for Concern and ESCR-Net (International 
Network for Economic, Social &amp; Cultural Rights), facilitated civil society consultations from 
15 to 17 September 2008 to discuss and debate the main themes in the financing for development 
agenda from the perspective of human rights. The consultations aimed at integrating human 
rights, including the right to development, in financing for development against the backdrop of 
challenging development issues given the volatility and crises in the world economy, that have 
tended to overshadow the Doha development agenda and the need for a new economic and social 
framework that not only prevents future crises, but provides for fairness in their resolution. The 
meeting brought together a number of participants, including human rights and development 
experts and civil society groups from different regions, and resulted in a set of consolidated 
comments on the draft outcome document for the Follow-up International Conference on 
Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, held in 
Doha from 29 November to 2 December 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Aid effectiveness, human rights and gender equality 
</b></p>
<p>19. Aid effectiveness, with its emphasis on ownership, harmonization, alignment, managing 
for results and mutual accountability, aims to increase the impact of aid in reducing poverty and 
inequality and accelerating the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. In 
collaboration with the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), OHCHR has developed a joint working paper to 
provide strategic input to the Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra to articulate 
advocacy strategies and messages for the aid effectiveness agenda from the perspective of human 
rights and gender equality. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Millennium Development Goals and poverty reduction 
</b></p>
<p>20. OHCHR has continued to work closely with development partners at the international and 
national levels to explore how human rights, including the right to development, can support the 
efforts of Member States to achieve inclusive development processes and equitable and 
sustainable poverty reduction outcomes. OHCHR has developed a conceptual framework to 
assess poverty reduction strategies from a human rights perspective which should contribute to 
further operationalizing the links between human rights and the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals. A publication &#8220;Claiming the Millennium Development Goals: A human 
rights approach&#8221; was produced in 2008, which aimed to provide guidance for policymakers 
and practitioners to strengthen policies based on the Millennium Development Goals and 
United Nations programming from a human rights perspective, and promoting a wider 
understanding on the linkages between the Goals and human rights, including the close 
relationship between Goal 8 and the right to development. Based on the approach set out in </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>this publication, OHCHR jointly with other development partners within and outside the 
United Nations has organized two regional dialogues in Johannesburg and Bangkok during the 
second half of 2008, which helped to define various rights-based approaches to national 
development strategies based on the Millennium Development Goals with forward-looking 
follow-up implications. OHCHR also contributed to the work of other United Nations agencies 
and to publications on the Millennium Development Goals and poverty reduction strategies, 
emphasizing how both international and national human rights responsibilities are critical for 
poverty reduction. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Trade and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>21. Exploring the impact of trade policies on the realization of human rights could contribute 
to the integration of the promotion and protection of the right to development in global 
development partnerships, including trade agreements. During the World Trade Organization 
Public Forum in October 2008, OHCHR co-sponsored and participated in a panel discussion 
entitled &#8220;The New &#8216;Geneva Consensus&#8217; Defining People-Centred and Development-Oriented 
Trade Policy: Can a Human Rights Approach Help?&#8221; The discussion explored conceptual issues 
at the intersection of trade and human rights, including the right to development, and values of 
the human rights framework in helping countries define people-centred trade policies.
