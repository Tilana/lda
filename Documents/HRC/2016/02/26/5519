</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also</i> that everyone should enjoy the human right to education, which is

on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other relevant international instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful</i> of recent significant developments and remaining challenges in the promotion and 
protection of economic, social and cultural rights at the national, regional and international 
levels, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> that, on current trends, some key goals of the Education for All initiative 
agreed upon at the World Education Forum, held in Dakar in April 2000, will not be achieved by 
2015, including the goal of universal primary education, despite progress made in recent years 
towards achieving such goals, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to take all measures to implement Council resolution 8/4 with a 
view to ensuring the full realization of the right to education for all; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on the right to education, in particular 
his report on the right to education of persons in detention in the criminal justice system; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also welcomes</i> the work of the United Nations treaty bodies in the promotion of the 
right to education, and notes with interest the holding, by the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, of a general discussion day on the theme &#8220;The right of the child to education in 
emergency situations&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Further welcomes</i> the contribution of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and that of 
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization towards attaining the 
Millennium Development Goals of achieving universal primary education and eliminating 
gender disparity in education and the goals of the Education for All initiative, agreed upon at the 
World Education Forum; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 5. <i>Welcomes</i> the convening, by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural

World Conference on Education for Sustainable Development, held from 31 March to 
2 April 2009, in Bonn, the Sixth International Conference on Adult Education, held in 2009 in

regional and headquarters levels; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Urges</i> all relevant stakeholders to increase their efforts so that the goals of the 
Education for All initiative can be achieved by 2015, including by tackling persistent inequalities 
based on income, gender, location, ethnicity, language, disability and other factors, and notes the 
role that good governance can play in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Stresses</i> the need for cultural and educational programmes to be developed with a 
view to raise awareness on human rights, and urges States to intensify their efforts in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Urges</i> all States to ensure the right to education of persons in detention in the 
criminal justice system as an imperative in its own right, and to provide appropriate education to 
foster reintegration into society and help reduce recidivism, including by making every effort: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To ensure equal access to education for all female and male detainees; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To develop a coherent policy for education in detention; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To remove barriers to education in detention, including its possible negative impact 
on opportunities for remuneration in prison; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To make available to all detainees comprehensive education programmes aimed at 
the development of the full potential of each detainee; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To incorporate human rights education in the programmes; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To develop individual education plans with the full participation of the detainee, 
taking into account the diverse backgrounds and needs of persons in detention, including women, 
persons belonging to minority and indigenous groups, persons of foreign origin and persons with 
physical, learning and psychosocial disabilities, while recalling that a detainee may belong to 
more than one of these groups; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To integrate education programmes into the public school system, in order to allow

<p> (<i>h</i>) To ensure appropriate professional training and working conditions and a safe

</p>
<p> (<i>i</i>) To evaluate and monitor all education programmes in places of detention, and to 
undertake multidisciplinary and detailed research in this regard; 
</p>
<p> (<i>j</i>) To share best practices concerning education programmes in detention; 
</p>
<p> (<i>k</i>) To produce and deliver adequate pedagogical materials for persons in detention, 
including appropriate opportunities to receive education and training in the use of new 
information technologies; 
</p>
<p> (<i>l</i>) To ensure that primary education is compulsory, accessible and available free to all, 
including to all children in detention or living in prisons; 
</p>
<p> (<i>m</i>) To ensure curricula and educational practices that are gender-sensitive but not 
gender-stereotypical in places of detention, in order to fulfil the right to education of women and 
girls; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 11. <i>Encourages </i>the Office of the High Commissioner, the treaty bodies, the special 
procedures of the Council and other relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms, specialized 
agencies or programmes, within their respective mandates, to continue their efforts to promote 
the realization of the right to education worldwide, and to enhance their cooperation in this 
regard; 
</p>

report on the right to education of migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers;
