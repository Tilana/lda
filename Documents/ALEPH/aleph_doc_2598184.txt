H2 FY2016
  Record exports of 14.5Mt in FY2016 (FY2015: 12.2Mt), of which 7.6Mt was exported in the
second half of FY2016 (H2 FY2016)
  Revenue up by 9% to A$786M (FY2015: A$718M) of which $413M was earned in H2 FY2016
  Average FY2016 realised price of A$55.47/ WMT CFR (FY2015: A$59.96/ WMT CFR)

  C1 costs down by 25% to A$34.39/WMT (FY2015: A$45.74/WMT)

  Non-cash asset impairment & write downs of A$101M (FY2015: A$1,077M) have contributed to
a statutory loss of A$159M (FY2015: A$1,378M)
Atlas Iron Limited (ASX: AGO or Atlas) has today released its FY2016 annual results.   These results reflect 
the impact of lower iron ore prices which, with 19% higher tonnes, delivered an increase in revenue of 9% to 
A$786M.  The  increase  in  revenue  also  reflects  the  additional  lump  tonnes  sold  in  FY2016  which  attract  a 
premium price. 
 
Atlas was able to achieve significant cost reductions during FY2016 where the savings generated were able 
to match or better the rate of decline experienced in the iron ore price. The FY2016 full cash cost per tonne 
was reduced by 24% to A$52.59/WMT (FY2015: A$68.95/WMT), with the average realised price per tonne 
received in FY2016 of A$55.47/ WMT CFR (FY2015: A$59.96/ WMT CFR). The average 62% Fe price was 
US$51.37/ DMT CFR in FY2016 (FY2015: US$71.39/ DMT CFR) and the average USD/AUD exchange rate 
changed from 0.8382 in FY2015 to 0.7283 in FY2016. 
 
After allowing for non-cash asset impairments and inventory write-downs of A$101M (FY2015: A$1,077.1M) 
and a depreciation and amortisation expense of A$85M (FY2015: A$117.8M), Atlas recorded a statutory loss 
of A$159M (FY2015: A$1,378M). 
 
Cash  on  hand  at  30  June  2016  was  A$80.9M  after  investing  A$14.5M  (including  the  lump  circuit  at  Mt 
Webber), repayment of debt facilities (A$16.9M) and payment of interest (A$29.5M). The net proceeds of the 
July  2015  capital  raising  of  A$46.6M  strengthened  Atlas’  balance  sheet  and  improved  its  working  capital 
position.  
 
As  advised  last  year,  Atlas  entered  into  new  commercial  relationships  with  key  contractors  and,  with  the 
support of the Western Australian Government, targeted a substantially  lower cost  base in a lower  iron ore 
price environment to ensure a more sustainable business. In addition, as part of the contractor collaboration 
model,  Atlas  moved  to  reduce  exposure  to  volatility  in  iron  ore  pricing  by  utilising  hedging  products,  fixed 
price  sales  contracts  and  shorter  dated  pricing  periods.  This  has  reduced  Atlas’  exposure  to  iron  ore  price 
risk.
Borrowings  have decreased by  A$150M primarily  as  a result of a debt restructure completed in May  2016. 
The key terms of the restructure were as follows:
Term loan debt reduced from US$267M to US$135M and extended maturity date to April 2021;
 
  Annual cash interest expense reduced by ~65% due to the lower debt balance and reduced cash
interest rate;
  Atlas issued 6,229,503,087 fully paid ordinary shares and 4,513,986,260 7.5 cent 31 July 2017 options 
to acquire fully paid ordinary shares in Atlas to the Term Loan Lenders (Lenders) such that the Lenders 
held 70% of all Atlas shares on issue at 6 May 2016.
Borrowings  have  been  negatively  impacted  by  the  change  in  the  AU$:US$  foreign  exchange  rate  from 
0.7680 at 30 June 2015 to 0.7426 at 30 June 2016. 
 
Pursuant  to  the  debt  restructure  completed  in  May  2016,  the  Lenders  and  Atlas  have  entered  into  an 
amended  Term  Loan  Agreement  where  the  six  monthly  Asset  Coverage  Ratio  has  been  replaced  with  a 
minimum  cash  balance  covenant  requiring  Atlas  to  have  a  minimum  of  A$35  million  at  the  end  of  each 
month. A  100% cash sweep pay  down  has  also been introduced for any cash in excess of A$80 million at 
the end of each quarter to be paid to the lenders in the following month.

Horizon 1 mining properties
Atlas’  Horizon  1  mining  properties  relate  to  the  assets  and  liabilities  contained  within  its  current  operating 
mines and the Corunna Downs development project. During the year ended 30 June 2016, Atlas recognised 
an  impairment  loss  for  its  Horizon  1  mining  properties  of  A$13,273,000  (property,  plant  and  equipment  of 
A$4,170,000  (2015:  A$7,003,000)  and  mine  and  reserve  development  assets  of  A$9,103,000  (2015: 
A$169,948,000)) all of which was highlighted in our H1 FY2016 half year report in February 2016.

Horizon 2 projects
Atlas’ Horizon 2 projects relate predominantly to the McPhee Creek and South East Pilbara projects. During 
the  year  ended  30  June  2016,  Atlas  recognised  an  impairment  loss  for  its  Horizon  2  projects  of 
A$79,400,000  (mining  tenements  capitalised  of  A$78,700,000  (2015:  A$574,286,000)  and  reserve 
development assets of A$700,000 (2015: A$32,285,000)) due primarily to changes in the forecasted iron ore 
price (provided by independent iron ore forecasters).
Horizon 2 projects Ore Reserves
Atlas  is  currently  completing  a  review  of  its  Ore  Reserves  as  at  30  June  2016.  In  its  2015  Annual  Report, 
Atlas reported Ore Reserves for its  Horizon 2 projects at McPhee Creek and South East Pilbara (Davidson 
Creek Hub). Based on current assessments of the ability to fund rail and port infrastructure for these iron ore 
projects, Atlas advises that it is unlikely to report Ore Reserves at 30 June 2016 for its Horizon 2 projects at  
McPhee  Creek  and  South  East  Pilbara  (Davidson  Creek  Hub)  but  expects  to  continue  to  report  Mineral 
Resources  for  the  two  projects.  Atlas  expects  to  release  its  Mineral  Resource  and  Ore  Reserves  as  at  30 
June 2016 in its Annual Report expected to be released October 2016.
Atlas  is  continuing  to  investigate  a  trucking  based  infrastructure  solution  for  its  McPhee  Creek  project. 
Should  such  a  trucking  based  infrastructure  solution  for  its  McPhee  Creek  project  be  feasible,  Atlas  may 
again be able to report Ore Reserves for its McPhee Creek project.
Further details regarding Atlas’ FY2016 annual results can be found in the accounts lodged with ASX today.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
Atlas’ purpose is to deliver mineral products that create value for all stakeholders including shareholders, customers, 
suppliers, and the communities in which the Group operates. In order to achieve this goal, Atlas’ strategy is to 
consolidate its current production base with a competitive cost base, and to pursue opportunities through optimising 
near term production to maximise profitability and cash flow, developing customer and market focused solutions, and 
maintaining options for growth, should market conditions allow.
A discussion on factors that will impact the achievement of the Group’s Strategy can be found later in this Operating and 
Financial Review in “Factors and Business Risks that affect Future Performance”.

Revenue 
 
Tonnes sold (WMT) have increased by 19.0% from the prior year. This increase is attributable to the suspension of 
operations in the prior period impacting tonnes sold and also increased production from Mt Webber coupled with 
productivity improvements at Wodgina and Abydos.

Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2016 was $785.8 million following the sale of 14.5 million tonnes of iron ore at an 
average realised selling price of AU$55.47 per tonne. The increase of revenue by 9.4% has resulted primarily from an 
increase in tonnes sold of 19.0% and additional lump tonnes sold which attract a premium price, offset by a reduction in 
the average realised price by AU$4.49 per tonne (7.5%).

Underlying EBITDA and EBIT 
The following graph shows a comparison of underlying EBITDA for the year ended 30 June 2016 compared to the prior 
year:
Underlying EBITDA has increased by $126.0 million to $74.5 million as a result of favourable impact of significant 
reduction in the Group’s All-in cash cost per tonne (23.2%)  and increase in tonnes sold including Atlas lump, partly 
offset by a 7.5% decrease in the average iron ore price received.

ATLAS IRON LIMITED 2016 ANNUAL REPORT
Atlas Iron Limited and its Controlled Entities - Annual Report 
Directors’ Report (continued)
Underlying loss after tax 
The underlying loss after tax of (AU$57.7) million improved from a loss of (AU$240.2) million in the prior year due to 
favourable EBITDA movement outlined above, partly offset by a reduction in the AUD/USD exchange rate resulting in 
foreign exchange losses on the USD denominated debt facility and higher interest. 
 
Statutory loss after tax 
The statutory loss after tax has improved by AU$1,218.8 million from the prior year to a loss of AU$159.0 million due to 
the favourable impact on costs as a result of the contractor collaboration detailed above and other savings with reduced 
write-downs and one off transactions, including:
- 
- 
- 
- 
-
impairment charges on assets of AU$97.1 million; 
inventory valuation write-down of AU$3.7 million; 
restructuring costs, the majority of which were onerous lease provisions, of AU$3.8 million;  
realised gain on term loan B debt to equity swap of AU$5.5 million; and 
the impact of other one off costs and business combinations of AU$2.2 million.
C1 cash cost per tonne  
C1 cash cost per tonne decreased by 24.8% (AU$11.35 per tonne) from the prior year to AU$34.39 per tonne 
associated with cost reduction initiatives including the positive effect from the Contractor Collaboration agreement and 
other cost savings. 
 
All-in cash cost per tonne  
The All-in cash costs per tonne decreased by 23.2% (AU$14.88 per tonne) from the prior year to AU$49.35 per tonne 
due to a reduction in C1 cash costs, freight, royalties, corporate costs and other overheads. 
 
Full cash cost per tonne 
Full cash cost per tonne decreased 23.7% (AU$16.36) from the prior year to AU$52.59 due to a reduction in All-in cash 
costs, sustaining capital and higher tonnes sold.

performance of the Group. A reconciliation between statutory results to underlying results is provided in “Underlying cash gross margin” 
section above. These non-IFRS measures are unaudited. 
 
There has been a significant improvement in the cash flows from operations of AU$98.2 million during the year ended 
30 June 2016 as a result of the Company completing the contractor collaboration in May 2015 and other cost savings 
which lowered the Company’s cost base but the iron ore price volatility continues to impact operating cash flows. The 
Group remains focused on reducing costs further and mitigating the iron ore volatility risk.  
 
Net Investing and Financing Cash Flows 
The reduction in mine development and reserve development spend reflects the conclusion of Atlas’ initial mine 
development phase. The majority of capital spent related to the conversion of the Mt Webber crusher to facilitate the 
production of lump product.
Cash outflows from financing activities has improved in the year ended 30 June 2016 to AU$1.9 million by AU$64.6 
million a result of the cash inflows from the capital raising completed in July 2015 offset by higher interest payments as 
a result of the depreciation in AUD/USD exchange rate and debt restructure expenditure. 
 
Cash 
At the end of the financial year, Atlas had AU$80.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. The following graph outlines 
the cash inflows and outflows during the year:
The increase in cash from AU$73.3 million to AU$80.9 million during the year has primarily resulted from: 
- 
- 
-
an increase in revenue receipts; 
proceeds from royalty assistance program; 
continued reduction of operating costs; and

Working capital has increased by AU$67.2 million to AU$69.7 million due to:
- 
-
-
increase in cash outlined above; 
lower trade and other payables balance as a result of reduced costs arising from contractor collaboration and 
other savings; and 
increase in trade receivables at 30 June 2016 compared to the prior period as a result of increase in tonnes 
shipped.
Borrowings 
Borrowings has decreased by AU$150.2 million primarily as a result of a debt restructure completed on 6 May 2016. 
The key terms of the restructure were as follows:
-
-
-
term loan debt reduced from US$267 million to US$135 million and extended maturity date from December 
2017 to April 2021; 
annual cash interest expense reduced by ~65% as a result of the lower debt balance and reduced cash 
interest rate; and 
Atlas issued 6,229,503,087 fully paid ordinary shares and 4,513,986,260 options to acquire fully paid ordinary 
shares in Atlas to the Term Loan Lenders (Lenders) such that the Lenders held 70% of all Atlas shares on 
issue at 6 May 2016.
Borrowing have also been negatively impacted by the change in the AU$:US$ foreign exchange rate from 0.7680 at 30 
June 2015 to 0.7426 at 30 June 2016. 
 
Factors and business risks that affect future performance 
 
Atlas operates in a changing environment and is therefore subject to factors and business risks that will affect future 
performance. The following factors and business risks could have a material effect on Atlas’ future results from 
operations and financial position: 
 
Commodity prices  
Atlas’ revenues and cash flows are derived from the sale of iron ore. The majority of Atlas’ sales contracts use a pricing 
formula linked to the spot market for iron ore. Contract pricing is often based on the spot market price in a future period.  
This has meant that Atlas’ final received price is known one to two months after iron ore is shipped. Atlas’ financial 
performance has historically therefore been exposed to fluctuations in the iron ore price, which has been particularly 
volatile in recent times.
As part of the contractor collaboration deed, Atlas looks to reduce volatility on a three month look forward basis using 
hedging products, fixed price sales and shorter dated pricing periods. This will reduce exposure to iron ore price risk, 
but may also limit Atlas’ ability to leverage any potential iron ore price appreciation.
Iron ore prices may be influenced by numerous factors and events that are beyond the control of Atlas, including 
increased global supply, actions of other producers, decreased demand, currency exchange rates, general economic 
conditions, regulatory changes and other global, regional, political and economic factors. Atlas cannot provide any 
assurance as to the prices Atlas will achieve for its iron ore. Changes in iron ore prices may have a positive or negative 
effect on various aspects of Atlas’ business including debt covenants, profit margins, project development and 
production plans and activities, together with its ability to fund those plans and activities.
Atlas sells iron ore products of differing nature and grade. The market for such products varies depending on factors 
outlined above. As the lump product market is smaller than the fines product market the impact of competitor activity or 
changes in demand have the potential to be amplified and therefore impact the price received.

The price received by Atlas is adjusted for Fe grade and quality.  
 
Exchange rates 
Atlas is exposed to fluctuations in the US dollar as all sales are denominated in US dollars. The Company borrows 
money and holds a portion of cash in US dollars, which provides a partial natural hedge.
Accordingly, Atlas’ income from, and the value of its business, will be affected by fluctuations in the rates by which the 
US dollar is exchanged with Australian dollars.
Although steps may be undertaken to manage currency risk (e.g. via hedging strategies), adverse movements in the 
Australian dollar against the US dollar may have an adverse impact on Atlas.

Refer to Note 29 to the financial statements for details of the Company’s foreign currency exposure and sensitivity 
analysis.  
 
Operating and development risks 
Atlas’ operations and development activities could be affected by various unforseen events and circumstances, which 
may result in increased costs, lower production levels and, following on from that, lower revenue levels. Any negative 
outcomes flowing from these operational risks could have an adverse effect on Atlas’ business, financial condition, 
profitability and performance.
Mining requires significant interaction with the natural environment and is impacted by inherent vulnerability including 
(but not limited to) weather, ground conditions, mineral enrichment, mineral endowment and ore physical 
characteristics, each of which might have an impact of the overall deliverability or cost of the ore delivered to customers. 
Atlas seeks to minimise the potential damage flowing from these risks by obtaining business interruption insurance for 
certain events and appropriate indemnities from suppliers and contractors. 
 
Debt covenants 
Atlas has financing arrangements in place which are at risk of acceleration and enforcement if a default arises under 
them. The Term Loan B is secured, so enforcement may involve enforcement of security over the assets of Atlas and its 
material subsidiaries, including appointing a receiver.
The Lenders and Atlas have entered into an amended Term Loan Agreement where the six monthly Asset Coverage 
Ratio has been replaced with a minimum cash balance covenant requiring Atlas to have a minimum of AU$35 million at 
the end of each month. A 100% cash sweep pay down has also been introduced for any cash in excess of AU$80 
million at the end of each quarter to be paid to the lenders in the following month.
Atlas is, as at the date of this Financial Report, in compliance with its obligations under the Term Loan B.  
 
Regulatory and title risk 
Changes in legislative and administrative regimes, taxation laws, interest rates and other legal and government policies 
in Australia may have an adverse effect on the assets, operations and ultimately the financial performance of Atlas and 
the market price of Atlas shares.
Exploration and production are dependent on the granting and maintenance of appropriate licences, permits and 
regulatory consents and authorisations (including those related to interests in tenements), which may not be granted or 
may be withdrawn or be made subject to limitations at the discretion of government or regulatory authorities.  Atlas also 
relies on authorisations pursuant to contractual regimes with various counterparties in relation to its ongoing operations 
and development activities. Although such authorisations may be renewed following expiry or granted (as the case may 
be), there can be no assurance that such authorisations will be continued, renewed or granted, or as to the terms of 
renewals or grants. If there is a failure to obtain or retain the appropriate authorisations or there is a material delay in 
obtaining or renewing them or they are granted subject to onerous conditions, then Atlas’ ability to conduct its 
exploration, development or operations may be adversely affected. 
 
Interest rates 
Atlas is exposed to interest rate risk on its borrowings, which are predominately held in US dollars and have a floating 
interest rate above a LIBOR floor. Fluctuation in interest rates above that LIBOR floor will have an impact on the
12
ATLAS IRON LIMITED 2016 ANNUAL REPORT
Atlas Iron Limited and its Controlled Entities - Annual Report 
Directors’ Report (continued)
Company’s earnings. Refer to Note 29 to the financial statements for details of our interest rate exposure and sensitivity 
analysis.  
 
Health, safety and environment  
Atlas is subject to regulation in respect of the health and safety of our people and the protection and rehabilitation of our 
environment. This is an area that is continually evolving and the expectations of communities can be different to the 
regulations in place. Health, safety and the environment is a key focus area of Atlas and the Company does all that it 
can do to comply with regulations and meet the expectations of the community. Given the sensitive nature of this area, 
Atlas may be exposed to litigation, foreseen and unforseen compliance and rehabilitation costs despite its best efforts.  
 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN STATE OF AFFAIRS 
 
On 24 July 2015 on the back of the prospectus issued in June 2015, the Company had received applications for AU$87 
million from existing shareholders, contractors and new investors. The Company issued 1.74 billion fully paid ordinary 
shares at an issue price of AU$0.05 per share. In addition, 1.74 billion free listed options were issued to subscribing 
parties, which are exercisable at AU$0.075 per share and expire on 30 June 2017. The Company lifted the trading 
suspension of its securities on 27 July 2015. 
 
During the year ended 30 June 2016, the Company has achieved significant cost and debt reductions which are now 
leading to positive operating margins.  
 
On 6 May 2016, Atlas completed the debt restructuring announced in December 2015. This debt restructure has 
resulted in the following:
•
•
•
•
Atlas has reduced its term loan debt from US$267M to US$135M and extended the maturity date from 
December 2017 to April 2021;
Atlas has reduced its annual cash interest expense by ~65% as a result of the lower debt balance and 
reduced cash interest rate;
Atlas has issued 6.23 billion fully paid ordinary shares and 4.51 billion options excerisable  at AU$0.075 per 
share to acquire fully paid ordinary shares in Atlas to the Term Loan Lenders (Lenders) such that the Lenders 
held 70% of all Atlas shares and options on issue at 6 May 2016; and
the Lenders and Atlas have entered into an amended Term Loan Agreement where the six monthly Asset 
Coverage Ratio covenant has been replaced with a minimum cash balance covenant requiring Atlas to have 
a minimum of AU$35 million at the end of each month.
The Company has significantly reduced its full cash costs by 23.7% thanks largely to the continued success of the 
contractor collaboration agreements and other operating cost savings. The Company remains focused on further cost 
reduction and welcomed the announcement, by the WA Government on 28 June 2016, of the extension of reduced port 
charges until 30 June 2017. 
 
All of the above factors have placed Atlas in a stronger financial position at 30 June 2016 and provides further evidence 
of how Atlas and its shareholders stand to enjoy a brighter future following the successful restructures. 
 
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE DATE 
 
On 28 June 2016, Mr Flanagan resigned as Managing Director, and retired effective 5 August 2016. Non-Executive 
Director, Mr Harris, has been appointed as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer and will continue in this role 
until a permanent replacement is appointed and commences employment with the Company. Thereafter, Mr Harris will 
revert to being a Non-Executive Director of the Company.
On 29 August 2016, haulage provider McAleese Limited announced that it had entered into voluntary administration (Refer 
to Note 1(a) of the consolidated financial statements) and appointed McGrath Nicol as Administrators of the McAleese 
Group.  
 
No other matters have arisen since 30 June 2016, which have significantly affected, or may significantly affect the 
operations of the Group, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the Group in subsequent financial years.  
 
LIKELY DEVELOPMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS 
 
During the coming year, the Group plans to continue mining operations at its Wodgina, Abydos and Mt Webber mines 
under a revised operating strategy founded on the back of the contractor collaboration model. Production at Wodgina 
and Abydos will decrease towards the end of the financial year in accordance with their mine plans. 
  
The Group will continue work on exploration and evaluation activities, particularly at its existing projects, Corunna 
Downs and McPhee Creek, to progress these projects towards production.

REMUNERATION REPORT
Letter from the Remuneration and Nomination Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of my fellow committee members and our Board, I am pleased to present our 2016 remuneration report.
The remuneration report provides insight to shareholders into the Board’s decisions on how we remunerate and reward 
our Executive team to achieve our overall business strategy. The Board strives to align the structure of our Executive 
remuneration with shareholder expectations and will continue to engage with shareholders and proxy advisors to ensure 
their expectations are taken into consideration when planning for the future. The 2015 Remuneration Report received 
positive shareholder support with a vote of 98.0% in favour at the 2015 Annual General Meeting (2015 AGM).
The 2016 financial year has seen continued volatility in the iron ore industry globally, and Atlas’ shareholders have felt 
the impact of this instability. The Board and Remuneration Committee are committed to delivering remuneration 
outcomes that are aligned to shareholder expectations.
With this in mind, at the 2015 AGM, the Board sought and received shareholder approval to issue incentive options to 
employees. These options were subject to a vesting condition that required execution of a debt refinancing which was 
completed on 6 May 2016.
The structure of our Executive’s remuneration package remains a key focus of our Board to ensure alignment with the 
resilient nature of Atlas’ business as it optimises operations, looks for incremental growth opportunities, and continues 
to reduce costs.
I commend the Remuneration Report to you.
Regards
Alan Carr 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

Committee and Nomination and Governance Committee.
REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE 
Remuneration Committee
The Atlas Board is responsible for ensuring that the remuneration arrangements for the Group are aligned with the 
overall business strategy and shareholders’ interests. The role of the Remuneration Committee is to advise the Board 
on Executive remuneration. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on Executive remuneration 
arrangements, including where appropriate, all awards under the Long Term Incentive (LTI) plan and approves the level 
of the Short Term Incentive (STI) pool.
The Remuneration Committee comprise the following Directors:

2.2 
Given the continued market volatility over the past 12 months and the debt restructure completed on 6 May 2016, the 
Board determined on 6 June 2016 to undertake an independent remuneration review for the FY 17 year. This 
independent review was completed by Lyons Benenson & Company Inc., an independent remuneration consultant, in 
August 2016.

EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS
The Board is committed to driving alignment between the remuneration arrangements of its Executives and KMP within 
the expectations of our shareholders, its employees and the Company’s sustainability.  
 
The Executive Remuneration Policy aims to reward Executives fairly and responsibly in accordance with the Australian 
market and ensure that the Group: 
− 
− 
−
provides competitive rewards that attract, retain and motivate Executives of the highest calibre; 
sets demanding levels of performance which are clearly linked to an Executive’s remuneration; 
structures remuneration at a level that reflects the Executive’s duties and accountabilities and is competitive 
within Australia and, where applicable, internationally; 
benchmarks remuneration against appropriate comparator groups;  
aligns Executive incentive rewards with the creation of value for shareholders; and  
complies with applicable legal requirements and appropriate standards of governance.
− 
− 
−
The following table illustrates how the remuneration strategy aligns with the strategic direction, and how the various 
elements of the remuneration arrangements for Executives are linked to performance.
Strategic purpose 
We deliver mineral products that create value for our shareholders, our people, customers and the communities we 
operate within. 
 
Remuneration strategy linkage to business objectives 
To align the interests of Executives with shareholders and to attract, motivate and retain high performing individuals. 
 
FIXED REMUNERATION 
Purpose: 
To provide a competitive fixed remuneration element based on criticality of role, market and individual skills and 
experience. 
 
Instrument: 
Comprises of a base salary, statutory superannuation contributions and other fixed benefits. 
 
Performance link: 
Strategically aligned individual performance objectives are assessed annually during remuneration reviews. 
 
AT RISK SHORT TERM INCENTIVE (STI) 
Purpose: 
To reward Executives for business success in achieving short term objectives and for their contribution to the 
achievements of the organisation as a whole and their business units. 
 
Instrument: 
Paid in cash and equity.  
 
Performance link: 
For KMPs the short term incentive plan is structured so an individual KPI achievement is required to be met to qualify 
for the overall corporate objectives. Corporate measures are to drive a focus on leading and lagging safety outcomes 
and earnings.  
 
At the Board’s absolute discretion, the STI plan for Executives may include a deferral element awarded as equity.
AT RISK LONG TERM INCENTIVE (LTI) 
Purpose: 
To reward Executives for business success in achieving long term objectives and for their contribution to the 
achievements of the organisation as a whole and their business units. 
 
Instrument: 
Paid in equity.  
 
Performance link: 
For KMPs the long term incentive plan is structured so that 100% is linked to long term performance outcomes 
determined by the Board.
Remuneration mix
3.1 
The remuneration arrangements for Executives consist of fixed remuneration, short term incentives and long term 
incentives. Market trends, strategic business objectives and shareholder interests are considered when determining the 
mix of remuneration and how each component will drive desired outcomes. Based on these considerations, the 
following summarises the target remuneration components for Atlas Executives for the 2016 financial year.

The Board sought and received shareholder approval to issue zero priced incentive options to employees at the 2015 
AGM. These options vested in May 2016 on completion of the debt restructure. 
 
3.2 
3.2.1 
KMPs are provided a competitive fixed remuneration element based on criticality of role, market comparator data and 
individual skills and experience. Fixed remuneration consists of base pay and superannuation. 
 
3.2.2 
In FY 2016 the STI plan is linked to an individual performance rating (Personal Component) and an overall corporate 
cash earnings objective with a safety requirement (Corporate Component). At the beginning of the financial year, 
targets were approved for the 2016 financial year, all of which aimed at driving business growth, generating efficiencies 
in cost and importantly driving shareholder value. The STI plan aims to drive the organisation to achieve its shorter term 
milestones that, in turn, provide the foundations for long term growth and thus, greater shareholder wealth. 
 
Personal Component 
KMPs are set personal KPIs and performance rating targets which must be achieved before an STI is awarded 
(Personal Component). If the personal performance rating is not achieved then no STI is awarded to that individual 
irrespective of corporate target performance. 
 
Corporate Component 
KMP’s are only eligible for the Corporate Component of the FY 2016 STI plan if the business achieves a certain positive 
cash generation measure (Earnings Performance Gateway) and meets a minimum Total Recordable Injury Frequency 
Rate result (TRIFR) (Safety Result).   
 
In the event that the Earnings Performance Gateway hurdle or Safety Result is not met, STI will not be awarded. The 
Earnings Performance Gateway is calculated as the Atlas realised selling price less Full Cash Costs including 
contractor profit share multiplied by tonnes sold in the period. 
 
A linear approach is taken in the classification intervals between the Earnings Performance Gateway and TRIFR levels 
when calculating the STI award.

At 30 June 2016, the minimum Earnings Performance Gateway was met with Cash Earnings for the period of AU$40.3 
million resulting in a Defined Pool of AU$1.8 million. The TRIFR for the period was 8.69 resulting in a final STI pool of 
AU$0.8 million which is to be distributed amongst all employees based on the individual’s performance rating.
At 30 June 2016, 69% (2015: 100%) of KMPs Corporate STI payments have been forfeited as full performance targets 
were not met.
Going forward, the Board is reviewing both the STI plan and is considering complementing it with a longer term equity 
plan to preserve cash and increase employees’ equity ownership in the Company.

Directors’ Report (continued)
Short term incentive deferred plan
3.2.3 
Whilst STI plans pay rewards over a short period of time i.e. twelve months, Atlas has taken into consideration feedback 
from shareholders and proxy advisors and has deferred up to 20% of KMPs rewards since the financial year 2014. No 
STI was deferred in the 2015 financial year given no STI was awarded during the year and no deferred STI was offered 
to employees in FY 2016 given the focus on short term financial restructuring.
The STI deferral plan is currently being reviewed by the Board following the debt restructure completed on 6 May 2016. 
 
3.2.4 
Zero priced options were issued, following shareholder approval at the 2015 AGM. The options vested on the first to 
occur of:
Long term incentive (LTI) plan
- 
-
-
31 December 2017 (the expiry date of the original Term Loan B Facility);  
the existing Term Loan B is refinanced or restructured to the satisfaction of the Board in its absolute 
discretion; or  
a Change of Control Event occurs, as that term is defined in the Rules.
These options vested upon the successful completion of the restructure on 6 May 2016. As in previous financial years, 
eligibility to any LTI reward is subject to the participant’s continuous service over the term of the plan at the point of 
vesting.
The zero priced options percentage of TFR issued for Executives is shown in the table below:

KMP equity ownership
5.1  
As mentioned above, the Board took into consideration both shareholder and investor feedback in relation to equity 
ownership amongst its’ Executives and introduced a STI deferral plan for KMPs in 2014. In addition KMPs were issued 
zero price incentive options in November 2015 which vested on 6 May 2016. In line with market practice, a minimum 
shareholding obligation is not enforced. As mentioned above, the Board is currently reviewing the STI plan, STI deferral 
plan and LTI plan. 
 
6. 
The key principle underpinning Non-Executive Director (NED) remuneration is the need to attract high calibre and 
resilient Directors to direct the current business and into the future.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION
The Board’s policy is to periodically review its approach to NED remuneration and seeks independent advice to ensure 
its NED fees remain competitive with other similarly sized mining production companies listed on the ASX.
No element of NEDs remuneration is linked to the performance of the Company as Directors’ fees are the only form of 
remuneration for the NEDs. However, to create alignment with shareholders, NEDs are encouraged to hold equity 
securities in the Company. At the date of this report some NEDs hold some form of equity securities in the Company. All 
Directors are subject to the Company’s “Guidelines for Dealing in Securities”.
The Company makes superannuation contributions on behalf of the NEDs in accordance with its statutory 
superannuation obligations, and each Director may sacrifice part of their fee for a further superannuation contribution by 
the Company.
NED fees are not paid to the Managing Director or any other executive director as the time spent on Board work and the 
responsibilities of Board membership are considered in determining the remuneration package provided as part of 
normal employment conditions. The total remuneration paid to, or in respect of, each NED during the year is set out in 
this report.
The remuneration structure of NEDs from the 6th May 2016 consists of both Director fees and committee fees. The 
Chairman of the Board does not receive any additional fees for his or her role on any committees.

Modification of terms of equity settled share-based transactions 
No terms of options or rights over ordinary shares in Atlas Iron Limited have been altered or modified by the issuing 
entity during the year or the prior year.
Board policy in relation to hedging unvested equity 
The Board limits employees from entering into transactions that limit the economic risk of participating in unvested 
employee entitlements. Each Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) option and rights is personal to the holder and is not 
transferable, transmissible, assignable or chargeable without permission of the Board. Without prior approval and 
subject to compliance with the Corporations Act 2001, Directors and Key Management Personnel should not enter into 
agreements that provide lenders with rights over their interests in the Company’s shares and options, such as the 
disposal of the Company’s shares or options, that is the result of a secured lender exercising its right. Before entering 
into such arrangements, Directors and senior management must receive clearance from the Board. The LTIP rules state 
that an employee must not transfer, assign, dispose of or grant any security interests over or otherwise deal with any 
rights.

ATLAS IRON LIMITED 2016 ANNUAL REPORT
Atlas Iron Limited and its Controlled Entities - Annual Report 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Atlas Iron Limited (the Company) is a company limited by shares incorporated in Australia whose shares are publicly 
traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The consolidated financial statements of Atlas Iron Limited for the 
year ended 30 June 2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group or Atlas) and 
the Group’s interest in associates and jointly controlled entities. The Group is a for-profit entity and its principal activity is 
the exploration, development and operation of mines in the Pilbara region in Western Australia.  
 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial report are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. These financial statements were 
approved by the Board on 30 August 2016. 
 
(a) 
Statement of compliance 
This general purpose financial report has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and other 
authoritative pronouncements issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the Corporations Act 
2001. The financial report of the Group complies with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
 
Basis of measurement 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following items 
measured at fair value:
Basis of preparation
• 
• 
•
share-based payment transactions; 
financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss; and 
derivative and other financial instruments.
Functional and presentation currency 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the Group’s functional currency. 
The Group is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations Instruments 2016/191, dated 1 April 2016 and, in accordance 
with that Corporations Instrument, amounts in the Directors’ Report and financial report have been rounded off to the 
nearest thousand dollars, unless otherwise stated. 
 
Going Concern 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realisation of assets and 
the discharge of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.  
 
As at 30 June 2016, the Company has net assets of AU$269.7 million which have increased by AU$49.0 million since 30 
June 2015 mainly from:
•
•
•
completion of the Term Loan B debt for equity restructure in May 2016 which reduced the loan by US$132 
million; 
lower operating costs due to the contractor collaboration agreement and other cost initiatives, a focus on cost 
control; and 
gross margin from increased tonnes shipped in the year ended 30 June 2016.
The above favourable movement in net assets is offset by non-cash impairment charge of AU$97.1 million due to 
continued volatility in iron ore price. The Company has positive net current assets as at 30 June 2016 of AU$67.9 million.  
 
In May 2016 the Company successfully completed the restructure of its Term loan B. The key terms of the restructure 
are as follows:
• 
• 
•
•
Atlas reduced its term loan debt from US$267 million to US$135 million; 
extended the maturity date from December 2017 to April 2021;  
reduced its cash interest expense by over 65% as result of the lower debt balance and reduced interest rate; 
and 
The TLB lenders were issued shares and options such that, immediately post the restructure, they held 70.0% 
of the Company’s shares and options on issue. Refer to Note 19 for further details.
Under the completed restructure, the Asset Coverage Ratio test in the original loan agreement has now been replaced. 
It includes among other requirements a more transparent requirement that the Company has a minimum of AU$35 
million in cash at the end of each month. As at 30 June 2016, the restructured debt remains in good standing and Atlas 
is in compliance with all obligations. The Company’s net debt position (cash and cash equivalents less drawn debt 
facilities) is AU$108.5 million as at 30 June 2016 which is summarised as follows:

The Company prepares rolling 12 month cash flow forecasts. The cash flow forecast to August 2017 (the forecast 
period) has a positive working capital balance throughout that period.
The material assumptions adopted by the directors in the cash flow forecasts include:
•
• 
• 
•
Forecast iron ore price for the forecast period of between AU$64 and AU$79 per tonne (benchmark IODEX 
62% Fe CFR China). The USD 62% Fe CFR China price and the AU$:US$ foreign exchange rate, have been 
independently sourced.  
Estimated sale of 16.2 million tonnes for the 14 month period ended 31 August 2017. 
Forecast cost savings based on the contractor collaboration Deed for the Abydos and Wodgina mines.  
A significant contribution from the sale of lump product from both the Abydos and Mt Webber mines 
generating an expected premium to the standard fines product of Atlas.
•  Repayment of royalty relief in quarterly instalments (total of $12.3 million) during the period.
The cash flow forecast to August 2017 is highly dependent upon the achievement of USD iron ore price and AUD:USD 
exchange rate forecasts and the achievement of forecast operating cost and production outcomes.  
 
On 29 August 2016, haulage provider McAleese Limited, a party to the contractor collaboration deed, announced that it 
had entered into voluntary administration and appointed McGrath Nicol as Administrators of the McAleese Group. Based 
on information available to the Company at this time, haulage of ore from its three mining operations will continue as 
normal in the short term whilst the Administrator assesses each business. It is the Director’s expectation that McAleese 
will continue to provide contracted supply services beyond the short term. The Directors have considered the risks 
associated with any potential interruption of supply of haulage services beyond the short term. In such an event they are of 
the view that a reinstatement of the existing fleet or arrangement of alternative supply would be available to enable the 
continued transport of ore to port.  
 
To illustrate the sensitivity to iron ore price, a downward movement in the independent forecasters forward prices of 5% 
would result in a net reduction in forecast working capital and cash of approximately AU$7 million by the end of August 
2017 to forecast working capital of AU$47 million and cash of AU$45 million (assuming no change in the assumed 
US$:AU$ exchange rate). 
 
The Directors believe that the cash flow forecasts are reasonable with respect to all material factors. On this basis the 
going concern basis of preparation has been adopted. The cash flow forecasts are highly sensitive to movements in the 
Australian dollar iron ore price which continue to be depressed in a challenging global iron ore market. A material 
uncertainty relates to the risk of a sustained decline from forecast prices during the forecast period or the production and 
cost assumptions contained in the forecast do not eventuate.  
 
Should the key assumptions of the cash flow forecast not be achieved, the Company may breach the requirements of its 
Term Loan B. The Company may then be required to renegotiate terms with its lenders or source additional funds through 
debt or equity markets. In this regard the Directors would review other funding options, such as unsecured debt, 
convertible notes and offtake agreements with financing elements. The ability to renegotiate terms or access sufficient 
funds in this way represents a material uncertainty. 
 
These material uncertainties related to future events give rise to significant doubt about the ability of the Company to 
continue as a going concern and realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities in an orderly manner at the amounts stated 
in the financial report.  
 
(b) 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Atlas Iron Limited and its subsidiaries 
together with the Group’s share of joint arrangements and associates accounted for as described below.
Principles of consolidation
(i)
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all those entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

ATLAS IRON LIMITED 2016 ANNUAL REPORT
Atlas Iron Limited and its Controlled Entities - Annual Report 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
In preparing the consolidated financial statements all intergroup balances and transactions, income, expenses, 
unrealised gains/losses and profit or loss, resulting from intergroup transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted by the Group.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at their cost of acquisition in the Company’s financial statements. 
 
Non-controlling interests are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the 
acquisition date. Changes in the Groups’ interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for 
as equity transactions.
(ii)
Investment in associates and joint ventures
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control. This is generally 
the case where the Group has significant voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity 
method of accounting, after initially being recognised at cost. 
 
A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of 
the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Joint control is defined as the 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities 
require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the 
equity method.  
 
Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to 
recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and the Group’s 
share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Goodwill relating 
to the joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested 
for impairment. Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the 
carrying amount of the investment.  
 
The financial statements of the associate or joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. 
When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group. 
 
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on 
its investment in its associate or joint venture. An impairment loss is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of 
the investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or 
Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, and is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to 
determine the recoverable amount. 
 
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures and 
recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate or 
joint venture upon loss of significant influence or joint control and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds 
from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.
(iii)
Investment in joint operation
Changes in accounting policy
A joint operation is an arrangement in which the parties with joint control have rights to the assets and obligations for the 
liabilities relating to that arrangement. In respect of its interest in a joint operation, a joint operator must recognise all of 
its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, including its relative share of jointly controlled assets, liabilities, revenue 
and expenses. 
 
(c) 
Atlas has adopted all of the new and revised Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the AASB that are 
relevant to the operations of Atlas and effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2015. The Group 
applied for the first time AASB 2015-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Withdrawal of AASB 1031 
Materiality and AASB 2015-4 Financial Reporting Requirements for Australian Groups with a Foreign Parent. However 
these amendments did not impact the annual consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
 
(d) 
The carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities are often determined based on estimates and assumptions of 
future events. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in 
any future period affected. The key estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period are:
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
Ore reserve and resource estimates 
Ore reserves are estimates of the amount of ore that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s mining 
properties. The Group estimates its ore reserves based on information compiled by appropriately qualified persons 
relating to the geological judgements to interpret the data. The estimation of recoverable reserves is based upon factors
33
ATLAS IRON LIMITED 2016 ANNUAL REPORT
Atlas Iron Limited and its Controlled Entities - Annual Report 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
such as estimates of commodity prices, future capital requirements, production costs and foreign exchange rates along 
with geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and grade of the ore body.
The Group estimates and reports ore reserves under the principles contained within the Australasian Code for 
Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (Revised 2012), known as the JORC Code, which 
is prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 
Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia. Changes in the reserve or resource estimates 
may impact upon the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets, mine properties, property, plant and 
equipment, provision for rehabilitation, and depreciation and amortisation charges.
Units of production depreciation 
Estimated recoverable reserves are used in determining the depreciation and/or amortisation of mine specific assets. 
This results in a depreciation/amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the anticipated remaining life of mine 
production. Each item’s life, which is assessed annually, has regard to both its physical life limitations and to present 
assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the asset is located. These  
calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including the amount of recoverable reserves and estimates 
of future capital expenditure. Refer to Note 1(j) for the accounting policy on production stripping.
Provision for rehabilitation costs 
The Group assesses its mine rehabilitation provision at each reporting date. Significant estimates and assumptions are 
made in determining the provision for mine rehabilitation as there are numerous factors that will affect the ultimate 
liability payable. These factors include estimates of the extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, technological 
changes, regulatory changes, cost increases/decreases and changes in discount rates (2016: 2.55% (2015: 2.55%)). 
Those uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided. The provision 
at balance date represents management’s best estimate of the present value of the future rehabilitation costs required. 
 
Production start date 
The Group assesses the stage of each mine development project to determine when a mine moves into the production 
stage. The criteria used to assess the start date of a mine are determined based on the unique nature of each mine 
development project. The Group considers various relevant criteria to assess when the mine is substantially complete, 
ready for its intended use and moves into the production phase. Some of the criteria include:
• 
• 
•
completion of a reasonable period of testing of the mine plant and equipment; 
ability to process iron ore in saleable form; and 
ability to sustain ongoing mining and processing of iron ore.
When a mine development project moves into the production stage, the capitalisation of certain mine development costs 
ceases and costs are either regarded as inventory or expensed, except for costs related to mining asset additions or 
improvements and mineable reserve development, which are capitalised. It is also at this point that 
depreciation/amortisation commences. 
 
Impairment of assets 
The Group assesses each asset or cash generating unit (CGU) at each reporting period to determine whether any 
indication of impairment exists. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is 
made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use. These assessments 
require the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices (considering current and historical 
prices, price trends and related factors), discount rates, operating costs, future capital requirements, closure and 
rehabilitation costs, exploration potential, reserves and operating performance (which includes production and sales 
volumes). These estimates and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty. Therefore, there is a possibility that 
changes in circumstances will impact these projections, which may impact the recoverable amount of assets and/or 
CGUs. Recoverable amount is determined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Fair value is 
determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between 
knowledgeable and willing parties. Value in use is determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows 
arising from the continued use of the asset. Cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset/CGU. The key 
assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs, including a sensitivity analysis, are 
disclosed and further explained in Note 3.
Deferred taxation 
Deferred income tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Determination of fair values
(e) 
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial 
and non-financial assets and liabilities. When measuring fair value of an asset or liability, the Group uses market 
observable data as far as possible.  
 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when 
pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value 
measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by
34

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use. 
 
Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation 
techniques as follows:
•  Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
•  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly
•  Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability
Business combinations
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability might be categorised in different levels of the fair value 
hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as 
the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.  
 
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during 
which the change has occurred. Refer to Note 29. 
 
(f) 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-
controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the acquirer elects to measure the components of 
non-controlling interest that are present ownership interests that entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the 
entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation either at fair value, or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in business combination expenses. When  
the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the 
acquisition date.  
 
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value as at the acquisition date (being the date the acquirer gains control) 
through profit or loss. 
 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, will be 
recognised in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement either in profit or loss or 
as change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it shall not be 
remeasured. Subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. In instances, where the contingent consideration 
does not fall within the scope of AASB 139, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate AASB. 
 
Goodwill is included in intangible assets and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interest over the fair value of the identifiable net 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the identifiable net assets of 
the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in profit or loss. 
 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the 
Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or 
liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. 
 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the 
Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or 
liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain 
or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative value 
of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Where the Group acquires interests in joint operations in which the activity constitutes a business, the acquisition 
method of accounting is adopted.
Property, plant and equipment
(g) 
Each class of property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less, where applicable, any accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses.
The carrying amount of plant and equipment is reviewed to ensure it is not in excess of the recoverable amount from 
these assets. The recoverable amount is assessed on the basis of the expected net cash flows which will be received
35

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
from the assets employment and subsequent disposal. The expected net cash flows have been discounted to their 
present values in determining recoverable amounts. The cost of plant and equipment constructed within the Group 
includes the cost of materials, direct labour, borrowing costs and an appropriate proportion of fixed and variable 
overheads that are directly attributable to the construction of plant and equipment.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only 
when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item 
can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of comprehensive income 
during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation 
Land is not depreciated but is subject to impairment.
Depreciation of buildings is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to write off the net costs over the expected useful 
life. The depreciation rate for buildings is between 5% and 10% per annum.
Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to write off the net costs of each asset 
over the expected useful life or the estimated life of the associated mine, if shorter. The rates vary between 5% and 
40% per annum.
The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is 
greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in the 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income
Impairment of assets
(h) 
Financial assets 
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is 
impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events that 
occurred after the initial recognition of the asset have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that 
asset and that effect can be estimated reliably.
The Group considers evidence for impairment at the specific asset and collective level of assets with similar risk 
characteristics. An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the 
difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the 
asset’s original interest rate. All impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss.
Non-financial assets 
The carrying amount of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred taxes, are reviewed at 
each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and any intangible assets that have indefinite lives are tested 
annually for impairment. 
 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs 
to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For 
the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash 
inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of assets or groups of assets (cash-
generating unit). 
 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related CGU exceeds its estimated 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of 
CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then 
to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis. 
 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed that carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
 
(i) 
Exploration and evaluation costs on an area of interest are written off in the year they are incurred if there is no 
expectation of commercial viability, apart from acquisition costs, which are carried forward where right of tenure of the 
area of interest is current, and they are expected to be recouped through sale or successful development and 
exploitation of the area of interest, or, where exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not 
reached a stage that permits reasonable assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves. Evaluation 
expenditure on an area of interest, where commercial viability has been established, is capitalised.

Where an area of interest is abandoned, or the Directors decide that it is not commercially viable, any accumulated 
costs in respect of that area are written off in the financial period the decision is made. Each area of interest is also 
reviewed at the end of each accounting period and accumulated costs written off to the extent that they will not be 
recoverable in the future.  
 
Exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to development costs once technical feasibility and commercial 
viability of an area of interest is demonstrable. Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment, and any 
impairment loss is recognised, prior to being reclassified. 
 
The carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation assets is dependent on successful development and commercial 
exploitation, or alternatively sale of the respective area of interest. 
 
Impairment testing of exploration and evaluation assets 
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment if sufficient data exists to determine technical feasibility 
and commercial viability or facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
•
•
Exploration and evaluation assets are tested for impairment when any of the following facts and circumstances exist: 
The term of exploration license in the specific area of interest has expired during the reporting period or will 
expire in the near future, and is not expected to be renewed; 
Substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area are 
not budgeted nor planned; 
Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of 
commercially viable quantities of mineral resources and the decision was made to discontinue such activities 
in the specified area; or 
Sufficient data exist to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the 
carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful 
development or by sale.
•
•
Where a potential impairment is indicated, an assessment is performed for each CGU which is no larger than the area 
of interest. The Group performs impairment testing in accordance with accounting policy Note 1(h).
Development costs
(j) 
Mine and port development 
Development expenditure relates to costs incurred to access a mineral resource. It represents those costs incurred after 
the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting the mineral resource has been demonstrated and an 
identified mineral reserve is being prepared for production (but is not yet in production). 
 
Significant factors considered in determining the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the project are the 
completion of a feasibility study, the existence of sufficient proven and probable reserves to proceed with development 
and approval by the Board of directors to proceed with development of the project. 
 
Development costs include direct and indirect costs associated with mine infrastructure, pre-production development 
costs, development excavation, project execution costs and other subsurface expenditure pertaining to that area of 
interest. Costs related to surface plant and equipment and any associated land and buildings are accounted for as 
property, plant and equipment. The definition of an area of interest is the area serviced by a given mining operations 
centre. 
 
Overburden and other mine waste materials are often removed during the initial development of a mine in order to 
access the mineral deposit. This activity is referred to as development stripping (i.e. overburden and other waste 
removal). The directly attributable costs (inclusive of an allocation of relevant overhead expenditure) are capitalised as 
development costs. Capitalisation of development stripping costs ceases when commercial production commences. 
 
Development costs are carried forward in respect of areas of interest in the development phase until commercial 
production commences. When commercial production commences, carried forward development costs are amortised 
on a units of production basis over the life of economically recoverable reserves of the area of interest. The Group 
assesses future capital costs required to bring existing reserves into production and includes an estimate of these costs 
in the base when calculating amortisation expense. 
 
Development assets are assessed for impairment if an impairment trigger is identified. For the purposes of impairment 
testing, development assets are allocated to CGUs to which the development activity relates.  
 
Production stripping 
Removal of waste material normally continues after commercial production commences and throughout the life of a 
mine. This activity is referred to as production stripping. The costs of production stripping are capitalised. 
 
Where a mine operates several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning, 
production stripping costs are accounted for separately by reference to the ore from each separate pit. If however, the 
pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning, the second and subsequent pits are regarded as extensions 
of the first pit in accounting for stripping costs. The amount of stripping costs deferred is based on the ratio of waste

tonnes mined and ore tonnes mined. Amortisation of the production stripping asset takes place on a unit of production 
based on the identified component of the ore body which is mined. An identifiable component is a specific volume of the 
ore body that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. Significant judgement is required to identify and define 
these components, and also to determine the expected volumes (e.g. tonnes) of waste to be stripped and ore to be 
mined in each of these components. The Group assesses future production stripping costs required to bring existing 
reserves into production and includes an estimate of these costs in the base when calculating amortisation expense.  
 
(k) 
When a mine moves into the care and maintenance stage the costs of maintaining the mine are expensed in the period 
as incurred unless there are future economic benefits for other operating mines.
Care and maintenance
Leases
(l) 
Leases of property, plant and equipment where substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to the ownership of the 
asset, but not the legal ownership, transfer to the Group, are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised 
by recording an asset and a liability at the lower of the amounts equal to the fair value of the leased property, plant and 
equipment or the present value of the minimum lease payments, including any guaranteed residual values. Lease 
payments are allocated between the reduction of the lease liability and the lease interest expense for the period. Leased 
assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Lease payments for operating leases, where substantially all the risks and benefits remain with the lessor, are 
recognised in the profit or loss on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Income tax
(m) 
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred taxes are recognised in profit or loss 
except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other  
comprehensive income. 
 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current 
tax payable also includes any tax liability arising from the declaration of dividends. 
 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for:
•
•
•
temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; 
temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and associates and jointly controlled entities to 
the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and 
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, 
based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.  
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and 
assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax 
entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be 
realised simultaneously. 
 
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are 
reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit 
will be realised. 
 
The Group and its wholly-owned Australian resident entities are part of a tax-consolidated group. As a consequence, all 
members of the tax-consolidated group are taxed as a single entity. The head entity within the tax-consolidated group is 
Atlas Iron Limited. 
 
(n) 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST incurred is 
not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office. In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part of the cost of 
acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the expense. Receivables and payables in the statement of financial 
position are shown inclusive of GST. Cash flows are presented in the cash flow statement on a gross basis, except for 
the GST component of investing and financing activities, which are disclosed as operating cash flows. 
 
(o) 
Employee benefits are expensed in the profit or loss and provisions are made for benefits accumulated as a result of 
employees rendering services up to the reporting date. These benefits include wages and salaries, annual leave, long 
service leave and related on-costs such as superannuation, workers compensation and payroll tax. The Group’s 
superannuation is a defined contribution plan under which fixed contributions are made to a superannuation fund with 
no further legal or constructive obligation to pay.

A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term bonus or profit sharing plans if the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, 
and the obligation can be measured reliably.  
 
Liabilities arising in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave and any other employee benefits expected to be settled 
within twelve months of the reporting date are measured at their nominal amounts based on remuneration rates which 
are expected to be paid when the liability is settled. All other employee benefit liabilities are measured at the present 
value of the estimated future cash outflow to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting 
date. In determining the present value of future cash outflows, the market yield as at the reporting date on corporate 
bonds, which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related liability, are used.
Share-based payments 
The Group provides benefits to employees (including Executive Directors) of the Group in the form of share-based 
payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled 
transactions’). Share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees via the Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(subject to shareholder approval for Executive Directors), the Employee Share Plan and the Salary Sacrifice and 
Matched Share Plan. Information relating to these plans is set out in Note 4. 
 
During previous financial years, key management personnel and selected direct reports were offered performance rights 
and share appreciation rights under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The fair value of the awards granted is measured 
using a combination of a Black-Scholes option pricing model and a Monte Carlo simulation model, taking into account 
the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted. Measurement inputs include share price on 
measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historic volatility 
adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information), weighted average expected life of the instruments 
(based on historical experience and general rights holder behaviour), expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate 
(based on government bonds). Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not 
taken into account in determining fair value. 
 
The cost of the equity-settled option transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date 
on which they are granted. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
 
The cost of equity-settled transaction is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in 
which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled 
to the award (‘vesting date’). 
 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects:
(i) the extent to which the vesting period has expired; and 
(ii) the number of options and rights that, in the opinion of the Directors of the Group, will ultimately vest.
This opinion is formed based on the best available information at balance date. No adjustment is made for the likelihood 
of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included in the determination of fair 
value at grant date. 
 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a 
market condition. Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, no further expense is recognised. However, if a new 
award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the 
cancelled and new award are treated as if they were a modification of the original award. 
 
The Employee Share Plan is administered by the Atlas Iron Employee Share Trust, which is consolidated in accordance 
with the principals in Note 1(b). 
 
Under the Employee Share Plan, shares issued by the Atlas Iron Employee Share Trust vest immediately on grant date. 
On this date, the market value of the shares issued is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding 
increase in equity. 
 
The Salary Sacrifice and Matched Share Plan allow participants to salary sacrifice certain amounts per annum from 
their pre-tax salary. Atlas will match the salary sacrifice shares on a one for one basis, with shares purchased by the 
Atlas Iron Employee Share Trust.  
 
The matched shares do not vest until the participants have completed a specified service condition, management deem 
that services are to be rendered over a three year period. The participants become unconditionally entitled to the shares 
at the end of the three year period. The employees have no beneficial entitlement to the matched shares until they are 
awarded. 
 
Service vesting conditions (which are non-market conditions) and non-market performance conditions are not 
incorporated into the grant date fair value calculation of the Matched Share Plan, instead they are taken into 
consideration when estimating the number of awards that will vest. The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest 
is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the 
actual awards issued. No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.

The cumulative expense recognised for the matched share transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects 
the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the proportion of the awards that are expected to ultimately vest. 
 
Matched shares are subject to good and bad leaver provisions. Matched shares will be forfeited in regards to bad 
leavers. Bad leavers include; participants that cease to be employed by the Group via voluntary resignation, dismissal 
for cause, fraud, criminal offence or purported dealing. Good leavers include participants that cease to be employed by 
the Group by reason of redundancy, death, incapacitation or any other reason determined by the Board. The expense 
recognised for good leavers is accelerated as the shares vest immediately and are no longer subject to the 3 year 
service condition or trading restrictions. 
 
(p) 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. The Group recognises revenue when 
the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and 
specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities. The amount of revenue is not considered to be reliably 
measurable until all material contingencies relating to the sale have been resolved. 
 
Sale of goods 
Revenue from the sale of goods and disposal of other assets is recognised when persuasive evidence, usually in the 
form of an executed sales agreement, or an arrangement exists, indicating there has been a transfer of risks and 
rewards to the customer, no further work or processing is required by the Group, the quantity and quality of the goods 
has been determined with reasonable accuracy, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably 
assured. This is generally when title passes. The majority of the Group’s sales agreements specify that title passes 
when the product is delivered to the destination specified by the customer, which is typically the vessel on which the 
product will be shipped. In practical terms, revenue is generally recognised on the bill of lading date, which is the date 
the commodity is delivered to the shipping agent. These sales agreements also allow for an adjustment to the sales 
price based on a survey of the goods by the customer (an assay for mineral content), therefore recognition of the sales 
revenue is based on the most recently determined estimate of product specifications. Revenue is not reduced for 
royalties and other taxes payable from the Group’s production. 
 
Provisional values are recognised on cargos which are provisionally priced at the date of sale. Adjustments to the sale 
price then occur subsequent to the date of sale based on movements in quoted market prices on which the final price is  
based, with adjustments reflected in sales and trade receivables. The period between provisional invoicing and final 
pricing is typically between 30 and 120 days. The revenue adjustment which is embedded within the provisionally priced 
sale arrangements is measured at fair value and is re-estimated continuously until final pricing is determined. Fair value 
adjustments, estimated by reference to forward market prices, are recognised as an adjustment to revenue.  
 
(q) 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Any transaction costs arising on the issue of ordinary shares are recognised 
directly in equity as a reduction of the share proceeds received. 
 
Repurchase and re-issue of ordinary shares (treasury shares)  
Own equity instruments that are re-acquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost including directly attributable 
incremental costs (net of income taxes) and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of Atlas’ own 
equity instruments. Any difference between the consideration received and the carrying amount, if reissued, is 
recognised in the share-based payments reserve. Shares held by the Atlas Iron Employee Share Trust are disclosed as 
treasury shares and are deducted from contributed equity. 
 
(r) 
Basic earnings per share 
Basic EPS is calculated as the profit/(loss) attributable to equity holders of the Group, excluding any costs of servicing 
equity other than ordinary shares, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the 
financial year, adjusted for any bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the year.  
 
Diluted earnings per share 
Diluted EPS adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic EPS to take into account the after income tax effect 
of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number 
of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares (share 
options granted to employees). 
 
(s) 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of six months or less. 
 
(t) 
The Group records the present value of estimated costs of legal and constructive obligations required to restore 
operating locations in the period in which the obligation is incurred. The nature of these restoration activities includes 
dismantling and removing structures, rehabilitating mines, dismantling operating facilities, closure of plant and waste 
sites and restoration, reclamation and re-vegetation of affected areas. The obligation generally arises when the asset is

installed or the ground/environment is disturbed at the production location. When the liability is initially recognised, the 
present value of the estimated cost is capitalised by increasing the carrying amount of the related mining assets. Over 
time, the discounted liability is increased for the change in present value based on the discount rates that reflect current 
market assessments and the risks specific to the liability. The periodic unwinding of the discount is recognised in the  
statement of comprehensive income as a finance cost. Additional disturbances or changes in rehabilitation costs are 
recognised as additions or charges to the corresponding assets and rehabilitation liability when they occur. 
 
(u) 
Iron ore stockpiles are physically surveyed or estimated and valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Net 
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and 
costs of selling final product. 
 
Cost is determined by the weighted average method and comprises direct purchase costs and an appropriate portion of 
fixed and variable overhead costs, including depreciation and amortisation, incurred in converting materials into finished 
goods. Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Any provision of obsolescence is 
determined by reference to specific items of stock. A regular review is undertaken to determine the extent of any 
provision for obsolescence. 
 
(v) 
Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held-for-sale if it is considered 
highly probable that they will be recovered principally through sale rather than continued use. Such assets, or disposal 
groups, are measured at the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on 
disposal groups is allocated first to goodwill and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro-rata basis, except 
that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets or employee benefits. Impairment losses on 
initial classification as held-for-sale and subsequent gains and losses on re-measurement are recognised in profit or 
loss. Whilst classified as held-for-sale, property, plant and equipment, intangibles and mine development are no longer 
amortised or depreciated, and any equity-accounted investee is no longer equity accounted. 
 
(w) 
Intangible assets acquired by the Group, such as port access rights, software and licences that have a finite life are 
recorded at cost or fair value in business combinations less accumulated amortisation or impairment charges.  
Amortisation is charged over the useful life of the finite asset according to consumption of benefits. 
 
(x) 
Port access prepayments are initially recognised at cost and amortised over the period of the benefits obtained. 
 
(y) 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues 
and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other 
components. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the Board of Directors to make 
decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance, and for which discrete 
financial information is available. 
 
Segment results that are reported to the Board of Directors include items directly attributable to a segment. 
 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, and 
intangible assets other than goodwill. 
 
(z) 
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, dividend income, changes in the fair value of financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in profit or loss. Interest 
income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.  
 
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, changes in the fair 
value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and impairment losses recognised on financial assets. 
 
(aa) 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange 
rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting 
date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on 
monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, 
adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at 
the exchange rate at the end of the year. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are 
measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was 
determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency that are measured in terms of historical cost are translated using 
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in 
profit or loss.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
1. 
 
(bb) 
Non-derivative financial assets 
The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. All other financial 
assets (including assets designated at fair value through profit or loss) are recognised initially on the trade date at which 
the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.  
 
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it 
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that 
is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability. 
 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and 
only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
 
Derivative financial assets 
The Group has the following financial assets: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
A financial asset is classified at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held for trading or is designated as 
such upon initial recognition. Financial assets are designated at fair value through profit or loss if the Group manages 
such investments and makes purchase and sale decisions based on their fair value in accordance with the Group’s 
documented risk management or investment strategy. Attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss 
when incurred. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and changes therein are 
recognised in profit or loss. 
 
Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss comprise equity securities that otherwise would have 
been classified as available for sale and embedded derivatives. 
 
Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated 
as effective hedging instruments. 
 
Derivatives embedded in host contracts are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their 
economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not 
held for trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss. These embedded derivatives are initially measured at 
fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured with changes in fair 
value recognised in profit or loss. Derivatives are recognised as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as 
financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
Such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment losses.  
 
Loans and receivables comprise cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.

The standards and interpretations relevant to Atlas that have not been early adopted are:
Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued but not adopted
AASB 9 Financial Instruments: applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2018.  
 
This standard includes requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets resulting 
from the first part of Phase 1 of the project to replace AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement. An assessment of the Groups financial assets and liabilities was performed to determine 
whether the change in standard would affect the classification and measurement of financial instruments 
currently held. The new standard is not expected to impact the measurement of Atlas’ financial assets 
and liabilities. Additional disclosure requirements will be incorporated on adoption of the standard.
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on 
or after 1 July 2018.  
 
The core principle of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers is that an entity recognises 
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity 
recognises revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps:
(i)  
(ii)  
(iii)
Identify the contract(s) with a customer  
Identify the performance obligations in the contract  
Determine the transaction price

(v)

The Group has completed an assessment of revenue recognition on adoption of this standard and its impact is 
expected to be limited.
(ii)
AASB 2014-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests 
in Joint Operations: applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2016. 
 
AASB 2014-3 amends AASB 11 Joint Arrangements to provide guidance on the accounting for 
acquisitions of interests in joint operations in which the activity constitutes a business. The amendments 
require:
•
•
The acquirer of an interest in a joint operation in which the activity constitutes a business, 
as defined in AASB 3 Business Combinations, to apply all of the principles on business 
combinations accounting in AASB 3 Business Combinations and other Australian 
Accounting Standards except for those principles that conflict with the guidance in AASB 
11 Joint Arrangements; and; 
The acquirer to disclose the information required by AASB 3 Business Combinations and 
other Australian Accounting Standards for business combinations.
Adoption of this amendment will not result in a material impact on the Group financial statements as 
the amendment is consistent with the Group’s current accounting policy.
(iv)   
annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2016.
AASB 2014-4 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation: applicable to
AASB 116 Property Plant and Equipment and AASB 138 Intangible Assets both establish the 
principle for the basis of depreciation and amortisation as being the expected pattern of consumption 
of the future economic benefits of an asset. The IASB has clarified that the use of revenue-based 
methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate because revenue generated by 
an activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of 
the economic benefits embodied in the asset. The amendment also clarified that revenue is 
generally presumed to be an inappropriate basis for measuring the consumption of the economic 
benefits embodied in an intangible asset.
(v)
Adoption of this standard is expected not to materially impact the financial statements of the Group.
AASB 16 Leases: applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2019.
Under AASB 16 Leases there is no longer a distinction between finance and operating leases as 
previously defined in AASB 117 Leases. Lessees will now bring to account a right-to-use asset and 
lease liability onto the statement of financial position for all leases. This means the vast majority of 
operating leases as defined by the current AASB 117 Leases which currently do not impact the 
statement of financial position will be required to be capitalised once AASB 16 is adopted.
From an income statement perspective operating leases are typically expensed on a straight line 
basis under AASB 117 Leases. The new treatment will result in both a depreciation and interest 
charge impacting on the income statement. Depreciation is likely to be on a straight basis however 
interest is higher in the initial years. This will have the effect of front loading expenses in the income 
statement which will reduce over the life of the lease. AASB 16 Lease is effective for reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2019 (early application possible if AASB 15 Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers is also adopted early).
The adoption of this new standard is expected to have a significant impact on all components of the Group 
financial statements. The statement of financial position will be impacted as all lessees will be required to bring 
to account a right-to-use asset and lease liability. From a statement of profit or loss perspective currently all 
operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis under AASB 117 Leases however on applying the new 
standard this will increase depreciation and interest charges. Depreciation will be on a straight basis however 
interest charges will be higher in the initial years of the lease. Additional disclosure requirements will be 
incorporated on adoption of the standard. The impact of this new standard where the Group act as lessor is 
expected to be minimal.
Comparative amounts 
Certain comparative disclosures have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.

The Group assesses whether there are indicators that assets, or groups of assets, may be impaired at each reporting 
date. The following impairment indicators were identified during the year:
IMPAIRMENT LOSS
(773,986)
(889,739)
•
•
Volatile US dollar iron ore price, compounded by the volatile Australian dollar exchange rate during the year 
which impacts the feasibility and returns on mines and projects; and  
The continued gap between the Group’s net asset book value and its market capitalisation.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made. Atlas has made an 
assessment of the recoverable amount of its assets as at 31 December 2015 and 30 June 2016.
Total impairment losses recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income 
for the year were as follows:
Disposal group and assets held for sale
Leasehold improvements
Investment in equity accounted investee (port assets)
Other receivables
Mine and reserve development assets
Property, plant and equipment
Mining tenements capitalised
Intangibles (port assets)

Horizon 1 mining properties 
Atlas’ Horizon 1 mining properties relate to the assets and liabilities contained within its current operating mines 
(including the Corunna Downs development). During the year ended 30 June 2016, Atlas recognised an impairment 
loss for its Horizon 1 mining properties of $13,273,000 (property, plant and equipment of $4,170,000 (2015: $7,003,000) 
and mine and reserve development assets of $9,103,000 (2015: $169,948,000)).
The recoverable amount of the Horizon 1 mining properties was determined using life-of-mine value in use calculations 
based on life-of-mine cash flow projections from Board-approved financial budgets/forecasts and mine plans covering 
the life of the mine based on current reserves. 
 
Key assumptions contained in cash flow projections are based on external sources of information where available, or 
reflect past experience, and include:
•
• 
• 
• 
•
forecast USD iron ore price and foreign exchange rates (based on the most recent external economic 
forecasters); 
published reserve statements;  
operating and capital cost estimates utilising mine plans; 
inflation applied at 2.5% per annum beyond the period covered by Atlas’ most recent forecasts; and 
a nominal post-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections of 11-13.5% (June 2015: 11%).
A key component of the cash flow projections is the revenue assumptions utilised. A summary of the externally sourced 
forecast USD iron ore price and foreign exchange rate assumption ranges (real, based on external economic 
forecasters) utilised in determining the recoverable amount of its Horizon 1 mining properties are detailed below:

Horizon 2 exploration projects 
Atlas’ Horizon 2 exploration projects relate predominantly to the McPhee Creek and South East Pilbara exploration 
projects. During the year ended 30 June 2016, Atlas recognised an impairment loss for its Horizon 2 exploration 
projects of $79,400,000 (mining tenements capitalised of $78,700,000 (2015: $574,286,000) and reserve development 
assets of $700,000 (2015: $32,285,000).  
 
When considering the fair value less cost to sell basis in determining the recoverable amount of the McPhee Creek 
project the Company has regard to implied valuations per reserve and resource tonnes of comparable projects and 
project cashflows. The group of comparable projects is included in the comparative group where they hold hematite iron 
ore projects at a similar stage and size within the Pilbara to the Group’s. The implied valuations per reserve and 
resource tonne valuations have been calculated using publicly available information and the share price of the relevant 
company at the point of testing. This is considered to be a level three valuation technique within the fair value hierarchy. 
In addition the recoverable amount of the McPhee Creek exploration project area considers the life-of-mine value in use 
calculations using cash flow projections from financial budgets and indicative mine plans covering the life-of-mine. The

nominal post-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections was 15%. No impairment loss has been recognised on 
the McPhee Creek project for the year ended 30 June 2016.  
 
The recoverable amount of the undeveloped South East Pilbara exploration project has been determined based on the 
implied valuations per reserve and resource tonnes of comparable projects, consistent with the methodology described 
above. An impairment loss of $70,500,000 has been recognised on the South East Pilbara exploration project. 
 
Non-core tenements 
An impairment loss of $8,900,000 has been recognised in relation to non-core tenements, which do not contain 
sufficient resources for the Company to pursue and have been, or are, in the process of being disposed of or 
surrendered.

Employee and contractors option plan 
The Group has historically provided benefits to its employees (including Directors) and contractors in the form of share-
based payment transactions, whereby options to acquire ordinary shares were issued as an incentive to improve 
employee and shareholder goal congruence. All options granted during the year had a nil exercise price. The options 
granted to employees have an expiry date of 13 November 2020, and vested on 6 May 2016.  
 
The fair value of the services received in return for the zero priced employee options granted was fair valued using the 
closing share price on the date of employee acceptance of the employee share options. See below for a summary of the 
key terms of the employee share option plan and fair value assumptions. This is considered to be a level one valuation 
technique within the fair value hierarchy. To remain entitled to the employee share options all Atlas employees had to 
remain in employment until date of vest.

Unvested unlisted performance and share appreciation rights under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
No performance rights or share appreciation rights were granted during the year ended 30 June 2016. 
 
During a previous reporting period, on 2 December 2013, Key Management Personnel (KMP) and selected direct 
reports were granted performance rights and share appreciation rights. In 2014, the Board approved the removal of the  
internal Iron Ore Shipping (IOS) target and replaced it with an Earnings Per Share (EPS) target. Both rights are subject 
to a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) hurdle as well as EPS target, with equal weightings for each hurdle.
No performance rights or share appreciation rights will vest until after an employee receives a vesting notification from 
the Board, advising them in writing the number of Long-Term Incentive (LTI) awards that have vested and the manner in 
which the awards will be settled, that is, cash or shares. Performance rights and share appreciation rights not vested on 
the vesting date (30 June 2016 for LTIP granted on 2 December 2013) will automatically lapse and be forfeited in 
accordance with the LTIP rules. LTI awards that vest to any Executive Director cannot be settled in equity without prior 
shareholder approval.

Secured Debt Facility 
On 10 December 2012, Atlas entered into a Term Loan B facility of US$275,000,000 which was fully drawn. The term of 
the facility was 5 years with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 7.50% (LIBOR floor of 1.25%). The facility was secured over 
all assets of Atlas and each material subsidiary subject to agreed exceptions and in some certain circumstances, to 
obtaining third party consents. The facility had no earnings or net asset based maintenance covenants, but had an 
asset coverage covenant of 2:1 (Total Assets to Total Liabilities). 
 
On 6 May 2016, Atlas completed a creditors' scheme of arrangement which implemented a restructure of the Term 
Loan B facility. The principal amount owing on the Loan was reduced to US$135,000,000 from US$267,000,000. For 
this reduction in the Loan, Atlas paid down US$10M and on completion issued to the Lenders 6,229,503,087 fully paid 
ordinary shared and 4,513,986,260 Options exercisable at $0.075. The term of the facility is 5 years (maturing April 
2021) with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.33% (LIBOR floor of 1.25%) paid monthly plus Paid in Kind interest 
(capitalised monthly) of 3.00%. Atlas is required to maintain a minimum AU$35,000,000 in cash at the end of each 
month. A 100% cash sweep pay down has been introduced for any cash in excess of AU$80,000,000 at the end of each 
quarter. Atlas is in compliance with all covenant requirements as at 30 June 2016. The facility continues to be repaid at 
1% per annum and then the remainder paid out on maturity. The facility remains secured over all assets of Atlas and 
each material subsidiary subject to agreed exceptions and in some certain circumstances, to obtaining third party 
consent. 
 
The Company established a fair value of the shares and options issued of AU$133,627,000. The fair value of the shares 
was measured using the Atlas share price on the date of the completed restructure (6 May 2016: $0.02). This is 
considered to be level one on valuation technique within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the options issued 
was measured using a Black-Scholes model, with the following inputs:
Assumptions
Options granted
Expiry Date
Test date
Exercise price
Share price at grant date
Remaining life
Risk free rate

As required by accounting standards under IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments a gain of 
$5,482,000 was recognised in the income statement as the differences between the carrying value of the borrowings 
converted and the fair value of the equity issued. Establishment fees paid in relation to the facility have been fully 
amortised as part of the gain on restructure of the Term Loan B.  
 
On 10 December 2012, Atlas also put in place an AU$50,000,000 three-year revolving facility. This facility expired on 9 
December 2015 undrawn.

Rehabilitation provision 
When developing its mines, the Group makes provision for the future cost of rehabilitating mine sites on a discounted 
basis. This provision represents the present value of rehabilitation costs relating to the mine sites, which are expected to 
be incurred through the life of mine. These provisions have been determined in conjunction with the work undertaken by 
external consultants. Assumptions based on the current economic environment have been made in determining current 
rehabilitation provisions, which management believes are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability. 
These estimates are reviewed at each reporting date to take into account any material changes to the assumptions. 
However, actual rehabilitation costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning 
works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of rehabilitation is likely 
to depend on when the mines cease to produce at economically viable rates. This in turn will depend upon future iron 
ore prices, which are inherently uncertain. 
 
Onerous lease 
In 2012, the Group entered into a non-cancellable lease for office space which will expire in 2024. Due to changes in 
requirements, a portion of the office space is sublet to a third party for part of the remaining lease term but changes in 
market conditions have meant that the rental income will be lower than the rental expense. In addition, a portion of the 
remaining office space is surplus to current requirements and the Group is actively looking to sublet this space. The 
obligation for the discounted future payments, net of expected rental income, has been provided for by the Group.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES
Centaurus Metals Limited 
During the period, Centaurus Metals Limited (CTM) issued shares, diluting the Group’s interest from 20.48% to 9.14%. 
As the Group was deemed to have lost significant influence, Atlas ceased equity accounting for CTM as an associate 
and commenced accounting for the retained interest at fair value through profit or loss.  
 
28. 
 
Segment products and locations 
The Group operates in the mineral exploration and extraction industry in Australia. For management purposes, the 
Group is organised into one main operating segment which involves the exploration and extraction of minerals in 
Australia. All of the Group’s activities are interrelated and discrete financial information is reported to the Board of 
Directors (Chief Operating Decision Maker) as a single segment. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are 
based upon analysis of the Group as one segment. The financial results from this segment are equivalent to the 
financial statements of the Group as a whole. 
 
29. 
 
Financial risk management 
The Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. These risks arise in the normal course of 
business and are managed in accordance with the Group’s Financial Risk Management Policy. The Board of Directors 
has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management framework and has delegated the 
authority for monitoring risk management policies to the Audit and Risk Committee. 
 
The Group’s Treasury function reports to the Board and Audit and Risk Committee and provides assurance that the 
Group’s financial activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, 
measured and managed in accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives. It is the Group’s policy that no 
trading in derivatives for speculative purposes shall be undertaken, however derivative positions may be utilised to 
manage the Group’s financial risks. The Group’s Financial Risk Management Policy does not allow the Group to enter 
into any sold option positions. 
 
Fair value hierarchy 
The following table shows the fair value of financial assets including their levels in the fair value hierarchy. The Group 
has not disclosed the fair values for financial instruments such as short-term trade receivables, payables and interest 
bearing loans, because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair values.

or indirectly (derived from prices).
Financial risks 
The Group is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk (including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and 
commodity price risk) and operational risk. 
 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and receivables from customers. 
 
To manage credit risk, the Group maintains policies governing credit approvals and investment counterparties.  
 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the characteristics of its customers. The majority of the Group’s 
sales revenue arises from customers based in China and the Group has mitigated the risk of financial loss by 
undertaking trade finance through letters of credit.

The Group’s policies limit its exposure to credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents by investing and transacting 
with banks that hold minimum investment credit ratings of A-1, where exposure to an individual counterparty with this 
rating is limited to 20% of the total portfolio. Where an investment credit rating is above A-1, exposure is limited to 33% 
of the total portfolio. The Company is currently in compliance with these limits. Certain different limits apply with respect 
to potential counterparties for commodity hedging transactions. Refer to commodity price risk below. 
 
Exposure to credit risk 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying amount of the Group’s financial assets:

   impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables past due. 
 
No impairment losses have been recognised during the year as a result of credit risk. 
 
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s liquidity risk arises from the possibility that it will not be able to meet financial obligations as they fall due. 
The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows to ensure that it maintains 
sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions. The Group prepares detailed 
financial models as part of its budget planning and forecasting processes, which are used to predict liquidity needs to 
support the Group’s funding requirements.

Market risk 
Market  risk  is  the  risk  that  changes  in  market  prices,  including  foreign  exchange  rates,  commodity  price  and  interest 
rates  will  affect  the  Group’s  income  or  the  value  of  its  holdings  of  financial  instruments.  The  Group  is  exposed  to 
fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign currency and interest rates.  
 
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters 
while optimising return. 
 
To date, the Group has not adopted hedge accounting. 
 
Commodity price risk 
Commodity price risk arises from fluctuations in market prices of iron ore. As part of the contractor collaboration 
arrangements, Atlas has sought to establish strategies that mitigate its exposure to iron ore price volatility in the short-
term. The strategy of ultilising fixed priced sales contracts, cap/collar positions and option positions is aimed at providing
64

some protection against decreases in the US dollar iron ore price while maintaining some exposure to pricing upside. At 
30 June 2016, the Group had approximately 1.5 million WMT subject to these contracts and positions at a range of 
US$40 to US$61 62% Fe price CFR/DMT China. 
 
The Group has entered into provisionally priced commodity sales contracts. These are provisionally priced sales 
volumes for which price finalisation is referenced to the relevant index at a future date. Provisional pricing mechanisms 
embedded within these sales arrangements have the character of a commodity derivative and are carried at fair value.  
 
The Group’s exposure at 30 June 2016 to the impact of movements in commodity prices upon provisionally invoiced 
sales volumes is set out in the following table. 
 
Impact on profit or loss before tax of a 10% increase in market price
2015
2016
$’000

-
(1,179)
Iron Ore 
 
The sensitivities in the above tables have been determined as the absolute impact on fair value of a 10% increase in 
commodity prices at each reporting date, while holding all other variables, including foreign currency and exchange 
rates, constant. 
 
The relationship between commodity prices and exchange rates is complex and movements in exchange rates can 
impact commodity prices. The sensitivities should therefore be used with care. 
 
The Group's policies allow iron ore commodity risk trades (e.g. swaps) with counterparties of credit ratings A – (A 
minus) which is lower than for foreign exchange trades and short term investments, recognising the nature of the 
counterparties which regularly participate in the iron ore swap markets. 
 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases which are denominated in currencies other than

Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on borrowing and investments from the possibility that changes in interest 
rates will affect future cash flows. The Group does not manage its exposure to movements in market interest rates. The 
Group adopts a policy of ensuring that as far as possible, it maintains excess cash and cash equivalents in short-term 
deposits at interest rates with maturities not exceeding 90 days.

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments 
A change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit 
or (loss) by the amounts shown below. This analysis does not reflect any change in profit or (loss) in relation to the 
variable Term loan B, as even if the reasonably possible increase in interest rates occurs the interest rate floor on the 
Term loan B will not be exceeded. This analysis assumes that all other variables, including foreign exchange rates, 
remain constant.

The carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities approximately reflect their fair values. 
 
Capital management 
The Board’s policy is to maintain a suitable capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence 
whilst sustaining future development of the business. Capital consists of share capital plus retained loss. The Board 
monitors both retained earnings/(loss) in addition to the Group’s underlying earnings. Underlying earnings adjust 
retained earnings/(loss) for acquisition related costs and material non-cash, non-recurring adjustments such as asset 
impairment.  
 
The Group’s Term Loan B facility formerly had a total asset secured debt covenant (‘asset debt covenant’) of 2:1, which 
was formally measured every six months. Under the new agreement this has been replaced with a minimum monthly 
cash requirement of AU$35,000,000 among other requirements. At 30 June 2016 the Group is in compliance with all 
requirements. A breach of the covenant would result in the Term Loan B facility becoming immediately payable. 
 
The Group does not purchase its own shares, except where purchased under an employee share. The Group’s Term 
Loan B facility includes some restrictions on capital management that are standard for the Term Loan B market.  
 
There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
