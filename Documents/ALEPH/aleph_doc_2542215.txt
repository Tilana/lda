regulatory approvals (including OGC approvals) and all competitor lease access and data acquisition approvals. Contractor will
provide, at Company’s cost, reasonable assistance to Company in undertaking such permitting duties, if requested by Company
Worksite Representative.
6.2
Environmental issues: Are of paramount concern and should be mitigated, as regulators may require, to the full extent possible by
Contractor in consultation with Company. Please see the map showing Wildlife Timing included in Exhibit “B-1”: Project
Parameters. Operations are expected to take place during the calving window for ungulates, which follows the larger stream and
river corridor riparian areas. Contractor will be required to show operational flexibility during this time and to move or delay
operations as required. Company’s expectations regarding Wildlife are set out in Section 8 below.
If Services take place within the migratory bird nesting window and mitigation measures will need to be taken to minimize incidental
removal of birds, bird nests or eggs, Company will bear all costs related to these mitigation measures.
6.3
Line Clearing: Whereever line clearing is required it is Company's wish to carry out the project while damaging the least amount of
timber possible. Company envisions cutting only meandering paths through forests, leaving marketable timber untouched. This will
have an effect on how line clearing, survey and energy sourcing operations take place. This must be included in the Project
Management Plan (Exhibit
25 of 156
“B-2”: Project Management Plan). Receiver lines need to be cleared for safe travel by the recording crew and in the event a stretcher
is needed. It is expected that Contractor will designate an Advance Man whose responsibility will be line clearing for both source lines
and receiver lines. Contractor has included information on the estimated amount of hand cutting and First Nation employment in the
Description of Labour Force (Exhibit “B-4”: Contractor Personnel).
6.4
Survey: GPS survey is preferable, however Company will evaluate all methods of survey recommended by Contractor, including
conventional “total station” survey, Inertial Navigation (INS), or “under canopy GPS” with LiDAR or any combination of GPS, LiDAR
and INS. See Company’s survey guidelines in Exhibit “B-6”: Survey Guidelines.
6.5
Energy Sources- Vibroseis-Dynamite: – The project requires the use of dynamite as a source. To this end, the appropriate
explosives handling and storage permits must be obtained by Contractor as necessary to facilitate an efficient drilling and blasting
operation. If possible, Company would like Contractor to use Vibroseis as a source in any areas that are appropriate. Contractor is
asked to assess the terrain for Vibrator access and include any Vibroseis in the Project Management Plan (Exhibit “B-2”: Project
Management Plan).
6.6Drilling: It is anticipated that low impact track drills and heli-drilling will be utilized. Contractor must provide a detailed estimate of the
number of points for each type of drilling in the Project Management Plan (Exhibit “B-2”: Project Management Plan).
6.7Shotholes: Contractor shall have a plan to tamp and plug the shotholes to prevent “blowouts” and secure all shotpoints in order to
protect them from tampering or vandalism which includes the use of electronic detonators.
6.8
Preloading shotholes: Company is aware of BC regulations regarding explosives left in the ground longer than 30 days. Contractor
must provide a detailed operational and security plan that will illustrate how Contractor will deal with this issue through the OGC,
minimize the risk to the public and prevent vandalism that may result in lost or damaged explosives charges. Electronic detonators
are required.
6.9
Recording: A recording plan will be submitted to Company which illustrates the projected plan of layout/sources acquired/pickup for
the duration of the project. Contractor will adhere to Company‘s recording guidelines (Exhibit “B-7”: Company Recording
Guidelines).
6.10
Operational Plan: An operational and security plan shall be instituted by Contractor in order to minimize the risk to the public and
prevent vandalism that may result in lost, stolen, or damaged equipment and/or explosives charges, and it shall be included in the
the Project Management Plan (Exhibit “B-2”: Project Management Plan).
6.11Security: Security at the explosives magazine and on line after the shot holes have been pre-loaded and when sleeping charges
are present will be the responsibility of Contractor.
6.12Lost or Stolen Equipment: Will be the responsibility of Contractor.
6.13Backup Equipment: Contractor shall have backup equipment available at short notice to replace any equipment that cannot be
repaired. Company will not pay standby charges for lost time due to insufficient or inoperable backup equipment.

7LOCAL LABOUR AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS
7.1Company has identified community relations as one of the most important factors which can contribute to a successful operation.
Initial negotiations and permitting may be undertaken by Company advisors and consultants.
7.2During all operations Contractor will maintain a field office which will also serve as a meeting place for crews and landowners.
Information updates will also be posted allowing landowners to keep informed about crew activities.
7.3Company’s expectations for the management of relations with the community are set out in Exhibit “D-7”: Local Benefits and
Stakeholder Relations Requirements.
8WILDLIFE
Company is committed to minimizing disturbance to wildlife and wildlife habitat, and complying with all applicable regulations. Potential
adverse impacts to wildlife species of management concern, including species at risk will be mitigated to the extent possible by
Contractor in consultation with Company. Specific wildlife issues that must be managed for the project are outlined below:
8.1Ungulate Calving Areas
Undefined calving areas have been identified along rivers and riparian corridors in the project area by a professional biologist. (See
Wildlife Timing Map included in Exhibit “B-1”: Project Parameters.) To minimize potential disturbance to females and their calves,
program activities will be mitigated and monitored, to the extent possible, during the peak ungulate calving period from May 21 – June 8.
Company will contract a qualified environmental professional to be onsite during the calving period to monitor activity in these areas.
Operations in calving areas will be directed on the advice of the qualified environmental professional and specific mitigation will be
implemented to meet the following objectives: avoid flights over calving areas; minimize impact of helicopter noise and presence in
proximity to calving areas; and avoid areas where cow/calf pairs are observed.
Operations are expected to take place during the calving window for ungulates. Contractor will be required to show operational
flexibility during this time and to move or delay operations as required by Company.
8.2Migratory Birds
Company has an Incidental Take & Migratory Bird Active Nest Surveys Practice to mitigate potential risks  associated with the
incidental take of active migratory bird nests and the disturbance to bird nests, young or eggs. The highest risk of incidental take2 occurs
when there is clearing of vegetation scheduled to occur within the migratory bird active nesting window, from May 1 – July 313.
Operations are expected to take place during the migratory bird active nesting window and Company will seek the advice of a qualified
environmental professional to design and conduct migratory bird nest surveys/sweeps where required to demonstrate due diligence in
protecting species that receive protection under the British Columbia Wildlife Act, the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the Species at
Risk Act. Species at risk within the project area include: Connecticut Warbler, Cape May Warbler, Canada Warbler, Bay-breasted
Warbler and Black- throated Green Warbler.
2 Incidental Take: the destruction of migratory birds, their nests or eggs due to a human activity in which the objective was not
destruction (CWS 2008). A common example is vegetation clearing or timber harvesting in which the purpose is not to kill migratory
birds, but it happens incidentally when unidentified active nests are destroyed by the removal of vegetation in which nests are
contained.
3 Company’s migratory bird timing window for the BC Peace Region.
27 of 156
Qualified environmental professionals will be retained by Company to conduct an active bird nest survey. An active nest survey is a
search for nests by walking through the entire area to be cleared, and includes examining shrubs, trees and ground for nests, and
listening for the presence of song birds in an area. The active nest survey will be conducted a maximum of 7 days prior to the start of
clearing, and is valid for 7 days following the completion of the survey. Efforts will be made to prioritize areas and coordinate active nest
surveys according to the program schedule. Efforts will also be made to allocate additional survey crews at key times as and when
required.
Active nests that are located will be recorded (UTM), and an appropriate buffer will be established such that clearing can occur up to the
buffer boundary without disturbing the nest. The buffer radius will be determined by the qualified environmental professional and will be
clearly marked in the field and communicated to project personnel. The buffer radius is determined based on the bird species and site
specific features; 30m is a typical song bird nest buffer radius however, potential buffer zones (radius) could range from 10m to 100m.
Active nests shall be confirmed inactive by the qualified environmental professional prior to clearing even if clearing is scheduled to
occur outside of the active nesting window. Removal of the tree/nest after the nesting season may not be appropriate for species where
the loss of the nest(s) could have negative impact on future nesting success. For example, ospreys re-use their stick nests among
seasons. Stick nests are protected under the BC Wildlife Act regardless of their current use.
Stick nests will be located (in mid to late March) using an aerial survey method. This survey will also be conducted by the qualified
environmental professional. If mitigation is required due to a stick nest’s proximity on or near a planned seismic line, the qualified
environmental professional will provide recommendations for the mitigation depending on the species, use of the nest and site-specific
factors. The OGC requires a 100m minimum setback around stick nests. Various best management practices for raptors suggest
setbacks ranging from 50m to 200m and in certain cases suggest additional buffers. The appropriate setback and mitigation technique
for stick nests is species and site-dependent and will be based on recognized practices.
If operations take place during the migratory bird active nesting window (May 1 – July 31), Contractor will be required to incorporate the
work of the qualified environmental professionals, and any additional Company requirements, into the Project Management Plan
(Exhibit “B-2”: Project Management Plan”) and show operational flexibility during this time and to move or delay operations as
required. Contractor’s field project manager will be required to liaise with the lead qualified environmental professional in order to
coordinate field operations. Contractor will be required to provide a detailed ERP and will be responsible for providing appropriate
medical response during the active nest survey. Company expects Contractor to be flexible on logistics and scheduling operations to
ensure that potential delays related to bird surveys do not incur additional overall cost. No lines may be cut or shot without first being
surveyed and cleared for operations by the qualified environmental professional.
8.3Wildlife Awareness & Wildlife Sighting Cards
Company will provide a Wildlife Awareness Training Sessions to inform all project personnel about sensitive wildlife and wildlife habitat
in the project area. Mitigation plans for migratory birds, stick nests, species at risk and calving areas will also be conveyed during this
session. It is expected that all project personnel will participate in this session (1-1.5 hrs).
Wildlife sighting cards will be provided for project personnel to proactively report wildlife sightings and wildlife habitat features
encountered (i.e. nests, dens) during the work. This information will also be helpful for Company in planning future oil and gas
operations in the project area.
9POTENTIAL CHANGE TO PROJECT TIMELINE
Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, Contractor acknowledges that, as of the commencement date of this Scope of Work,
Company continues to evaluate its obligations under Applicable Laws relating to migratory birds and, as such, may determine, in its
sole discretion, that the project timeline should be changed so that field operations do not commence until after the migratory bird
nesting window (May 1 – July 31).
28 of 156
If Company makes such determination and provides Contractor with written notice thereof, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith, for at
least thirty (30) days following Contractor’s receipt of Company’s notice, to execute such amendments to this Scope of Work (including
the Exhibits attached hereto) and to the Schedule “C” and “D” subparts relating hereto, as are necessary or desirable to provide for field
operations to commence in August 2013.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
SA Exploration
Project Management Plan
SAExploration has been created to provide a unique service to energy companies that demand the most effective acquisition of seismic
data. SAE is committed to meeting specific client requirements and ensuring continuous customer satisfaction. We operate to the
highest standards in safety, efficiency and quality while respecting the environment and the communities in which we operate.
PERSONNEL
Our strength is in our people: Our team consist of the most experienced, knowledgeable and qualified people in the industry. We have
an energy and vision that is unsurpassed. The table below highlights our Canadian based Senior Field staff that would manage and
support the Cypress 3D. In addition to the individuals shown we have the ability to draw on additional Canadian based staff or if needed
internationally based Canadian experienced personnel.
Project Managers, Recording Crew Managers and Senior Observers have valid SFOS tickets; our in house SFOS trainer is available to
Talisman Energy Personnel if requested.

Exhibit "B-2"Page 1 of 13
KEY CONSIDERATIONS
SAExploration believes that the best way to ensure a positive outcome on complex projects is through proper planning. It is our
experience that collaborating with our clients on the detailed project management plan greatly enhances the likelihood of a successful
project. Our view of a successful project is a project that is on time, on budget with zero incidents. The obvious variables that can affect
the AFE are weather and ground conditions.
It is our understanding that SAExploration would be considered the Prime Contractor onsite, appropriate discussions would be required
to ensure that a clear understanding of what the role entails combined with clear roles and responsibilities of all parties.
Prior to starting operations a detailed Project Risk Assessment would be completed with appropriate mitigation for high risk activities.
SAExploration utilizes a Green, Yellow and Red grading system for managing subcontractors. Our preference is to always utilize green
contractors. In the event that yellow or red contractors are required, we would work with our client and the contractor to ensure that the
appropriate level of management and mitigation is in place to ensure successful operations.
Wildlife timing considerations, work planning and helicopter flight restrictions would be followed as per the Government approval, onsite
Biologists and Community Monitors. All activity would be required to be coordinated through the Project Manager. Subsequent reporting
would go to the Survey Mapper to ensure proper communication with all phases of the operation (Line Clearing, Survey, Drilling,
Acquisition and all helicopter operations). If specific flight plans are required a Kodiak Navigation unit will be utilized to ensure specific
flight routes are maintained (especially for Migrating birds).
The final key consideration is that our PMP is a proposal only and should essentially be considered a draft document as we believe that
as the primary stakeholder Talisman Energy should be involved in the finalizing of the plan.
Although SAExploration has gotten informal rates from the local community it is our belief that we could not get formal bids as First
Nation consultation and Line Clearing work for the local community typically go hand in hand.
Careful consideration should be given to Helicopter management for Front End Operations (Line Clearing). SAE recommends that Line
Clearing and Survey operation helicopter support is managed by us with costs being paid by Talisman. It would be necessary to receive
revised bids from contractors if Talisman agrees with this philosophy. Adopting this philosophy ensures that Community Environmental
Monitors have unrestricted access to field operations in addition to HSE Advisors and Drill Pushes.
All operations would commence in the South end of the project. This will allow time to evaluate conditions on the Northern portion of the
project to determine if 100% of the project should be acquired in 2013.
Exhibit "B-2"Page 2 of 13
SAExploration recommends a local Bear Guard be utilized as the area is known to have a significant bear population.

PREPLANNING MEETINGS
SAExploration preplanning would involve Talisman, successful subcontractors, and our Operations Group.
Preplan meetings are intended to cover everything from roles and responsibilities to Emergency response.
EMPLOYMENT PLAN
SAExploration is first and foremost an equal opportunity employer. Although a large portion of our workforce is labor we have an
obligation to try and field an experienced properly trained crew. As a result of this and the seasonality of our work we try and re-hire as
many of our past employee’s or seismic experienced personnel as possible. When we move into different operating area’s we are open
to provide employment opportunities to qualified people. Our expectation is to try and hire long term people and not just area specific
local people. We need our field staff to be mobile and move with the crew.
Our pre-employment requirements are as follows:
Resume and Interview
Drug Test
Physical demands analysis
Minimum 18 yrs. of age.
Social Insurance Number
If all these requirements are met and the person accepts an offer of employment they are required to complete our in-house SAET Level
1 training before being deployed to a field crew. This SAET Level 1 training consists of the following:

OPERATIONS
Talisman’s project will be recorded using conventional heli-assist and heli-portable operations. SAExploration has included various
options based on Client preferences. Operations are configured to operate 13 hour shifts during daylight hours only.
Prior to commencing work all personnel will be required to have an initial site orientation, ticket verification and equipment inspection (if
applicable). Equipment inspection will include verification of radios and the appropriate frequencies for traveling on resource roads.
The CAGC Heli - Assist / Heliportable Operations Best Practice is the foundation to our Heli-portable operations.
HSE
HSE is integral to every SAExploration project. Our Project Managers, Recording Crew Managers and Field HSE personnel have
extensive experience with managing significant Heliportable mountain projects.
A project risk assessment and mitigation plan will be created prior to project start-up in conjunction with Talisman during the
preplanning phase.
Hazard maps are considered to be “living” and change daily based on crew reporting. Hazards are reported to the mapping department
through Hazard 10 cards daily. Our HSE staff verify and validate significant hazards while in the field.
At SAExploration, we consider the safety and well-being of our personnel to be of the utmost importance. We continue to work diligently
on implementing fresh ideas towards the improvement of our Health and Safety Programs so that we may provide a work environment
that is safe. We rely on our personnel to assist with creating these new ideas, while also continuing to train, mentor, and develop our
personnel to be the best.
SAExploration continues to strive for excellence and in doing so we have enhanced our initiatives within our Canadian Operations.
- Improved pre-employment physical testing for new workers.
-Pre-employment substance abuse testing and introduction of breath alcohol units on all crews to ensure fit to work initiatives.
Exhibit "B-2"Page 5 of 13
An improved, two phased approach to new worker training and competency verification complete with the new Enform General Safety
Orientation training which replaces IRP 16. (Reg #: GS0-0014-2012). At the time of our bid submission SAExploration is the only
-
CAGC member that have completed the Enform GSO approval process and are 1 of 38 companies Enform has approved overall (at the
time of bid submission).
-Full time, experienced, and competent Health and Safety Field Advisors on our sites
-
-
- Driver monitoring systems for vehicles, snowmobiles and UTV’s
- Behavior / Task Observation Program
- Kodiak Navigation system or equivalent will be utilized for flight watch.
Injury Management Program
Improved driver training and assessment
A safety meeting will be conducted each morning, prior to the start of operations. Copies of the job plan for that day, updated
hazard/access maps, safety reporting forms (Near-miss and Hazard cards), and assigned daily crew activity will be reviewed at this
time. The previous day’s results and a discussion of the hazards expected that day are reviewed before the crew departs for the field.
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
All SAExploration personnel and all contractors working on these programs will be required to have the following basic PPE based on
initial project risk assessment:
Approved footwear (ankle support, aggressive tread)
Approved Hard Hats
Eye Protection
Long Sleeves
Covered legs
Gloves
Appropriate outer-ware for weather conditions
Approved Fall Protection when working above 1.8m
Other PPE may be required depending on job specific hazards that could be identified once field operation commence.
Front End Operations
Sub-Contractor selection would be completed in conjunction with Talisman.
SAExploration utilizes a Red, Yellow and Green contractor rating system. Based on contractor grading’s, additional mitigation is put in
place to ensure a successful project. All contractors must be approved in our system before commencing work. In addition to our
stoplight program our contractors are also rated under the OGP mode 1, 2 and 3 contractor management system.
All personnel including any contractor onsite would be required to have both the SAE and Client site orientation prior to commencing
work. Visitors will have a site orientation and be accompanied by a site representative.
Exhibit "B-2"Page 6 of 13
Transportation
Primary transportation for getting to and from the field will be supplied by our subcontractors. All vehicles will require driver monitoring
and tracking devices while on the project. A bus may be supplied for chain saw operators based on road conditions and the overall
project risk assessment.
For field operations a combination of light trucks, UTV’s (no A TV’s) and helicopter support will be required. SAExploration can supply
Hagglund’s for emergency response and personnel support in the field if required in areas of limited vehicle access.
By working closely with Great Slave Helicopters (our preferred service provider) we have included Heliportable options that do not
utilize performance class 1 or 2 aircraft. This is based on Great Slave’s interpretation of Talisman documents. Performance class 1 or 2
aircraft are available for personnel movement at an additional cost. A more thorough summary is available on request however here is a
short summary of the mitigation that we have in place for helicopter operations.
A portion of the terrain that is encompassed by the Cypress 3D could be considered “hostile”, is the narrow definition of not having a
safe landing area under the helicopter at all times was utilized. In order to reduce the risk of requiring a forced landing in a single engine
helicopter the following mitigating steps will be taken:
1. No components that are critical for flight (engine, transmission, etc) will be on extension.
2. No inspections that involve the drive train of the aircraft will be on extension.
3. A Spectrometric Oil Analysis Program (SOAP) will be in place for the engine oil.
4.
An engine recording device that counts it’s Start and Gas Producer cycles, as well as all exceedances, will be installed on the
aircraft(s).
5. A program to review all recorded engine information will be in place.
6. All engine chips will be sent for laboratory or manufacturer review within 20 flight hours of discovery.
7. All post maintenance ground runs will be twice the OEM requirement.
8.
All Flight Data (in 3 axes plus audio and video from the cockpit) will be recorded and reviewed in near real time (daily), with pilot
involvement in any discussion of flight events.
9. All flight crew will undergo mission specific training (LOFT) based on the project required tasks.
10.An engine failure focused Safety Management System (SMS) is in place and will be referred to at all times during operations.
Line Clearing
It is our recommendation that due to the dangerous nature of tree falling operations a zero line width methodology is used rather than
cutting lines 1.5 meters wide. If Talisman Energy agrees to this methodology a HETS crew would be required onsite for the duration of
the program. It is our experience that a portion of these costs can be covered by having timber damage assessments waived due to the
line width reduction. Although not widely used in British Columbia the de-limb and dangerous tree control methodology has been
successfully employed on numerous sites in this region with great success. In addition to the reduced risk associated with falling trees
there is a cost benefit due to improved crew productivity.
Exhibit "B-2"Page 7 of 13
QST’s and crew foreman are considered a critical component on managing the risk associated with chain saw operations. Depending
on the final outcome of the bid and consultation process additional management (QST / Foreman) may be required. IRP #11 for
Dangerous Tree Control will be adhered to.
Mulching operations will utilize a meandering technique as described in the CAGC mulching best practice.
During the preplanning phase a better understanding of ground conditions will determine creek crossing locations and preparation.
Every effort will be made to reduce downtime hourly charges for the mulchers.
SAExploration verifies that all site workers have been deemed competent by their perspective employers. In addition to the competency
sign off by the employer our on-site HSE representative will also be assigned to front end operations and is responsible for operational
safety, compliance with procedures and personnel training issues.
BC’s Resource Road protocols will be utilized by everyone on site.
Note: Based on the BC data there are three burn areas that could have an impact on cutting operations. Two burn areas are from 1985
and 1986. The most significant burn area is 396 Hectares and burned in May of 1985 and the second area is 134 Hectares and was
August of 1986.
Survey operations will take place only after detailed operational planning session in conjunction with but not limited to the completion of
the HSE planning. Some of the items to be addressed would include permit restrictions, cultural and or community concerns, regulatory
or approval requirements, hazard identification and environmental/endangered species concerns that may exist in the area.
An access man will be on-site before the survey crew arrives to identify problem areas, culture, water wells, structures, oil wells and
confirm point placement. Hazards that were not previously identified through design and job preplanning can be addressed at this time.
This person will “own” the hazard map throughout the job. The Chief Surveyor will oversee all survey operations, supported by his Field
Supervisor. Both individuals will report directly to the SAExploration Project Manager
SAExploration verifies that all site workers have been deemed competent by their perspective employers. In addition to the competency
sign off by the employer our on-site HSE representative will also be assigned to front end operations and is responsible for operational
safety, compliance with procedures and personnel training issues.
Exhibit "B-2"Page 8 of 13
HAZARD IDENTIFICATION
Hazards will be marked by a lath “X” and colored flagging. Hazards can consist of fences, terrain, rivers/creeks, wildlife etc. The
receivers will be marked with a lath, or tag with the color based on CAGC guidelines.
All personnel are responsible for reporting any hazards encountered during their work day. Each hazard will be reviewed and
appropriate mitigation put in place, a project hazard map will be maintained and updated as required. This is in conjunction with extra
flagging and stakes to ensure that field hazards are visible to all personnel working in the immediate area.
Surveyors will be familiar with and conform to all regulations that govern safe distances from energy sources (shot points) to various
structures and terrain issues including but not limited to all creek setbacks and all oil and gas infrastructure.
All personnel must be alerted to any known hazards they may face prior to starting their work day, relevant information will be
communicated at the safety I operations meeting prior to the start of the shift.
Some general common hazards that may be encountered at the worksite are as follows:
•Difficult ground conditions, steep slopes, water hazards, vegetation covered holes
•Wells, fences, gates, H2S locations
•Power, gas, water and telephone lines, radio, television, and radar transmitters
•Weak bridges, holes, or pits
•Animals
SOURCE AND RECEIVER POINT MARKING
Each source and receiver point will be marked using a shipping tag to ensure a degree of permanency and thus eliminate the need for
re-establishment by survey or recording crews.
Shot and receiver numbers are required on all tags. Appropriate amounts of flagging are required between points and as necessary on
all detours to provide a visual access from point to point from either direction.
All flagging colors will be based on the CAGC Seismic Flagging poster
When necessary crews will be utilize handheld GPS receivers loaded with the project to aid in project navigation.
INITIAL HAZARD IDENTIFICATION
When an obstruction in the field is encountered the following should be used as a guideline for marking access:
Exhibit "B-2"Page 9 of 13
Hazards: Mark any and all potential hazards such as potholes, stumps, snags, steep pitches, cross fences etc. to identify for subsequent
personnel working on site. Hazards will be cross-referenced on the Hazard Assessment and Access Maps.
Fences: Attention should be given to making sure every fence line is marked.
Pipelines: All locations where the line crosses or parallels a pipeline, such crossings shall be marked by a lath with “P/L” and
directional arrows flagging tied to the lath. All lathe will be placed at bends, corners or elevation changes > 2 M.
Power lines: Low overhead power lines must also be designated by a lath with “O/H Power”.
DRILLING
WorkSafe BC drill inspection requirements audit will be conducted prior to the equipment commencing work. This is a relatively new
document and as such we reduced the number of sub-contractors that were selected for bidding to ensure 100% compliance. This
includes ensuring drillers have the G600 training and rigging training.
The CAGC “Safe Operating Procedures for Seismic Drilling and Blasting” and WorkSafe BC Drilling regulations will be adhered to. This
includes Safe Guarding of Rotating Parts, iButton use, and Dust suppression for drilling.
Operations will utilize a combination of low impact tracked drills and Heli-Portable drills.
SAExploration verifies that all site workers have been deemed competent by their perspective employers. In addition to the competency
sign off by the employer our on-site HSE representative will also be assigned to front end operations and is responsible for operational
safety, compliance with procedures and personnel training issues.
Drilling crews will consist of an experienced Driller and Drill Helper for each piece of drilling equipment on the ground and all will be
supported by a Drill Push. The Drill Push provides support for drills, the ratio being dependent upon terrain conditions and the ease of
travel between drills. This ratio is determined on a project by project basis. Drillers and drill push will follow IRP 17 and have Ground
Disturbance training.
Heli - Drill crews report in by radio to the Drill Push prior to move-ups between shot holes.
BC’s Resource Road protocols will be utilized by everyone on site.
Electronic detonators will be utilized in all holes and due to the high cost of Heliportable holes double detonators will be used as an
extra safety measure.
Various methods of “tamping” shot holes are available. Bids are based on regulatory requirements any additional requirements by
Talisman would be at cost (gravel, bentonite etc.).
Based on Talisman Energy’s scout it is estimated that approximately 9800 heli drill holes would be required.
Exhibit "B-2"Page 10 of 13
EXPLOSIVES STORAGE AND HANDLING
SAExploration recognizes the security concerns and issues associated with North East British Columbia, due to the perceived higher
security threat in the region we are recommending that a Security Magazine is utilized. The magazine utilizes satellite communications
and reports magazine door opening, closing and tampering.
Although overnight storage is permitted on heli drills we would propose posting security in areas with vehicle access to ensure no
issues occur.
The drill push is responsible for distributing and maintaining explosives counts on a daily basis in addition to ensuring drilling
operations are conducted in a safe manner.
Please note: Daily magazine visits are conducted with an I Button being utilized for daily logging of site visit.
ACQUISITION
RECORDING SYSTEMS AND CREW CONFIGURATION
[***]
[2 pages omitted pursuant to the Confidential Treatment Request]
Overview
The recording crew has been configured with sufficient Oyo GSX wireless equipment and Oyo GS ONE super phone for the main
acquisition of the project so that no seam will be required for the project. The test spread portion of the project has been configured
utilizing Sercel DSU 3 component cable equipment.
By utilizing wireless technology we do not have concerns of the 20 kilometer long lines. This will allow us to operate in the most efficient
ways possible.
SAExploration has included multiple options including full Heliportable as there are many potential variables based on access due to
weather and ground conditions.
By working closely with Great Slave Helicopters (our preferred service provider) we have included Heliportable options that do not
utilize performance class 1 or 2 aircraft. This is based on Great Slave’s interpretation of Talisman documents. Performance class 1 or 2
aircraft are available for personnel movement at an additional cost.
Based on our experience with wireless equipment utilizing a single point sensor we are able to achieve some significant benefits while
maintaining exceptional data quality.
•Smaller crews (3 man layout and 3 man pickup crews). This reduces our HSE exposure due to fewer personnel walking down line).
•Lower overall equipment weight per station which allows more channels per heli bag which reduces our aviation risks.
Exhibit "B-2"Page 11 of 13
•
o
o
Insignificant risk for equipment damage from weather (lightning) when compared to cable equipment. Equipment would require almost
a direct strike compared to cable equipment.
This reduces cost overrun risks as a lightning strike on a cable system can be costly due to the actual damage as well as the required
time to troubleshoot damaged equipment.
Based on the estimate of 45% heli drilling our estimate is that 35% of the geophones would be group planted due to elevation changes
if a geophone array was utilized.
Day to Day operations
The crew is configured to have eight three man crews. These crews would be deployed as required to ensure smooth operations day to
day. A combination of Trouble Shooters, Line View Technicians would be utilized to verify spread prior to acquiring data on them. Each
person on layout or pickup is responsible for deploying individual stations completely. Stations will be line viewed either by the Line
Boss or a Trouble shooter prior to recording operations commencing on each station.
It is our intention to utilize a helicopter support for equipment (and personnel if required). Bags will be deployed utilizing either a
carousel or a Mr. T BagRunner. Heli-bags will contain 12- 15 stations per bag depending on our final risk assessment.
Recorder setup locations can be located based on the best location for communications and daily access as there is no requirement to
be able to tie into the line.
Sufficient equipment has been allocated for the project for a 6 line roll. This will allow our operations to continuously work on a two line
swath which will assist in minimizing our HSE exposure to personnel detouring in order to maintain production.
Daily tailgate meetings, hazard reporting, animal sighting cards and behavior observations are a daily part of our operations. We
acknowledge that our HSE Advisors are also responsible for paperwork however their primary role is to ensure that they are on-site in
the field working with our crews for continuous improvement.
Alternative Source
Depending on final design and government approval SAExploration would propose to utilize AHV IV Commander buggy vibrators to
replace shot holes (specifically heli holes where practical). During the negotiation phase we would propose adjusting the design
accordingly to validate the potential cost savings.
Crew Transportation
Crew transportation will be handled through various methods. A combination of ½ ton support trucks, and 2 ton line trucks and a crew
bus will be utilized based on road conditions. Once crews are in staging a combination of trucks, UTV’s and Hagglund Personnel
Carriers and helicopters would be utilized. All forms of transportation are fitted with Driver monitoring and tracking devices. A Kodiak
system in addition to Great Slave’s satellite tracking would be used for flight watch duties. BC’s Resource Road protocols will be
utilized by everyone on site.
Exhibit "B-2"Page 12 of 13
3C TEST
If Talisman proceeds with the 3C test it is our intention to utilize the Sercel DSU. A separate crew would be added to manage the is
portion of the project.
SHOT HOLE REMEDIATION
Blowouts will be plugged if practical by the shooter and the shooters helper. In the event that the blowout caused a significant increase
in size (or a crater) of the bore hole shooters will call in the shot point location to the Recorder. The Observer will make a note of the
location. SAExploration will provide a shot hole remediation crew as per rates shown in rates sheet. Based on our previous experience
and depending on the size of the blowout or crater various materials will be required. This could include a lava rock, peat moss or
support from a Chain saw crew to properly remediate the shot point. In the event of a flowing hole regulatory requirements will be
applied to ensure that the flowing hole is properly plugged to ensure no possibility of contamination.
FINAL CLEANUP AND INSPECTION
The pickup crew is responsible for removing all debris from line. As an additional measure Recording Crew Managers, Senior
Observers, HSE Advisors, Trouble Shooters and Line Bosses are utilized to spot check the project to ensure appropriate cleanup has
been conducted.
Final inspection and a letter of clearance request will occur in the spring of 2014.
FINAL REPORT
The two Final Reports completed for this project would be the required government submission and The Final Operations Report. The
final Operations report would include information on each phase of the operation budget to actual comparisons, final statistical
information on HSE performance and suggestions for improvement.

Talisman Energy Inc.
ALCOHOL AND DRUG POLICY EXPECTATIONS FOR CONTRACTORS
I.
INTERPRETATION
For the purposes of this Schedule and all Appendices hereto, the term "Operator" shall be equivalent to and used interchangeably with
the term "Company" and the terms "Talisman Energy Inc.", “Talisman Sasol Montney Partnership” or "Talisman".
II.
RESPONSIBILITIES
Contractors are expected to:
ensure that their representatives remain free from any adverse performance effects of Alcohol or other Drugs by enforcing these
·
requirements for their employees, subcontractors and agents, when working on Company Business, Company Premises and Well-
Sites;
comply with the Company Alcohol and Drug Policy (the “Policy”), attached hereto as Appendix “A” to this Schedule “D-2” or implement
·
and enforce their own policy that meets or exceeds the requirements of the Company Policy.
III. ACCESS TO TESTING SERVICES AND TEST RESULTS
The requirements for testing are set out in the Policy. In those situations where testing is required and the Contractor does not have their
own testing program set up or is temporarily unable to perform testing as required by the Policy, Company will allow Contractors to
access Company’s Alcohol and Drug testing system.
Any Contractor accessing Company’s Alcohol and Drug testing system will be required to sign a waiver indemnifying Company from
any legal liability associated with the provision of testing services. Company reserves the right to invoice the Contractor for reasonable
and customary charges associated with providing this service. In any situation where personnel are tested under Company’s employee
testing system, that individual must confirm in writing that their results can be released to the Company Alcohol and Drug Program
Administrator.
In addition, Contractors must ensure that the testing protocol under the Contractor’s own policy includes a requirement for the personnel
to sign a release indicating both the name of the donor and that the results (“Negative Test” or “Positive Test” as defined in the Policy)
will be released to Company.
Where Alcohol and Drug Testing is required under the Policy, personnel will not be permitted to return to a Company Well-Site until the
results of the Alcohol and Drug Test are received by Company.
IV. VIOLATIONS OF CONTRACTOR EXPECTATIONS
If there is any reason to believe any Contractor personnel is on duty in an unfit condition, or otherwise in contravention of the basic
intent and provisions of the Policy, the Contractor is required to conduct an investigation and Company may also conduct its own
investigation.
The Contractor must satisfy Company that there was not a breach of the Policy. Alternatively, if the Contractor confirms a violation has
occurred, they are required to take the appropriate steps to prevent further risk to people, property, the environment or Company
Business. The personnel in violation of the Policy will not be allowed to return to work for Company without written permission from the
Vice President responsible for the Company Business or Premises in relation to which the violation of the Policy occurred and the Vice
President HSE/OI for Company’s North American Operations.
Failure of the Contractor or the Contractor’s representatives, to meet these expectations will be considered willful misconduct and a
failure to comply with Company’s health and safety requirements. As such it will be considered a breach of contract and may result in
Company exercising its rights under its contract with the Contractor including the suspension or termination of the contract.

PURPOSE
It is the intention of Talisman Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates in Canada (“the Company” or “Talisman”) to provide a safe
and productive working environment for Employees, Contractors, customers, and business associates. The use of Illegal Drugs and the
inappropriate use of Alcohol, Medications, and other substances can adversely affect an Employee’s health, safety and job
performance. It can also affect or endanger other Employees, customers or members of the public.
This Policy is intended to outline in detail the standards and expectations associated with Alcohol and other Drug use. It confirms the
Company’s commitment to minimize risk throughout our operations consistent with the Talisman Global Health, Safety and Environment
(HSE) Policy.
This Policy is subject to ongoing review and evaluation, and modifications will be made as deemed necessary to respond to current
circumstances and evolving needs.
Please refer to InSite for policies in respect of other regions.

SCOPE AND APPLICATION
This Policy applies to all Employees while they are engaged in Company Business, working on Company Premises or worksites, and

•
as a minimum requirement for Canadian-based Employees when representing the Company at any international operations of the
Company or its affiliates (where Employees will be required to comply with any additional requirements in those jurisdictions or at
those facilities).
Violations of these provisions may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
Because of the greater risk involved in performing certain functions, some positions have been designated as Safety-Sensitive or Risk-
Sensitive Positions and some work locations have been designated as Safety-Sensitive Work Locations. Individuals holding these
positions or working in these locations will be expected to meet higher standards as outlined in the Policy.
All Contractors in Canada will be advised of the applicable provisions of this Policy, and will be expected to enforce these requirements
for their employees, sub-contractors and agents. Any contravention of this Policy will be considered a breach of contract. Specific
requirements for Contractors are set out in the document entitled
“Talisman Alcohol and Drug Policy Expectations for Contractors”.
This Policy sets out responsibilities and standards, which may be enhanced or modified by any facility, site or business unit where there
are sound reasons, i.e. customer requirements, significant hazard differences, past practices, or location-specific differences related to
cultural or community expectations or risks. Proposed enhancements or modifications must be supported by documented justification
and brought forward by the Alcohol and Drug Program Manager to the EVP, Corporate Services and the EVP, NAO for approval prior to
implementation. On an annual basis the VP HSE/OI NAO will review any authorized enhancements or modifications to this Policy.

Employees are encouraged to access assistance through the Company EFAP, their personal physician, their manager, or appropriate
community services for help with any problem that may be affecting work performance, including an Alcohol or Drug problem. Anyone
not covered by the Company benefit plan should seek assistance through resources available in their employer or the community.
Job performance monitoring will continue to be emphasized. Through this process, Employees with apparent performance problems
will be reminded that they should access assistance through the Company EFAP, their personal physician, or appropriate community
services for help with any personal problem.
67 of 156
6.2
Assessment/Rehabilitation
The Company recognizes that Alcohol and Drug dependency are treatable illnesses and early intervention greatly improves the
probability of a lasting recovery. Individuals who suspect they have a substance dependency or emerging Alcohol or Drug problem are
expected to seek advice and to follow appropriate treatment promptly before job performance is affected or violations of this Policy
occur. Following the violation of a provision of this Policy, Employees will be referred for an assessment by a Substance Abuse
Professional.
6.3
Request for Assistance
Employees who come forward voluntarily for help with an Alcohol or Drug problem will be referred for an assessment by a Substance
Abuse Professional and supported through a treatment and aftercare program consistent with the SAPs recommendations and the
applicable benefit coverage.
6.4
Responsibilities
Arrangements for the assessment will be made through the Alcohol and Drug Program Manager. Employees should understand that
accessing assistance or declaring a problem does not eliminate the requirement for maintenance of satisfactory performance levels.
Corrective action or testing cannot be avoided by a request for assistance with a problem or by disclosure that the individual is already
involved in a treatment program.
6.5
Aftercare
All Employees who complete primary treatment (e.g. residential or out-patient treatment) for Alcohol or Drug problems as a result of a
performance-related referral or request for assistance from the Company will be required to participate in an aftercare program when
returning to duty to help them maintain recovery. They will be expected to enter into a written agreement which will outline the
conditions governing their return to the job, and the consequences for failing to meet those conditions.
6.6
Return to Work Restrictions
Where a medical professional, SAP, or other counseling professional advises there may be a risk that prevents an Employee from doing
their job safely, a medical work modification may be issued in conjunction with the Alcohol and Drug Program Manager, and the
individual may be assigned to alternate duties if available and at the discretion of the Company. Arrangements for the assessment will
be made through the Alcohol and Drug Program Manager.
6.7
Confidentiality
Confidentiality will be maintained to the greatest extent possible except where limited disclosure is necessary for related health and
safety concerns, (e.g. there is deemed to be a potential for risk to self, others or the Company), or where required or permitted by law
(e.g. in the case of litigation or government investigation). That is, only the information strictly limited to the level of functionality (e.g.
fitness for work and any restrictions that may apply) may be shared with management for purposes of determining fitness for work,
appropriate work accommodation, and/or work re-entry initiatives.
7
7.1
INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURES
Unfit for Work Situations
In all situations when there are grounds to believe a Worker is unfit to be on Company Premises, the Worker will be escorted by a
Supervisor to a safe place, interviewed, and given an opportunity to explain why they appear to be not Fit for Work.
If the explanation is not plausible and/or the Supervisor still believes the Worker is in a condition unfit for normal work, the Supervisor
must take one or more of the following actions:
68 of 156
7.1.1
investigate further by questioning the Worker to determine the reason that the Worker is not Fit for Work and determine whether a
referral for medical attention or testing for Alcohol and Drugs is required under this Policy;
7.1.2 refer the Worker for medical attention if there are immediate medical concerns (health center, local hospital or clinic);
7.1.3
direct the Worker to submit to an Alcohol and Drug test if there are reasonable grounds to believe Alcohol or Drug use may be a
factor in the situation.
The Supervisor should first consult with a second level of supervision or management (which can include occupational health or on-site
medics where appropriate) whenever possible. However, the Supervisor has the authority and responsibility to refer an Employee for an
Alcohol and Drug test where required by this Policy.
Under no circumstances will a Worker return to work if they are not Fit for Work.
Where a Worker is referred for medical attention or directed to submit to an Alcohol and Drug test, the Worker will be provided with
transportation and escorted to the collection site or hospital/clinic depending on the circumstances, and then transportation to their local
place of residence or the care of another adult person. The Worker may be temporarily removed from their duties or reassigned pending
completion of any investigation.
7.2
Alcohol and Drug Testing
All individuals are subject to testing in the following circumstances. The testing procedures are found in Appendix 2.
7.2.1
Reasonable Cause
Testing will take place whenever the Company has reasonable cause to believe that the actions, appearance or conduct of a Worker
while on duty are indicative of the use of Alcohol or Drugs in violation of the Policy. The decision to test shall be made by a Supervisor,
and after consultation and agreement of a second level of supervision or management whenever possible. The basis for the decision
will be documented as soon as possible after action has taken place. The referral for a test will be based on specific, personal
observations resulting from, but not limited to such indicators as:
7.2.1.1
observed use or evidence of inappropriate use of Alcohol or Drugs (e.g. smell of Alcohol);
7.2.1.2
erratic or atypical behaviour or changes in behaviour;
7.2.1.3
changes in the physical appearance or speech patterns; and
7.2.1.4 any other observations that suggest the Worker may be under the influence of Alcohol or Drugs.
Workers tested in this circumstance will be removed from duty until the investigation is complete. Depending on the test result, a Fit for
Duty assessment may also be required.
7.2.2
Post Incident
Alcohol and Drug testing will be required as part of an investigation into an actual or potential Major or Critical Incident for all Workers
for which it is reasonable to believe were directly involved in the chain of acts or omissions leading up to the incident. However, a test is
not required if there is clear evidence that the acts or omissions of Workers could not have been a contributing factor (e.g. structural or
mechanical failure or environmental factors).
Testing is also required following any other incident if, as a result of the preliminary investigation, it is concluded that there is
reasonable cause for an Alcohol or Drug test.
Incident reporting requirements are outlined in Talisman Energy NAO HSE/OI Incident Reporting, Investigation & Analysis Practice
NAO-HSEOI-PRA-11-01. All Employees are to be familiar with and comply with this Practice.

7.2.3
Return to Duty – Post Violation
In those situations where employment is continued with the Company after a Policy violation, Employees will be required to submit to
an Alcohol and Drug test and may be subject to unannounced testing as a condition of continued employment as set out in an
agreement with the Company. A Negative Test Result is necessary before an individual will be permitted to return to work.
7.2.4
Return to Duty - Post Treatment
Unannounced testing may be used as a monitoring tool as determined on a case by case basis to support the recovery of any individual
assuming duties following a breach of this Policy.
7.2.5
Safety/Risk Sensitive Positions or Work Locations
As a condition of qualification for a Safety-Sensitive or Risk-Sensitive Position, or for permanent assignment at a Safety-Sensitive Work
Location, all applicants are required to submit to an Alcohol and Drug test. The test will be conducted before the applicant reports for
work but after an offer of employment in a Safety-Sensitive or Risk-Sensitive Position or for permanent assignment at a Safety-Sensitive
Work Location has been made.
A Negative Test Result is a condition of an applicant being hired or transferred into a Safety-Sensitive or Risk-Sensitive Position or for
permanent assignment at a Safety-Sensitive Work Location. Where the applicant is not currently a Talisman Employee, the individual
must, prior to testing, sign a ‘Pre-Employment Testing Consent Form’ whereby they consent to the release of the test results to the
Company.
Contract Workers assigned to Safety-Sensitive Work Locations are required to submit to an Alcohol and Drug test which must result in a
Negative Test Result prior to being accepted by Talisman for assignment for work at a Safety-Sensitive Work Location.
Exception for Alcohol and Drug Testing at Safety/Risk-Sensitive Positions or Work Locations
Employees currently in positions that are classified as Safety/Risk-Sensitive or that are currently permanently assigned to a Safety-
Sensitive Work Location (or the position is subsequently re-classified) are not required to submit to a pre-employment Alcohol or Drug
Test unless they apply for a different position that is also classified as a Safety/Risk-Sensitive Position or is one located at a Safety-
Sensitive Work Location.
7.2.6
Site Pre-Access Testing
Where a Safety-Sensitive Work Location is designated by the VP HSE/OI NAO as a site to which pre-access testing is applicable, a
Worker must complete a pre-access test, for which the test result must be a Negative Result before the Worker is deployed to a
designated Safety-Sensitive Work Location. Unless otherwise directed by the VP HSE/OI NAO, the pre-access test must be completed
not more than 3 months (90 calendar days) prior to arrival at such sites.
Unless otherwise directed by the VP HSE/OI NAO, the pre-access test will be valid for return access to a designated Safety-Sensitive
Work Location for:
7.2.6.1
A period not more than 90 calendar days from the date the test was completed. Workers will be required to provide proof of a
valid pre-access test for each subsequent return to a Safety-Sensitive Work Location; or
7.2.6.2
As long as the Worker remains in continuous employment with the same Contractor (subject to revalidation every 1 year).
Continuous employment means without lay-off or termination of employment.
Unless otherwise directed by the VP HSE/OI NAO, exceptions to the above testing requirements include:
7.2.6.3
A Worker will not be required to complete a pre-access test for initial access to a Safety-Sensitive Work Location if the Worker
has previously completed a pre-access test with respect to work to be performed on another Safety-Sensitive Work Location and
it is not more than 90 calendar days since the date the test was completed, and the Worker has remained in continuous
employment with the Company or Contractor since the date of that test.
70 of 156
7.2.6.4
A Worker will not be required to complete a pre-access test for initial access to a Safety-Sensitive Work Location if the Worker is
actively participating in a Rapid Site Access Program or a similar program designated by the Company.
7.2.6.5
An individual will not be required to be tested if the individual is present at a Safety-Sensitive Work Location for temporary short
term day-by-day access and while on the site are escorted at all times by Company personnel or other personnel designated by
Company. These individuals include Employees from other sites, vendor representatives, visitors, government agents, or
consultants authorized by the Company to attend at a Safety-Sensitive Work Location for visits, tours, inspections or deliveries.
All Contractors must maintain and provide on request sufficient records to demonstrate compliance with pre-access testing upon
request by the Company.
7.2.7
Failure to Test
Failure to report directly for a test, refusal to submit to a test, refusal to agree to disclosure of a test result to the Company Testing
Program Administrator, a confirmed attempt to tamper with a test sample, or failure to report an incident which may require testing, are a
violation of this Policy.
7.2.8
Random Testing
In addition to the listed testing circumstances, the Company reserves the right to initiate a program of random testing when it is deemed
necessary to meet the objectives of this Policy. Workers subject to random testing will be advised in advance of initiation of the program.
7.3
Search of Company Premises
Searches may by conducted by Talisman security in the following circumstances:
7.3.1
Reasonable Cause
Talisman security may Search for Alcohol and Drugs on Company Premises where, based on a combination of indicators which could
include behaviour, odor, or presence of paraphernalia, there is reasonable cause to believe that Alcohol or Drugs are present in
violation of the Policy. Such Searches may include offices, lockers, luggage and personal effects.
Supervisors are responsible for notifying Talisman security where there are reasonable grounds to believe that this Policy is being
violated. Talisman security will determine whether to conduct a Search.
7.3.2
Unannounced Periodic Searches
Talisman may conduct unannounced periodic Searches at Safety-Sensitive Work Locations. Such Searches may include any vehicle,
lockers, or personal effects located in the Common Areas of these facilities. Where the Company Premises is a camp or other location
at which Workers temporary reside, notification of the affected Worker and the consent of the Worker will be obtained prior to the Search
of the room, luggage, and personal effects of the Worker. All Unannounced Periodic Searches must be conducted in accordance with
the terms of a Search plan approved for the location by the VP HSE/OI NAO and published on Insite.
Any Illegal Drugs or Drug Paraphernalia found during a Search will be turned over to the Police. Confiscated Alcohol will be secured by
Talisman security and either disposed of or returned to the owner as deemed appropriate by Talisman security.
7.4
Loss of License/Impaired Driving Charge
All Employees who regularly or periodically operate any motorized vehicle on behalf of Talisman must advise management of any loss
of their driver’s license. In addition, Employees must inform their Supervisor immediately if they have been charged with an impaired
driving offence when operating a Company vehicle or driving on behalf of the Company. Impaired driving would include but not be
restricted to testing over the legal BAC in any jurisdiction, driving while impaired, or refusing to provide sample at the request of a police
officer for testing. Failure to report the charge is a violation of this Policy.
71 of 156
8 CONSEQUENCES OF A POLICY VIOLATION
Any violation of a provision of this Policy may result in discipline up to and including termination of employment. Pending the outcome
of any investigation an Employee may be suspended with or without pay.
Should the Company determine that employment will be continued after a violation, the Employee would be required to enter into an
agreement governing their continued employment which may require any or all of the following actions, or any other condition
appropriate to the situation:
8.1
temporary removal from their position;
8.2 assessment by a SAP to determine the need for a structured treatment program;
8.3
adherence to any recommended treatment and aftercare program;
8.4 remain substance-free and have satisfactory performance on return to duty;
8.5
successful completion of a return to duty test;
8.6
8.7
8.8
ongoing unannounced testing for the duration of their agreement;
adherence to any rehabilitation conditions or requirements; and
no further Policy violations during the monitoring period.
Failure to meet the requirements of the agreement during the monitoring period will be grounds for discipline up to and including
termination of employment as set out in the agreement.
Where a Contract Worker violates a provision of this Policy, the Contract Worker will not be permitted to return to work on Company
Business without the written permission of both the Vice President responsible for the Company Business or Premises in relation to
which the violation of this Policy occurred and the Vice President HSE/OI NAO.

Appendix 1
TO 240 – ALCOHOL AND DRUG POLICY IN CANADA
GUIDELINE ON MEDICATIONS
All Workers are expected to manage the legitimate use of Medications to avoid potential performance impairment during working hours.
The following Drug categories have been associated with performance impairment and are provided as a guideline to Workers in
assessing their own situation. The list is not exhaustive; there are numerous other over-the-counter and prescription Drugs which when
taken may negatively impact performance.
Workers are expected to consult with their personal physician or a pharmacist, the Alcohol and Drug Program Manager, or the on-site
medic to determine if use of a Medication will have any potential negative impact on job performance. If the Medication will affect their
ability to operate safely, Workers are to take appropriate action to minimize safety risk by advising management of any need for modified
duties.
Talisman Sasol Montney Partnership reserves the right through the Alcohol and Drug Program Manager to confirm the nature and
duration of any required work modification.
Antihistamines - are widely prescribed for hay fever and other allergies (e.g. Allegra, Dimetane). They are also found in many cold
Medications. These Medications may cause drowsiness.
Motion Sickness Drugs - are used to prevent motion sickness and nausea (e.g. Gravol, Antivert). Side effects may include drowsiness.
Barbiturates, Sedatives, Hypnotics, Tranquilizers, Antidepressants – are used to treat sleep disorders and depression (e.g., Ativan,
Imovane, Paxil). Potential side effects may include mild sedation, hypnotic state, dizziness or drowsiness.
Narcotics - (e.g. Demerol, Codeine, Oxycontyn and Percoset). Codeine is often found in combination drugs such as 222s or 292s or
Tylenol 1,2,3s. Potential side effects may include mild sedation, hypnotic state, dizziness or drowsiness.
Stimulants - Medication used for central nervous system stimulation and for appetite suppression can produce sensations of well-being
which may have an adverse effect on judgment, mood and behaviour (e.g. amphetamines or Medications sold as "diet pills").
Anticonvulsants - are used to control epileptic seizures and can cause drowsiness in some patients (e.g. Dilantin).
Muscle Relaxants - are used to treat musculoskeletal pain. Most common side effects are sedation and drowsiness (e.g. Flexeril,
Robaxisal).
Cold Tablets/Cough mixtures - in particular, nighttime remedies can cause drowsiness (e.g. Sinutab, Contac, Triaminic, Tussionex and
preparations containing dextromethorphan (DM) or codeine).

TO 240 – ALCOHOL AND DRUG POLICY IN CANADA
ALCOHOL AND DRUG TESTING PROCEDURES
Process:
The Alcohol and Drug testing process is based on rigorous collection, analysis and reporting procedures designed to ensure the
accuracy and integrity of the results. Steps for those tested under the Talisman Alcohol and Drug Policy are highlighted below.
Advise the Worker(s) who are being referred for an Alcohol and Drug test under the Policy. If there is any resistance, advise them of the
consequences for failure to participate. If there is any delay in sample collection, remind the Worker(s) that they cannot use any product
containing Alcohol until the test is completed or a decision not to test has been made.
Make arrangements for testing:
Complete “Alcohol and Drug Test Requisition” form
Contact Drivercheck 1-800-463-4310
Ensure the individual(s) is/are escorted to the collection site by a Supervisor or reasonable company escort (no immediate family or
close friends). The designated company escort stays at the collection site until the Worker has been released from the collection site.
Complete documentation supporting the request for a test as soon as possible and forward it to the Testing Program Administrator and
Drivercheck as soon as possible.
Testing will be conducted in those circumstances outlined under the Company Policy to determine the presence of six classes of Drugs:
cannabinoids, amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine and Alcohol. If Talisman concludes there is justification to include
additional Drugs in this list, Employees will be advised of the change. Testing for additional Drugs may also be required on an
individualized basis on the advice of a treatment centre or Substance Abuse Professional in a post-treatment situation.
Alcohol tests will be administered by a calibrated breathalyzer with a printout of test results. In those situations when a breath analyzer
is not readily available Alcohol testing will be done with a saliva strip followed by urine collection for confirmation analysis in the
laboratory.
All Drug tests will be administered by urinalysis, or by collection of an oral fluid sample for analysis in the laboratory. In certain
situations, a “point of collection” (quick test) urine Drug screening test may be administered with appropriate adulterant checks; any
result that is not negative will be sent to the laboratory for confirmation analysis.
Collection specimens for Drug testing and administration of Alcohol tests will be performed by trained collection agents at Company-
designated collection sites. In post incident and reasonable cause testing situations, samples will be collected as soon as possible after
the triggering event, but collection attempts will end eight (8) hours after the incident for an Alcohol test, and thirty-two (32) hours after
the incident for a Drug test.
All individuals who are tested are required to sign a form to acknowledge the accuracy of the Employee and employer information and
authenticity of the specimen(s). They will be given a copy of the Drug Testing Custody and Control Form and the Breath Alcohol Testing
Form for their records.
Urine samples for Drug testing will be analyzed by a fully qualified and accredited laboratory using a two-step process with initial
screening by immunoassay and all confirmations being performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). If a point of
collection screening device is used, any non-negative result will be forwarded to a laboratory for confirmation analysis.
74 of 156
If either test was not negative, arrange transportation to an Employee’s local residence or to the care of another responsible adult, as
circumstances warrant. If an Employee insists on driving after being advised against, the Employee is to be informed that the local
police are being notified.
Confirmed Positive Test Results will be reviewed by a qualified Medical Review Officer who will discuss the result with the Employee in
an effort to determine whether a Positive Test could have resulted from the legitimate use of Medications or other medical explanations.
The individual concerned will be given an opportunity to explain the finding to the MRO who will then determine whether the result will
be reported to the Company as a Negative or a verified Positive Test, a tampered or substituted result.
In the case of a verified Positive Test Result of a urine test conducted in accordance with this Policy, the person who has been tested
may request the MRO to direct the split sample to be tested by an accredited laboratory of that person's choice within seventy-two (72)
hours of receiving their results. Where split samples are not collected, the Employee may request that the original sample be
reanalyzed. If a second confirmed Positive Test is reported, the person who requested the second analysis is responsible for
reimbursing the Company for the associated costs.
Any Positive Test result will be considered a violation of this Policy, whether or not the Drugs or Alcoholic beverage were actually
consumed on Company Business or Premises. Failure to report directly for a test, refusal to submit to a test, refusal to agree to
disclosure of a test result to the Testing Program Administrator or designate, or tampering or attempting to tamper with a test sample are
considered a violation of the Policy.
All test results will be reported directly to the Company Testing Program Administrator or designate. Except for the release of
information in accordance with this Policy and in situations affecting the health and safety of Workers and the public, results of all testing
will be maintained by the Testing Program Administrator and will be kept confidential to the greatest extent possible except where
required or permitted by law (e.g. in the case of litigation or government investigation).

RANDOM ALCOHOL AND DRUG TESTING GUIDELINE
SAFETY SENSITIVE POSITIONS AT SELECT SAFETY SENSITIVE WORK LOCATIONS – NAO CANADA
9
PURPOSE
The commitment of Talisman is to operate our business to ensure proactive risk mitigation in accordance with our core value to ensure
safe operations. Alcohol and Drugs represent a safety risk to both Workers at Talisman worksites and members of the public. In
accordance with our Alcohol and Drug Policy, Talisman is implementing random Alcohol and Drug testing within its Canadian
operations to detect Workers in Safety-Sensitive Positions (SSP) under the influence of Alcohol and Drugs and to deter Workers from
using Alcohol and Drugs at Company Premises.
10 ASSESSMENT OF RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ALCOHOL AND DRUGS AT TALISMAN OPERATIONS
All Vice Presidents (VP) within Talisman’s Canadian operations will ensure that an ongoing review is completed to determine whether
an existing or new worksite is one at which there are significant hazards such that a Worker in a Safety-Sensitive Position who is under
the influence of Alcohol or Drugs could cause an actual Major or Critical Incident.
This assessment should include consideration of:
· Job functions, work processes and tools utilized at the worksite;
· Potential injuries that may occur as a result of an incident;
· The ISNetworld rating of the Contractors at the worksite as it relates to safety;
·Nature of the incidents at the particular worksite and/or at other Talisman and/or industry worksites where similar work is performed;
·The potential for an incident at a worksite to threaten and/or harm members of the public residing and/or present at the worksite;
· The potential for an incident to cause an environmental release;
Whether Workers in a Safety-Sensitive Position will be operating motor vehicles on private and/or public roads as part of their duties
·
and/or to travel to and from the worksite;
· Workplace factors that tend to contribute to the abuse of substances such as:
·
high stress;
· long hours or irregular shifts (including overtime);
· fatigue (including that associated with duties, shift rotation) ;
· repetitious duties (including driving);
· periods of inactivity or boredom;
isolation (including residing in camp facilities or being required to reside for rotations at a location other than the primary residence of
·
the Worker);
· easy access to Alcohol or Drugs.
76 of 156
The Alcohol and Drug policy of Contractors working at the worksite and whether the Contractor has implemented procedures for the
·
testing of Alcohol and Drugs equivalent to the requirements of the Talisman Alcohol and Drug Policy;
Prior incidents and/or issues involving Alcohol and Drugs at the worksite and/or at other Talisman and industry worksites engaged in
·
similar work;
The other measures utilized and their effectiveness in detecting and mitigating the risk associated with Alcohol and Drugs at the
·
worksite or similar worksites;
The Vice President responsible for a particular worksite will forward the assessment to the VP HSE/OI who will determine whether the
inclusion of the worksite in the Talisman program of random Alcohol and Drug testing is warranted in order to mitigate the risk posed to
safe operations by Alcohol and Drugs. If the worksite is deemed to be a location subject to random Alcohol and Drug Testing it will be
added to the random selection pool by the Talisman Alcohol and Drug Program Manager.
11
FREQUENCY
Once per month or on such other frequency stipulated by the VP HSE/OI Workers in Safety-Sensitive Positions will be subject to
random Alcohol and Drug testing.
12 NOTICE OF RANDOM ALCOHOL AND DRUG TESTING
The Talisman Alcohol and Drug Program Manager is responsible for maintaining and updating the list of Talisman worksites which the
VP HSE/OI has included as a worksite at which random Alcohol and Drug Testing may be performed as outlined in this Procedure.
The VP, or their designate, responsible for a designated worksite are responsible for advising all Contractors that the worksite is one at
which testing may be performed.
Contractors are required to provide advance notice to Contract Workers that random testing may be performed at the worksite and that
the provision of consent to testing is a requirement for being permitted to attend to the worksite. Contractors are required and an audit
may be performed to confirm that Contractors have obtained the written consent of Contract Workers to undergo Alcohol and Drug
Testing as requested.
Site Supervisors at eligible worksites are required to ensure that sufficient signage is present at the worksite so that any Worker
attending to the worksite will be aware that Workers at the worksite are subject to random Alcohol and Drug Testing.
13 TESTING PROCEDURE – RANDOM SITE SELECTION AND RANDOM NAME SELECTION
13.1
The Talisman VP HSE/OI will select at least two weeks prior to the test date, the date on which Alcohol and Drug testing will be
performed. This test date will be kept confidential between the VP HSE/OI and the Alcohol and Drug Program Manager. The testing
will proceed on selected date unless the VP HSE/OI is satisfied that, based on the nature of the operations, that the testing will
jeopardize safe operations.
13.2The Talisman VP HSE/OI will inform the Talisman Alcohol and Drug Program Manager that testing is to be performed on the
selected date.
13.3The Talisman Alcohol and Drug Program Manager will contact the operations designates to ensure that the list of Safety-Sensitive
Work Locations at which random Alcohol and Drug Testing may be performed will remain current as of the proposed test date.
13.4Prior to selected date, the Talisman Alcohol and Drug Program Manager will provide the list of Safety Sensitive Work Locations
subject to random testing to an external third party contracted to administer the random selection process.
13.5The external third party contracted to administer the random selection process will enter all Talisman Safety-Sensitive Work
Locations subject to random testing into a computer based random selection generator.
77 of 156
13.6Once the location has been randomly selected the external third party contracted to administer the random selection process will
notify the Talisman Alcohol and Drug Program Manager of the specific site location.
13.7
On the date selected for random testing, the Talisman Alcohol and Drug Program Manager will then contact the Talisman site
Supervisor to request a list of the names of the Workers working or scheduled to work at the site on the selected date. The Talisman
Supervisor will submit the list of names to the Talisman Alcohol and Drug Program Manager within 30 minutes of the request.
The Talisman site Supervisor is responsible for keeping all information related to the intention to randomly test Workers at the worksite
confidential until the selection of names has been made and communicated to the Supervisor. Disciplinary action will be considered for
any breech of protocol.
13.8
The Talisman Alcohol and Drug Program Manager will submit the list of names to the external third party contracted to administer
the random selection process for entry into the random selection process. Unless otherwise directed by the VP HSE/OI,
approximately 25% of the Workers working or scheduled to work at the site on the selected date will be selected for random testing.
13.9The external third party contracted to administer the random selection process will communicate the names of individuals that were
randomly selected to the Talisman’s Alcohol and Drug Program Manager.
13.10The Talisman Alcohol and Drug Program Manager will advise the VP Operations responsible for operations at the selected site
and the site Supervisor of the individuals randomly selected for testing.
13.11The site Supervisor for the selected worksite will be responsible to ensure that a request for an Alcohol and Drug test is made for
all Workers selected for random testing.
13.12Workers are entitled to refuse to undergo an Alcohol and Drug Test. This will constitute a breach of the Talisman Alcohol and
Drug Policy. Consequences will be imposed as outlined in section 8 of the Policy.
13.13The testing company shall provide results of Alcohol and Drug testing to the Talisman Alcohol and Drug Program Administrator;
13.14No Worker will be permitted to return to work until the Alcohol and Drug test is confirmed as a Negative Test (Fit for Duty) unless
otherwise permitted under the provisions of the Policy.
13.15The Talisman Alcohol and Drug Program Administrator will communicate Fit or Un-Fit for Duty status of Workers to the VP
Operations and Site Supervisor that is responsible for the worksite.
13.16Where a Contract Worker is not Fit for Duty (i.e. Positive Test), the test result will be communicated by the Talisman Alcohol and
Drug Program Administrator to the Contractor.
13.17
Where a Contract Worker is not Fit for Duty (i.e. Positive Test), Talisman expects that this breach of the Talisman Alcohol and
Drug Policy will be addressed in accordance with the terms of the Contractors own policy. The onus is on the Contractor to ensure
that the Contract Worker is safely removed from site and escorted to a safe location.

PURPOSE
To establish the minimum requirements for safe operation of motor vehicles while conducting Talisman business and provide a
standard practice for NAO employees and contractors operating vehicles on behalf of Talisman that aligns with Golden Rule 9 –
Operate Vehicles Safely.
Golden Rule 9 States:
We will never operate vehicles without:
1.1 Conducting a pre-trip inspection, assessing the risks and planning accordingly.
1.2 Ensuring the driver is properly licensed for the class of vehicle and free from fatigue, drug or alcohol impairment.
1.3 Driving with care at appropriate speeds for road conditions, and ensuring all occupants fasten seatbelts.
1.4 Avoiding the use of all mobile communications devices and other driving distractions.
1.5

competence. Approved courses shall be a minimum of one day, consist of a combination of classroom and hands on training and must
contain a pass fail component. The vehicle driven in the course should be comparable to Talisman vehicles typically operated by the
driver at work. A list of approved courses will be recorded in the Talisman Training Framework. NAO HSEOI will review new training
vendors upon request.
Contractor: A person employed by a contractor or a contractor’s subcontractor who is directly involved in the execution of work under a
contract with Talisman.
Contract Driver: Any contractor who drives on Talisman business.
Equipment Damage: Damage to a vehicle while that vehicle is parked. For example, a vehicle damaged while an operator loads an
object into the cargo box is considered equipment damage. A stolen vehicle would also be classified as equipment damage and theft.

it impacts Talisman and/or its contractors directly, or a third party.
Near Miss - Vehicle: An occurrence that, under slightly different circumstances, had the potential to cause a vehicle incident or
equipment damage.
Non-Recordable Vehicle Incident: Any incident involving a motor vehicle resulting in an injury, or loss/damage, or harm to the
environment, whether it impacts Talisman and/or its contractors directly, or a third party that is “non-work related”.
Non-Recordable Vehicle Incidents will be classified based on actual and potential severity and investigated to determine root cause,
corrective actions and shared learnings with the same rigor as a Recordable Vehicle Incident but will not be captured in the Talisman
vehicle statistics for benchmarking driving performance against industry partners.
80 of 156
Professional Driver: A driver who typically drives on Talisman business for 10,000 km (6,213 miles) or more over a twelve-month
period or as designated by their supervisor.
Road Hazard Assessment: A detailed description of the hazards related to driving on an access road to a Talisman operation site or
project activity.

TRAINING / COMPETENCY
6.1
Initial Training
All Talisman drivers shall maintain a valid North American driver’s license for the class of vehicle they operate. All drivers, where
required by law, shall have a valid TDG or DOT certificate in their possession.
All Talisman drivers will successfully complete an Approved Defensive Driver Training Course (DDT). This requirement may be waived
by local area management if a Talisman driver has completed an acceptable DDT course within the last three years and can provided
valid certification.
Talisman drivers who have not taken a DDT course within the past three years will be scheduled on a priority basis to attend a DDT
course. Priority will be given to those individuals considered to be Professional Drivers and/or to those whose driving record indicates
high-risk driving behaviors.
The schedule within Business Group or Operating Area shall be set to ensure all Talisman drivers attend a DDT course prior to Dec
2013.
A temporary variance for the DDT requirement may also be granted within the Business Group or Operating Area if a Talisman driver
successfully completes an external driver assessment and is enrolled in a DDT course within the following six months.
A risk assessment must also be performed at each job site to determine what type of additional driving training may be required. These
could include:
· Vehicles fit for purpose and conditions;
· Adverse road conditions (gravel, lease roads, snow and ice, mud, etc.);
·
·
·
·
Winter Driving;
Backing;
Sloped surfaces;
Reverse skidding;
· Fatigue and Journey Management;
·
Animal avoidance;
· Understanding 4 X 4’s;
·

· Radio communications.
6.2
Refresher Training
Talisman employees who are involved in a vehicle incident resulting in a minor classification as classified in the NAO Incident
Reporting, Investigation & Analysis Practice Risk Matrix, or who have more than one citation for at risk driving behaviors shall be
required to participate in a refresher DDT course as soon as possible after the related incident or citation. Refresher courses for
employees will be at Talisman’s expense.
83 of 156
6.3
Driver Abstracts
Talisman Employees who operate a Talisman vehicle on company business shall provide driver abstracts to their supervisor upon
request.
Supervisors shall review driver abstracts for professional drivers who are involved in minor motor vehicle incidents in order to determine
if additional training should be taken to improve safe driving behaviors.

7.1
SAFE DRIVER ACTIVITIES
Road Hazard Assessments
A road hazard assessment is an inventory of road hazards that exist along the route to a Talisman location. All operating areas within
the Talisman NAO operating group will identify high risk roads and communicate road hazards to Talisman and Contract drivers as a
proactive measure.
Operating Areas and Delivery Units will assess and identify roads that will require written road hazard assessments, based on risk and
use.
Target completion for initial road hazard assessments is the end of Q2 2011. Communication and updating of road hazard assessments
will be ongoing.
Activities outside an existing operating area will require a project specific road hazard assessment.
Road hazards that should be considered and identified include:
· Bridges (width, capacity, no post markers, approaches);
· Adverse road conditions (gravel, lease roads, snow and ice, mud, etc.);
·
Identification of narrow road sections;
· Blind corners and hilltops;
· Reduced speed areas;
Chain up requirements and safe chain up areas.
Appendix 2 includes a sample Road Hazard Assessment Form.
If high hazard areas are identified on Talisman controlled roads, measures such as road crown enhancements, signage upgrades, or
improved grading practices should be considered. If Talisman is not the primary road permit holder, the hazard information should be
communicated to the permit holder through road use groups or by contacting the permit holder directly.
7.2Journey Management
All Talisman employees shall question the need to drive and do so only when it is required and when safe driving conditions exist.
Prior to commencing a trip, drivers shall conduct a journey hazard assessment and complete a Journey Management Checklist when
the journey is outside of their regular job duties, or schedule. A Journey Management Checklist (guideline) can be found in Appendix 3.
The hazard assessment may include:
· Current weather forecast;
·
·
·
Road conditions;
Level of alertness;
Traffic volume;
84 of 156
·Trip duration and distance;
·Working alone;
·Emotional state.
Ask yourself, “is this trip necessary?”
Where travel is necessary, a trip plan shall be made to ensure that the following controls are in place:
·An appropriate vehicle is available;
·A vehicle safety kit is available (see Appendix 4);
·Potential driving hazards have been identified;
·The driver is well rested;
The route and estimated schedule are clearly communicated to direct supervisor or an appropriate designate such as an answering
·
service;
·Where applicable a local road hazard assessment map is available from the local Operating Area;
·Drive during daylight hours wherever possible;
·A vehicle inspection has been completed by the driver;
·Ensure working alone requirements are met.
7.3Seatbelts
·All occupants shall wear seatbelts at all times when a vehicle is moving.
7.4Speed
The posted speed limit shall be adhered to on all roads and a hazard assessment should govern speed on private roads where speed
·
limits are not posted.
·A hazard assessment should govern speed limit on any road in inclement weather or other hazardous conditions.
7.5Cell Phones
Avoid the use of all mobile communications devices while driving.
The use of hand held cell phones or text messaging (or similar wireless devices) while driving are not permitted for any Talisman Driver.
Permitted cell phone practices include:
·Phone must be a hands free device;
·Calls may be answered but shall not be initiated by the driver while driving;
·Calls shall be answered only when it is deemed safe to do so;
·Where hazardous or congested road conditions exist the driver shall pull off the road to engage in conversation if it is safe to do so;
85 of 156
The process for complying with the above cell phone practice shall meet all local regulatory requirements as well as the NAO Driving
Practice. Any conflict between the NAO Driving Practice and local regulatory requirements will be resolved by adopting the more
stringent of the two, if not prohibited by law or regulation.
Use of a two-way radio to call km’s (miles) on a radio-controlled road is permitted in accordance with the road rules for the radio-
controlled road.
7.6Other Driver distractions
Drivers must also consider and manage other distractions including but not limited to:
·Eating, drinking;
·Vehicle controls, radios and cd players;
·GPS Unit, MP3 players, two way radios;
·Reading and writing;
·Conversations with passengers;
·Reaching for items;
·Preoccupation with other things and outside surroundings.
7.7Driver Fatigue and Alertness
All Talisman drivers must be appropriately rested and alert. Talisman drivers operating vehicles that fall within hours of service
regulations must comply with duty hour requirements specified by local regulations.
All Talisman drivers will participate in Talismans fatigue awareness training. The fatigue awareness training is available on Insight for
review during regular safety meetings or focused training sessions.
7.8Securing of Loads
Talisman drivers carrying loose items in the passenger compartment and/or pickup truck box shall use sufficient restraints to ensure
·
objects are secured to prevent a projectile hazard during an emergency braking situation, collision or during travel;
·Flammables shall not be carried in the passenger compartment of a vehicle;
Where items are transported in a pickup truck or other cargo vehicle, they shall be stored and securely fastened as specified by law and
·
local area policy;
Failure to use load binders properly may result in serious injury or even death to a driver or others – Appendix 5 includes a Load Binder
·
Guideline.
7.9Vehicle Walk-Around
·Driver inspection of the vehicle by walking around is required.
·Prior to driving, Talisman drivers shall engage in completing a mental checklist, guidelines for which are highlighted in Appendix 6.
7.10Parking
All drivers will back into parking spaces unless a documented hazard assessment indicates otherwise. A vehicle walk-around prior to
moving the vehicle will help to mitigate risk in these situations.
All vehicles with trailers should be equipped with chock blocks for use when parked.
86 of 156
7.11Hazardous Areas
No vehicle shall be operated within 25 meters (82 feet) of any wellhead, piping, process vessel or tank containing combustible fluids
unless required by a specific maintenance or operating function.
7.12Backing Up Safely – Congested Areas
Backing up and maneuvering vehicles usually occurs at slow speeds, yet backing incidents account for a disproportionate number of
minor low-speed collisions and have the potential for serious consequences.
·Always use a spotter in a congested area;
·Walk around vehicle before backing up;
·Give audible notice that backing will occur if the vehicle is equipped with a back up alarm;
·If the vehicle is not equipped with a back-up alarm, touch the horn lightly two times before beginning the back-up maneuver;
·Check overhead, side and rear clearance;
·Apply the brakes while shifting the vehicle to reverse;
·Back up at a very low speed.
7.13Spotters
A spotter shall be used when backing into an area with limited visibility, constricted or congested areas, within 25 meters (82 feet) of
process equipment or where necessary to guide heavy equipment.
·Spotter and backing vehicle do not move at the same time – if the spotter must change position, the driver must stop;
·Use a spotter located at the left rear of the vehicle whenever backing up;
·If using hand signals driver and spotter to agree on hand signals used;
·The driver must be able to see the spotter through the mirror and vice versa;
·The driver and the spotter must maintain eye contact;
·If the spotter disappears from the mirror, the driver must immediately stop;
·If there is no spotter available:
· Reconsider backing up. Is it really necessary?
· Make a reasonable attempt to get someone to act as a spotter;
·If a spotter cannot be obtained, get out of the unit and walk around the unit completing a “circle of safety” and survey the backing area;
· Hang a ribbon or other marker to indicate the safe backing up distance;
· Follow the “backing up safely” steps (above).
87 of 156
7.14Towing
Utilizing a tow-truck appropriately sized for the vehicle is the most desirable option for recovering a vehicle. Where a tow truck is not
available, all Talisman drivers shall follow the towing procedures specified in Appendix 7.
The towing procedure in Appendix 7 applies only to light and medium-duty vehicles (1 Ton (907 kg) vehicles or lighter). A tow truck
must be used for any heavy-duty vehicle (greater than a 1 Ton (907 kg)).
7.15Boosting, Tire Changes and Chains
·Talisman drivers should refer to the Owner’s manual provided with their vehicle or with their tire chains;
Manufacturers’ directions should be followed unless a hazard assessment by the driver indicates these directions would be unsafe to
·
follow. Example: conditions associated with changing a tire on an unstable surface;

Procedures
STEP BY STEP GUIDE FOR PULLING OUT A VEHICLE WITH A RECOVERY STRAP
1.
Stop, consider the task at hand and assess the hazards. If you have any questions or doubts at this point, call a tow truck, it remains
your best option.
2.
If the vehicle recovery takes place on or near a roadway, you must implement a traffic warning or traffic control system (e.g., traffic
cones or reflector flares).
3.
Ensure that you have the correct equipment—a recovery strap is essential. The recovery strap should be at least 6 m or 20 ft in length,
with loops (not hooks) and in good working condition (no cuts or broken stitches). If you do not have a recovery strap like this at hand,
call a tow truck.
4.
Check both vehicle weights and add the weights of any loads either vehicle is carrying. The vehicle doing the pulling must be of equal
or, ideally, greater weight than the vehicle that is being pulled.
5.
Ensure the recovery strap has a Minimum Breaking Strength (MBS) that is 2-3 times the total weight of the stuck vehicle. If it is less,
the danger is the strap may snap under high tension. If the MBS is greater, it will not function optimally (they are most effective when
their elasticity enhances the pull).
Recovery straps are usually constructed so that each inch of width adds approximately 10,000 lbs (4,500 kg) of MBS (e.g., a 3 inch wide
strap would usually have a rating of approximately 30,000 lbs [13,500 kg]).
6.
Ensure tow hooks, hitch receivers and any shackles used are rated to loads that exceed the recovery strap MBS. In the event of
excessive loads, the recovery strap should always be the weakest link and snap first. A shackle should have a Working Load Limit
(WLL) stamped on it (remember 1 ton = 2000 lbs or 900 kg).
7.As much as possible, clear out mud, sand, or snow from under the stuck vehicle and in front of the tires in the direction of the pull.
8.
Position the pulling vehicle in line with the stuck vehicle—the pulling vehicle facing forward; the stuck vehicle being pulled from the
front (ideally) or the back. You need to be within 10° of a straight line—side loading can lead to serious vehicle damage. You need to
be sure you have a clear path straight forward free of any obstacles that is at east the length of the strap and stuck vehicle.
9.
Lay out the recovery strap between the two vehicles and loop the strap onto a tow hook bolted to the vehicle frame or put the loop on a
shackle which is properly pinned to a frame mounted hitch rated for recovery. If using a threaded shackle, hand tighten the pin and
then turn it back one quarter turn for ease of release later. Never tie the strap onto the vehicle, slip the strap over a ball hitch, or attach
it to anything other than a tow hook or frame mounted hitch. Only use one recovery strap (never two in parallel)—however, there are
two options for creating additional length with two recovery straps if needed:
Reduce the expected strength of the recovery straps by 25% if you are using two correctly joined straps.
10. Drape a heavy coat or blanket over the middle of the strap to dampen any backlash if it snaps or releases.
11.
Agree on a plan and communication signals between the two drivers. Industry Recommended Practice Hand Signals for Directing
Vehicles (IRP 12) provides a good system of signals to use.
99 of 156
12.
Ensure all other bystanders are at least 2 times the length of the recovery strap to the side of the vehicles—both the strap and the
vehicles lurching forward unexpectedly present a hazard.
13.
The pulling vehicle accelerates slowly (to about 10-12 KPH) to build tension in the strap and provide a sustained pull. Once the
slack is taken up, the stuck vehicle likewise applies acceleration in low gear to assist the pulling car. Neither vehicle should spin
their tires. Steady momentum is most effective—never resort to jerking or take a long run and jerk. Maintain tension throughout the
pull, do not allow slack to develop in the strap at any point. After three attempts to pull the vehicle loose, it is time to stop and call a
tow truck.
14.
Do not remove straps until both vehicles are fully stopped and secured. It is a good idea to clean and dry out a recovery strap after
use as dirt and moisture weaken the strap. Remember, if at any point in the process you have any safety concerns whatsoever or
concerns about potential damage to either vehicle, stop and call a certified tow truck.

the helicopter performance has been calculated with known (for take-off) and estimated (for landing) altitudes and temperatures.
3.7
Utilizing known obstacles and planned flight paths, HOGE or HIGE performance charts will be used by the Helicopter Operator to
calculate maximum weight. If the Helicopter Operator is not reasonably assured a HIGE flight path is possible, the Helicopter
Operator will use the HOGE performance charts to calculate maximum weight. The Helicopter Operator shall ensure the take-off and
landing helicopter weights are equal or less than the performance maximum weight calculated. At the request of the Company, the
Helicopter Operator shall provide documentation to demonstrate compliance.
The Helicopter Operator shall ensure the helicopter's centre of gravity is within limits during all phases of flight. If the take-off and
3.8landing centre of gravity is not calculated prior to flight, an alternative means of ensuring conformity with centre of gravity limits must
be approved by the Company prior to flight operations.
3.9
Before tender and during operations, the Helicopter Operator shall assess the pilot workload (duringflight) required to complete the
project and communicate this assessment to the Company. For helicopters certified for single pilot operations, at the request of the
Company, the Helicopter Operator will provide a second pilot. The Company will compensate the Contractor, at reasonable market
rate, for the second pilot.
3.10In order to conduct helicopter operations under VFR (daytime) the following weather minima, or the minima described in Applicable
Laws shall be complied with, whichever is greater:

Successful emergency landing: An unavoidable landing or ditching with reasonable expectancy of no injury to persons in the aircraft
or on the surface.
Passenger: Anyone aboard the helicopter who is not one of the following: Pilot, Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (or Mechanic), qualified
Flight Navigators and Cabin Attendants who are required by local regulation or the Helicopter Operator.
Performance Class 1 (PC1) Multi-engine helicopter: If an engine fails, the helicopter is able to land within the rejected take off area or
to safely continue flight to an appropriate landing area. (Helicopters must be certified Category A) (From OGP 390)
Performance Class 2 with Defined Limited Exposure (PC2DLE) Multi-engine helicopter: If an engine fails, the helicopter is able to
safely continue flight, except when the failure occurs early during take off or late in the landing, in which case a forced landing may be
required. The period of time when a forced landing is required defines the “limited exposure”. The defined “limited exposure” must be
less than a minute. (Helicopters must be certified Category A)
Performance Class 3 (PC3) Single Engine or Multi-engine helicopter: If an engine fails, a forced landing is required for single
engine helicopters and may be required for multi-engine helicopters. (Helicopters certified Category A or B) (From OGP 390)
Category A: with respect to transport category rotorcraft, means multiengine rotorcraft designed with engine and system isolation
features specified in FAR/JAR 29 and utilizing scheduled takeoff and landing operations under a critical engine failure concept which
assures adequate designated surface area and adequate performance capability for continued safe flight in the event of engine failure.
Category B: with respect to helicopters means single-engine or multi-engine helicopters which do not fully meet all Category A
standards. Category B helicopters have no guaranteed stay-up ability in the event of an engine failure and unscheduled landing is
assumed.
LOFT: Line Oriented Flight Training; LOFT refers to aircrew training which involves a full mission simulation of situations which are
representative of line operations, with special emphasis on situations which involve pilot decision making, communications,
management and leadership. In short, LOFT means realistic, "real-time", full mission training.
FAR/JAR 27/29: Harmonized airworthiness certification standards from the US (FAR) and Europe (JAR) that address aviation safety
through helicopter design. Part 27 addresses smaller helicopters (9 and fewer passengers) Part 29 address larger (10 or more
passengers).

Appendix 1 – OGP 420 Helicopter guidelines, Section 3
Where available for the type of aircraft, the Helicopter Provider (shall) establish a simulator training programme, using approved
Synthetic Training Devices for all Flight crew at a preferred frequency of 12 months and not less than once per 24 months. Flight crew
training should be conducted in a synthetic Training Device (STD) that replicates the model of aircraft being flown as closely as
possible. It is preferred that the device be full motion with a visual screen that provides forward and peripheral imaging.
Level C or D Flight Simulators are preferred. Where a Flight Simulator in not available for the helicopter type, the use of Flight Training
Devices (FTDs) during training is strongly encouraged.
While it is recognized that the use of simulators allows practice in handling emergencies that cannot be practiced in the air, the
emphasis of this training should also be on the development of Crew Resource Management (CRM) for multi-crew aircraft or
Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) for single piloted aircraft, including practice of CRM/ADM principles. When appropriate, this
should be in the form of Line Oriented Flight Training (LOFT), the exercise for which should be developed between the Helicopter
Provider and the simulator operators to provide “real time” exercises using simulated local operational, weather and environmental
conditions.
All pilots (shall) receive annual recurrent training to the standards of appropriate civil aviation authorities, and flight checks at not less
than a frequency of every six months for long-term operations. These flight checks should include an annual instrument rating
proficiency check/renewal (where applicable), a proficiency check (including emergency drills) and an annual route check. Where
distinct climatic seasons exist, training related to the seasonal change is recommended.
Before being scheduled for flight duties in a new location, all crewmembers (shall) receive as a minimum a documented Line Check,
which includes an orientation of local procedures/policies.

Exhibit “D-5”
Talisman Energy Inc.
POLICY ON BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS
PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE
The Policy on Business Conduct and Ethics (PBCE) is a statement of the principles to which Talisman Energy Inc. is committed to
uphold across its operations worldwide. The Policy reflects our Values and commitment to conduct business safely, in an ethically,
socially and environmentally responsible manner. It explains the way we do business and sets standards for everyone who works for, or
on behalf of, Talisman to follow. It has also been developed to be consistent with internationally recognized standards that Talisman
adheres to, including the United Nations Global Compact, the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights and the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative.
In the upstream business we are subject to many different laws and local customs in different parts of the world, and of course often
what we do in one part of the world is reflected and played back in another. That is the benefit and price of being a global company. We
must take great care to apply consistent standards to the way we do business everywhere. It is each employee’s accountability to know
about this Policy and to apply it in all situations.
This Policy applies not only to Talisman employees, officers and directors, but also to independent contract workers to the extent they
conduct activities at or for Talisman. The Company will make reasonable efforts to promote the application of these ethical business
practices by our joint venture partners and third party suppliers. Everyone conducting work on the Company’s behalf is an ambassador
of Talisman. You are encouraged to act in a manner that upholds the spirit of the Policy and demonstrates Talisman’s values every day.
As such I ask that you take the time to read this Policy and consider what it means for you.
If at any time you have a question, are unsure about what to do, or have a concern that someone has undertaken an action inconsistent
with the Policy you have the responsibility to raise the issue even if the message is difficult. Honest communication is critical. You can
do this a number of ways including speaking with your Supervisor, Manager, Country Manager or Executive Vice President.
Furthermore, you are strongly encouraged to report any business ethics concerns via Talisman’s Integrity Matters hotline. The hotline is
operated by a third party host and all reports made in good faith and in the context of a breach of any of Talisman’s policies will be taken
very seriously. All calls and reports will be treated in confidence and information will be shared with only those persons who need to
know or persons who are required to know. Where permissible or required by law, anonymity of the reporter will be maintained at the
request of the reporter. Please remember that non compliance with the Policy or retaliation against someone who raises an issue
regarding the Policy will not be tolerated.
Maintaining the goodwill of our stakeholders, including employees, governments and communities is critical to our Company's objective
of maximizing shareholder value. All activities undertaken by Talisman must, of course, be lawful and safe, but it is equally important
that these be conducted in an ethical, honest and fair manner, free from deception and impropriety, and with constant regard for
Talisman’s reputation. This is the foundation of our license to operate and without that we have no business.
By our continued commitment to the principles embodied in this Policy, we can ensure that Talisman is a welcome corporate citizen
worldwide.

INTRODUCTION
The Policy on Business Conduct and Ethics is a reference guide for employees, officers, directors and independent contract workers
that conduct activities on Talisman’s behalf. The Policy defines Talisman’s standards in a variety of areas including: ethical business
conduct; personal conduct; health, safety and environment; employee practices; human rights and community relations.
1.1
Scope
The Policy applies to Talisman employees, officers, directors and independent contract workers to the extent that they conduct activities
on the Company’s behalf. It also applies to all subsidiaries of Talisman Energy Inc. In this document, the term “Talisman” and “the
Company” shall refer to Talisman Energy Inc. and all of its subsidiaries.
1.2
Responsibilities
Everyone to whom this Policy applies must become familiar with the policies and procedures described in the Policy and review them
periodically. To assist you in this regard both the complete Policy and the supporting policies and procedures referenced therein are
available on the Talisman Intranet. In addition, certain geographical and functional areas of the Company have specific procedures for
various purposes to adhere to local laws. It is your responsibility to be aware of, and comply with, all procedures applicable to your area.
Managers have additional responsibilities in regard to the Policy. Every Manager is expected to lead by example and must promote
compliance with the Policy by providing clear guidance to employees regarding appropriate business conduct in all situations.
2
ETHICAL BUSINESS CONDUCT
To maintain Talisman's excellent reputation with our stakeholders, all dealings on Talisman's behalf must reflect high standards of
ethical behaviour. In particular, the following specific principles must be observed:
2.1
Compliance with Laws
We must be aware of and comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations as locally interpreted and administered in all
jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business. We have a duty to inform ourselves of any laws relevant to our particular
activities. Anyone with questions regarding legal issues should consult the Legal Department.
2.2
Integrity in Business Dealings
We must act with integrity in dealings with all persons inside and outside the Company, including government officials, customers,
suppliers and members of the community. We must follow established standards in procurement, and must treat tenderers fairly and
equally. Detailed procurement procedures apply in each jurisdiction and must be scrupulously followed.
Talisman adheres to antitrust and competition laws that promote and protect free and fair competition. We will not be complicit in price
fixing and / or anti-competitive behaviour.
2.3
Gifts
No person may give to, or accept from, an associate any material or extravagant gift, prize or entertainment benefit. “Material” and
“extravagant” relate to benefits of such value as to appear to an objective observer:
to be excessive;
perceived to constitute a personal enrichment for the recipient; and / or
to be a factor in influencing that person’s behaviour.
120 of 156
Gifts, prizes and entertainment benefits are considered material and extravagant if they exceed the standard that Talisman customarily
offers to its partners and business associates. As a general rule, the exchange or receipt of gifts, entertainment and prizes must be
occasional, modest and consistent with standard industry practice. Any amounts spent on gifts, prizes or entertainment benefits must be
properly recorded in Talisman's accounts.
In issues related to gifts, prizes and entertainment benefits, common sense and good judgment should be used at all times. If in doubt
as to the appropriateness of giving or receiving any gift, entertainment benefit or prize to or from an associate, consultation with a
Supervisor or Manager is recommended.
For additional information on the interpretation of materiality, please refer to the Gift and Entertainment Policy.
2.4
Questionable or Improper Payments
Where commissions, consultants' fees, retainers and similar payments are required to be made and can be justified in the normal
course of business, those payments must clearly commensurate with the services performed and must be properly recorded in
Talisman's accounts. No other payments may be given or received. In particular, we may not, in the context of our relationship with
Talisman, receive any personal payment or compensation from a source other than Talisman.
2.5
Compliance With Accounting Policies
We must comply with the Company's accounting regulations, policies, procedures and related controls. All accounts must properly
describe and accurately reflect the transactions recorded and all assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses must be properly recorded
and fully disclosed in Talisman's books. No secret or unrecorded funds or other assets are to be established or maintained.
In furtherance of our commitment to comply with applicable accounting regulations and corporate governance principles relating to
financial reporting, the Company has instituted procedures to deal with complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls
and auditing matters as well as the confidential anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting
or auditing matters.
2.6
Political Donations
All political contributions made on Talisman's behalf must be authorized by Talisman's Chief Executive Officer in accordance with the
Company's established guidelines.
2.7
Political Activities
Talisman encourages its employees to be active members of their communities and exercise their freedom to participate in lawful
political activities; however, employees choosing to participate in political activities must do so on their personal time and at their own
expense.
2.8
Public Disclosure
Employees and officers responsible for financial and other disclosures must ensure that Talisman makes full, fair, accurate, timely and
understandable disclosure in reports and documents that are filed with or submitted to all regulatory bodies and in all other public
communications.
Employees and officers are responsible for ensuring that information required in such reports and documents is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported on a timely basis, and that any known or perceived weaknesses or breakdowns in the reporting chain are
brought to the attention of their Manager or to a member of Senior Management.
In addition, employees, directors (and third parties to whom this Policy applies) are encouraged to promptly report to a member of
Senior Management any information that they consider could be material to the business and affairs of Talisman.
For additional information, please refer to the Disclosure Policy.
121 of 156
2.9
Compliance with Anti-Bribery Legislation
In keeping with Talisman’s objective of fostering an honest and transparent approach to our business, Talisman has a zero tolerance
approach to bribery and corruption and insists that employees comply with this obligation. This means that Talisman employees must
not give or accept facilitation payments, bribes, kickbacks or other types of improper payment for any reason. Talisman will endeavor as
far as is reasonable to encourage business partners and others to also observe this standard.
Employees should be aware that Talisman is subject to legislation in Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions that prohibit
corrupt practices in dealing with foreign governments. These laws make it an offence to make or offer a payment, gift or other benefit to a
foreign public official in order to induce favourable business treatment, such as obtaining or retaining business or some other advantage
in the course of business.
Violation of this legislation may result in substantial penalties to Talisman and to individuals. Foreign public officials include all people
who perform public duties or functions for a foreign state. This can include:
anyone "acting in an official capacity";
anyone under a delegation of authority from the government to carry out government responsibilities; or
officers and employees of companies that have government ownership or control, such as national oil companies, regardless of whether
the government in question has majority ownership or control.
Talisman, as well as individual employees, officers and directors, must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the requirements of this
legislation are strictly met. No payments, gifts or other benefits are to be given, directly or indirectly, to foreign public officials, political
parties or political candidates for the purpose of influencing government decisions in Talisman's favour or for securing other improper
advantages. Furthermore, no such payments are to be made to agents or other third parties in circumstances where it is likely that part
or all of the payment will be passed on to a foreign public official, political party or political candidate.
3
PERSONAL CONDUCT
We must comply with the standards of ethical behaviour in all aspects of our activities at and for Talisman. This includes our dealings
with people outside the Company as well as our relationships within Talisman. In addition, we must act ethically and with loyalty to the
Company at all times. In particular, we must not:
•
•
misuse Company resources, including computer systems. Individuals should protect the Company's assets and endeavour to ensure
their efficient use. It is acknowledged, however, that minimal use of Company local telephone, electronic mail and internet services for
personal use may occasionally take place, provided that such use is consistent with the Talisman IT Global Security Policy;
engage in Insider Trading. Insider Trading means buying or selling securities in a company when you have knowledge of a material
fact or material change regarding the company that has not been publicly disclosed. This includes knowledge you have about the
business of Talisman and also applies to the shares of other companies you may have confidential information about as a result of
your position with Talisman. Trading with such knowledge, or providing such information to other people, is unethical and illegal.
Talisman's Insider Trading Policy provides additional guidance on materiality and restrictions in this regard; or
•pursue improper personal gain or compensation from our employment activities, Company property, information or position.
3.1
Conflict of Interest
Actual or perceived conflicts of interest between an individual's personal interests and those of the Company may hinder that person's
ability to perform his or her Talisman work effectively and objectively. Accordingly, in general, individuals representing Talisman must
not enter into outside activities, including business interests or other employment, that might interfere with or be perceived to interfere
with their performance at Talisman, or that might otherwise compromise loyalty to the Company.
122 of 156
We must not take opportunities for improper personal gain that are discovered through the use of Company property, information or
position. We should not compete with the Company but should endeavor to advance its legitimate business interests when appropriate
opportunities arise.
Any employee who wishes to serve on a board of directors for a business that is not affiliated with Talisman must obtain the approval of
his or her immediate Supervisor or Manager and of the Executive Officer responsible for legal affairs. Any Executive Officer wishing to
serve on a board of directors for a business that is not affiliated with Talisman must obtain the approval of the President and Chief
Executive Officer. This limitation does not apply to independent directors of Talisman whose service on other companies' boards is
taken into account in the Company's board evaluation process.
Conflicts of interest also arise when an employee, officer or director, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal
benefits as a result of his or her position in the Company. Loans to, or guarantees of obligations of such persons are prohibited.
All conflicts of interest, whether actual, possible or perceived, should be communicated to your immediate Supervisor, Manager or the
Executive Vice President Legal and General Counsel at the earliest possible opportunity.
In addition to the above, the Conflict of Interest in Employment Policy provides additional guidance on other potential conflict of interest
issues.
3.2
Corporate Information
All corporate information is the property of Talisman. Corporate information includes trademarks (e.g., the Talisman logo), patents,
software developments and applications, strategic and operational knowledge and financial information. We are in a position of trust
with respect to such corporate information in the same manner as with any other corporate property. We must take care to protect the
confidentiality of corporate information, including any confidential information received by Talisman from third parties. In particular, we
must not:
use corporate information that has not been disclosed to the public for personal gain;
disclose confidential corporate information other than in the necessary course of business and with appropriate safeguards;
reference material publicly undisclosed corporate information in public speeches, written presentations or other publications. Anyone
who speaks publicly on behalf of Talisman must obtain approval from the appropriate Talisman authority (in most cases, the appropriate
authority would be that employee's Executive Officer) and must remit to the Company any payments or material gifts received; or
participate in Internet chat rooms or newsgroups discussions on matters relating to Talisman’s corporate activities or its securities.
In order to ensure consistency and fair disclosure, all media and investor communications are to be handled by the Corporate
Communications and Investor Relations departments unless otherwise approved by the Senior Officer responsible for Corporate
Communications or the President and Chief Executive Officer.
For additional information, please refer to the Disclosure Policy, the Insider Trading Policy and the Gift and Entertainment Policy.
4 HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT
Our goal is to create a working environment such that we cause no harm to people, and where we minimize our impact on the
environment.
To achieve this we will:
always comply with the law, or Talisman standards, whichever are higher;
operate our business to ensure proactive risk mitigation and continuous improvement;
123 of 156
set goals and targets, and measure performance against them;
hold ourselves and our contractors accountable to meet Talisman standards; and
communicate openly with those who may be affected by our activities.
Safe operations in all company activities is a core value. If operational results and safety ever come into conflict, we all have a
responsibility to choose safety over operational results and Talisman will support that choice.
Workplace health and safety and environmental protection are responsibilities shared by every member of the Talisman workforce. Our
leaders create the capacity for effective individual performance through role clarification, training, and competency verification, and they
are expected to lead by example.
For additional information, please refer to the Health, Safety and Environment Policy and the Protocol for reporting High – Profile HSE
Incidents.
5
EMPLOYEE PRACTICES
Talisman recognizes that it must earn the loyalty that it expects from its employees. Talisman is committed to treating its employees
ethically and fairly. In particular, Talisman strives, in conjunction with local legal requirements, to ensure the following:
no discrimination on the basis of gender, physical or mental disability, age, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious
belief, race, colour, ancestry or place of origin;
consistency with universally accepted standards related to exploitation of child and / or forced or compulsory labour;
freedom of association and collective bargaining;
fair and competitive compensation;
promotion of a harassment-free workplace;
confidentiality of employee records; and
compliance with local employment laws in conjunction with internationally recognized best practices.

with other employees. Talisman expects all contactors to comply with these practices.
For additional information, please refer to the Canadian Privacy Policy and your local policies and procedures.
6
HUMAN RIGHTS
Talisman will conduct its business activities with integrity and will show respect for human dignity and the rights of the individual, based
on the following principles:
6.1 Promoting respect for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
Talisman supports the principles of, and will promote respect for, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We will lead by example,
demonstrating values of tolerance and respect in the conduct of our operations.
6.2 Reviewing potential human rights issues and their relationship to our operations

124 of 156
6.3 Addressing human rights concerns within our sphere of influence
Talisman will promote adherence to and respect for human rights principles in our areas of operation and will not be complicit in human
rights abuses. We will strive to advance best practices with host governments, partners and third parties and we will seek consistency
with our Security Policy and Guidelines, which has been based on the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.
6.4 Respecting the diverse cultures and perspectives of indigenous peoples
Talisman recognizes and respects the diverse cultures and perspectives of indigenous peoples. We will work with indigenous
communities in all countries where we operate to better understand each other’s cultures, perspectives and values. We recognize that
our activities have the potential to overlap with the use of lands by indigenous or tribal peoples and that they should be consulted on
decisions affecting rights to use lands and resources.
7
COMMUNITY RELATIONS
Talisman’s approach to community relationships is based on the principles described in our Global Community Relations Policy
(GCRP). The GCRP recognizes cultural diversity and the potentially differing needs and aspirations of different communities, including
those of indigenous and tribal peoples. The GCRP responds to the expectation that others have of Talisman: that we will assess and
understand the cultural and economic context in which we are working; that we will do no harm; and that we will enhance social and
economic well–being. Please refer to the GCRP. Talisman believes that being a responsible and welcome member of the communities
in which we operate is an essential part of our business strategy. Strong and transparent relationships with communities, based on trust
and respect, allow the Company to effectively and efficiently carry out operations to the mutual benefit of the Company and our
neighbours.

GOLDEN RULES FOR SAFE OPERATIONS
(TLM Safety Culture Global Standard)
Introducing the Talisman
Golden Rules for Safe Operations
Safety is one of our core values, aimed at creating working conditions where we cause no harm to people. In March 2010, we
introduced the 10 Golden Rules for Safe Operations. These rules are to help ensure that everyone working at Talisman goes home
safely every day.
Everyone working at a Talisman site (including our partners and contractors) is expected to know and abide by the Golden Rules. They
have been developed with the full participation of all our operations and have been extensively discussed with both the executive
leadership and our Board.
If a procedure or rule is not workable or clear, you are responsible to stop and seek clarification. It is our expectation that office
employees also learn about and be aware of the Golden Rules, and abide by those rules which apply to their work situation.
We are making great progress in improving our safety performance, and I am grateful to you for your focus on safety to date. The Golden
Rules will help us build on our achievements and help us on our journey to become a top quartile safety performer.
