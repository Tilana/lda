W&T Offshore Announces Second Quarter 2016 Operations and Financial Results along
with Third Quarter and Full Year 2016 Production and Expense Guidance
HOUSTON, Aug. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- W&T Offshore, Inc. (NYSE: WTI) today reported its
second quarter 2016 operations and financial results, as well as its 2016 third quarter and full
year production and expense guidance. Some of the key items and subsequent events include:
On July 25, 2016, we announced the commencement of an exchange offer to qualifying
holders of our 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "8.50% Senior Notes") for new secured
and unsecured notes and common stock that could result in a debt reduction of up to $518
million. We also announced that we have scheduled a Special Meeting of Shareholders for
September 1, 2016.
Production for the second quarter of 2016 averaged 42,864 barrels of oil equivalent ("Boe")
per day (3.9 million Boe for the quarter), 58.6% of which was oil and natural gas liquids
("NGLs").
Revenues for the second quarter of 2016 were $99.7 million, 79% of which was from oil
and NGLs.
Lease operating expenses ("LOE") declined 18.9% for the second quarter of 2016 to $36.6
million compared to $45.1 million in the second quarter of 2015 reflecting our continuing
focus on cost reduction efforts. General and administrative expenses decreased 17.8% for
the second quarter of 2016 to $16.2 million with reduced headcount, reduced contractor
usage and other cost saving measures.
Tracy W. Krohn, W&T Offshore's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "The prolonged
weakness in commodity prices has impacted our cash flow and liquidity, and restricted our ability
to fund current and future drilling activity and debt obligations. As a result, we have tendered an
offer to all qualifying holders of our 8.50% Senior Notes for an exchange to reduce our
outstanding indebtedness, preserve liquidity, reduce interest expense and increase our ability to
comply with our debt covenants and provide necessary funding for capital investments. We
believe that we have a quality asset base with upside opportunities and an outstanding team of
employees working hard to make W&T a success. Our objective is to prudently manage our
balance sheet, assets and expenses, and position the Company to benefit from the eventual
upcycle in the market."
Production, Revenues and Price: For the second quarter of 2016, our oil production was 1.8
million barrels, down 3.9% from the second quarter of 2015. NGL production was 450,900
barrels, up 10.5% from the second quarter of 2015, which includes a 20,714 barrel positive out of
period adjustment related to ethane production (the ethane was sold as a product by the operator
of the gas plant rather than reinjected into the natural gas stream). Natural gas production was
9.7 billion cubic feet ("Bcf") for the second quarter of 2016, down 15.6% from the second quarter
of 2015. Our combined total production was 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent ("MMBoe") in the
second quarter of 2016, down 7.8% from the second quarter of 2015. Production was lower in the
second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015 due to natural production
declines, pipeline outages, field maintenance and the loss of production as a result of the sale of
our Yellow Rose field in October 2015, partially offset by oil production additions from the
development of certain deepwater fields within the last year.
During the quarter we experienced production deferrals attributable to third-party pipeline
outages, operational issues, and maintenance, which occurred at Ship Shoal 349 (Mahogany),
East Cameron 321 A and other locations. We estimate production deferrals reduced our quarterly
production by approximately 0.5 MMBoe during the second quarter of 2016 compared to 0.7
million MMBoe for the second quarter of 2015.
Revenues for the second quarter of 2016 were $99.7 million compared to $149.1 million in the
second quarter of 2015. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to the steep decline in
commodity prices, combined with modestly lower production. Our average realized crude oil
sales price was down $17.52 per barrel, or 30.9%, between the two quarters. NGLs prices
declined 18.9%, or $3.62 per barrel and natural gas prices were lower by $0.69 per Mcf, or
25.2%, from the second quarter of 2015. During the second quarter of 2016, our average realized
sales price for oil was $39.11 per barrel, $15.56 per barrel for NGLs and $2.05 per Mcf for natural
gas. On a combined basis, we sold 42,864 Boe per day at an average realized sales price of
$25.28 per Boe compared to 46,497 Boe per day sold at an average realized sales price of
$34.83 per Boe in the second quarter of 2015.
West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil prices averaged $45.46 per barrel for the second
quarter of 2016 compared to our average realized crude oil price of $39.11 per barrel. WTI is
frequently used to value domestically produced crude oil, and the majority of our oil production is
priced using the spot price for WTI as a base price, then adjusted for the type and quality of crude
oil and other factors. Just like crude oil prices, the differentials for our offshore crude oil have also
experienced significant volatility. For example, the monthly average differentials of WTI crude oil
prices versus Light Louisiana Sweet ("LLS"), Heavy Louisiana Sweet ("HLS") and Poseidon
crude oil prices for the second quarter of 2016 were a positive $2.04 and $1.23, and a negative
$3.68 per barrel, respectively. The majority of our crude oil is priced similar to Poseidon and,
therefore, is experiencing negative differentials. In addition, a few of our crude oil fields have a
negative quality bank adjustment due to crude oil quality which reduces our crude oil price
realizations.
Lease Operating Expenses: LOE, which includes base lease operating expenses, insurance
premiums, workovers, and maintenance expenses on our facilities decreased $8.5 million, or
18.9%, to $36.6 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015.
On a per Boe basis, lease operating expenses decreased to $9.39 per Boe in the second quarter
of 2016, a 12.0% reduction compared to $10.67 per Boe in the second quarter of 2015. On a
component basis, base lease operating expenses decreased $3.8 million, workover expense
decreased $2.3 million, insurance premiums decreased $1.6 million and facilities maintenance
decreased $1.0 million. Base lease operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower costs
from service providers and the sale of the Yellow Rose field in October 2015, partially offset by
increases in expenses related to our new deepwater fields at Dantzler and Big Bend and lower
production handling fees (cost offsets) at our Mississippi Canyon 243 field (Matterhorn). The
decrease in workover costs was primarily due to the sale of the Yellow Rose field and reduced
activities offshore.
Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion ("DD&A"): DD&A, including accretion for
ARO, decreased to $14.74 per Boe for the second quarter of 2016 from $24.42 per Boe for the
second quarter of 2015. On a nominal basis, DD&A decreased to $57.5 million for the second
quarter of 2016 from $103.3 million for the second quarter of 2015 due to a decrease in the
DD&A rate per Boe and lower production volumes. The DD&A rate per Boe decreased primarily
due to the ceiling test write-downs recorded in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 (the second
quarter 2016 ceiling test write-down will not affect the DD&A rate until the third quarter of 2016),
the proceeds from the sale of the Yellow Rose field and the decrease in associated future
development costs. Other factors affecting the DD&A rate are lower net proved reserves, the
general reduction in the costs of goods and services and lower capital expenditures in relation to
DD&A expense, which lowered the full-cost pool subject to DD&A.
Ceiling test write-down of oil and natural gas properties: For the second quarter of 2016, we
recorded a non-cash ceiling test write-down of $104.6 million as the book value of our oil and
natural gas properties exceeded the ceiling test limitation. The write-down resulted from a
significant reduction in the market value of all three commodities we sell. For the second quarter
of 2015, the ceiling test write-down was $252.8 million.
General and Administrative Expenses ("G&A"): G&A decreased $3.5 million, or 17.8% to
$16.2 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. The
decrease was primarily due to decreases in headcount related expenses (salaries, benefits,
contractors, etc.), partially offset by higher legal costs. G&A on a per BOE basis was $4.16 Boe
for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $4.67 per Boe for the second quarter of 2015.
Derivatives: For the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $4.9 million net derivative loss on
derivative contracts for crude oil and natural gas as increased prices for crude oil and natural gas
resulted in reversal of previously recorded gains. For the second quarter of 2015, there was a
$1.1 million net derivative loss recorded. A report providing our commodity derivative positions is
posted to our website.
Income Tax Benefit: Our income tax benefit for the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 was $35.7
million and $44.1 million, respectively, with the change attributable primarily to changes in the
pre-tax loss and changes in the valuation allowance recorded for the respective periods. Our
annualized effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 was 22.8% and 14.5%,
respectively, and differs from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to recording and
adjusting a valuation allowance related to federal and state deferred tax assets. During the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded valuation allowances of $22.3 million and
$62.9 million, respectively, related to federal and state deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets
are recorded related to net operating losses and temporary differences between the book and tax
basis of assets and liabilities expected to generate tax deductions in future periods. The
realization of these assets depends on recognition of sufficient future taxable income in specific
tax jurisdictions in which those temporary differences or net operating losses are deductible. In
assessing the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it
is more likely than not that some portion or all of them will not be realized.
Income Tax Receivable: As of June 30, 2016, we recorded a current income tax receivable of
$5.6 million and non-current income tax receivables of $52.1 million. For the current income tax
receivable, the amount is comprised principally of a net operating loss ("NOL") claim for 2015
carried back to 2005 filed on Form 1139, Corporation Application for Tentative Refund. For the
net amount classified as non-current income tax receivables, our NOL claims for the years 2012,
2013 and 2014 were carried back to the years 2003, 2004, 2007, 2010 and 2011 filed on Form
1120X, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return. These carryback claims are made pursuant to
Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 172(f) which permits certain platform dismantlement, well
abandonment and site clearance costs to be carried back 10 years. The refund claims filed on
Form 1120X will require a review by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation and are
accordingly classified as non-current.
Net Loss & Loss Per Share: We reported a net loss for the second quarter of 2016 of ($120.9)
million, or ($1.58) per common share, compared to net loss of ($260.4) million, or ($3.43) per
common share, during the same period in 2015. Excluding special items (including the ceiling
test write-down of oil and natural gas properties, write off of debt issuance and other non-
operating costs and an unrealized commodity derivative loss, net of applicable federal income
tax at the effective tax rate for the periods presented), our net loss for the second quarter of 2016
was ($35.8) million, or ($0.47) per common share, compared to second quarter 2015 net loss of
($40.9) million, or ($0.54) per common share. Operating results for the second quarter of 2016,
excluding special items, were down primarily due to a $49.4 million decrease in revenues
primarily driven by a 27.4% decline in our realized prices, partially offset by an $11.1 million
decrease in operating costs and a $45.8 million decrease in DD&A.
See the "Reconciliation of Net Loss to Net Loss Excluding Special Items" and related earnings
per share, excluding special items in the table under "Non-GAAP Information" at the end of this
news release for a description of the special items.
Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA and Liquidity: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted
EBITDA margin are non-GAAP measures and are defined in the "Non-GAAP Financial
Measures" section at the end of this news release.
Net cash used in operating activities for the first six months of 2016 was $11.3 million compared
to net cash provided by operating activities of $80.9 million for the same period in 2015.
Cash flows from operating activities, before changes in working capital and asset retirement
obligations ("ARO") settlements and adjusted for income taxes (most all of which are non-cash),
were $6.5 million in the first six months of 2016, compared to $87.6 million generated over the
same period in 2015. Cash flows declined as revenues were $99.6 million lower in the 2016
period compared to the 2015 period while operating expenses were $24.1 million lower over the
same time period. Asset retirement obligation settlements totaled $25.2 million in the first six
months of 2016.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 was $40.8 million, down from $79.7 million
generated over the same period in 2015. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin was 41% in the 2016
period compared to 53% in the 2015 period.
At June 30, 2016, we had a cash balance of $171.8 million and had $1.1 million of availability
under our revolving bank credit facility. Also at June 30, 2016, borrowings outstanding under the
revolving bank credit facility were in conformity with the borrowing base limitation.
2016 Capital Expenditures Update: Our capital expenditures on an accrual basis for the first six
months of 2016 were $17.7 million ($51.8 million on a cash basis) compared to $151.0 million
($201.8 million on a cash basis) for the first six months of 2015. In 2016, the substantial majority
of our capital expenditures were directed at completion activities of the Ewing Bank 954 A-8 well
in the amount of $10.0 million. The remainder of the expenditures was associated with
recompletions, other development activities and seismic.
Our capital expenditure budget for 2016 remains set at a level well below prior year levels. Our
plug and abandonment activities for 2016 are currently estimated to total $76 million ($91.3
million over the next twelve months) and are expected to be funded with cash on hand and cash
flow from operating activities.
BOEM Matters: In February and March, 2016, the Company received several orders from the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ("BOEM") demanding that the Company provide
additional financial security on certain Federal offshore oil and gas leases, rights of way ("ROW")
and rights of use and easement ("RUE"). The outstanding orders total $260.8 million. We have
filed appeals with the Interior Board of Land Appeals ("IBLA") regarding these orders. The IBLA,
acknowledging that the BOEM and the Company were seeking to resolve the BOEM orders
through settlement discussions, stayed the effectiveness of the orders until June 30, 2016.
Because settlement discussions were ongoing, on June 30, 2016, the IBLA again stayed the
effectiveness of the orders until August 31, 2016. We continue to have discussions with BOEM
regarding these matters.
In July 2016, the BOEM issued Notice to Lessee ("NTL") No. 2016-N01, effective September 12,
2016, related to obligations for decommissioning activities on the Outer Continental Shelf
("OCS"), to clarify the procedures and guidelines that BOEM Regional Directors use to determine
if and when additional security may be required for OCS leases, ROW, and RUE. This NTL
supersedes and replaces NTL No. 2008-N07. Among other things, the NTL eliminates the
"waiver exemption" currently allowed by the BOEM, whereby lessees on the OCS meeting
certain financial strength and reliability criteria are exempted from posting bonds or other
acceptable financial assurances for such lessee's decommissioning obligations. Under the new
NTL, qualifying operators may self-insure for only an amount that is no more than 10% of their
tangible net worth. In addition, the NTL implements a phase-in period for establishing
compliance with additional security obligations for certain properties, whereby lessees may seek
compliance with its additional security requirements under a "tailored plan" that is approved by
the BOEM and would require securing phased in compliance in three approximately equal
installments during a one-year period from the date of the BOEM approval of the tailored plan.
Additional security for sole liability properties (those leases, ROWs or RUEs where there are no
co-lessees or other grant holders or prior interest holders who may be liable to the BOEM) may
not be phased in.
Exchange Offer: On July 25, 2016, we announced commencement of an exchange offer and
consent solicitation to certain eligible holders of our outstanding 8.50% Senior Notes for up to (i)
62,100,000 shares of common stock of the Company, (ii) $202.5 million aggregate principal

aggregate principal amount of its new Senior PIK Toggle Notes due 2021. Concurrently with the
exchange offer, the Company is soliciting consents from holders of the 8.50% Senior Notes to
adopt certain proposed amendments to the indenture under which the 8.50% Senior Notes were
issued.
The exchange offer, which expires on September 1, 2016 subject to extension, is conditioned on
the satisfaction or waiver of certain additional conditions, including, among other things, (i)
stockholder approval related to the increase in the number of authorized shares of the

minimum of 95%, or $855.0 million, of the 8.50% Senior Notes being tendered as of the
expiration date together with requisite consents having been obtained, which tender condition
may be waived, in the Company's discretion, provided 85%, or $765.0 million, of the 8.50%
Senior Notes are tendered as of the expiration date. To the extent less than 90% in principal
amount of the outstanding 8.50% Senior Notes are validly tendered and accepted for exchange,
the new unsecured notes will instead be issued as secured by third-priority liens on substantially
all of the Company's and its subsidiary guarantors' assets that secure the Company's revolving

(1) MMcfe and MBoe are determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude
oil, condensate or NGLs (totals may not compute due to rounding).  The conversion ratio does
not assume price equivalency and the price on an equivalent basis for oil, NGLs and natural gas
may differ significantly.
(2) Variance percentages are calculated using rounded figures and may result in slightly
different figures for comparable data.

Certain financial information included in our financial results are not measures of financial
performance recognized by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or
GAAP.  These non-GAAP financial measures are "Net Income Excluding Special Items,"
"EBITDA" and "Adjusted EBITDA."   Our management uses these non-GAAP financial
measures in its analysis of our performance.   These disclosures may not be viewed as a
substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP and are not necessarily comparable
to non-GAAP performance measures which may be reported by other companies.
Reconciliation of Net Loss to Net Loss Excluding Special Items
"Net Loss Excluding Special Items" does not include the unrealized commodity derivative loss,
write-off of debt issuance and other non-operating costs, a contingent assessment provision,
ceiling test write-down of oil and natural gas properties and associated tax effects.  Net Loss
excluding special items is presented because the timing and amount of these items cannot be
reasonably estimated and affect the comparability of operating results from period to period, and
current periods to prior periods.

Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA
$(0.47)

$(1.50)
We define EBITDA as net income (loss) plus income tax expense (benefit), net interest expense,
depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion and ceiling test write-down of oil and natural
gas properties. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the unrealized commodity derivative loss, write off of
debt issuance and other non-operating costs and a contingent assessment provision.  We
believe the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information regarding
our ability to service debt and to fund capital expenditures.  We believe this presentation is
relevant and useful because it helps our investors understand our operating performance and
makes it easier to compare our results with those of other companies that have different
financing, capital and tax structures.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered
in isolation from or as a substitute for net income (loss), as an indication of operating
performance or cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity.  EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA measures reported by other companies.  In addition, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do
not represent funds available for discretionary use. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents the ratio
of Adjusted EBITDA to total revenues.
The following table presents a reconciliation of our consolidated net loss to consolidated
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA along with our Adjusted EBITDA margin.
