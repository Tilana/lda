review, the Government had engaged in and would continue inclusive and transparent 
consultations, including with civil society.

transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process and noted that certain issues and </p>


<p>concerns related to the conduct and outcome of the elections were being addressed. The 
Government also emphasized the need to work towards rebuilding national unity and 
achieving national reconciliation post elections. 
</p>
<p>8. On cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms, the Government 
stated that it was preparing to receive the Special Rapporteur on the right to food in

of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health. The delegation clarified developments related to the ratification by Malaysia of

<p>64. In responding to the comments and questions, the Government reaffirmed its

legislative and other possible impediments to the enjoyment of the full range of human 
rights. The Government had initiated an extensive review of existing laws and regulations, 
particularly on civil and political rights, beginning in 2009, which saw, inter alia, the 
repealing of the Internal Security Act 1960 and the promulgation of the Peaceful Assembly 
Act 2012 (PAA), which enhanced the implementation of the constitutional right to 
assemble peaceably and without arms. 
</p>
<p>65. Malaysia illustrated the implementation of PAA with reference to two major rallies 
where the police had adhered fully to the spirit of PAA by facilitating the rallies with 
effective crowd control to prevent untoward incidents. 
</p>
<p>66. The delegation further discussed the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of religion 
in Malaysia which is subject to the constitutional restrictions pertaining to the propagation 
of other religions or beliefs on Muslims and the preservation of public order and national 
security. Malaysia explained the recent Court of Appeal decision dated 14 October 2013 on 
the case concerning the Herald &#8211; the Catholic weekly: the Court decided clearly that the 
Minister&#8217;s decision to ban the use of the word &#8220;ALLAH&#8221; in the Malay version of the 
Herald is constitutional and legal. The Court ruled that the Minister&#8217;s decision was based on 
legitimate grounds of public safety and public order as such action raised religious 
sensitivities in Malaysia. The Minister&#8217;s decision as a preventive measure to ensure public 
safety and public order in Malaysia is legal and also in compliance with the laws to control 
and restrict the propagation of religious doctrine or belief among Muslims. 
</p>
<p>67. Malaysia also explained its initiatives concerning in-depth research on the death 
penalty. It further clarified that the proposed National Harmony Bill was being deliberated </p>


<p>in consultation with civil society organizations and international experts. In that regard, the 
Sedition Act, laws of various jurisdictions and the complex and unique position of 
Malaysia, including on the position of the King and Malay Rulers, and threats to national 
security and public order were also taken into consideration. 
</p>
<p>68. Malaysia emphasized that the revitalised Prevention of Crime Act 1959 (POCA) 
sought to deal with organized crime and serious crimes. Its commitment to uphold human 
rights norms and standards was reflected by the inclusion of safeguards in POCA, 
including: (a) the requirement for a minister to submit an annual report to Parliament on all 
activities related to detention orders; (b) the requirement for Parliament to revisit the 
provision on detention orders every five years; (c) the possibility of challenging decisions 
by the Crime Prevention Board in the High Court; and (d) judicial review of detention 
concerning any issue of non-compliance with any procedural requirement by the Crime 
Prevention Board. 
</p>
<p>69. Malaysia reiterated its commitment not to reintroduce broad powers of preventive 
detention and refuted the allegation that the POCA amendments marked the return of the 
repealed Internal Security Act 1960. 
</p>
<p>70. The delegation elaborated on measures taken to better protect migrant workers, 
including a special registration exercise that would run for three months from 21 October 
2013 with a view to addressing grievances by migrant workers or employers cheated by 
irresponsible recruitment agencies. 
</p>
<p>71. Malaysia continued to view trafficking in persons seriously and had sought to 
improve protection for victims, including through closer collaboration with NGOs. The 
Government had announced the launch of the first NGO-led shelter, to be operational in 
mid-November 2013, funded by the Government. 
</p>
<p>72. Malaysia remained committed to addressing the issue of custodial deaths, including 
through awareness-raising programmes on human rights for police personnel. The 
establishment of the Enforcement Agency Integrity Commission reflected the readiness of 
the Government to address violations of work ethics and misconduct by law enforcement 
agencies, including the police. 
</p>
<p>73. Malaysia emphasized that Islam and Islamic administration of justice under the 
Syariah had a long history in Malaysia. The status of Islam as the religion of the Federation 
and the freedom to practice religions other than Islam was also enshrined in the 
Constitution.  
</p>
<p>74. In Malaysia, matters pertaining to Islam, including codification of Syariah laws and 
procedures and its administration, fell under the jurisdiction of the respective States. 
</p><p>75. The National Fatwa Consultative Council had issued a decision in 1984, updated in 
1996, determining the Sunni school of thought to be adhered to by Malaysian Muslims. 
That decision was endorsed by State Fatwa Councils and later gazetted. 
</p>
<p>76. The allegation that Islamic Family Law in Malaysia discriminated against Muslim 
women on marriage issues was unfounded. However, the Government acknowledged that 
there was room for improvement in the implementation of the law by the Syariah courts. 
</p>
<p>77. The delegation explained that Malaysia had recently implemented a national 
minimum wage policy which would benefit all workers in all sectors and regions. 
Additionally, Malaysia continued to guarantee equal access to social justice for foreign 
workers. 
</p>
<p>78. Malaysia remains committed to enhance worker protection including through: (a) 
enhancing maternity protection; (b) mandatory requirement for payment of wages into bank </p>


<p>accounts; (c) increasing minimum retirement age to 60 years; and (d) implementation of 
bilateral arrangements with labour source countries. 
</p>
<p>79. Costa Rica encouraged consideration of a death penalty moratorium with a view to 
abolition. 
</p>

CRPD and withdrawal of some reservations to CEDAW. The non-discrimination principle 
should be universally applied.

appropriation of indigenous land; and limits to freedom of expression and opinion. 
</p>
<p>86. Djibouti appreciated the national human rights institution&#8217;s attainment of &#8220;A&#8221; status.

workers, and to combating human trafficking and transnational organized crime. 
</p>
<p>88. Egypt, noting obstacles to the protection of persons with disabilities and combating 
human trafficking, asked how Malaysia intended to address those two issues. 
</p>
<p>89. Finland welcomed ratification of CRPD and the withdrawal of some of its 
reservations to the human rights treaties to which it was a party. It requested information on

Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (CAT), and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial

<p>128. The Russian Federation valued the Government&#8217;s efforts to ensure basic human 
rights and freedoms. It recognized the encouragement to inter-confessional tolerance and 
inter-ethnic dialogue. 
</p>
<p>129. Sri Lanka welcomed the achievement of the MDG target on poverty reduction, the 
accession to OP-CRC-SC and OP-CRC-AC, the priority given to women&#8217;s empowerment 
and the commitment to quality and affordable education. </p>


<p>130. The delegation responded to questions and comments raised in the preceding 
interactive dialogue by reiterating that Orang Asli rights to land, beliefs, culture and non-
discrimination were clearly provided for by the Federal Constitution and the Aboriginal 
People&#8217;s Act 1954. 
</p>
<p>131. The Government clarified that a task force comprising senior officials had been 
established to review and formulate the necessary strategy regarding the issue of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; land rights, pursuant to the national inquiry into the land rights of indigenous 
peoples in Malaysia undertaken by SUHAKAM. 
</p>
<p>132. The Government continued to hold consultations with State authorities, other 
relevant agencies and indigenous groups on land issues. Progress had also been made in the 
survey and gazetting exercise for Orang Asli land. 
</p>
<p>133. Currently, the Government along with UNDP and UNICEF was collaborating on a 
study and review of the socioeconomic status of Orang Asli in peninsular Malaysia for the 
formulation of an Orang Asli national development plan.  
</p>
<p>134. Sarawak State, with a large indigenous population comprising 27 ethnic groups, had 
for nearly two centuries had laws which recognized and protected indigenous rights to land. 
Official records confirm Sarawak has about 1.5 million hectares of native customary rights 
(NCR) land. A survey to demarcate boundaries and guarantee security of tenure of NCR 
land was ongoing under the Government Transformation Programme. 
</p>
<p>135. The current development agenda, involving the building of hydroelectric facilities, 
necessitated the use of NCR land. Where rights to NCR land were affected, the State 
Government and its utility company, Sarawak Energy Berhad: (a) adopted best 
international practices in engagement and consultation with indigenous peoples, which 
conformed with acceptable norms and standards, including principles embodied in the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; and (b) provided affected 
indigenous communities with a  comprehensive compensation package, which assured them 
an immediate and substantial improvement in living standards, better access to basic human 
rights to education and health care, and better economic opportunities, whilst preserving 
their cultural identities and traditions. 
</p>
<p>136. Implementation of the resettlement action plan and compensation package for those 
affected by the Murum Hydro-electric Project exemplified a process that recognized the 
rights and well-being of the indigenous people. 
</p>
<p>137. In recognizing the challenges facing indigenous communities in Malaysia, the 
Government maintained that those communities must be afforded choice and be free to 
decide whether they wished to join mainstream society or not. 
</p><p>138. Malaysia continued to recognize women as important human capital. As an 
affirmative action, the Tenth Malaysia Plan (2011&#8211;2015) gave prominence to increasing 
women&#8217;s participation in the labour force and decision-making positions, provision of 
support in challenging circumstances and eliminating all forms of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>139. Steps taken to increase women&#8217;s participation in the labour force included incentives 
for the establishment of childcare centres, extension of fully paid maternity leave, 
employers&#8217; double tax deduction to retrain and employ women after a career break and 
enactment of the (Part-Time Employees) Regulation 2010. 
</p><p>140. Owing to the success of the &#8220;Policy of At Least 30% Women in Decision Making 
Positions in the Public Sector&#8221;, a similar policy for the corporate sector had been introduced 
in 2011. In addition, the Women Directors Programme had been implemented and the 
Women Directors Registry established. </p>


<p>141. In empowering women economically, Malaysia had implemented microcredit 
schemes to encourage uptake of micro-enterprise opportunities to low-income individuals 
in rural and urban areas.  
</p>
<p>142. The Child Act was currently being reviewed to enhance the well-being of children. 
In addition, juvenile restorative justice models were studied, while initiatives were taken to 
protect children from cyberthreats. 
</p>
<p>143. Malaysia highlighted that the Persons with Disabilities Act was a non-punitive law. 
However, non-compliance with the Act could be addressed through relevant legislation, 
namely the Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code and uniform building by-laws. 
Additionally, the existing Policy and Plans of Action for Persons with Disabilities was 
currently being reviewed in line with the regional aspiration towards the Asia and Pacific 
Decade for Persons with Disabilities, 2013&#8211;2022, and the Incheon Strategy to &#8220;Make the 
Right Real&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>144. A technical committee chaired by the Ministry of Women, Family and Community 
Development would be started to review all the existing reservations under CEDAW, CRC 
and CRPD, and optional protocols thereto that had not been ratified by Malaysia.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>145. The review concluded with Malaysia reiterating its commitment to and belief in 
UPR and its follow-up. The delegation stressed that Malaysia had approached the exercise 
seriously and would give full consideration to all comments and recommendations made 
during the review. 
</p>
