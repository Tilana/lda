<p><b>  22</b>/&#8230;<b> Panel on the human rights of children of parents sentenced to  
 the death penalty or executed 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other relevant international 
human rights instruments,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the purposes and principles of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, in particular its articles 2, 3, 9, and 20, and the obligations of State parties thereto,  
</p>
<p><i>Mindful </i>of all forms through which a child can be separated from his or her parents 
against their will, in particular when the separation results from any action initiated by a 
State, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the day of general discussion on children of incarcerated parents, held by 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child on 30 September 2011, and taking note with 
interest of the outcomes thereof,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 19/37 of 23 March 2012 on the rights of 
the child,  
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>at the negative impact of the imposition and carrying out of the 
death penalty on the human rights of children of parents sentenced to the death penalty or 
executed, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Acknowledges</i> the negative impact of a parent&#8217;s death sentence and his or her 
execution on his or her children, and urges States to provide those children with the 
protection and assistance they may require; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Calls upon</i> States to provide those children or, where appropriate, giving due 
consideration to the best interests of the child, another member of the family, with access to 
their parents and to all relevant information about the situation of their parents;  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Decides</i> to convene, at its twenty-fourth session, a panel discussion on the 
human rights of children of parents sentenced to the death penalty or executed, with a 
particular focus on the ways and means to ensure the full enjoyment of their rights; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Requests </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to organize the panel discussion and to liaise with States, relevant United Nations 
bodies, agencies, treaty bodies, special procedures and regional human rights mechanisms, 
as well as with civil society, including non-governmental organizations, and national 
human rights institutions, with a view to ensuring their contribution to the panel discussion; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a report on the 
outcome of the panel discussion in the form of a summary, and to present it to the Human 
Rights Council at its twenty-fifth session; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Decides</i> that the yearly supplement to the quinquennial report of the 
Secretary-General on the question of the death penalty, mandated by Human Rights 
Council decision 18/117 of 28 September 2011, will continue to inform on this matter.
