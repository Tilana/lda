Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements and information in this Form 10-Q may constitute “forward-looking statements.”  The words
“believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “intend,” “foresee,” “should,” “would,” “could” or other similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking statements, which are generally not historical in nature.  These forward-looking
statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect
on us.  While management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made, there
can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we anticipate.  All comments concerning
our expectations for future operating results are based on our forecasts for our existing operations and do not include
the potential impact of any future acquisitions.  Our forward-looking statements involve significant risks and
uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ
materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections.  Important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,
those summarized below:

JP ENERGY PARTNERS LP
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1. Business and Basis of Presentation
Business.  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein contain the results of JP
Energy Partners LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and its subsidiaries. All expressions of the “Partnership,” “JPE,”
“us,” “we,” “our,” and all similar expressions are references to JP Energy Partners LP and our consolidated, wholly-
owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context requires otherwise. We were formed in May 2010
by members of management and were further capitalized in June 2011 by ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC (“ArcLight”)
to own, operate, develop and acquire a diversified portfolio of midstream energy assets. We completed our initial
public offering in October 2014. Our operations currently consist of three business segments: (i) crude oil pipelines and
storage, (ii) refined products terminals and storage and (iii) NGL distribution and sales, which together provide
midstream infrastructure solutions for the growing supply of crude oil, refined products and NGLs, in the United States.
JP Energy GP II LLC (“GP II”) is our general partner.
Basis of Presentation.  Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial
information. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.
The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results
expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016. In our opinion, the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements include all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals necessary for fair
statement of the financial position and results of operations for such interim periods in accordance with GAAP.
Although we believe the disclosures in these financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in
accordance with GAAP have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. These unaudited
condensed consolidated interim financial statements and the notes thereto should be read in conjunction with our
audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016.
Use of Estimates.  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
GAAP, which includes the use of estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities that exist at the date of the
condensed consolidated financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management’s available
knowledge of current and expected future events, actual results could be different from those estimates.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Fair value measurement.  We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. We determine fair value based on assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering
market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between
observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:
Level 1 Inputs—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting
entity at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs—Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
9
Table of Contents
Level 3 Inputs—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable
inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or
liability at measurement date.
The fair value of our derivatives (see Note 7) was estimated using industry standard valuation models using market-
based observable inputs, including commodity pricing and interest rate curves (Level 2). The fair value of our
contingent liabilities was determined using the discounted future estimated cash payments based on inputs that are
not observable in the market (Level 3). We do not have any other assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis.
Our other financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt. The fair value of
long-term debt approximates the carrying value as the underlying instruments are at rates similar to current rates
offered to us for debt with the same remaining maturities.
Accounts Receivable.  Accounts receivable are reported net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for
doubtful accounts is based on specific identification and expectation of collecting considering historical collection
results. Account balances considered to be uncollectible are recorded to the allowance for doubtful accounts and
charged to bad debt expense, which is included in general and administrative expenses in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $887,000 and $1,217,000 as of June
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred and/or services have been rendered, the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable, and
collectability is reasonably assured.
Revenue-related taxes collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities, principally sales taxes, are
presented on a net basis within the consolidated statements of operations.
Crude Oil Pipelines and Storage. The crude oil pipelines and storage segment mainly generates revenues through
crude oil sales and pipeline transportation and storage fees. We enter into outright purchase and sale contracts as well
as buy/sell contracts with counterparties, under which contracts we gather and transport different types of crude oil and
eventually sell the crude oil to either the same counterparty or different counterparties. We account for such revenue
arrangements on a gross basis. Occasionally, we enter into crude oil inventory exchange arrangements with the same
counterparty for which the purchase and sale of inventory are considered in contemplation of each other. Revenues
from such inventory exchange arrangements are recorded on a net basis. Revenues for crude oil pipeline
transportation services are recognized upon delivery of the product and when payment has either been received or
collection is reasonably assured. For certain crude oil pipeline transportation arrangements, we enter into purchase
and sale contracts with counterparties instead of pipeline transportation agreements. In such cases, we assess the
indicators associated with agent and principal considerations for each arrangement to determine whether revenue
should be recorded on a gross basis versus net basis. In addition, we also provide crude oil trucking transportation
services to third party customers.
Refined Products Terminals and Storage. We generate fee-based revenues for terminal and storage services with
longstanding customers under contracts that, consistent with industry practice, typically contain evergreen provisions
after an initial term of six months to two years. Such fee-based revenues are recognized when services are provided
upon delivery of the products to customers. Revenues are also generated by selling excess refined products that result
from blending, additization and inventory control processes.
NGL Distribution and Sales. Revenues from the NGL distribution and sales segment are mainly generated from NGL
and refined product sales, sales of the related parts and equipment and through gathering and transportation fees.
Comprehensive Loss. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, comprehensive loss was equal to
net loss.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements.
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting.  This standard makes several modifications to Topic 718 related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer
tax withholding on share-based compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or
deficiencies. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-
based awards. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
although early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact this standard will have on our
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842). Lessees will need to recognize almost all
leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. It will be critical to identify leases embedded
in a contract to avoid misstating the lessee’s balance sheet. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual
model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are
largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. ASU 2016-02 is effective
for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those
fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the potential impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities. ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized in net income; simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair
values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; eliminates the requirement for public business
entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be
disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; requires public business entities
to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; requires an
entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability
resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair
value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; requires separate presentation of financial
assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial assets on the balance sheet or the
accompanying notes to the financial statements and clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation
allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity’s other deferred
tax assets. ASU 2016-01 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017
and interim periods within those fiscal years. This standard does not allow for early adoption except related to credit
risk adjustment in other comprehensive income. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
ASU 2015-11 changes the measurement principle for inventory measured using any method other than LIFO or the
retail inventory method from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value.  Net realizable value
is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of
completion, disposal and transportation.  ASU 2015-11 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016.  Early adoption of this ASU is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the potential impact this
standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 supersedes
the existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues
when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an
entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core
principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than
are required under existing GAAP. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December
15, 2016 using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the
11
Table of Contents
application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a
retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption
(which includes additional footnote disclosures). In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Update
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for public and
non-public entities reporting under U.S. GAAP for one year. The FASB also decided to permit entities to early adopt
the standard but adoption is not permitted earlier than the original effective date for public entities. In March 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) – Principal versus Agent
Considerations (Reporting Gross versus Net), which is intended to provide clarity to principal versus agent
considerations when it comes to revenue recognition related to ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) – Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing, which provides clarity to a few items for identifying performance obligations and licensing where the board
had received feedback on the issuance of ASU 2014-09. Neither ASU 2016-08 nor 2016-10 is effective until ASU
2014-09 becomes effective. We are currently evaluating the potential impact this standard will have on our
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
3. Discontinued Operations
On February 1, 2016, we sold certain trucking and marketing assets in the Mid-Continent area (the “Mid-Continent
Business”) to JP Development, simultaneous with JP Development’s sale of its GSPP pipeline assets to a third party
buyer. The sales price related to the Mid-Continent Business was $9,685,000, in cash, which included certain
adjustments related to inventory and other working capital items. As of December 31, 2015, the Mid-Continent
Business met all the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale in accordance with ASC 360; therefore, we
classified all the related assets and liabilities as held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheet at that
date. The operating results of the Mid-Continent Business have been classified as discontinued operations for all
periods presented in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. We combined the cash flows from the Mid-
Continent Business with the cash flows from continuing operations for all periods presented in the condensed
consolidated statements of cash flows. The Mid-Continent Business will not generate any continuing cash flows
subsequent to the date of disposition. Prior to the classification as discontinued operations, we reported the Mid-
Continent Business in our crude oil pipelines and storage segment. The following table summarizes selected financial
information related to the Mid-Continent Business’ operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015.

4. Net Income per Unit
Net income per unit applicable to limited partner common units and to limited partner subordinated units is computed
by dividing the respective limited partners’ interest in net income for the periods subsequent to the IPO by the
weighted-average number of common units and subordinated units outstanding for the period. Income per limited
partner unit is calculated in accordance with the two-class method for determining income per unit for master limited
partnerships (“MLPs”) when incentive distribution rights (“IDRs”) and other participating securities are present. The
two-class method requires that income per limited partner unit be calculated as if all earnings for the period were
distributed as cash, and allocated by applying the provisions of the partnership agreement, and requires a separate
calculation for each quarter and year-to-date period. Under the two-class method, any excess of distributions declared
over net income is allocated to the partners based on their respective sharing of income specified in the partnership
agreement. Diluted net income per unit includes the effects of potentially dilutive units on our common units, consisting
of unvested phantom units. Basic and diluted net income per unit applicable to limited partners holding subordinated
units are the same because there are no potentially dilutive subordinated units outstanding.  For the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, diluted loss per unit was equal to basic loss per unit because the outstanding phantom
units of 617,317 and 500,547, respectively, were antidilutive.
On July 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of our general partner declared a cash distribution for the second quarter of
2016 of $0.325 per common unit and subordinated unit. The distribution will be paid on August 12, 2016 to unitholders
of record as of August 5, 2016.

Bank of America Credit Agreement.  We have a $275,000,000 revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. (the
“BOA Credit Agreement”) that matures on February 12, 2019. As of June 30, 2016, the unused portion of our revolving
credit facility was $102,250,000. Issued and outstanding letters of credit, which reduced available borrowings under
the BOA Credit Agreement, totaled $14,750,000 at June 30, 2016. The BOA Credit Agreement contains various
restrictive covenants and compliance requirements. We were in compliance with all covenants as of June 30, 2016.
7. Derivative Instruments
We are exposed to certain market risks related to the volatility of commodity prices and changes in interest rates.  To
monitor and manage these market risks, we have established comprehensive risk management policies and
procedures. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than hedging commodity price risk and
interest rate risk. We do not speculate using derivative instruments.
Commodity Price Risk. Our normal business activities expose us to risks associated with changes in the market price
of crude oil, propane and refined products, among other commodities. Management believes it is prudent to limit our
exposure to these risks, which include our (i) propane purchases, (ii) pre-existing or anticipated physical crude oil and
refined product sales and (iii) certain crude oil held in inventory.  To meet this objective, we use a combination of fixed
price swap and forward contracts. At times, we may also terminate or unwind hedges or portions of hedges in order to
meet cash flow objectives or when the expected future volumes do not support the level of hedges. Our forward
contracts that qualify for the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (“NPNS”) exception under GAAP are recognized when the
underlying physical transaction is delivered.  While these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments
under ASC 815, they are not recorded at fair value, but on an accrual basis of accounting. If it is determined that a
transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception, the fair value of the related contract is recorded
on the balance sheet and immediately recognized through earnings.
In the first quarter of 2015, we entered into several long-term fixed price forward sale contracts related to certain barrels
of crude oil we had on hand as of December 31, 2014, effectively locking these barrels at higher sales
16
Table of Contents
prices in future periods.  These forward sale contracts were intended to mitigate the effect of any decline in crude oil
prices, but did not qualify for NPNS accounting under GAAP, because we normally buy and sell crude oil inventory
either within the same month or in the following month. As a result, these longer than normal term forward sale
contracts were given mark-to-market accounting treatment. As these forward sale contracts related to the marketing
assets in our Mid-Continent Business (see Note 3), the fair values of the forward contracts were classified as held for
sale in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of the Mid-Continent forward
contracts was $630,000 and was included in current liabilities of discontinued operations held for sale in the
condensed consolidated balance sheets.
The following table summarizes the net notional volume purchases (sales) of our outstanding commodity-related
derivatives, excluding those derivatives that qualified for the NPNS exception as of June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, none of which were designated as hedges for accounting purposes.

Interest Rate Risk. We are exposed to variable interest rate risk as a result of variable-rate borrowings under our
revolving credit facilities. We entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting
from interest rate risk on a portion of our debt with a variable-rate component. These swaps effectively change the
variable-rate cash flow exposure on the debt obligations to fixed rates. Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, we
receive variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments, thereby creating the equivalent of fixed-
rate debt for the portion of the debt that is swapped.  As of June 30, 2016, our outstanding interest rate swap contracts
contained a notional amount of $100,000,000 with maturity dates ranging from July 2016 to January 2019. There were
no outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2015.
Credit Risk. By using derivative instruments to economically hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices and
interest rates, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under
the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us,
which creates credit risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we owe the counterparty and,
therefore, we do not possess credit risk. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into
transactions with high quality counterparties. We have entered into master netting agreements, including Master
International Swap Dealers Association (“ISDA”) Agreements, which allow for netting of contract receivables and
payables in the event of default by either party.
Fair Value of Derivative Instruments. We measure derivative instruments at fair value using the income approach,
which discounts the future net cash settlements expected under the derivative contracts to a present value. These
valuations primarily utilize indirectly observable (“level 2”) inputs, including contractual terms, commodity prices,
interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals. None of our derivative contracts are
17

designated as hedging instruments. The following table summarizes the fair values of our derivative contracts included

9. Unit-Based Compensation
Long-Term Incentive Plan and Phantom Units.  The 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) for our employees,
directors and consultants authorizes grants of up to 3,642,700 common units in the aggregate.  Our phantom units
issued under our LTIP are primarily composed of two types of grants: (1) service condition grants with vesting over
three years in equal annual installments; and (2) service condition grants with cliff vesting on April 1,
2018.  Distributions related to these unvested phantom units are paid concurrent with our distribution for common units.
The fair value of our phantom units issued under our LTIP is determined by utilizing the market value of our common
units on the respective grant date.
The following table presents phantom units activity for the six months ended June 30, 2016:

compensation expense.
Restricted (Non-Vested) Common and Subordinated Units.  All of our restricted Class B common units were granted
prior to our IPO in October 2014, and were converted into restricted common units and restricted subordinated units
upon the IPO at certain conversion ratios.

Total unit-based compensation expenses related to our phantom units and restricted (non-vested) common and
subordinated units were $383,000 and $97,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and
$942,000 and $503,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
10. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Matters. We are involved in legal proceedings and litigation in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of
management, the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Environmental Matters. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection
of the environment. Such environmental laws and regulations impose numerous obligations, including the acquisition
of permits to conduct regulated activities, the incurrence of capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and
restrictions on the generation, handling, treatment, storage, disposal and transportation of certain materials and
wastes.
Failure to comply with such environmental laws and regulations can result in the assessment of substantial
administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial liabilities and even the issuance of injunctions
restricting or prohibiting our activities. We have established procedures for the ongoing evaluation of our operations, to
identify potential environmental exposures and to comply with regulatory policies and procedures.
We account for environmental contingencies in accordance with the ASC 410 related to accounting for contingencies.
Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures
that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and do not contribute to current or future revenue
generation, are expensed.
Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or clean-ups are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no significant environmental matters.
11. Reportable Segments
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reorganized our business segments to match the change in our internal organization
and management structure.  The segment changes reflect the focus of our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”)
and how performance of operations is evaluated and resources are allocated.  Therefore, the results of our formerly
reported crude oil supply and logistics segment have been combined into our crude oil pipelines and storage
segment.  As a result of the reorganization, our operations currently consist of three business segments: (i) crude oil
pipelines and storage, (ii) refined products terminals and storage and (iii) NGL distribution and sales.  Accordingly, we
20
Table of Contents
have presented segment information for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 to reflect this new segment
adjustment.
Crude oil pipelines and storage.  The crude oil pipelines and storage segment consists of a crude oil pipeline
operation and a crude oil storage facility. The crude oil pipeline operates in the Permian Basin consisting of
approximately 156 miles of high-pressure steel pipeline with throughput capacity of approximately 130,000 barrels per
day and a related system of truck terminals, LACT bay facilities, crude oil receipt points and crude oil storage facilities
with an aggregate of 140,000 barrels of shell storage capacity. We also own a crude oil storage facility that has an
aggregate storage capacity of approximately 3,000,000 barrels in Cushing, Oklahoma.
The crude oil pipelines and storage segment also consists of crude oil supply activities and a fleet of crude oil
gathering and transportation trucks. We conduct crude oil supply activities by purchasing crude oil for our own account
from producers, aggregators and traders and selling crude oil to traders and refiners. We also own a fleet of crude oil
gathering and transportation trucks operating in and around highly prolific drilling areas such as the Eagle Ford shale
and the Permian Basin. As described in Note 3, the disposition of the Mid-Continent Business impacts the crude oil
pipelines and storage segment, as the results of those operations are now presented within discontinued operations
and excluded from the segment information tables. Accordingly, we have recast the segment information.
Refined products terminals and storage.  The refined products terminals and storage segment has an aggregate
storage capacity of 1.3 million barrels in two refined products terminals located in North Little Rock, Arkansas and
Caddo Mills, Texas. The North Little Rock terminal has storage capacity of 550,000 barrels in 11 tanks and has eight
loading lanes with automated truck loading equipment. The Caddo Mills terminal consists of 10 storage tanks with an
aggregate capacity of approximately 770,000 barrels and has five loading lanes with automated truck loading
equipment.  In the second quarter of 2016, we completed the connection of the North Little Rock terminal to Magellan’s
Little Rock Pipeline. Following the connection, the North Little Rock terminal allows delivery from Enterprise TE
Products Pipeline Company LLC and Magellan’s Little Rock Pipeline. The Caddo Mills terminal is primarily served by
the Explorer Pipeline.
NGL distribution and sales.  The NGL distribution and sales segment consists of three businesses: (i) portable cylinder
tank exchange; (ii) NGL sales through our retail, commercial and wholesale distribution business; and (iii)  NGL
gathering and transportation business. Currently, the cylinder exchange network covers 46 states through a network of
approximately 20,000 locations, which includes grocery chains, pharmacies, convenience stores and hardware stores.
Additionally, in seven states in the southwest region of the United States, we sell NGLs to retailers, wholesalers,
industrial end users and commercial and residential customers. We also own a fleet of NGL gathering and
transportation operations trucks operating in the Eagle Ford shale and the Permian Basin.
Corporate and other. Corporate and other includes general partnership expenses associated with managing all of our
reportable segments.
Our CODM evaluates the segments’ operating performance based on Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA
as net income (loss) plus (minus) interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and
amortization expense, asset impairments, (gains) losses on asset sales, certain non-cash charges such as non-cash
equity compensation, non-cash vacation expense, non-cash (gains) losses on commodity derivative contracts (total
(gain) loss on commodity derivatives less net cash flow associated with commodity derivatives settled during the
period), and selected (gains) charges and transaction costs that are unusual or non-recurring.

12. Related Party Transactions
We performed certain management services for JP Development through January 2016. We received a monthly fee of
$50,000 for these services, which reduced the general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated
statements of operations by $150,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2015, and $50,000 and $300,000 for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Prior to February 2016, JP Development had a pipeline transportation business that provided crude oil pipeline
transportation services to our discontinued Mid-Continent Business. As a result of utilizing JP Development’s pipeline
transportation services, we incurred pipeline tariff fees of $1,625,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and
$372,000 and $3,265,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which have been included
in net loss from discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31,
2015, we had a net receivable from JP Development of $7,933,000, primarily as the result of the prepayments made in
2014 for the crude oil pipeline transportation services to be provided by JP Development. We recovered these
amounts in full on February 1, 2016.
As discussed in Note 3, on February 1, 2016, we sold certain trucking and marketing assets in the Mid-Continent area
to JP Development in connection with JP Development’s sale of its GSPP pipeline assets to a third party.
As a result of the acquisition of the North Little Rock, Arkansas refined product terminal in November 2012, Truman
Arnold Companies (“TAC”) owns common and subordinated units in us. In addition, Mr. Greg Arnold, President and
CEO of TAC, is one of our directors and owns a 5% equity interest in our general partner. Our refined products
terminals and storage segment sold refined products to TAC during the six months ended June 30, 2016. We did not
sell refined products to TAC during the three months ended June 30, 2016 or during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2015. Our revenue from TAC was $244,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which is included in
NGL and refined product sales – related parties in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Our NGL distribution and sales segment also purchases refined products from TAC. We paid $243,000 and $288,000
during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $462,000 and $514,000 during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for refined product purchases from TAC, which are included in
cost of sales on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Through April 2015, we entered into transactions with CAMS Bluewire, an entity in which ArcLight holds a non-
controlling interest. CAMS Bluewire provided IT support for us. We paid $22,000 and $132,000 for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2015, for IT support and consulting services, and for the purchases of IT equipment, which are
included in operating expense, general and administrative and property, plant and equipment, net, in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations and the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
We perform certain management services for Republic Midstream, LLC (“Republic”), an entity owned by ArcLight. We
charged a monthly fee of approximately $58,000 for these services through November 2015. In December 2015, the
monthly fee increased to $75,000. The monthly fee reduced the general and administrative expenses on the
condensed consolidated statements of operations by $225,000 and $175,000 for the three months ended June 30,
2016
23
Table of Contents
and 2015, respectively, and $450,000 and $350,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
During the second quarter of 2015, we began performing crude transportation and marketing services for Republic. We
charged $814,000 and $280,000 in the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $1,845,000
and $280,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for these services which are included in
gathering, transportation and storage fees – related parties and crude oil sales – related parties on the condensed
consolidated statements of operations. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had a receivable balance due
from Republic of $487,000 and $646,000, respectively, which is included in receivables from related parties in the
condensed consolidated balance sheets.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, our general partner agreed to absorb $3,500,000 and
$5,000,000, respectively, of corporate overhead expenses incurred by us and not pass such expense through to
us.  We receive reimbursements for these expenses from our general partner in the quarters subsequent to when they
were incurred, which was $1,500,000 and $4,000,000, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016.  In the first quarter of 2015, certain executive bonuses related to the year ended December 31, 2014 were paid
on our behalf by ArcLight.  In the second quarter of 2015, ArcLight agreed to reimburse us for certain professional fees
we incurred.  The total amounts paid on our behalf were $1,254,000 and $2,604,000 for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2015, respectively, and were treated as deemed contributions from ArcLight.
We do not have any employees. The employees supporting our operations are employees of our general partner, and
as such, we reimburse our general partner for payroll and other payroll-related expenses we incur.
Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with the unaudited historical condensed consolidated financial statements and notes in “Item 1. Financial
Statements” contained herein and our audited historical consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015
and 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K,
as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016 (our “2015 Form 10-K”). Among other things, those historical consolidated
financial statements include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information.
This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ
materially from those discussed below as a result of various risk factors, including those that may not be in the control
of management. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those
identified below and those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” included in our 2015 Form 10-K. See also
“Forward-Looking Statements.”
General
We are a growth-oriented limited partnership formed in May 2010 by members of management and further capitalized
by ArcLight to own, operate, develop and acquire a diversified portfolio of midstream energy assets. We completed our
initial public offering in October 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reorganized our business segments to match
the change in our internal organization and management structure. The segment changes reflect the focus of our chief
operating decision maker (“CODM”) and how performance of operations is evaluated and resources are allocated.
Therefore, the results of our formerly reported crude oil supply and logistics segment have been combined into our
crude oil pipelines and storage segment. As a result of the reorganization, our operations currently consist of three
business segments: (i) crude oil pipelines and storage, (ii) refined products terminals and storage and (iii) NGL
distribution and sales. Together our businesses provide midstream infrastructure solutions for the growing supply of
crude oil, refined products and NGLs in the United States. Our primary business strategy has been to focus on:
·owning, operating and developing midstream assets serving two of the most prolific shale plays in the United States,
as well as serving key crude oil, refined product and NGL distribution hubs; and
·providing midstream infrastructure solutions to users of liquid petroleum products in order to capitalize on changing
product flows between producing and consuming markets resulting from the growth in hydrocarbon production across
the United States.

Table of Contents
We are focused on growing our business through organic development, acquiring and constructing additional
midstream infrastructure assets and increasing the utilization of our existing assets to gather, transport, store and
distribute crude oil, refined products and NGLs. Our crude oil businesses are situated in highly prolific areas, including
the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford shale, and provide us with a footprint to increase our volumes if these areas
experience further drilling and production growth. In addition, we believe we have a competitive advantage with regard
to the sourcing of opportunities to build, own and operate additional crude oil pipelines due to the insights in the
market that we obtain while providing services to customers in our crude oil supply and logistics operations within our
crude oil pipelines and storage segment. We believe that our NGL distribution and sales segment will continue to grow
due to our recent expansion into new geographic markets, an increased market presence in our existing areas of
operation and the increase in industrial and commercial applications for NGLs such as in oilfield and agricultural
services.
We conduct our business through fee-based and margin-based arrangements.
Fee-based. We charge our customers a capacity, throughput or volume-based fee that is not contingent on commodity
price changes. Our fee-based services include the operations in our crude oil pipelines and storage segment, our
refined products terminals and storage segment, and the NGL transportation services we provide within our NGL
distribution and sales segment. In our crude oil pipelines business, we purchase crude oil at an index price less a
transportation fee and simultaneously sell an identical volume of crude oil at a designated delivery point to the same
party at the same index price. We consider this a fee-based business because we lock in the economic equivalent of a
transportation fee. Our fee-based businesses are governed by tariffs or other negotiated fee agreements between us
and our customers with terms ranging from one month to nine years.
Margin-based. We purchase and sell crude oil in our crude oil pipelines and storage segment and NGLs and refined
products in our NGL distribution and sales segment. A portion of our margin related to the purchase and sale of crude
oil in our crude oil pipelines and storage segment is derived from “fee equivalent” transactions in which we
concurrently purchase and sell crude oil at prices that are based on an index, thereby generating revenue consisting of
a margin plus our purchase, transportation, handling and storage costs. In our NGL distribution and sales segment,
sales prices to our customers generally provide for a margin plus the cost of our products to our customers. We
manage commodity price exposure through the structure of our sales and supply contracts and through a managed
hedging program. Our risk management policy permits the use of financial instruments to reduce the exposure to
changes in commodity prices that occur in the normal course of business, but prohibits the use of financial instruments
for trading or to speculate on future changes in commodity prices.

Business”), in connection with JP Development’s sale of its GSPP pipeline assets to a third party buyer. The sales
price related to the Mid-Continent Business was $9.7 million, which included certain adjustments related to inventory
and other working capital items. We utilized the proceeds from the sale of the Mid-Continent Business to pay down a
portion of our revolving credit facility. We continue to retain our crude oil storage operations in the Mid-Continent area
of Oklahoma.
Recent Trends
Changes in Commodity Prices
Average daily prices for NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil ranged from a high of $61.36 per barrel to a low of
$26.19 per barrel during the period from January 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016. Fluctuations in energy prices, like the
recent declines in commodity prices of crude oil, can also greatly affect the development of new crude oil reserves,
including reserves in our areas of operation in the Midland Basin. Further declines in commodity prices of crude oil
could have a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity, and, if sustained, could lead
25

to a material decrease in such activity. Sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in our areas of
operation would lead to reduced utilization of our assets and increased competition for production volumes. We are
unable to predict future potential movements in the market price for crude oil and, thus, cannot predict the ultimate
impact of commodity prices on our operations. If commodity prices continue to trend lower as they did in the latter part
of 2014 and the first quarter of 2016, this could lead to reduced profitability and may result in future potential
impairments of long-lived assets, goodwill or intangible assets. We performed our annual impairment assessment of
goodwill at year end of 2015, which resulted in an impairment charge of $29.9 million. Due to the market conditions
discussed above, there is an increased likelihood of incurring additional future goodwill impairments, which may be
material.
How We Evaluate Our Operations
Our management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance. We view these
metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and review these measurements for consistency and trend
analysis. These metrics include volumes, revenues, cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, operating
expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted gross margin.
Volumes and revenues
·Crude oil pipelines and storage.    The amount of revenue we generate from our crude oil pipelines business depends
primarily on throughput volumes. We generate a substantial majority of our crude oil pipeline revenues through long-
term contracts containing acreage dedications or minimum volume commitments. Throughput volumes on our
pipeline system are affected primarily by the supply of crude oil in the market served by our assets. The revenue
generated from our crude oil supply and logistics business depends on the volume of crude oil we purchase from
producers, aggregators and traders and then sell to producers, traders and refiners as well as the volumes of crude oil
that we gather and transport. The volume of our crude oil supply and logistics activities and the volumes transported
by our crude oil gathering and transportation trucks are affected by the supply of crude oil in the markets served
directly or indirectly by our assets. Accordingly, we actively monitor producer activity in the areas served by our crude
oil supply and logistics business and other producing areas in the United States to compete for volumes from crude
oil producers. Revenues in this business are also impacted by changes in the market price of commodities that we
pass through to our customers.  The volume of crude oil stored at our crude oil storage facility in Cushing, Oklahoma
has no impact on the revenue generated by our crude oil storage business because we receive a fixed monthly fee
per barrel of shell capacity that is not contingent on the usage of our storage tanks.
·Refined products terminals and storage.    The amount of revenue we generate from our refined products terminals
depends primarily on the volume of refined products that we handle. These volumes are affected primarily by the
supply of and demand for refined products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our refined products
terminals, which we believe are strategically located to take advantage of infrastructure development opportunities
resulting from growing markets.
·NGL distribution and sales.    The amount of revenue we generate from our NGL distribution and sales segment
depends on the gallons of NGLs we sell through our cylinder exchange and NGL sales businesses. In addition, our
NGL transportation operations generate revenue based on the number of gallons of NGLs we gather and the distance
we transport those gallons for our customers. Revenues in this segment are also impacted by changes in the market
price of commodities that we pass through to our customers.
Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization.    Our management attempts to minimize cost of sales,
excluding depreciation and amortization, in order to enhance the profitability of our operations. Cost of sales, excluding
depreciation and amortization, includes the costs to purchase the product and any costs incurred to transport the
product to the point of sale and to store the product until it is sold. We seek to minimize cost of sales, excluding
depreciation and
26
Table of Contents
amortization, by attempting to acquire the products which we use in each of our segments at times and prices which
are most optimal based on our knowledge of the industry and the regions in which we operate.
Operating expenses.    Our management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations in part by minimizing
operating expenses. These expenses are comprised of payroll, wages and benefits, utility costs, fleet costs, repair and
maintenance costs, rent, fuel, insurance premiums, taxes and other operating costs, some of which are independent of
the volumes we handle.
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted gross margin.    Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted gross margin
to analyze our performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (minus) interest expense (income),
income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization expense, asset impairments, (gains) losses on asset
sales, certain non-cash charges such as non-cash equity compensation, non-cash vacation expense, non-cash (gains)
losses on commodity derivative contracts (total (gain) loss on commodity derivatives less net cash flow associated with
commodity derivatives settled during the period) and selected (gains) charges and transaction costs that are unusual
or non-recurring. We define adjusted gross margin as total revenues minus cost of sales, excluding depreciation and
amortization, and certain non-cash charges such as non-cash vacation expense and non-cash gains (losses) on
derivative contracts (total gain (losses) on commodity derivatives less net cash flow associated with commodity
derivatives settled during the period).
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted gross margin are supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures used by management
and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:
·our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in the midstream sector, without regard to
financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure;
·the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders;
·our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and
·the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment
opportunities.
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted gross margin are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We
believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides information useful to investors in
assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted
EBITDA and adjusted gross margin are net income (loss) and operating income (loss), respectively. Adjusted EBITDA
and adjusted gross margin should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss) or
any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and
adjusted gross margin exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and operating income (loss) and
these measures may vary among other companies. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted gross margin may not
be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.

(1)See further analysis of Adjusted EBITDA of each reportable segment below.
(2)In February 2016, we completed the sale of our Mid-Continent Business.
Corporate and other Adjusted EBITDA. Corporate and other Adjusted EBITDA primarily represents corporate
expenses not allocated to reportable segments. Such expenses decreased to $2.5 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 from $6.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to $3.5
million of expenses incurred by us during the three months ended June 30, 2016, that were absorbed by our general
partner and not passed through to us.
Interest expense. Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $2.1 million from $1.4
million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to non-cash losses on interest rate
swaps and an increase in average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  Our interest rate swaps
are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes; therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in earnings each
period.  Losses on interest rate swaps increased $0.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
the three months ended June 30, 2015 as a result of forward market interest rates decreasing. Our average
outstanding borrowings increased from $136.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $159.6 million for
the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Loss on disposal of assets, net. The loss on disposal of assets, net for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.6
million compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The change is primarily due to a reduction
in the amount of scrapped cylinders and valve assets in our propane cylinder exchange business.
Total loss on commodity derivatives and net cash payments for commodity derivatives settled during the period. The
changes in both total loss on commodity derivatives and net cash payments for commodity derivatives settled during
the period are primarily due to the more favorable position of our propane and crude hedges during the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.

Table of Contents
Non-cash inventory costing adjustment. We use the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method to calculate the cost of our crude
oil inventory.  Occasionally, we physically hold the crude oil inventory during contango market conditions (when the
price of crude oil for future delivery is higher than current prices).  The non-cash inventory costing adjustment reflects
the difference between the actual purchase price for this crude oil inventory and the cost calculated under the FIFO
method.   As a result, we have excluded the $1.0 million non-cash inventory costing adjustment in calculating Adjusted
EBITDA, which will result in realization of the actual cost of this inventory in the same period when the inventory is
physically sold.
Corporate overhead support from general partner. Corporate overhead support from general partner of $3.5 million
represents expenses incurred by us during the three months ended June 30, 2016, that were absorbed by our general
partner and not passed through to us.
Discontinued operations. Discontinued operations primarily represents non-cash depreciation and amortization
expense, the total loss on commodity derivatives and net cash payments for commodity derivatives settled during the
period and non-cash inventory costing adjustments related to the discontinued operations previously owned by our
crude oil pipelines and storage segment. Such amounts were $1.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015
primarily due to a $3.9 million non-cash inventory costing adjustment in the three months ended June 30, 2015. As
noted above, we use the FIFO method to calculate the cost of our crude oil inventory. During the first quarter of 2015,
we entered into several fixed price forward sale contracts that settled during the third and fourth quarters of 2015. We
physically held the crude oil inventory associated with those forward sales contracts until the time of the sale. The non-
cash inventory costing adjustment reflected the difference between the actual purchase price for the crude oil inventory
and the cost calculated under the FIFO method. As a result, we excluded the $3.9 million non-cash inventory costing
adjustment in calculating Adjusted EBITDA in the three months ended June 30, 2015, which resulted in realization of
the actual cost of the inventory in the same period when the inventory was physically sold. This increase was partially
offset by changes in the total loss on commodity derivatives and net cash payments for commodity derivatives settled
during the period of $2.0 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $0.6 million in the three months ended
June 30, 2015.

Volumes. Crude oil pipeline throughput volumes decreased to 25,219 barrels per day for the three months ended June
30, 2016 from 29,541 barrels per day for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Crude oil sales volumes decreased to
25,400 barrels per day for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from 33,349 barrels per day for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in crude oil pipeline throughput volumes is due to overall reduction in our
customer crude oil production volumes in our areas of operation.  The reduction in crude oil sales volumes is primarily
due to lower crude oil production for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June
30, 2015.
Adjusted gross margin. Adjusted gross margin decreased to $9.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016
from $9.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in crude oil
sales and throughput volumes of $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, as explained above, partially offset by an
increase in crude oil sales margin of $1.3 million due to improved cost efficiencies on trucked barrels.
Operating expenses. Operating expenses decreased to $2.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from
$2.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to reductions in personnel
costs of $0.5 million from lower headcount.

Volumes. Volumes decreased to 58,655 barrels per day for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from 61,073 for the
three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to increased competition in our areas of
operations.
Revenues. Revenues increased to $8.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $4.7 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in refined products sales revenue
of $3.4 million related to timing of our sale of butane blending volumes in the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Cost of Sales, excluding depreciation and amortization. Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization,
increased to $3.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $1.3 million for the three months ended June
30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in refined products sales volumes.
Operating expenses. Operating expenses decreased to $0.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from
$0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to $0.2 million in expenses
incurred in the three months ended June 30, 2015 related to inadvertent product releases.

(2)Certain expenses have been excluded from cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, operating
expenses and general and administrative expenses for the purpose of calculating segment Adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted gross margin. Adjusted gross margin remained relatively flat in the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in NGL and refined product sales margin was offset
by a decrease in NGL and refined product sales volumes.  The average NGL and refined products sales margin
increased due to more favorable market conditions in the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three
months ended June 30, 2015.  The reduction in NGL and refined product sales volumes was primarily due to a decline
in volumes associated with oilfield services as a result of lower exploration and production activity in the three months
ended June 30, 2016, partially offset by an increase in volumes due to the acquisition of Southern Propane in May
2015.
Operating expenses. Operating expenses decreased to $13.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from
$14.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in employee
costs of $0.5 million related to a reduction in headcount.
General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased to $2.3 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 from $3.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 due to overall cost reduction efforts.
The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in bad debt expense of $0.3 million from an improvement in collection
efforts and lower personnel costs of $0.4 million related to reduction in headcount.

(1)See further analysis of Adjusted EBITDA of each reportable segment below.
(2)In February 2016, we completed the sale of our Mid-Continent Business.
Discontinued operations Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA related to discontinued operations included previously
in our crude oil pipelines and storage segment decreased $2.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in crude oil sales
volumes and crude oil sales margin in our operations in the Mid-Continent region of Oklahoma and Kansas. We
completed the sale of our Mid-Continent Business in February 2016.
Corporate and other Adjusted EBITDA. Corporate and other Adjusted EBITDA primarily represents corporate
expenses not allocated to reportable segments. Such expenses decreased to $7.9 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 from $13.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to $5.0
million of expenses incurred by us during the six months ended June 30, 2016, that were absorbed by our general
partner and not passed through to us, as well as a decrease in employee expenses of $0.5 million.
Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense for the six months ended June 30,
2016 increased to $23.2 million from $22.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily
due to the expansions of our Silver Dollar Pipeline System throughout 2015. Our average depreciable asset base
increased from $304.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $354.0 million during the six months
ended June 30, 2016.
Interest expense. Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $4.5 million from $2.5 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to non-cash losses on interest rate swaps and
an increase in average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  Our interest rate swaps are not
designated as hedges for accounting purposes; therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in earnings each period.
35
Table of Contents
Losses on interest rate swaps increased $1.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six
months ended June 30, 2015 as a result of forward market interest rates decreasing. Our average outstanding
borrowings increased from $119.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $158.6 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016.
Unit-based compensation.  Unit-based compensation for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $0.9 million
from $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to the additional LTIP phantom units granted in
the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Total loss on commodity derivatives and net cash payments for commodity derivatives settled during the period. The
reduction in both total loss on commodity derivatives and net cash payments for commodity derivatives settled during
the period are primarily due to the more favorable position of our propane and crude hedges during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Non-cash inventory costing adjustment. We use the FIFO method to calculate the cost of our crude oil
inventory.  Occasionally, we will physically hold the crude oil inventory during contango market conditions (when the
price of crude oil for future delivery is higher than current prices).  The non-cash inventory costing adjustment reflects
the difference between the actual purchase price for this crude oil inventory and the cost calculated under the FIFO
method.   As a result, we have excluded the $1.1 million non-cash inventory costing adjustment in calculating Adjusted
EBITDA, which will result in realization of the actual cost of this inventory in the same period when the inventory is
physically sold.
Corporate overhead support from general partner. Corporate overhead support from general partner of $5.0 million
represents expenses incurred by us during the six months ended June 30, 2016, that were absorbed by our general
partner and not passed through to us.
Discontinued operations. Discontinued operations primarily represents non-cash depreciation and amortization
expense, the total loss on commodity derivatives and net cash payments for commodity derivatives settled during the
period, non-cash inventory costing adjustments and non-cash vacation expense related to the discontinued operations
previously owned by our crude oil pipelines and storage segment. Such amounts decreased to $0.2 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2016 from $1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to changes in
the total loss on commodity derivatives and net cash payments for commodity derivatives settled during the period of
$1.4 million and reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $0.9 million.  In addition, non-cash vacation
expense decreased $0.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30,
2015.  These decreases are partially offset by a non-cash inventory costing adjustment of $1.0 million during the six
months ended June 30, 2015. As noted above, we use the FIFO method to calculate the cost of our crude oil inventory.
During the first quarter of 2015, we entered into several fixed price forward sale contracts that settled during the third
and fourth quarters of 2015. We physically held the crude oil inventory associated with those forward sales contracts
until the time of the sale. The non-cash inventory costing adjustment reflected the difference between the actual
purchase price for the crude oil inventory and the cost calculated under the FIFO method. As a result, we excluded the
$1.0 million non-cash inventory costing adjustment in calculating Adjusted EBITDA in the six months ended June 30,
2015, which resulted in realization of the actual cost of the inventory in the same period when the inventory was
physically sold.

Volumes. Crude oil pipeline throughput volumes decreased to 25,188 barrels per day for the six months ended June
30, 2016 from 28,939 barrels per day for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Crude oil sales volumes decreased to
21,892 barrels per day for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from 31,577 barrels per day for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. The decrease in crude oil pipeline throughput volumes is due to overall reduction in our customer
crude oil production volumes in our areas of operation.  The reduction in crude oil sales volumes is primarily due to the
lower crude oil production for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Adjusted gross margin. Adjusted gross margin decreased to $17.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from
$18.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in crude oil sales
and throughput volumes of $2.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, as explained above, partially offset by an
increase in crude oil sales margin of $2.1 million due to improved cost efficiencies on trucked barrels.
Operating expenses. Operating expenses decreased to $4.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $5.3
million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to reductions in personnel costs of
$1.2 million from lower headcount.

Volumes. Volumes decreased to 58,647 barrels per day for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from 62,423 for the six
months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to increased competition in our area of operations  and
a non-recurring increase in volumes in the six months ended June 30, 2015 from a refinery turn-around in our area of
operations during that period.
Revenues. Revenues increased to $14.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $10.2 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in refined products sales revenue of $3.9
million related to the addition of butane blending capabilities at our North Little Rock Terminal since the second
quarter of 2015.
Cost of Sales, excluding depreciation and amortization. Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization,

(3)Adjusted gross margin. Adjusted gross margin remained relatively flat in the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in NGL and refined product sales margin was offset
by a decrease in NGL and refined product sales volume.  The average NGL and refined products sales margin
increased due to more favorable market conditions in the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six
months ended June 30, 2015.  The reduction in NGL and refined product sales volumes was primarily due to
warmer than normal temperatures sustained in the six months ended June 30, 2016 partially offset by an increase
in volumes due to the acquisition of Southern Propane in May 2015.
General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased to $4.8 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 from $6.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 due to overall cost reduction efforts. The
decrease is primarily due to a reduction in bad debt expense of $0.7 million from an improvement in collection efforts
and lower personnel costs of $0.7 million related to a reduction in headcount.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We principally require liquidity to finance current operations, fund capital expenditures, including acquisitions from
time to time, service our debt and pay distributions. We expect our sources of liquidity to include cash generated from
operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of debt and equity.
We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will
be adequate to meet our operating needs, our planned short-term capital and debt service requirements and our cash
distribution requirements. We believe that future internal growth projects or potential acquisitions will be funded
primarily through borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through issuances of debt and equity securities.
However, future issuances of equity securities are less likely without a recovery in the market price of our common
units from current depressed levels.
Distributions
We intend to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.3250 per unit per quarter, which equates to approximately
$12.1 million per quarter, or $48.4 million per year, calculated based on the number of common and subordinated units
outstanding as of August 5, 2016 and estimated unvested phantom units under our long-term incentive
39
Table of Contents
plan. We do not have a legal obligation to pay this distribution, except as provided in our partnership agreement. We
currently estimate that our distributable cash flow in certain quarters of 2016 will be less than our anticipated
distributions to unitholders during those periods. This shortfall is expected to be temporary and is expected to be
funded with a combination of borrowings from our revolving credit facility and potential corporate overhead support
from our general partner. A distribution of $0.3250 per common unit and subordinated unit for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 was declared on July 25, 2016 and will be paid on August 12, 2016 to unitholders of record as of
August 5, 2016.
Revolving Credit Facility
Our revolving credit facility has a maturity date of February 12, 2019 and consists of a $275.0 million revolving line of
credit, which includes a sub-limit of up to $100.0 million for letters of credit, and contains an accordion feature that will
allow us to increase the borrowing capacity thereunder from $275.0 million to $425.0 million, subject to obtaining
additional or increased lender commitments. Our revolving credit facility is available for refinancing and repayment of
certain existing indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions and for general partnership
purposes, including distributions, not in contravention of law or the loan documents. Substantially all of our assets, but
excluding equity in and assets of unrestricted subsidiaries and other customary exclusions, are pledged as collateral
under our revolving credit facility. Our revolving credit facility contains customary covenants, including, among others,
those that restrict our ability to make or limit certain payments, distributions, acquisitions, loans, or investments, incur
certain indebtedness or create certain liens on our assets. Our revolving credit facility also requires compliance with
certain financial covenants, which include the following:

Cash Flow
Cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities were as follows for the
periods indicated:

Cash provided by operating activities.    Cash provided by operating activities was $31.0 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to $19.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The $11.7 million increase
was primarily due to a $8.2 million reduction in cash payments for commodity derivatives settled, primarily related to
our propane financial swap contracts and a $0.9 million increase from the timing of collections and payments and cash
used for inventory purchases.
Cash used in investing activities.    Cash used in investing activities was $3.1 million for the six months ended June
30, 2016 compared to $43.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The $40.6 million decrease was primarily
due to a decrease in capital expenditures of $17.9 million and an increase of  $10.3 million in proceeds from the sale
of assets, which includes the sale of our trucking and marketing assets in the Mid-Continent Business.  The six months
ended June 30, 2015 also included $12.5 million in cash used for the acquisition of Southern Propane.
Cash (used in) provided by financing activities.    Cash used in financing activities was $28.6 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $23.5 million for the six months ended June
30, 2015. The $52.1 million change was primarily due to a reduction in net borrowings under our revolving credit
facility of $51.0 million and an increase in distributions paid to unitholders of $1.0 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Cash flows from discontinued operations.    We combined the cash flows from discontinued operations with the cash
flows from continuing operations. The cash flows from discontinued operations related to our operating, investing and
financing activities were insignificant. We do not expect the absence of cash flows from these discontinued operations
will have a significant impact to our future liquidity.
Capital Expenditures
Our capital spending program is focused on expanding our pipeline, maintaining our fleet and storage assets and
maintaining and updating our information systems. Capital expenditure plans are generally evaluated based on return
on investment and estimated incremental cash flow. In addition to annually recurring capital expenditures, potential
acquisition opportunities are evaluated based on their anticipated return on invested capital, accretive impact to
operating results and strategic fit.
Under our partnership agreement, maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to maintain our
operating income or operating capacity, while growth capital expenditures are capital expenditures that we expect will
increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long-term. Examples of maintenance
capital  expenditures are those made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating
capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives, or other capital expenditures that are incurred in maintaining
existing system volumes and related cash flows. In contrast, growth capital expenditures are those made to acquire
additional assets to grow our business, to expand and upgrade our systems and facilities and to construct or acquire
similar systems or facilities.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we spent $14.4 million on capital expenditures, of which $1.4 million
represents maintenance capital expenditures and $13.0 million represents growth capital expenditures. We have
budgeted

$5.0 million in maintenance capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2016. We expect growth capital
expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2016 to range from $25.0 million to $35.0 million, with an estimated
$15.0 million of these investments to be made on the continued development of our Silver Dollar Pipeline system. This
estimated range of growth capital expenditures does not include any potential third party acquisitions that we will
continue to evaluate throughout 2016.
Although we intend to move forward with our planned internal growth projects, we may further revise the timing and
scope of these projects as necessary to adapt to existing economic conditions and the benefits expected to accrue to
our unitholders from our expansion activities. We expect to fund our growth capital expenditures with borrowings under
our revolving credit facility and a combination of debt and equity issuances.
Working Capital
Our working capital is the amount by which our current assets exceed our current liabilities and is a measure of our
ability to pay our liabilities as they come due. Our working capital was $8.9 million and $16.7 million as of June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
Our working capital requirements have been and will continue to be primarily driven by changes in accounts
receivable and accounts payable, which generally fluctuate with changes in the market prices of commodities that we
buy and sell in the ordinary course of our business. Other factors impacting changes in accounts receivable and
accounts payable could include the timing of collections from customers and payments to suppliers, as well as our
level of spending for maintenance and growth capital expenditures. A material adverse change in our operations or
available financing under our revolving credit facility could impact our ability to fund our working capital requirements
for liquidity and capital resources.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off
balance sheet liabilities.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial
statements are set forth in our 2015 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and have not changed.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Commodity price risk. Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. We
manage exposure to commodity price risk in our business segments through the structure of our sales and supply
contracts and through a managed hedging program. Our risk management policy permits the use of financial
instruments to reduce the exposure to changes in commodity prices that occur in the normal course of business but
prohibits the use of financial instruments for trading or to speculate on future changes in commodity prices. See note 7
to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q for additional
information.
In our crude oil pipelines and storage segment, we purchase and take title to a portion of the crude oil that we sell,
which exposes us to changes in the price of crude oil in our sales markets. We manage this commodity price risk by
limiting our net open positions and through the concurrent purchase and sale of like quantities of crude oil that are
intended to lock in positive margins based on the timing, location or quality of the crude oil purchased and delivered. In
our refined products terminals and storage segment, we sell excess volumes of refined products and our gross margin
is impacted by changes in the market prices for these sales. We may execute forward sales contracts or financial
swaps to reduce the risk of commodity price changes in this segment. In our NGL distribution and sales business, we
are generally able to pass through the cost of products through sales prices to our customers. To the extent we enter
into fixed price product sales contracts in this business, we generally hedge our supply costs using fixed price forward
contracts and swap contracts. In our cylinder exchange business, we sell approximately half of our volumes pursuant
to contracts of

generally one to three years in duration, which allow us to re-negotiate prices at the time of contract renewal, and we
sell the remaining volumes on demand or under month-to-month contracts and generally adjust prices on these
contracts on an annual basis. We hedge a majority of the forecasted volumes under our fixed-price contracts using
financial swaps, and we may also use financial swaps to manage commodity price risk on our month-to-month
contracts. At times we may also terminate or unwind hedges or a portion of hedges in order to meet cash flow
objectives or when the expected future volumes do not support the level of hedges. In our NGL transportation
business, we do not take title to the products we transport and therefore have no direct commodity price exposure.
Sensitivity analysis. The table below summarizes our commodity-related financial derivative instruments and fair
values, as well as the effect of an assumed hypothetical 10% change in the underlying price of the commodity.

Price-risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming a theoretical 10% change (increase or decrease) in price
regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying
commodity price. Results are presented in absolute terms and represent a potential gain or loss in net income. The
preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in prices may or may not equal 10% and actual results
may differ.
Interest rate risk. Our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate and exposes us to interest rate risk. From
time to time, we may use certain derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates. As of June 30,
2016, $100.0 million of our outstanding debt is economically hedged. Based on our unhedged interest rate exposure to
variable rate debt outstanding as of June 30, 2016, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change annual
interest expense by approximately $0.6 million.
We do not hold or purchase financial instruments or derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Credit risk. We are exposed to credit risk. Credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty fails to
perform under its contractual obligations. We manage our exposure to credit risk associated with customers to whom
we extend credit through analyzing the counterparties’ financial condition prior to entering into an agreement,
establishing credit limits, monitoring the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis and entering into netting
agreements that allow for offsetting counterparty receivable and payable balances for certain transactions, as deemed
appropriate. We may request letters of credit, cash collateral, prepayments or guarantees as forms of credit support.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers, the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report, and has concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to
be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms
including, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures.
