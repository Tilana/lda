The assessors have given unanimous opinions that the accused is guilty of abuse of office as charged in count 1. The assessors are also unanimous that the accused abused the authority of his office for gain. Their opinions are available on the evidence. I direct myself in accordance with my summing up and find the accused guilty of abuse of office as charged in count 1.
