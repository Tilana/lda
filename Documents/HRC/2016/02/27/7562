</p>
<p> The Government of the Republic of Macedonia has considered with great attention 
the Report of the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations on the Promotion and Protection 
of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, Frank La Rue on his visit to the 
Republic of Macedonia which took place from 18 to 21 June 2013.  
</p>
<p> A general observation of the Macedonian authorities is that Report does not contain 
a number of views and arguments presented to Special Rapporteur La Rue by the official 
representatives of the institutions of the Republic of Macedonia during his visit to the 
country which may, in turn, lead to certain events being misrepresented and misinterpreted.  
</p>
<p> Remaining true to the spirit of constructive dialogue, the Government of the 
Republic of Macedonia would like to hereby submit the comments and suggestions from its 
in-line institutions concerning the Report of the Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraphs 21 and 22 
</b></p>
<p> The closing of A1 TV station and of three daily newspapers was a result of a legal 
procedure, i.e. following regular public revenue office inspection, as performed on all legal 
persons, including broadcasters. The TV station was closed as a result of a debt incurred on 
the grounds of unpaid taxes. Despite all the activities, very carefully implemented by the 
relevant authorities, aimed at avoiding the closure of the TV station, considering that it was 
a matter of a media outlet with one of the highest ratings in the country, and despite the 
efforts of the relevant authorities to facilitate the payment of the unpaid tax debt in 
instalments, the A1 TV Station did not fulfil the required legal conditions to provide 
collateral for the debt. Therefore, bankruptcy proceedings had to be instituted.  
</p>
<p> The Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services acts in accordance with  its 
legally prescribed competences and exclusively for the purpose of ensuring the consistent 
application of the law (in the case of A1 and A2 televisions, the legislation in force at that 
instance was the Law on Broadcasting). Article 62, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 4 of the 
Law on Broadcasting has stipulated that the broadcasting license is revoked in case of 
bancuptcy or liquidation of a broadcasting company holding the licence. Thus, once the 
Agency for Electronic Communication adopted a Decision revoking the licenses for 
allocating broadcasting frequencies, A1 TV which, at that point, was already declared 
bankrupt, stopped broadcasting, while, as a consequence, the national Broadcasting Council 
adopted a Decision revoking the company&#8217;s broadcasting license.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 3 
</b></p>
<p> As a further explanation to the case of A2 TV, while making regular controls on 
three consecutive occasions, the then national Broadcasting Council1, found that the 
broadcaster in question had failed to meet the licensing criteria on the programming format, 
following which, during its first control conducted in February 2012, the Council 
established that the broadcaster should align its work with the legally prescribed license 
conditions. Having ascertained during its second control at the beginning of May 2012 that 
nothing had been done to address the situation, the Council issued A2 TV a written warning 
to comply with the licensing conditions as stipulated under the law. Following the third 
consecutive control at the end of May of that same year which only corroborated the fact 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 Under the new Law on Audio and Audiovisual Media Services, the erstwhile Broadcasting Council 
</p>
<p>has been converted into the new Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services (Official Gazette 
of the Republic of Macedonia No. 184, dated 26 December 2013).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>that the A2 TV had failed to comply with the licensing conditions, the Council initiated a 
procedure to revoke its broadcasting licence. In the first half of June 2012, another control 
was conducted to determine whether the media outlet had aligned its program with the 
licensing conditions in the additional time it had been given to address the situation. By 
that, the national Broadcasting Council exhausted all legally allowed opportunities it had in 
its power, leading to it adopting a Decision to revoke A2 TV its broadcasting licence. The 
media outlet lodged an appeal to the Administrative Court against the Decision of the 
Broadcasting Council to revoke its broadcasting licence, filing a special formal motion for 
the execution of the Decision of the Council to be postponed until the Administrative Court 
passed its final ruling. The Administrative Court, on its turn, overruled the motion for 
postponing the execution of the Decision of the Council, deeming it ungrounded, while, in 
its ruling, it also dismissed the appeal of A2 TV against the Decision of the Broadcasting 
Council to revoke its broadcasting licence as ungrounded (the Court&#8217;s ruling is final as of 
23 March 2013).  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 27 
</b></p>
<p> For the purpose of gaining an adequate and objective perception as to the listed 
statistical data outlining the number of lawsuits for  defamation and offence, it would also 
be useful to examine how many of those lawsuits have actually been filed against 
journalists and who the plaintiff has been in those cases. Namely, according to the 
statistical data acquired from the Ministry of Justice, as of November 2013, the status with 
regard to the structure of cases pertaining to defamation and offence that are being 
prosecuted in Skopje II First Instance Court (where most cases on such grounds are being 
processed) is the following:  
 There have been 61 cases in which journalists or media outlets have been sued for 
defamation and offence by individuals and legal entities, politicians, other journalists, etc.  
 Politicians or individuals have been sued for defamation or offence in 20 cases, with 
the plaintiffs being other politicians, journalists, individuals, etc.  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 28  
</b></p>
<p>The Republic of Macedonia is one of the very few countries in the world that have 
decriminalized defamation and offence which can now be exclusively tried in civil law 
proceedings. Under the new concept of identifying  liability, the European Convention on 
Human Rights and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights would have 
supremacy in both cases of conflicting domestic legislation and when potential legal 
loopholes arise.  
</p>
<p> The new Law defines compensations of damages being paid to victims of 
defamation and offence as a measure of last resort. Namely, the Law envisages that liability 
for defamation and offence be assigned exclusively in cases where intent can be identified. 
Those making offensive claims against holders of public offices will not be held 
accountable for offence under certain conditions such as when claims of that sort encourage 
public debates, when they are based on true facts or when there are reasonable grounds to 
believe in the authenticity of the facts presented. Those making negative remarks on 
someone else with honest designs or believed to have presented those remarks with good 
intentions will not be held accountable for offence either. The Law also envisages other 
grounds that exclude liability for offence.  
</p>
<p> As regards defamation, the Law does not assign accountability for defamation if the 
defendants are able to substantiate the authenticity of their claims or are able to prove that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>they had reasonable grounds to believe in the authenticity of their claims. When the 
plaintiff is a holder of public office, an exception has been made to the rule stating that the 
burden of proof falls to the defendant. In such cases, the holders of public office are legally 
obliged to provide an explanation with regard to the specific facts that are directly related or 
are of significance to the performance of public office if the defendants are able to prove 
had been of public interest.    
</p>
<p> Moreover, the Law prescribes a possibility for mitigating the damage incurred prior 
to the lawsuit being filed, particularly in cases of defamatory remarks and offences being 
delivered in public media when the damaged party can ask for public apology or for the 
claims made to be publicly retracted. Compensation of non-material damage in cases of 
defamation is ordered by the court only if the defamer had not apologized or had not 
publicly retracted the offensive claims. For purposes of alleviating the damage, there is a 
possibility of the defendants being allowed to prove that they had apologized, offered to 
apologize or had in any other way made a serious attempt to eliminate the damaging 
consequences of the defaming claims they had made.  
</p>
<p> Journalist who are being prosecuted for defamation and offence have a right to 
appeal the ruling of the first instance court, institute an extraordinary legal remedy before 
the Supreme Court of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as file an application with the 
European Court of Human Rights. Other venues for revising the rulings made by the 
domestic courts are unacceptable and contrary to international standards.  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraphs 29 and 31 
</b></p>
<p> Following a brief period of interruption, the <i>Focus</i> weekly resumed printing. One of 
the causes believed to be the reason for the temporary interruption of its publication was the 
death of the outlet&#8217;s owner who lost his life in a tragic traffic accident. The institutions in 
charge undertook all measures and activities necessary to clear the case while the findings 
of the investigation into the accident were presented to the general public.  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraphs 32 and 33 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>As regards the case of journalist Ke&#382;arovski, it should be underlined that Mr. 
Ke&#382;arovski was charged with unlawfully revealing information and facts on witnesses, 
collaborators to justice, victims who appear in the capacity of witnesses and their close ones 
under Article 42, Paragraph 1 of the Law on the Protection of Witnesses. In October 2013, 
the Skopje I First Instance Court passed a verdict on the case, convicting the journalist to 4 
and a half  years of imprisonment.  
</p>
<p> In February 2014, the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, Mrs. Dunja 
Mijatovi&#263; visited Mr.  Ke&#382;arovski, who will remain under house arrest until the final 
deadlines for the appeal procedure and deciding upon it by the courts of higher instance 
expire.  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 36 
</b></p>
<p> Article 24, Paragraph 2 of the Law on Broadcasting stipulated that members of the 
Broadcasting Council can be persons who have made significant contributions in the fields 
of communication sciences, journalism, telecommunications, information technology, 
culture, economy, law and others that are relevant to the Broadcasting Council&#8217;s area of 
competence. The Law also contained provisions ensuring political independence and 
preventing any types of conflicts of interests while stipulating, at the same time, that during </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>the terms they had been elected to, the members of the Council would act  in accordance 
with the Law on Broadcasting. If they were found to be working contrary to the provisions 
that the Law contained, the members of the Broadcasting Council would be discharged 
prior to the terms of offices they had been appointed to had expired.              
</p>
<p> Under the new Law on Audio and Audiovisual Media Services which entered into 
force on 3 January this year, the number of members sitting on the Council of the Agency 
for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services has been reduced, being proposed by the two 
national associations of journalists with the largest number of members, the Interuniversity 
Conference, the Bar Chamber of the Republic of Macedonia, the Federation of Trade 
Unions of Macedonia, the Committee on Election and Appointment Issues at the Assembly 
of the Republic of Macedonia and the national Association of the Units of Local Self-
Government. The new Law has retained the previously prescribed requirements for 
professionalism and prevention of political and economic influence over the members of 
the Council.  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraphs 38 and 48 
</b></p>
<p> In the period from April to July 2013 the Ministry of Information Society and 
Administration conducted a wide consultation process with all stakeholders regarding the 
Media Law and the Law on Audio and Audiovisual Media Services. The consultation 
process included online consultations and public hearings. Expertise and opinions were 
received and properly incorporated from the Council of Europe, OSCE and the European 
Commission through TAIEX. The public hearing on the laws continued after their entry 
into parliamentary procedure with the participation of experts. 
</p>
<p> As a result of lengthy consultative process and accepted amendments, the Parliament 
adopted the Law on the Media and the Law on Audio and Audiovisual Media Services in 
December 2013.  
</p>
<p> The newly adopted Law on the Media lays down the basic principles and conditions 
that the media publishers (radio broadcasters, printed or electronic media publishers) need 
to comply with when performing their activities. The Law has been harmonized with the 
documents/standards of the Council of Europe and the OSCE relating to ensuring freedom 
of expression and freedom of the media.  
</p>
<p> The newly adopted Law on Audio and Audiovisual Media Services fully 
incorporates the EU Directive 2010/13/EU on Audiovisual Services. The goal of the Law 
on Audio and Audiovisual Media Services is to ensure the development of the audio and 
audiovisual media services, the development of the independent production, to encourage, 
upgrade and protect the cultural identity, minority languages and traditions in Macedonia, 
the respect of cultural and religious differences, to encourage the culture of public dialogue 
between citizens from different communities in order to enhance mutual understanding and 
tolerance, to encourage the educational and scientific development. Furthermore, this Law 
aims at providing protection of the interests of the users, especially minors, development of 
the media literacy, and ensuring a transparent, independent, efficient and accountable 
public broadcaster and transparent, independent, efficient and accountable regulatory body 
in the area of audio and audiovisual media services.  
</p>
<p> The new Law on Audio and Audiovisual Media Services provides that all 
government institutions are obliged to spend its funds for advertising in a non-
discriminatory, objective and transparent way in accordance with the provisions of the Law 
for public procurements. 
</p>
<p> The dialogue with the journalists further continued after the laws were adopted. This 
resulted in a number of amendments adopted by Parliament on 21 January 2014. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>adopted amendments to the Law on Audio and Audiovisual Media Services specifically 
promote and encourage freedom of expression, as well as revise the list of bodies 
authorized to propose members of the Council, including two most representative 
associations of journalists, ensures protection against court decision for dismissal of the 
Director of the Agency. The amendments also provide that restriction on media content 
should comply with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p> With the amendments to the media law it is prescribed that the contents published in 
media are not subject regulated by the Law and none of the provisions should be interpreted 
in a way that means regulation of the media content. The amendments exclude electronic 
publications from the Law, liability for publication of certain information and the obligation 
to adopt statutes of the media. 
</p>
<p> In the area of self-regulation, in December 2013, the Council for media ethics was 
established as the first self-regulatory media body. It is independent, collective body of 
editors, journalists, media owners and members of the public. The first meeting of the 
Steering Committee of the Council for Media Ethics was held and the president and the 
deputy-president of the Council were elected. The Statute of the Council for Media Ethics 
as well as the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board and the Steering Board, were 
adopted. Additionally, a call for election of members of the Appeal committee that will act 
upon citizens' complaints was published in order to elect its 7 members. Out of the 7 
members, two will be representatives of the media owners, two - journalists appointed by 
the AJM and three will be representatives of the public. 
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraphs 39, 40 and 41 
</b></p>
<p> The Law on Audio and Audiovisual Media Services contains provisions pertaining 
to the national public broadcasting service, i.e. the Macedonian Radio and Television 
(MRT), its way of operating and the obligations it has assumed as the public broadcasting 
service. The MRT has been structured in line with the universal model of the European 
Broadcasting Union (EBU).  
<b> </b>Article 102 of the new Law on Audio and Audiovisual Media Services stipulates 
that, if they had allocated funds within their budgets for informing and introducing the 
general public to their services or activities, the state institutions and state administration  
bodies, the public enterprises and institutions, the units of local self-government, the public 
establishments and institutions, as well as the legal entities with public competences are 
obliged to pursue those activities in a non-discriminatory, objective and transparent manner, 
in a procedure as set forth by the Law on Public Procurements.  
</p>
<p> As parts of its ongoing and regular operations, the Government of the Republic of 
Macedonian has been pursuing activities aimed at updating the citizens on certain projects 
it has been implementing, informing them, at the same time, on certain rights and 
opportunities it is introducing for the citizens to utilize, as well as promoting values that are 
of interest to the citizens. Those sets of information and promotion activities are being 
pursued via all national and local media such as Sitel TV, Telma TV, Kanal 5, Alsat TV, 
Alfa TV and other national and local TV outlets.  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraph 45 
</b></p>
<p> As regards the events that took place at the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia 
on 24 December 2012, it should be clarified that the events in question did not entail 
&#8220;journalists being expelled from the national Parliament floor,&#8221; but what actually happened 
was that it was found necessary to advise the journalists to leave the Assembly&#8217;s plenary </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>hall until conditions for the Assembly resuming its normal work and continuing its session 
are once again created.  
</p>
<p> For the purpose of clarifying the event, an Inquiry Committee was established in 
August 2013. 
</p>
<p> The recommendations of the Inquiry Committee report for December 24 are: 
Amendments to the Assembly&#8217;s Rules of Procedure - harmonization with the Law on the 
Assembly; regulation of the manner of work of the coordination at the Assembly's 
President; regulation of the procedure for the Budget adoption process; regulation of the 
procedure for managing the plenum and working bodies of Assembly; amendments to the 
provisions on the inquiry committees and the supervisory role of the Assembly, Adoption 
of the Code of Ethics for MPs and for the Assembly service; Separation of the security 
service from the Ministry of Interior and establishing a separate service for the security of 
the Assembly; Enhancing the dialogue between journalists and the Coordination; Adoption 
of the Assembly Calendar; Amendments of the Law on Assembly &#8211; setting up the 
movement regime around the Assembly during sessions; Amendments of the Criminal 
Code - to envisage qualified elements when the performer is a person holding public office, 
elected and appointed official.  
</p>
<p><b>  Paragraphs 68 and 69 
</b></p>
<p> The Republic of Macedonia remains permanently commitment to encouraging 
diversity in the media. Apart from the Macedonian Radio and Television  which maintains 
a separate channel especially reserved for broadcasting programs in the languages of the 
ethnic communities, 45 TV outlets in Macedonia are broadcasting in the Macedonian 
language, 12 in the Albanian, 2 in the Albanian and Macedonian in parallel, 2 in the Roma 
and Macedonian, 1 in the Bosniak, 2 in the Macedonian, Turkish and Albanian in parallel 
and 1 in the Bosniak, Macedonian and Albanian languages in parallel. The situation of 
radio broadcasters is similar &#8211; 63 of them are broadcasting in the Macedonian, 11 in the 
Albanian, 1 in the Macedonian, Serbian and Croatian in parallel, 1 in the Albanian and 
Macedonian, 1 in the Albanian, Macedonian and Turkish and 1 in the Roma and 
Macedonian languages in parallel. As outlined, the number of media broadcasting program 
in the languages of the ethnic communities living in the Republic of Macedonia closely 
corresponds to the overall sizes of the different ethnic groups in the country.  
</p>
<p> As part of its competences, the Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services 
pays close attention to ensuring media pluralism i.e. external pluralism in terms of media 
ownership and unlawful media concentration and internal pluralism in terms of media 
genres, geographic/local pluralism, media literacy, political pluralism and pluralism of 
media types.   
</p>
<p><b> External pluralism:</b> The Law on Audio and Audiovisual Media Services allows for 
horizontal integration of the media, but, at the same time, sets limitations as to the shares in 
founding capital, as well as with regard to the number of broadcasters that a single natural 
or legal person is allowed to own. In order to prevent political parties, state institutions, 
units of local self-government, holders of public offices and members of their families 
exerting influence on the media, under the said Law, they are not allowed to be involved in 
broadcasting activity or act as founders or cofounders of media or, for that matter, have any 
kind of share in the ownership of broadcasters. Certain provisions have also been 
incorporated in the Law stipulating that unlawful media concentration are also considered 
cases in which natural persons that are founders of broadcasting companies or are holders 
of executive positions in broadcasting companies are, at the same time, attested to be 
founders of: a printed media publisher printing a daily newspaper which is being distributed 
around the same area in which radio and/or television program is being broadcast; a news </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.5

</p>
<p>agency, an advertising company, market and public opinion research company, a company 
engaged in distributing audiovisual works, a film  production company or an operator of 
electronic communication networks broadcasting or re-broadcasting radio and television 
program.  
</p>
<p><b> Internal pluralism</b>: The media landscape in Macedonia is also quite diverse in 
terms of pluralism of media genres (diversity in media in view of the three basic media 
functions of informing, entertaining and educating; diversity of topics covered which is also 
one of the criteria being considered when issuing broadcasting licences), as well as with 
regard to pluralism in the types of media present  - the coexistence of media with different 
tasks and different sources of funding such as commercial media, non-profit radio outlets, 
and the public broadcasting service. The media scene in the country is also diverse in terms 
of both geographic/local pluralism (having different forms of presenting the local and 
regional communities, as well as interests, in the media is also one of the criteria for 
granting broadcasting licences) and in view of political pluralism (which also forms part of 
the programming principles upon which the radio and television programs are grounded). In  
2014, the Agency is expected to draft certain analyses over the different individual aspects 
of pluralism or, more precisely, an analysis of the issue of how political pluralism as one of 
the aspects of media pluralism is maintained during an ongoing election campaign. Another 
analysis will be focused on identifying the manner in which control of media ownership is 
maintained for purposes of ensuring media pluralism.  
</p>
<p> The <b>2013-2017 Strategy on the Development of Broadcasting Activity</b> is 
currently  being implemented through the activities that have been envisaged under the 
Action Plan for the Strategy&#8217;s implementation. Hence, the following activities have been 
completed under the aforementioned Action Plan in the period between May 2013 and 
February 2014:  
</p>
<p> * The May 2013 amendments to the Law on Broadcasting Activity defined the 
position of the operators of digital terrestrial multiplexes which are now legally obliged to 
broadcast the programs of the Macedonian broadcasters, laying down the procedure on how 
the existing broadcasters are to change from transmitting analogue to digital terrestrial 
signal (Item 3 of Section 4 of the Action Plan &#8211; Regulating Audio and Audiovisual Media 
Services).  
 * Following the adoption of the new Law on Audio and Audiovisual Media 
Services, as well as the Law on the Media in December 2013, certain activities have been 
completed under Section 1 of the Action Plan entitled Pluralism and Diversity of Program 
Content; Section 3 entitled Economic Potential of the Broadcasting Industry and Section 4 
entitled Regulation Concerning Audio and Audiovisual Media Services.  
</p>
<p> Activities are also under way for drafting the secondary legislation stemming from 
the aforementioned new media laws that are being pursued in parallel with the activities 
aimed at enhancing media literacy. All of them are being pursued as part of the IPA 2009 
project entitled Strengthening the Administrative Capacities of Telecommunications and 
Media Regulatory Bodies for Efficiently Regulating New Digital and Multipurpose 
Program Services. It is expected that the secondary legislation will be drafted by the middle 
of this year and the Media Literacy Program by the end of it. The first stage is expected to 
produce both a methodology and toolsets for gauging media literacy among both children 
and adults (in the first half of 2014) which is to be followed by research projects on the 
levels of media literacy in the country. The results acquired from these research projects 
will be used as the basis for developing the national Media Literacy Program. </p>

<p><b>  Paragraphs 70, 71 and 75  
</b></p>
<p> As part of its competences, the Broadcasting Council, <i>inter alia</i>, took due care of 
protecting the freedom of expression by determining whether a media outlet had gone 
beyond the legislative provisions, i.e. the media outlet had been discriminatory or had used 
hate speech. On several occasions, the Council discussed cases of infringing upon the legal 
provisions in this respect in the media, especially cases of ethnic intolerance, labelling and 
stigmatizing of journalists &#8211; political opponents, homophobic statements, etc. In  
elaborating such cases, the Council took into consideration Article 16 of the Constitution in 
reference with other constitutional provision guaranteeing human rights; as well as the 
European Human Rights Convention and the case-law of the European Human Rights 
Court; relevant recommendations of the Council of Europe and the Council of Europe 
Declaration on freedom of political debate in the media; taking into consideration other 
documents as well, such as the <i>Council of Europe Manual on Hate Speech;</i> then researches 
and analyses of the Macedonian media landscape prepared by various Macedonian 
research, education and scientific institutions; and the Glossary of terms in the area of 
discrimination, published by the Macedonian Centre for International Cooperation and the 
OSCE.  
</p>
<p> The Law Amending and Supplementing the Law on the Media envisages that the 
prohibition &quot;to encourage and spread discrimination, intolerance or hatred on grounds of 
race, gender, religion or nationality&quot; must be in line with the case-law of the European 
Human Rights Court. Despite the fact that the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of the Republic of 
Macedonia has the direct competence of undertaking proceedings in cases of hate speech, 
the Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services undertakes regular activities to 
upgrade its capacities to deal with cases of hate speech in the media. Hence, activities in 
this respect have been envisaged under the IPA Project &#8220;Strengthening administrative 
capacities of regulatory bodies for the media and telecommunications for purposes of their 
efficient regulating the new digital and multipurpose services&#8221;; in addition, there is the 
Council of Europe Project &quot;Advancing the freedom of expression and informing and the 
freedom of the media in Southeast Europe&#8221;; then there is the IPA 2011 project &#8220;Freedom of 
Expression - Support to Media Reforms&quot;. In this context, there will be a TAIEX mission in 
June 2014, i.e. a study visit of a media regulatory body in Germany.  
</p>
<p> The Law Amending and Supplementing the Criminal Code, adopted in February 
2014  introduced amendments to the Chapter relating to general rules for meting out a 
sentence, i.e. Article 39, paragraph 5; as well as amendments to provisions relating to 
crimes against human rights and freedoms, i.e. violation of the equality of citizens- Article 
137, paragraph 1; then provisions relating to the crime of threatening the security - Article 
144, paragraph 4 and Article 319, which specifically relates to the crime of <i>Causing hate, 
discord or intolerance on national racial, religious and other discriminatory grounds. </i>  
</p>
<p> These amendments expanded the protective characteristics to sex, race, skin colour, 
gender, belonging to a marginalized group, ethnic origin, language, nationality, social 
origin, religion or confession, other types of belief, education, political belonging, personal 
or social status, mental and physical disability, age, family or marital status, property status, 
health condition or on any other grounds established by law or by ratified international 
agreements.<b>

<p> Within the Ministry of Interior Centre for Organized Crime there is a Unit for 
Computer Crime which acts on all anonymous complaints regarding the hate speech.   
</p>
<p> The Commission against Discrimination reacted publicly to the incidents against the 
LGBT and called for tolerance, respect for equality and non-discrimination. The 
Commission takes part in various events linked to the promotion of rights of LGBT and, 
together with the <i>Hera</i> NGO, applied for the <i>Matra</i> project to focus on a survey of the 
situation of LGBT population in Macedonia.  
</p>
<p> The Commission acts on complaints of grounds of sexual orientation. Since the start 
of its work, 13 applications on this ground were lodged (5 in 2013). In 1 case 
discrimination was confirmed, while settlement was reached in one case. In 6 cases no 
discrimination was found and 5 are being processed.  
</p>
<p> In the area of non-discrimination and equal rights, a National Network for Fight 
against Homophobia and Transphobia was established as a network of 15 civil society 
organizations and informal groups.  Its purpose is to organize activities for greater visibility 
of the LGBTI community and promotion of their basic human rights.

<p><b>  Paragraphs 65 and 92

<p> The existent Law on Electronic Communications has been harmonized with the 
package of EU directives on electronic communications of 2002. As an EU candidate 
country, the Republic of Macedonia is obliged to align its national legislation with the EU 
acquis. Thus, the Macedonian legislation needs to be aligned with the new package of EU 
directives concerning electronic communications.  
</p>
<p> Taking the foregoing into consideration, an interdepartmental task force was 
established in September 2012. This task force was composed of representatives of state 
bodies and agencies and of the private sector and its goal was to draft a new Law on 
Electronic Communications. 
</p>
<p> In February 2014, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia adopted the new Law 
on Electronic Communications. 
</p>
<p>The new Law on Electronic Communications incorporates: 
</p>
<p><b> I. Directive 2009/140/EC  (&#8220;The Better Regulation Directive&#8220; ) amending: 
</b> - Framework Directive (2002/21/EC), 
 - Access Directive (2002/19/EC ), 
 - Authorisation Directive (2002/20/EC). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Directive 2009/136/EC (&#8220;The Citizens&#8217; Rights Directive&#8220;) amending: 
</b> - Universal Service Directive (2002/22/EC ), 
 - ePrivacy Directive (2002/58/EC) 
</p>
<p><b> III. Directive 2006/26/EC on the retention of data. 
</b></p>
<p>As regards the national legislation, the new Law on Electronic Communications was 
harmonized with:  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p> - the Law on Audio and Audi-Visual Media Services;  
</p>
<p> - the Law on Protection of Personal Data;  
</p>
<p> - the Law on Communication Interception; 
</p>
<p> - the Law on Misdemeanours;  
</p>
<p> - the laws governing construction and expropriation, etc. 
</p>
<p> The new Law on Electronic Communications takes into consideration the ruling of 
the Constitutional Court of 2010 annulling certain articles of the then-existent Law on 
Electronic Communications that concerned communication interception. 
</p>
<p> The conditions under which communication may be intercepted are set by the Law 
on Criminal Proceedings. Specifically, Article 235 of the Criminal Code stipulates for 
which criminal acts special investigative measures may be adopted. (The article is aligned 
with international norms.) 
 The Communication Interception Law governs the supervision and control over the 
implementation of the special investigative measure of communication interception. For 
purposes of supervision, the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia establishes a 
commission composed of MPs. The commission is composed of a chair, four members, a 
deputy chair and four deputy members. The chair of the commission is elected from the 
ranks of the opposition MPs.
