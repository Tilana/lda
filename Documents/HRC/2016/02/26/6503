<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the purposes, principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the importance of the core international human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> the relevance of optional protocols of the core international human rights 
instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that 2008 marks the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with appreciation</i> of the initiative of member and associate States of the 
Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR), to present a proposal to elaborate a set of human 
rights goals to be pursued, inspired by the Millennium Development Goals, to promote the 
implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and also taking note with great 
appreciation of the process towards broadening cross-regional support for that initiative, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking into account</i> that the above-mentioned initiative could bring more visibility and 
public awareness to the United Nations human rights system with a view to the promotion and 
protection of all human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and mutually 
reinforcing, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Decides</i> to initiate an open-ended intergovernmental process in order to elaborate, on 
a consensual basis, a set of human rights voluntary goals, to promote the realization and </p>

 page 5 
 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in accordance with States&#8217; 
international human rights obligations and commitments to be launched on 10 December 2008 
during the celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also decides</i> to the end described in paragraph 1 above to take the following steps: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To invite States to refer to the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and to human rights voluntary goals at the High-level Segment of 
the Human Rights Council at its session in March 2008, and to hold a panel with the aim of 
exchanging views on the issue of human rights voluntary goals at that session; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To invite the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
present to the Human Rights Council by its session in June 2008 information on the programmes 
and activities to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To hold thereafter open-ended intergovernmental informal consultations to elaborate 
a set of human rights voluntary goals to be presented to the Human Rights Council, on a 
consensual basis, through a draft resolution to be adopted by the Council at the end of its session 
in September 2008; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Further decides</i> that the open-ended intergovernmental process will lead to the elaboration 
of human rights voluntary goals under the following issues: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Universal ratification of the core international human rights instruments; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Elaboration, in each country, where they do not exist, of national human rights 
programmes, and the creation of national institutions responsible for human rights issues, in 
accordance with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action of 1993 and the Paris 
Principles; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Adoption of a legal, institutional and policy framework at the national level in order 
to ensure the promotion and protection of all human rights; </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/L.11/Add.1

<p> (<i>d</i>) Definition, within the framework of national human rights programmes, of targets 
and actions in the field of capacity-building as well as of a programme of human rights education 
and identification of needs and shortcomings related to international cooperation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Definition within the framework of national human rights programmes of targets and 
actions in compliance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, inter alia, to eliminate 
</p>
<p>discrimination of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Emphasizes</i> that such human rights voluntary goals are to be regarded as reinforcing 
and by no means as replacing, either totally or partially, existing human rights obligations and 
commitments, including the implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 
</p>
<p> 5.<i> Welcomes</i> participation in the process of representatives of the United Nations and of 
regional human rights systems, as well as of all relevant stakeholders, according to the rules of 
procedure of the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Decides</i> to consider the results of the open-ended intergovernmental process in elaborating 
a set of human rights voluntary goals to be submitted to the Human Rights Council, on a 
consensual basis, through a draft resolution, by its session in September 2008; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Encourages</i> States and all relevant stakeholders to present to the Human Rights Council, 
during the commemoration process, the projects and activities undertaken at the national, 
regional and international levels on the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights.

</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>

<p> A/HRC/6/L.11/Add.1 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights on the

own property and to adequate housing, including resolution 2005/25 of 15 April 2005, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights 
Council and 5/2 on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of the Human

were accorded full and equal rights to own land and other property, and the right to adequate 
housing, including through the right to inheritance, and to undertake administrative reforms and 
other necessary measures to give women the same right as men to credit, capital, appropriate 
technologies, access to markets and information, </p>

Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in the promotion of the rights related to adequate housing, 
and in this regard noting the affirmation in its general comment No. 4 that the human right to

rights, as well as general comments Nos. 7 and 16, 
</p>

<p><b>6/29.  Right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p> <i>Aware</i> that, for millions of people throughout the world, the full enjoyment of the right to 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health still remains a distant goal and that, 
in many cases, especially for those living in poverty, this goal remains remote, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard 
of physical and mental health is a human right as reflected, inter alia, in article 25, paragraph 1, 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 12 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, as well as, with respect to non-discrimination, in article 5 (e) (iv) of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and in article 12, 
paragraph 1, of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, and that such a right derives from the inherent dignity of the human person,

the Commission on Human Rights, </p>

<p> <i>Convinced</i> of the need to address the rise in all parts of the world of religious extremism 
affecting the rights of individuals and groups based on religion or belief, the situations of 
violence and discrimination that affect many women as well as individuals from other vulnerable 
groups in the name of religion or belief or due to cultural and traditional practices, and the abuse 
of religion or belief for ends inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations and other 
relevant instruments of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that a formal or legal distinction at the national level between different kinds of 
religions or faith-based communities may, in some cases, constitute discrimination and may 
impinge on the enjoyment of the freedom of religion or belief,  
</p>

bodies and the media have an important role to play in promoting tolerance, respect and freedom 
of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of interreligious and intra-religious dialogue and the role of 
religious and other non-governmental organizations in promoting tolerance in matters relating to 
religion or belief, and welcoming different initiatives in this regard, including the Alliance of 
Civilizations, the programmes led by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization and the High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and 
Cooperation for Peace, held at Headquarters on 4 and 5 October 2007, 
</p>
<p> <i>Seriously concerned</i> at the slow progress in the implementation of the Declaration on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, 
</p>
<p> <i>Believing</i> that further intensified efforts are therefore required to promote and protect the 
right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief and to eliminate all forms of hatred, 
intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief, as also noted at the World Conference 
against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, 
</p>
<p> <i>Having conducted</i> an assessment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on freedom 
of religion or belief in the form of an interactive dialogue during its present session, in

violence directed against members of many religious and other communities in various parts of 
the world, including cases motivated by Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and Christianophobia; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses concern</i> over the persistence of institutionalized or social intolerance and 
discrimination practiced against many in the name of or due to their religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 4.  <i>Recalls</i> that legal procedures pertaining to religious or belief-based groups and places 
of worship are not a prerequisite for the exercise of the right to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 5.  <i>Emphasizes</i> that such procedures as described in paragraph 4 above, at the national 
or local levels, as and when legally required, should be non-discriminatory in order to contribute 
to the effective protection of the right of all persons to practise their religion or belief either 
individually or in community with others and in public or private; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Condemns</i> any advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence, whether it involves the use of print, audio-visual and 
electronic media or any other means; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to 
make efforts to coordinate in the field of human rights the activities of relevant United Nations

all persons to write, issue and disseminate relevant publications in these areas; </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/L.11/Add.1 
page 46 
 
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) To ensure that, in accordance with appropriate national legislation and in conformity 
with international human rights law, the freedom of all persons and members of groups to 
establish and maintain religious, charitable or humanitarian institutions is fully respected and 
protected;

<p> (<i>i</i>) To ensure that, on account of religion or belief or the expression or manifestation of 
religion or belief, no one within their jurisdiction is deprived of the right to life, liberty or 
security of person, subjected to torture or arbitrary arrest or detention, or denied the rights to

</p>
<p> (<i>m</i>)  To promote and encourage, through education and other means, including regional 
or international cultural exchanges, understanding, tolerance and respect in all matters relating to

</p>
<p> 10. <i>Stresses</i> the need to strengthen dialogue, inter alia through the Global Agenda for

<p> A/HRC/6/L.11/Add.1 
 page 47 
 
</p>
<p>interact with various entities in the United Nations system and coordinate their contribution to 
dialogue; 
</p>
<p> 11.  <i>Invites</i> all actors to address in the context of that dialogue, inter alia, the following 
issues within the framework of international human rights: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>)  The rise of religious extremism affecting religions in all parts of the world;

within religions or beliefs, at all levels and with a broader participation including of women, to 
promote greater tolerance, respect and mutual understanding; 
</p>

adverse consequences on the enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief of all 
members of the religious communities concerned; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Further emphasizes</i> that, as underlined by the Human Rights Committee, restrictions 
on the freedom to manifest religion or belief are permitted only if limitations are prescribed by 
law, are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and 
freedoms of others, and are applied in a manner that does not vitiate the right to freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Recommends</i> that the United Nations and other actors, including non-governmental 
organizations and bodies and groups based on religion or belief, in their efforts to promote 
freedom of religion or belief, ensure the widest possible dissemination of the text of the 
Declaration, in as many different languages as possible, and promote its implementation; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief; </p>

Rapporteur to the protection, promotion and universal implementation of the right to freedom of 
religion or belief; 
</p>

religion or belief for a further period of three years and, in this context, invites the Special

necessary resources to enable her/him to discharge her/his mandate fully; 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Urges</i> all Governments to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur and to respond
