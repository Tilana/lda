<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report, prepared pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/38 and 
resolution 1/102 of the Human Rights Council, presents and analyses information on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression from United Nations 
sources, high-level national officials and institutions, non-governmental organizations and 
individuals, gathered by the Special Rapporteur in relation to his visit to Ukraine, from 14 to 
18 May 2007. 
</p>
<p> Since its independence, gained in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union 
in 1991, Ukraine has been striving for economic and social development as well as rapid 
consolidation of democracy. The current situation, marked by strong polarization and political 
instability, has been hindering the blossoming of a full democratic system based on the rule of 
law, good governance and human rights.  
</p>
<p> In spite of improvements since 2004, the overall state of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression is still not in line with the spirit and the contents of international human rights 
standards and the exercise of democracy.  
</p>
<p> With regard to the media, a number of journalists and other professionals have been 
victims of violence by various gangs and other informal groups, allegedly linked to some State 
security organs and academic institutions. Furthermore, many journalists, especially from the 
regions outside the capital, are under severe pressure and intimidation from local authorities and 
are often brought to justice and judged with great severity. Conversely, undue delays in the 
determination of cases of violence against journalists are a common feature and perpetrators 
have frequently not been brought to justice.  
 Proliferation of unprofessional publications and dependence on political and economic 
lobbies are amongst the most notable deficiencies in the media environment. The quality of 
journalism needs to be improved through adequate training in media ethics, and on the 
importance of respecting human rights, especially the right to privacy. Journalists&#8217; 
representatives should be allowed to carry out their mandates freely, without external 
interference, and the activities of various institutional organs entrusted with the responsibility 
over matters related to broadcasting and dissemination of information should be rationalized. 
Appointment or election of their members should be done in a transparent way.  
</p>
<p> The advocacy of racial and ethnic hatred, which is aggravated by beatings, physical 
assaults and murders perpetrated against foreigners residing in the country, including accredited 
diplomats and foreign students, ethnic groups and migrants, is a worrying trend in the country. In 
particular, the psychological or physical harm resulting from such violence could heighten 
domestic tensions and it taints irremediably the reputation of Ukraine as a tolerant and friendly 
society. All sides, particularly the Government, need to make more concerted efforts to protect 
and promote human rights of all individuals residing in the country. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present document is the full report of the mission of the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Ambeyi Ligabo, to 
Ukraine, held from 14 to 18 May 2007 at the invitation of the Government. This document 
contains information and opinions from various sources, received by the Special Rapporteur 
prior and following his visit to the country.  
</p>
<p>2. The contents of the present document refer to the situation prevailing in Ukraine, if not 
otherwise stated, at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. For the sake of clarity, the Special 
Rapporteur reiterates that his mandate does not concern exclusively the right to the promotion 
and protection of freedom of opinion and expression of the media, but it includes all forms of 
opinion and expression as exercised by citizens, groups and associations regarding civil, 
political, social, economic and cultural matters.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur would like to mention that in the preparation of his mission and 
his report, he consulted material from United Nations sources, particularly the Sixth Periodic 
Report submitted  by the Government of Ukraine under Article 40 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights (CCPR/C/UKR/6, 11 April 2006),  the Concluding Observations by 
the Human Rights Committee (CCPR/C/UKR/6, 2 November 2006); the concluding 
observations of the Committee Against Racial Discrimination (CERD/C/UKR/CO/18, 8 
February 2007) on the seventeenth and eighteenth periodic reports of Ukraine 
(CERD/C/UKR/18); the reports of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(E/C.12/1/Add.65, 2001) and the core document submitted by the Government of Ukraine 
(HRI/CORE/1/Add.63/Rev.1, 15 January 1998).  
</p>
<p>4. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with State and Government officials, as well 
as representatives of the media, trade unions, non-governmental organizations working in the 
field of human rights and members of the civil society. He also held an exchange of views with 
members of the diplomatic corps and senior officials of international organizations. 
</p>
<p>5. On 7 July 2007, the Government of Ukraine sent to the Special Rapporteur additional 
information and observations on several issues which were discussed during his visit. The 
contents of that document were taken into account by the Special Rapporteur in the preparation 
of this report. The full text of the document is available in the archives of the OHCHR 
Secretariat. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Ukraine for allowing him to 
carry out his mission in an effective way. The Special Rapporteur would also like to express his 
gratitude to all national and international personalities, institutions, members of the media, trade 
unions, non-governmental organizations and individuals with whom he met and had a 
comprehensive exchange of opinions and information. Moreover, he wishes to thank the 
United Nations Office in the country for its support and assistance.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.2

</p>
<p><b>I.  BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p>7. Ukraine gained independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and since then 
is trying to consolidate its European credentials in spite of some domestic and external 
resistance. Western Ukraine has close historical ties with Europe, particularly Poland. Both 
Orthodoxy and the Greek Catholic, or Uniate, faith have many followers there. The 1986 
accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station brought the region on the front stage. 
About 8 per cent of Ukraine&#8217;s territory was contaminated as were large areas in neighboring 
Belarus and millions of peoples have suffered as a result.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>8. While Ukrainian nationalist sentiments are traditionally strong in the western areas, which 
became part of Ukraine only when the Soviet Union expanded in the aftermath of World War II, 
a significant minority of the population of Ukraine are Russians or of Russian culture and roots. 
Russian influence is particularly strong in the industrialized east, where the Orthodox religion is 
predominant, as well as in Crimea, the base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the homeland of 
the Crimean Tartars, an ethnic group who was accused of collaborating with Nazi Germany and 
massively deported to Central Asia in 1944. Approximately 250,000 of them have returned to 
Crimea since the fall of Soviet Union. Russia is also the single largest trading partner of Ukraine, 
which depends on Russia for its gas supplies like, to various extents, other European countries. 
</p>
<p>9. The first president after independence, former Communist Party official Leonid Kravchuk, 
presided over a period of transition marked by economic decline. Following the victory of 
Viktor Yanukovych - the candidate backed by outgoing president Leonid Kuchma and leader of 
the Party of Regions - in the 2004 presidential elections, Viktor Yushchenko and the supporters 
of his coalition (Our Ukraine - People&#8217;s Self-Defense Block) took to the streets claiming that the 
vote had been marred by numerous irregularities. After ten days of peaceful demonstrations, 
dubbed the Orange Revolution, a recount was ordered in a very tense atmosphere and 
Yushchenko finally became president in early 2005.  
</p>
<p>10. Regarded as a pro-Western liberal reformer, Yushchenko&#8217;s claims to bring Ukraine within 
the circle of the European Union (2015 has been mooted as possible entry date for EU 
membership) and to seek future NATO membership found remarkable internal resistance from 
pro-Russian citizens and from Russia itself.  Yushchenko, who was credited with steering 
through successful economic reforms while serving as prime minister under Kuchma&#8217;s 
presidency between 1999 and 2001, has been facing a slowdown in economic growth that swept 
away the wave of optimism generated by the Orange Revolution.  
</p>
<p>11. In the aftermath of March 2006 parliamentary elections, in which the Party of Regions 
topped the poll, Viktor Yanukovych became prime minister through the support of a coalition 
with Socialist and Communist party. As a result, political power is now shared by two strongly 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Ukraine inherited the third largest nuclear 
</p>
<p>arsenal in the world and the option of whether or not to return these weapons to Russia or be 
considered a nuclear weapons state.  In the end, Ukraine decided to return the nuclear arsenal to 
Russia and to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as non-nuclear weapons state signing the 
START I treaty. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.2

</p>
<p>antagonistic parties while their supporters, especially those of the Party of Regions, have been 
frequently occupying important streets and squares, most of the time in a peaceful way. This 
climate of constant confrontation has developed anxiety for the future and great uncertainty in all 
citizens.  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity of witnessing directly a striking example of 
the consequences of polarization: at the time of his visit, both the Constitutional Court and the 
National Electoral Committee were besieged by supporters of the Party of Regions. While 
pacific demonstrations are surely instrumental to the progress of democracy, on the other hand, 
the blockade of core national institutions puts an undue pressure on administrators and hinders 
their work which could not be carried out with the necessary impartiality and peace of mind.  
</p>
<p>13. A former governor of Donetsk Region in eastern Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych was prime 
minister during Leonid Kuchma&#8217;s presidency between 2002 and 2004. Although known for his 
pro-Russian stance, on becoming Prime Minister Yanukovych undertook to pursue reforms but 
seemingly reduced President Yushchenko&#8217;s engagement for full integration with the European 
Union and NATO. 
</p>
<p><b>II. NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LEGAL AND  
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Constitution of Ukraine was adopted on 28 June 1996 by the Verkhovna Rada 
(Parliament of Ukraine). In its Article 32, the Constitution affirms that<b> &#8220;</b>The collection, storage, 
use, and dissemination of confidential information about a person without his or her consent 
shall not be permitted, except in cases determined by law, and only in the interests of national 
security, economic welfare, and human rights. Every citizen has the right to examine information 
about him or herself, that is not a state secret or other secret protected by law, at the bodies of 
state power, bodies of local self-government, institutions, and organizations. &#8230;&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>15. Article 34 states that &#8220;Everyone is guaranteed the right to freedom of thought and speech, 
and to the free expression of his or her views and beliefs. Everyone has the right to freely collect, 
store, use, and disseminate information by oral, written, or other means of his or her choice. The 
exercise of these rights may be restricted by law in the interests of national security, territorial 
indivisibility or public order, with the purpose of preventing disturbances or crimes, protecting 
the health of the population, the reputation or rights of other persons, preventing the publication 
of information received confidentially, or supporting the authority and impartiality of justice.&#8221;<b> 
</b>16. Article 36 reads: &#8220;Citizens of Ukraine have the right to freedom of association in political 
parties and public organizations for the exercise and protection of their rights and freedoms and 
for the satisfaction of their political, economic, social, cultural and other interests, with the 
exception of restrictions established by law in the interests of national security and public order, 
the protection of the health of the population or the protection of rights and freedoms of other 
persons. (&#8230;) Citizens have the right to take part in trade unions with the purpose of protecting 
their labor and socio-economic rights and interests. (&#8230;) Trade unions are formed without prior 
permission on the basis of the free choice of their members. All trade unions have equal rights. 
Restrictions on membership in trade unions are established exclusively by this Constitution and </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.2 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>the laws of Ukraine. No one may be forced to join any association of citizens or be restricted in 
his or her rights for belonging or not belonging to political parties or public organizations. All 
associations of citizens are equal before the law.&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>17. Article 39 affirms that &#8220;Citizens have the right to assemble peacefully without arms and to 
hold meetings, rallies, processions, and demonstrations, upon notifying in advance the bodies of 
executive power or bodies of local self-government. Restrictions on the exercise of this right 
may be established by a court in accordance with the law and only in the interests of national 
security and public order, with the purpose of preventing disturbances or crimes, protecting the 
health of the population, or protecting the rights and freedoms of other persons.&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>18. Article 55 reads: &#8220;Human and citizens&#8217; rights and freedoms are protected by the court. 
Everyone is guaranteed the right to challenge in court the decisions, actions or omission of 
bodies of state power, bodies of local self-government, officials, and officers. Everyone has the 
right to appeal for the protection of his or her rights to the Authorized Human Rights 
Representative of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. After exhausting all domestic legal remedies, 
everyone has the right to appeal for the protection of his or her rights and freedoms to the 
relevant international judicial institutions or to the relevant bodies of international organizations 
of which Ukraine is a member or participant. (&#8230;)&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>19. Article 64 (&#8230;) Under conditions of martial law or a state of emergency, 
specific restrictions on rights and freedoms may be established with the indication of the 
period of effectiveness of these restrictions. The rights and freedoms envisaged in 
Articles 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 40, 47, 51, 52, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62 and 63 of this 
Constitution shall not be restricted. 
</p>
<p>20. The President, the Verkhovna Rada and the Congress of Judges each appoint six judges to 
the Constitutional Court. The length of their mandate is nine years without the possibility of 
reappointment; the Chairperson is elected by secret ballot only for one three-year term. The 
Constitutional Court is entrusted with the official interpretation of the Constitution of Ukraine 
and the laws of Ukraine. Its authority comprises decisions deciding on issues of conformity with 
the Constitution (constitutionality) of the following: laws and other legal acts of the Verkhovna 
Rada; acts of the President; acts of the Cabinet of Ministers; legal acts of the Verkhovna Rada of 
the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The Court, on the appeal of the President or the Cabinet of 
Ministers, also provides opinions on the conformity with the Constitution of international treaties 
that are in force, or the international treaties submitted to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for 
granting agreement on their binding nature. 
</p>
<p>21. The Chair and other members of the Constitutional Court met with the Special Rapporteur 
and noted that there were too many laws related to mass media, a fact that generates some 
confusion in respecting rules and regulations. The decriminalization of defamation has increased 
the realm of freedom of expression and helped judges to be more liberal in their sentences 
against media. As a consequence, the amount of fines in civil law proceedings substantially 
decreased. The fact that also the Constitutional Court was under strict monitoring from a number 
of media is definitely positive, but the blockade of the Court&#8217;s premises, enforced by political 
activists, was severely limiting its capacity to take decisions independently and impartially.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>22. The National Office of the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights 
(Ombudsman) is Ukraine&#8217;s national human rights institution established in 1998 as a 
constitutionally-mandated independent human rights mechanism. Elected for a five year-term 
with a one-time possibility of renewal, by a majority of the Parliament deputies, the Ombudsman 
has a broad-based mandate to: protect human rights and freedoms proclaimed by the 
Constitution, domestic law and international agreements; observe and respect rights and 
freedoms through bodies of state power, local self-government and their officials and officers; 
prevent violations or repeat violations; facilitate the process of ensuring compatibility of 
domestic international law; improve and develop international co-operation for protection of 
human rights; prevent discrimination in the enjoyment of rights, and encourage legal knowledge 
among the population. 
</p>
<p>23. The law provides the Ombudsman with unrestricted and unannounced access to any public 
official, including the President; unrestricted access to any government installation, and 
oversight of the implementation of human rights treaties and agreements to which the country is 
a party. All citizens and residents can address their concerns to the Ombudsman, who serves in 
many occasions as an intermediary between citizens and the Constitutional Court. The 
Ombudsman has the right to attend the sessions of the Parliament, the Cabinet of Ministers, the 
Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court and the higher specialized courts, the collegiums of 
procurators&#8217; offices of Ukraine and other collegiate bodies. The Ombudsman may appeal to the 
Constitutional Court of Ukraine with regard to the issue of conformity between the Constitution 
and the laws and the official interpretation of the Constitution. The present Ombudsman, 
Ms. Nina Karpachova, was elected by Parliament in April 1998 and is currently serving her 
second term.<b>2 </b>As of May 2007, the International Coordination Committee of National Human 
Rights Institutions (ICC) did not accredit the institution as in compliance with the Paris 
Principles. 
</p>
<p>24. In her meeting with the Special Rapporteur, the Ombudsperson underlined that one of the 
major challenges faced by the Ukrainian society at present is the arrival of an increasing number 
of refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants. The tense political atmosphere does not help in 
dealing with this phenomenon, which needs clear policy strategies and respect for international 
engagements taken by Ukraine. After a time of optimism in the wake of the 2004 political 
dispute, media independence seems to be facing again the problems related to intimidation from 
political and economic lobbies. While incarceration of journalists is now very rare, media safety 
is still at stake, particularly for those media professionals inquiring on corruption cases. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  CCPR/C/UKR/6, paragraph 5: &#8221;The Office of the Ombudsman lacks adequate resources for its 
</p>
<p>work, even though the Office has key responsibilities including processing complaints about 
serious problems such as prison violence and ethnic discrimination. Many of the Ombudsman&#8217;s 
reform proposals have not been acted upon by the legislature. (art. 2) 
</p>
<p>The State party should supplement the resources of the Office of the Ombudsman, to enable it to 
carry out its work effectively, in particular, by increasing its capacity to investigate and remedy 
both individual complaints and systemic problems.&#8221;<b> </b> </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.2 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>Regrettably, no ultimate solution was found in the Gongadze&#8217;s case,<b>3</b> a somber reminder of the 
dangers linked to media freedom. The Ombudsperson added that her office was treating the cases 
of a few journalists whose rights appeared to be violated. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>25. Ukraine is a party to the following major human rights treaties: the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and its first Optional Protocol concerning individual 
complaints; the International Covenant on Economic, social and cultural rights (CESCR); The 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD); The 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and its Optional 
Protocol (CEDAW); The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment (CAT); the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and its 
Optional Protocols. Ukraine has not signed/ratified the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families; the second 
Optional Protocol to the ICCPR concerning the death penalty and the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture (CAT), while it has accepted the procedures for individual 
complaints under CAT and CERD. Ukraine became a member State of the Council of Europe 
on 9 November 1995. It has acceded or ratified 62 treaties, including many instruments relevant 
to human rights.  
</p>
<p>26. The Human Rights Committee, in its Concluding Observations on Ukraine at its 
eighty-eight session concluded that &#8220;Violent attacks against journalists, as well as the harassment 
of journalists, still pose a persistent threat to the freedom of the press. The Committee is 
concerned by the assassination of journalist Heorhiy Gongadze in November 2000, the killing of 
Ihor Alexsandrov, director of the Donetsk regional television station, in 2001, and the death of 
Volodymr Karachevtsev, head of the Melitopol independent journalists union, in December 
2003. (arts. 6 and 19)&#8221;. The Committee recommended that &#8220;The State party should protect the 
freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to freedom of the press. The State party 
should vigorously investigate and prosecute attacks against journalists.&#8221;<b>4</b> The Government 
provided information to the Special Rapporteur that concerning the case of Mr. Karachevtsev, it 
was found that he committed suicide under the influence of alcohol. Therefore, no criminal case 
was opened.  
</p>
<p>27. The Committee also noted that &#8220;During the 2004 elections, students participating in a 
peaceful protest march to Kiev were arrested and detained <i>en masse</i>. (art. 21)&#8221; and therefore 
recommended that &#8220;The State party should ensure that there are clear standards protecting the 
right of individuals to engage in peaceful assembly and to exercise the right of free expression.&#8221;<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  See paragraphs 47, 54 and 55 below.

</b>  CCPR/C/UKR/6, paragraph 15. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>28. The Committee further stated that &#8220;Problems of anti-Semitism and impositions on Muslim 
religious activities persist in Ukraine. Members of the Jewish community have suffered physical 
assaults, including attacks on Jewish day school students, Yeshiva students, and a rabbi and his 
son in Kiev. The Committee also is concerned by the anti-Semitic activities of the Inter-Regional 
Academy of Personnel Management (MAUP).<b>6</b>  In addition, there are unresolved claims for 
restitution of Muslim religious property, including places of worship, and discrimination against 
the Tatar community in the Crimea. (Articles 20 and 26)&#8221;. In this connection, the Committee 
recommended that &#8220;The State party should ensure that all members of ethnic, religious, or 
linguistic minorities are protected against violence and discrimination. The State party should 
provide robust remedies against these problems. The next periodic report of the State party 
should contain information on human rights training for the police, and the investigation and 
prosecution of acts of private violence.&#8221; <b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>29. While it should be noted that the Committee made concluding observations of the same 
nature after having examined Ukraine&#8217;s fifth periodic report<b>8</b> in 2001, the Committee 
commended the Government and the Office of the Ombudsperson of Ukraine for their concrete 
contribution to its work.  
</p>
<p>30. The Committee against Torture, while examining the fifth periodic report of Ukraine 
(CAT/C/81/Add.1) in May 2007, expressed &#8220;(&#8230;) concern about information on harassment and 
violence against journalists, including murders (<i>e.g.</i> the case of Mr. Georgiy Gongadze), and 
human rights defenders, which severely hamper the role of the mass media and freedom of 
opinion and expression as well as the monitoring activities of civil society with regard to human 
rights.&#8221; The Committee recommended that &#8220;The State party should take all necessary steps to 
ensure that all persons, including those monitoring human rights, are protected from any 
intimidation or violence as a result of their activities, and ensure the prompt, impartial and 
effective investigation of such acts.&#8221;<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>31. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recommended that the State party 
strengthen the provisions in its legal order with respect to the prohibition of discrimination in

<p>32. The Committee also emphasized that the right of trade unions to function freely shall be 
subject to no restrictions, other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a 
democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the 
rights and freedoms of others. The Committee requested the State party to ensure that such 
restrictions contained in the labour law are fully in line with article 8 of the Covenant, and that 
acts of intimidation against trade unions and their leaders are prohibited.<b>11</b>  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  THE SITUATION OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN UKRAINE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  General overview on mass media 
</b></p>
<p>33. Numerous Ukrainian media outlets are private enterprises. Commercial TV networks, 
particularly Inter TV and Studio 1+1, attract the majority of the audience. The FM radio band in 
Kiev counts more than twenty, mainly commercial, stations which are strenuously competing for 
listeners.  
</p>
<p>34. In the dispute surrounding the presidential elections of November 2004, journalists at 
the state-run TV took some distance from the network&#8217;s staunch pro-government line. For 
the first time, majority and opposition&#8217;s opinions were aired in a balanced way while the 
Kuchma years had seen the closure of a number of opposition papers. After his election success, 
Viktor Yushchenko stated that he considered press freedom as being a key element of Ukraine&#8217;s 
overall development.  
</p>
<p>35. During his meetings with NGOs, the Special Rapporteur gathered their perception 
concerning the main problems concerning freedom of the media in Ukraine. The central problem 
that was highlighted by these interlocutors was constant intimidation and other kinds of pressure 
to which media professionals are subject, both from the state and from the media outlets 
themselves. It was highlighted, for example, that the top management in the most important 
media outlets closely monitors the investigative work of the journalists they employ. 
Additionally, the State allegedly still guarantees the media several benefits, especially fiscal and 
financial advantages, which is often a source of pressure and power.  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur also received allegations that members of the Party of Regions 
have intimidated, and in a number of cases attacked, media professionals, particularly in the 
Crimea province. Interlocutors recognized that after the Orange Revolution, some practices and 
policies that led to de facto censorship - such as the &#8220;temniki&#8221;<b>12</b> - have been loosened or

</p>
<p>abolished altogether, which is seen as a positive step. However, it was emphasized that since the 
attacks and intimidation against the media, and the inability of the police and the judiciary to 
elucidate the crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice, have created a state of permanent 
tension and fear among media workers, fostering de facto self-censorship at various degrees. 
</p>
<p>37. Civil society interlocutors also pointed to the lack of transparency of the activities of the 
National Security Council, chaired by the Ukraine&#8217;s President, as a matter of utmost concern. 
This Council is allegedly able to control 80 per cent of the Internet traffic in Ukraine through an 
advanced technological system also in use in other countries. It was alleged that Internet 
providers could only obtain their licenses upon agreement to install this system.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors also pointed out that smear and falsification 
campaigns have been often carried out against human rights activists and trade unionists who are 
addressing sensitive topics such as corruption. However, it was highlighted that the situation 
with regards to defamation and libel trials against media professionals and other opinion-making 
leaders has improved since 2004.<b>13</b> In addition to the decriminalization of defamation, fines 
following a guilty verdict in civil proceedings are now seen as more proportionate.  
</p>
<p>39. Journalists&#8217; associations lamented that political actors continue to influence media 
professionals, especially in electoral periods. At present, pressure is often of an economic nature 
as the State or politically-engaged segments of the private sector own the main media outlets. 
Journalists&#8217; association regretted that a large majority of political personalities and their 
acquaintances seem not to perceive the added value of true freedom of expression and freedom 
of speech because they are, inter alia, still anchored to the old Soviet r&#233;gime philosophy. It was 
felt that a generational change only could modify this state of mind.  
</p>
<p>40. Many of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors also recognized that a share of the 
responsibility for these problems also lie with media workers. A number of journalists were 
believed to engage in partisan attempts to discredit opposing political factions and to have 
ambiguous relations with both the State and large companies. The need for training, upgrading of 
professionalism and more widespread dissemination of journalistic ethics was thus thoroughly 
felt. 
</p>
<p>41. Representatives of the Bar Association stated that the Judiciary, and in general lawyers, 
are not well trained in international human rights law. Although Ukrainian domestic law 
reflects international norms such as the prohibition of hate speech, racism, xenophobia and 
war propaganda, these issues are rarely brought to Courts. The Judiciary is believed to be 
still dependent on political lobbies and especially in rural areas, the pressure on Courts can 
be strong.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  See paragraph 43 below. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.2 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Relevant legislation 
</b></p>
<p>42. A body of laws, each regulating a specific part of the media sector - the Law on Printed 
Mass Media (the press), Law on Information Agencies, Law on the National Television and 
Radio Broadcasting Council, and Law on Television and Sound Broadcasting - are enforced in 
the country. 
</p>
<p>43. The regulation of the media environment appears difficult to implement in light of present 
legislation due to the existence of various institutions that often act with little coordination. In 
order to remedy these shortcomings, the Parliament adopted the &#8220;Amendments to Certain Laws 
of Ukraine on Ensuring Transparency of Ownership Relations with Regard to Mass Media&#8221;. 
Some media experts have pointed out that the amendments contain positive provisions that will 
enhance transparency of media ownership. However, these experts believed that these 
amendments are unable to create the adequate environment for the promotion of media 
pluralism, especially in what concerns the diversity of outlets.  
</p>
<p>44. Ukraine decriminalized defamation through the exclusion from a new criminal code 
adopted on 1 September 2001 of article 125 of the old criminal code, which prescribed prison 
sentences of up to three years for defamation offenses. After this key achievement, the frequent 
imposition of high fines in defamation cases remained a tool for pressure against journalists and 
editors. A subsequent step, the adoption of the &#8220;Law on Guarantee of Freedom of Speech&#8221;, 
provided additional protection to the media through, inter alia, a more sophisticated analysis of 
defamation offences. Other legislative changes contributed to reinforce freedom of speech 
protection: an amendment to the new Civil Code passed in January 2004 abolished a 
controversial article about the dissemination of false information. Other relevant changes in 
legislation include amendments to freedom of speech legislation on 3 April 2003 and to the right 
to freedom of information law on 22 December 2005. 
</p>
<p>45. NGOs informed the Special Rapporteur that the growth in the advertisement market was 
likely to help strengthen media independence, but also entailed the risk of reinforcing the power 
of economic lobbies. For the time being, state authorities appeared unwilling to complete the 
process of privatization and a common contractual basis for media professionals was still 
missing, which allegedly makes salaries be more subjective and related to political connections 
rather than professional merits. It was also noted that numerous journalists also cover political 
positions, especially in regional councils.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Violence and intimidation against media professionals 
</b></p>
<p>46. The greater press freedom achieved in 2005 is reduced by the continuation of physical 
attacks on journalists and a general atmosphere of intimidation. The completion of the trial of the 
killers of journalist Georgy Gongadze left doubts about the independence of the judiciary in 
relation to the capacity of enquiring about high-ranking State officials. Furthermore, the recent 
attack of a television crew by a Member of Parliament and his bodyguards, who took away 
crew&#8217;s material and equipment, shows that this kind of acts still find some justification in the 
minds of numerous politicians, who also trust that they can go unpunished. 
</p>
<p>47. It should be noted that, according to information submitted by the Government of Ukraine 
to the Special Rapporteur, there has been a decrease in the past years of crimes against </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>journalists and media professionals. Whereas in 2003 a peak of 169 cases were registered, 
68 attacks of this sort took place in 2006 and 13 in the five months of 2007. Whilst recognizing 
the positive evolution of the trend, the Special Rapporteur notes that the absolute number of 
attacks against journalists at present is still very high and creates an unfavorable environment for 
the flourishing of a free press. 
</p>
<p>48. It should be highlighted that the Government of Ukraine, throughout the years, has been 
providing timely replies to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communications, particularly concerning 
violence against media professionals. However, several cases of attacks require further 
examination and action from relevant authorities. The following cases are but examples of this 
need. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>49. The gates to the home of Lilia Bujurova, editor of the weekly <i>Pervaya Krimskaya</i> and 
president of the Crimean Association of Independent Journalists, were set on fire to in the city 
Simferopol, capital of Crimea, in the early hours of 1 March 2006. She blamed the attack on her 
publication of a list of crime-linked candidates in the 26 March 2006 Crimean parliamentary 
elections. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that a criminal proceeding was 
opened based on provisions on hooliganism, but that there are no indications that the attack was 
related to Ms. Bujurova&#8217;s professional activity. 
50. Other journalists were threatened or physically attacked during the year 2006. The Special 
Rapporteur met with Volodymyr Katsman, editor of the newspaper <i>Stolichnye Novosti</i>, was 
badly beaten up in his apartment building, on 8 April 2006, and hospitalized with injuries. While 
the journalist was still in hospital, his newspaper received an envelope contained white powder 
and a note in which an anonymous individual claiming to be one of the attackers threatened 
Katsman&#8217;s colleagues, in particular investigative journalist Sherhy Kovtunenko, warning that 
they would have no protection and that calling in police would not help. The official probe into 
Katsman&#8217;s beating has made no progress and the newspaper has asked for police protection for 
the two journalists. The Government informed that protection measures have been taken to 
guarantee the security of Mssrs. Katsman and Kovtunenko. 
</p>
<p>51. Margarita Zakora, editor of the weekly <i>Dzerzhynets</i> in Dniprodzerzhynsk, was hounded by 
authorities over several months. The paper, launched in January 2006, had become popular with 
a campaign against corruption among regional officials, who filed 19 almost-identical lawsuits 
against Zakora. She allegedly received threats in June 2006 after having criticized a 
businessman. After a second critical article, the same businessman would allegedly have 
distributed pornographic leaflets about her and her 20-year-old daughter, including their 
addresses. Zakora asked for police and court protection but despite solid evidence of this 
harassment, no action was taken. 
</p>
<p>52. Vladimir Lutiev, editor of the weekly <i>Evpatoriskaya</i> <i>Nedelia</i>, was sentenced to eight years 
in prison on 12 July 2006 for corruption, after being held since June 2005 when a former 
Crimean Member of Parliament accused him of attempted murder. The court trying Lutiev 
refused to hear defense witnesses or evidence, according to his lawyer, who also said that the 
journalist was being hounded by local officials because he had accused them of corruption. 
According to information provided by the Government, the sentence was subsequently cancelled 
and the case was set to consideration at the Court of Appeal. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.2 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p>53. Five organizers and triggermen accused of the killing of Igor Alexandrov, head of the 
<i>TOR TV</i> station in the Slaviansk region of Donetsk in 2001, were sentenced to between two and 
a half and 15 years in prison on 7 June 2006 by an appeal court in Lugansk after a two-month 
trial. The journalist had been beaten with a baseball bat on 3 July 2001 and died of head injuries 
four days later in hospital. In autumn 2003, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s office announced the killers, 
members of a criminal gang, had been identified and charged. 
</p>
<p>54. A court in Kiev resumed hearings on 14 September 2006 in the trial of the presumed killers 
of journalist Georgy Gongadze,<b>14</b> editor of <i>Ukrainskaya Pravda</i>. The Special Rapporteur 
received some allegations of obstacles in the trial proceedings. Prosecutor-general 
Oleksandr Medvedko was suspected of trying to slow down the investigation and influence its 
outcome while his successor, Sviatoslav Piskun, declared the case closed when three policemen 
were charged with kidnapping and murdering the journalists. The &#8220;Melnichenko tapes&#8221; disclosed 
by the media, indicated that the decision to get rid of Gongadze was allegedly made at the 
highest levels of government, but despite the change of regime and promises made by 
President Yushchenko, who said the day the trial resumed that Gongadze&#8217;s name had become 
&#8220;a symbol of political change and freedom of expression&#8221; in Ukraine, the investigation has made 
no progress. Court proceedings were to continue until 21 February 2008. 
</p>
<p>55. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur gathered details about a number of alleged 
anomalies surrounding the investigation and the trial of Gongadze&#8217;s case. Material and 
documents about the killing of the journalist have disappeared little by little and the first 
investigation team was replaced by a new one which had to recommence the enquiry from 
scratch. In spite of international pressure to find a satisfactory solution to this case, authorities 
seem to have constantly operated in order to delay the judicial proceedings and to create, as 
much as possible, confusion about the real motives behind the crime and the persons who 
perpetrated it. Moreover, the structure of the Ministry of Interior remains the same since 2000, 
and the family of the journalist still bears the burden of the consequences of the journalist&#8217;s 
killing. Close friends have adopted security measures because of the harassment from 
anonymous entities. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur also met with numerous journalists who pointed out to cases of 
intimidation and harassment. One journalist said that he was ordered to dismiss after twenty-five 
years of service from the top management of the State television. After his refusal, he was 
followed by management assistants and questioned about his work with gangster&#8217;s style 
interrogation. Another journalist was forced to dismiss after hosting, in the programme he run, a 
heated debate between opposition and Government representatives on the ground that the 
program was run in an unprofessional manner.

</p>
<p>57. Representatives of the Ministry of Interior rejected all allegations of inactivity concerning 
crimes against media workers. Conversely, they affirmed that they devote a lot of time and 
energy to attacks against journalists, which were investigated in depth, often with good results. 
Ministry&#8217;s relations with media are quite satisfactory owing, inter alia, to weekly press 
conference held in the Ministry, which also ensure proper investigations on violations allegedly 
perpetrated by police officers. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Racism 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur detected alarm among the international community living in 
Ukraine about violence against foreigners, including students, diplomats, businessmen and 
tourists, a phenomenon that has undoubtedly racist roots. For instance, a number of websites, 
popular among the young people, disseminate hate speech and very hostile considerations about 
foreigners in general, but especially non-Caucasian ethnic groups. Slogans like &#8220;Stop 
Zionist-African expansion&#8221;, &#8220;One race, one nation, our motherland Ukraine&#8221; have become quite 
usual in youth&#8217;s venues such as concerts, universities and coffee bars.<b>15</b> It has been reported that 
attacks against African students are frequent and that, as a consequence, the foreign student 
population is dramatically diminishing. 
</p>
<p>59. Racist attacks in the past have also targeted Jewish places of worship, synagogues and 
cemeteries. The attacks against persons of Jewish origin that have been recorded in the eastern 
regions and in the capital seem to be carried out by neo-Nazi and fascist groups. Other minority 
groups, such as Tartars and Roma, have been victims of prejudice and violence as well. 
Although the Government has been developing actions to promote tolerance towards the Jewish 
community, including supporting the 153 Jewish cultural organizations in the country and 
opening an International Center of Tolerance, civil society claimed that a more comprehensive 
strategy is required, particularly to eliminate impunity. 
</p>
<p>60. In his meeting with academic institutions, the Special Rapporteur was made aware of 
efforts made to reduce the incidence of racial attacks. Ukrainian universities have a long practice, 
like almost all academic institutions existing during the Soviet r&#233;gime, of hosting students from 
less developed countries and they intend to pursue this tradition of hospitality notwithstanding 
the present wave of racist violence. University managers have reinforced security measures 
around campuses and opened a dialogue with all students on racial discrimination and the harm it 
can bring to the Ukrainian society as a whole.  
</p>
<p>61. With regard to the Interregional Academy of Staff management (MAUP), a private 
educational institution which allegedly disseminates racial discrimination and maintains links 
with extremist groups, the representatives of the Ministry of Interior stated that they were ready 
to intervene should the law be broken, and added that, regardless to the fact that some its 
officials maintain contacts with that institution, the Ministry does not share its philosophy.

<p>62. The Special Rapporteur noted with satisfaction the information sent by the Government of 
Ukraine that an Action Plan against racism was adopted by the Ministry of Interior 
on 31 May 2007, which include a special focus on extremist groups, on the need to put in place a 
special unit to respond to crimes against foreigners and the creation of a database of racially, 
ethnically or religiously motivated crimes. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>Independent countries emerging from the dissolution of Soviet Union have been 
experiencing a period of transition marked by political instability and lack of consistent 
social growth. The legacy of a powerful and centralized state that characterized Soviet 
times still influences the behavior of some State institutions, particularly law enforcement 
and regulatory agencies, as well as the way relations between the State and the media are 
structured at present.  
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>Combined with a volatile economic growth, the present political context is marked by 
a high degree of polarization, which has been a negative influence on the empowerment of 
civil society and the strengthening of media independence. Due to ongoing political 
disputes, segments of the State that play a crucial role in the safeguarding of democracy 
and fundamental rights, such as the Constitutional Court and the Electoral Committee, 
have also suffered of some limitations of their own prerogative to freedom of expression.  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>Within the media environment various trends exist: a reformist current aspires to 
information based on free circulation of ideas and opinions ensured by independent press 
and media enterprises. A more conservative group, which prefers to continue with old 
traditions and attitudes inherited by the Soviet regime, supports the pro-Russian parties. 
A third, more pragmatic group, offers its services waiting for the outcome of the political 
struggle. It should be underlined that the borders among these trends are very thin and 
that the pursuit for independence is equally strong.  
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The media environment is marked by poor finances and unilaterally-oriented 
investments. Like in many parts of the world, newspapers and other printed press endure 
the increasingly aggressive competition of electronic communications tools, while national 
television and radio channels are struggling to keep their own audience. Powerful media 
corporations, which have links with political and economic elites, may intervene on 
editorial content, narrowing diversity of opinions and installing self-censorship. Public 
interest is best served by a variety of independent news media, both print and broadcast, 
which must be allowed to emerge and operate freely. Unrestricted access to foreign media 
should be guaranteed at all times as it ultimately encourages the advancement of 
independence among the national media. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Bearing in mind the vital role played by the media in creating broad awareness of 
political, economic and social issues, the fact that journalists are still targeted by political 
and public figures, who should be ready to accept criticism and public screening because of 
their institutional role, is definitely worrying. Although Article 47 of the Law on 
Information guarantees that no one can be brought to justice for expressing opinions that 
have a character of assessment or evaluation, it still leaves room for public figures to target 
journalists with judicial proceedings.  </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>68. <b>Journalists, editors and other media workers are often under considerable pressure 
from holders of state bodies, economic lobbies and informal associations, with links to 
ordinary criminality, acting often in close cooperation. In this context, investigative 
journalism might reveal to be an uncomfortable exercise, notably when addressing 
sensitive subjects. Safety and independence of media in the provinces is often at stake. As a 
result, self-censorship may emerge as a way to guarantee personal security and some 
financial benefit.  
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Special Rapporteur believes that some State institutions, particularly law 
enforcement agencies, have been downplaying the relevance of racist crimes in Ukraine. 
While noting that the ratification of the International Convention on Migrant Workers is 
under consideration, the Special Rapporteur remains convinced that the issue of racism is 
not adequately addressed by public institutions. The Special Rapporteur further underlines 
that many extremist groups, particularly neo-Nazi organizations, have used their 
prerogative of freedom of expression to convey messages of racism and racial hatred. 
International instruments, particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, establish clear limitations on free speech when incitement to racial, ethnic or 
religious hatred is in question. The Special Rapporteur calls on public authorities to 
implement these provisions as an essential step to curb the spread of racism and 
intolerance in Ukraine</b>. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the main political parties in Ukraine and their leaders 
to bear in mind, while pursuing their legitimate political aims, the importance of respecting 
its international human rights engagements and to promote a democratic process grounded 
on human rights and the rule of law. The Special Rapporteur further encourages all 
stakeholders involved in the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression to find fresh 
impetus in their work and to show genuine openness and commitment to dialogue with 
their counterparts. The Special Rapporteur also invites the United Nations and regional 
bodies to support all efforts to promote peaceful political debates and tolerance, and to 
strengthen freedom of opinion and expression, which remains one of the most effective 
tools for building constructive dialogue. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls for a broad and comprehensive revision of media 
legislation at large, but especially on TV and radio broadcasting. The existence of a 
growing body of law, at national level, on mass media has created certain confusion about 
duties and responsibilities of a number of institutions, whose activities may hinder the 
realm of freedom of expression. The Parliament should initiate a process of revision and 
simplification to be brought to an end quickly, in order, inter alia, to increase TV and 
Radio Broadcasting bodies&#8217; independence from political lobbies.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Government of Ukraine and principal State institutions should encourage a new 
state of mind among public personalities and civil servants based on the concept of good 
governance, which includes, inter alia, the possibility of criticism and screening by the 
media as well as by ordinary citizens. New legislation should be adopted to protect the 
media&#8217;s central role of ensuring accountability of state and government officials. </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/7/14/Add.2 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Ukraine and relevant national 
bodies to further develop actions aiming to guarantee that crimes against media 
professionals and opinion-makers will not go unpunished. The Ministries of Interior and 
Justice should strengthen programs to ensure that media workers are adequately protected 
in performing their professional duties regardless to the identity of the possible aggressors. 
Protection schemes should be provide whenever necessary and effective judicial enquiries 
should be completed.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Ukraine and relevant national 
bodies to take immediate and effective action in order to thwart the wave of racist violence 
which is invading the country. If not addressed properly, this phenomenon could seriously 
hamper the freedom of expression and of movement of foreign residents and migrant 
workers.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur esteems urgent that the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry 
of Justice extend human rights training programmes to all the personnel under their 
purview, including law enforcement officials. These training programmes should also have 
a specific focus on the principles of freedom of expression, public accountability and the 
fight against racism. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>In order to improve the quality of journalism and disseminate professional ethics, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that a school of journalistic ethics be established, with the 
support of international organizations, to organize training courses for journalists and 
other media professionals working in the country. Professional training and financial 
investments, especially an increase in salaries, may upgrade the moral stance of the press 
and the media industry at large. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Government should strengthen the provision of remedial measures, including 
financial compensation as appropriate, for all media professionals and opinion-makers 
victims of violence and intimidation, in particular whenever law enforcement officials 
appear to have been involved in these criminal acts. Mutatis mutandis, a similar r&#233;gime of 
compensation should be created in favor of those who have been victim of acts of racism 
and racial hatred.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Parliament should legislate on specific and urgent measures for the promotion of the 
print press, whose role, in a period of great technological revolution, remains fundamental 
for educational purposes, notably for the development of the reader&#8217;s capacity of critical 
approach and analysis of information. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
information provided by the Government that new changes in the legislation will be 
introduced soon, particularly concerning the mass media and social protection for 
journalists. 
</b>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur invites the Government of Ukraine to consider appropriate 
legislation for the establishment of an independent national human rights commission, 
which will supplement the activities of the Office of the Ombudsperson, whose functions 
appear to be too numerous and varied. </b> </p>
