</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 6/14. Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
slavery 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that no 
</p>
<p>one shall be held in slavery or servitude and that slavery and the slave trade shall be 
</p>
<p>prohibited in all their forms, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the Slavery Convention of 1926, the Supplementary Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices Similar to 
</p>
<p>Slavery of 1956 and International Labour Organization Convention No. 29 on Forced 
</p>
<p>Labour of 1930, as well as other relevant international instruments which prohibit all 
</p>
<p>forms of slavery and call on Governments to eradicate such practices, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action strongly 
</p>
<p>condemned the fact that slavery and slavery-like practices still exist today in parts of 
</p>
<p>the world and urged States to take immediate measures as a matter of priority to end 
</p>
<p>such practices, which constitute flagrant violations of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>that contemporary forms of slavery is a global issue which 
</p>
<p>affects all continents and most countries of the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> that the minimum estimate of the number of people in 
</p>
<p>slavery is over 12 million and that the problem appears to be increasing,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that broad international cooperation among States, as well as 
</p>
<p>between States and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations is 
</p>
<p>essential for effectively countering contemporary forms of slavery,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> with great appreciation of the work, reports and recommendations 
</p>
<p>of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery of the former Sub-</p>

<p>Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, since its 
</p>
<p>establishment in 1975, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> the proposals to replace the Working Group on Contemporary 
</p>
<p>Forms of Slavery with a Special Rapporteur as a mechanism for better addressing the 
</p>
<p>issue of contemporary forms of slavery within the United Nations system which were 
</p>
<p>made in May 1998 in a review of the implementation of the conventions on slavery 
</p>
<p>for the twenty-fourth session of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of 
</p>
<p>Slavery; in the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights&#8217; 
</p>
<p>report &#8220;Abolishing slavery and its contemporary forms, 2002&#8221; (HR/PUB/02/4); and in 
</p>
<p>the recommendations of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery itself 
</p>
<p>at its thirty-first session in 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Human Rights Council decision 5/1 &#8220;Institution-building of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Human Rights Council&#8221; of 18 June 2007 and its annex, which stated 
</p>
<p>that the Council would decide at its sixth session on the most appropriate mechanisms 
</p>
<p>to continue the work of the Working Groups on Indigenous Populations, on 
</p>
<p>Contemporary Forms of Slavery, Minorities, , as well as Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 5/2 &#8220;Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council&#8221; of 18 June 2007 and stressing that the mandate-holder shall 
</p>
<p>discharge his/her duties in accordance with these resolutions and their annexes,  
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that 2007 marks the two hundredth anniversary of the 
</p>
<p>beginning of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced </i>that the mandates of existing Special Rapporteurs do not 
</p>
<p>adequately cover all slavery practices, and that the issue of contemporary forms of 
</p>
<p>slavery needs to be given greater prominence and priority within the United Nations 
</p>
<p>system if these practices are to be eradicated once and for all, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Decides</i> to appoint, for a three-year period, a Special Rapporteur on

</p>
<p> 2. <i>Decides</i> that the Special Rapporteur shall examine and report on all

</p>
<p>Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery 
</p>
<p>of 1956, as well as all other issues covered by the Working Group on Contemporary 
</p>
<p>Forms of Slavery<b> </b>including forced prostitution  and its human rights dimensions; in

</p>
<p>the current practice, respond effectively to reliable information on alleged human 
</p>
<p>rights violations with a view to protecting the human rights of victims of slavery and 
</p>
<p>preventing violations; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Recommend actions and measures applicable at the national, regional 
</p>
<p>and international levels to eliminate slavery practices wherever they occur, including

<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur in the performance of the tasks and duties mandated, to supply all </p>

<p>necessary information requested by him/her and to give serious consideration to 
</p>
<p>responding favourably to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s requests to visit their countries, so 
</p>
<p>as to enable him/her to fulfil his/her mandate effectively; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages</i> the United Nations, including its specialized agencies, 
</p>
<p>regional intergovernmental organizations, Governments, independent experts,

</p>
<p>extent possible with the Special Rapporteur in the fulfilment of his/her mandate;
