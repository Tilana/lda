Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc.
(A Development Stage Company)
Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements
Note 1.     Nature of Operations
Company Overview
The operations of Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. (“AVRS” or the
“Company”),http://www.avrsys.com, commenced in 1994 with a predecessor entity called NCC,
Inc. NCC, Inc. was incorporated on March 15, 1994 in the State of Ohio. NCC, Inc. operated as a
software and hardware development company that marketed voice recognition and transcription
products for commercial applications.
In May 2000, WG Investments, LLC acquired the assets of NCC, Inc. and subsequently changed
its name to NCC, LLC. NCC, LLC (also a predecessor to AVRS) continued the operations of NCC,
Inc. until approximately December 31, 2001, when shifts in the industry’s markets caused NCC,
LLC to suspend its operations.
AVRS was incorporated in the State of Colorado on July 7, 2005. In September 2005, the
members of NCC, LLC transferred all of their membership interests in NCC, LLC to AVRS in
exchange for 93,333,333 shares (post-recapitalization) of AVRS common stock. In December
2005, the Board of Directors approved a 1.5-to-1 stock split issuing 46,666,667 common shares
(post-recapitalization), which increased the number of common shares outstanding to 140 million
shares (post-capitalization). Following the incorporation of AVRS, the Company initiated a new
business plan and intends to continue its operations in the voice recognition and transcription
industry.
AVRS is a software development company specializing in speech recognition technologies.
AVRS has successfully obtained patent protection of its proprietary technology (refer to Note 3,
Intangible Assets). The Company plans to focus its technologies for the medical profession
because of the profession’s present extensive use of dictation and its need for multiple
applications of speech recognition technology in the generation of reports, documents and medical
bills. Additionally the Company plans to focus on server based dictation and transcription, visual
voicemail and the voicemail to text market.
Stock Exchange Agreement
On April 28, 2008, the Company entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement (“the Agreement”) with
Samoyed Energy Corp., a Nevada corporation (“Samoyed”), which resulted in a reverse
acquisition.  The Agreement provided for the reorganization of AVRS with Samoyed. In connection
with the Agreement, Samoyed acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of
AVRS in exchange for 140 million shares of Samoyed’s common stock.  On May 19, 2008 at the
closing of the Agreement, the former shareholders of AVRS owned approximately 85% of the
outstanding common stock of Samoyed, resulting in a change in control.
For accounting purposes, this acquisition has been treated as a reverse acquisition and
recapitalization of AVRS, with Samoyed the legal surviving entity. Since Samoyed had, prior to the
recapitalization, minimal assets and limited operations, the recapitalization has been accounted
for as the sale of 24,700,008 shares of AVRS common stock for the net liabilities of Samoyed.
Therefore, the historical financial information prior to the date of the recapitalization is the financial
information of AVRS. Costs of the transaction have been charged to the period in which they are
incurred.
In connection with the Agreement, a shareholder of Samoyed holding an aggregate of 3.5 million
shares of Samoyed’s common stock made payments totaling $565,651 since 2008 in lieu of
tendering shares to the Company.  The Company received the final payment of $6,000 on
February 15, 2012.
Stock Purchase Agreements
During the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company entered into Stock Purchase
Agreements for the private sale of an aggregate of 5,400,000 shares of the common stock for
aggregate proceeds of $32,500, all of which was received in 2015. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016, the Company entered into Stock Purchase Agreements for the private sale of an
aggregate of 2,750,000 shares of the common stock for aggregate proceeds of $21,500, full
payment of which was received in the period.
Agreement and Plan of Merger
On March 25, 2009, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Agreement and
Plan of Merger”) with its wholly-owned subsidiary, NCC, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company,
whereby NCC, LLC merged with and into the Company pursuant to Section 92A.180 of the
Nevada Business Corporations Act. Upon consummation of the Agreement and Plan of Merger: (i)
NCC, LLC ceased to exist; (ii) the Company’s membership interests in NCC, LLC automatically
were canceled or retired and ceased to exist, without any consideration delivered in exchange
thereof; (iii) the title to all estate, property rights privileges, powers and franchise assets and/or
other rights owned by NCC, LLC became vested in the Company without reversion or impairment;
and (iv) all liabilities of any kind of NCC, LLC became vested in the Company.
Retention Agreement
On March 16, 2015 the Company entered into a letter agreement with Adapt IP Ventures, LLC
(Adapt IP) confirming the retention of Adapt IP to assist the Company in identifying companies that
might be interested in acquiring and / or licensing the Company’s patents, to attempt to negotiate
financial terms and conditions for acquisition and / or licensing and to assist with collection of
compensation from such entities.  Adapt IP will receive a success fee of 15% of net compensation
received from such entities based upon Adapts IP’s efforts.  The Company or Adapt IP may
terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ notice to the other party.
On August 20, 2015, Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. (AVRS) entered into a letter
agreement with Dominion Harbor Group, LLC pursuant to which Dominion will provide strategic
advisory services to AVRS to support the common goal of the acquisition, sale, licensing,
prosecution, enforcement, and settlement with respect to AVRS’s intellectual property, including
patents held by AVRS.The Company or Dominion may terminate the agreement upon 30 days’
notice to the other party.
Promissory Note
On April 20, 2015 the Company made a Promissory Note to Adapt IP Ventures, LLC (Adapt IP) for
up to $20,000, and Adapt IP agreed to pay to the Company’s patent counsel $19,935 for patent
work on behalf of the Company.  The Note matures one year from the date of the Note.  The
Company is obligated to repay the funds advanced by Adapt IP plus a premium of 10% of the
principal amount and a percentage of proceeds received by the Company from any monetization
event involving the patents.  If the Company repays the Note within the six months of the date of
the Note, the percentage will be 1%, and it will be 2% after six months.
Note 2.     Significant Accounting Policies
Unaudited Financial Information
The accompanying financial information at June 30, 2016 and for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015 is unaudited.  In the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments
which are necessary to provide a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position at June 30,
2016 and its operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 have been made. 
Certain information and footnote data necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and
results of operations in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America have been condensed or omitted.  It is therefore suggested that these financial
statements be read in conjunction with the summary of significant accounting policies and notes to
financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The
results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily an indication of
operating results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.
Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which
contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The Company may be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of
time.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon
its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to
attain profitability.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 the Company received an
aggregate of $32,500 from the sale of shares in private offerings of its common stock. During the
six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company received an aggregate of $21,500 from the sale of
shares in private offerings of its common stock.  The Company intends to raise capital through
private offerings until it is profitable.
Additionally, the Company continues to work with Adapt IP and Dominion Harbor Group to raise
capital through acquisition, sale, licensing, prosecution, enforcement, and settlement with AVRS’s
intellectual property.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of NCC, LLC which merged
with and into AVRS, Inc. March 25, 2009. Intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated. The accounts, results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies are
included from their respective acquisition dates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months
or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. The Company had cash at June 30, 2016 of $7,030,
and $2,703 cash at June 30, 2015.  No amounts resulted from cash equivalents.
Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of cash, receivables and current liabilities approximate fair value due to the
short-term maturity of the instruments.
Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from three to five years. Expenditures for
additions and improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed
as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property and equipment sold or
otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recorded in the year
of disposal.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from the sale of inventory is recognized on the date of sale, title and risk of loss have
transferred to the purchaser, the fees are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably
assured. Revenue from the performance of services is recognized when services have been
completed and collection is probable. There are no multiple element sales and no history of
material returns. The revenue recognition policies relate to operations performed prior to the
Company’s reverse acquisition.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements
and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the
recorded book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax
reporting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those
differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered
or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future
taxable income and tax credits that are available to offset future federal income taxes.  The
Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit
and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow.  Therefore, no reserves for
uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to ASC 740.  The Company did not
record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of ASC 740.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred.
Patents, Deferred Costs and Amortization
Patents consist of costs incurred to acquire issued patents. Amortization commences once a
patent is granted. Costs incurred to acquire patents that have not been issued are reported as
deferred costs. If a patent application is denied or expires, the costs incurred are charged to
operations in the year the application is denied or expires. The Company amortizes its patents
over an estimated useful life of twenty years.
Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates the carrying value of its long-lived assets under the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” now referred to as ASC 360-10 Property, Plant, and Equipment –
“Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets” subsections” . ASC 306-10 requires impairment
losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are
present and the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are
less than the assets’ carrying amount. If such assets are impaired, the impairment to be recognized
is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of
the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value,
less costs to sell.  The Company’s last impairment analysis was completed effective December 31,
2015.  Impairment recorded for each of the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $-0-. 
See Note 3.
Loss per Common Share
The Company reports net loss per share using a dual presentation of basic and diluted loss per
share. Basic net loss per share excludes the impact of common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss
per share utilizes the average market price per share when applying the treasury stock method in
determining common stock equivalents. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no variances
between the basic and diluted loss per share as there were no potentially dilutive securities
outstanding.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of cash and current liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-
term maturity of these items. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and, therefore, cannot be determined with
precision.  Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates.  We do not hold or
issue financial instruments for trading purposes, nor do we utilize derivative instruments.
The FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) clarifies that fair value is an exit price,
representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants. It also requires disclosure about how fair value is
determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and
liabilities must be grouped, based on significant levels of inputs as follows:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and inputs that are
observable for the asset or liability.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the
reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
The determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest
level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Note 3.     Intangible and Fixed Assets
Intangible Assets
The Company monitors the anticipated outcome of legal actions, and if it determines that the
success of the defense of a patent is probable, and so long as the Company believes that the
future economic benefit of the patent will be increased, the Company capitalizes external legal
costs incurred in the defense of the patent. Upon successful defense of litigation, the amounts
previously capitalized are amortized over the remaining life of the patent.
On November 13, 1995 the Company filed a patent application with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office, which was granted on September 28, 1999 as U.S. Patent #5,960,447, “Word
Tagging and Editing System for Speech Recognition”. In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 154, the term
for the above referenced patent shall be for a period beginning on the date on which the patent
issues and ending 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed in the
United States. The above referenced U.S. Patent expired on November 13, 2015.
On July 7, 2009, U.S. Patent # 7,558,730, entitled “Speech Recognition and Transcription Among
Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols,” was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  In
accordance with 35 U.S.C. 154, the patent shall be for a term beginning on July 7, 2009 and
ending 20 years from the application date of November 27, 2001, or November 27, 2021.  The
deferred fees were capitalized during the quarter ended September 30, 2009 and the Company
began amortization.
On March 9, 2010 the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office declared interference between the
Company as Senior Party and Allvoice Developments, US LLC as Junior Party.  Due to the
absence of a decision by the end of 2010, in the 4th quarter of 2010, AVRS impaired 100% of the
deferred costs associated with the interference, resulting in a $1,068,860 impairment loss.  On
April 27, 2012, the BPAI entered a judgment denying the Company’s motions.  On May 29, 2012,
AVRS filed a Request for Rehearing in the BPAI.  On December 19, 2012 the BPAI entered a
judgment denying the request for rehearing.  The Company decided not to appeal as additional
litigation would be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of management and
key personnel from business operations.
On May 24, 2011, U.S. Patent #7,949,534, entitled “Speech Recognition and Transcription Among
Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols,” was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In
accordance with 35 U.S.C. 154, the patent shall be for a term beginning May 24, 2011 and ending
20 years from the application date of the parent application (U.S. Patent #7,558,730) of November
27, 2001, or November 27, 2021.  The deferred fees were capitalized during the quarter ended
June 30, 2011 and the Company began amortization.
On March 6, 2012, U.S. Patent #8,131,557, entitled “Speech Recognition and Transcription
Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols,” was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office.  In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 154, the patent shall be for a term beginning March 6, 2012
and ending 20 years from the application date of the parent application (U.S. Patent #7,558,730) of
November 27, 2001, or November 27, 2021.  The deferred fees were capitalized during the quarter
ended March 31, 2012 and the Company began amortization.
On July 30, 2013, U.S. Patent #8,498,871, entitled “Dynamic Speech Recognition and
Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols,” was issued by the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 154, the patent shall be for a term beginning on
July 30, 2013 and ending 20 years from the application date of November 27, 2001, or November
27, 2021.  The deferred fees were capitalized during the quarter ended September 30, 2013 and
the Company began amortization.
On June 27, 2013, the Company filed two additional continuation applications 13/928/381 and
13/928,383 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office entitled “Speech Recognition and
Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols.”  On August 31, 2015, Application
13/928,381 was abandon by the Company.  Deferred costs were charged to operations the quarter
ended September 30, 2015.
On August 10, 2015, the Company filed a continuation application with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office entitled “Speech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having
Heterogeneous Protocols.”
On September 22, 2015, U.S. Patent #9,142,217, entitled “Speech Recognition and Transcription
Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols,” was issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 154, the patent shall be for a term beginning September 22,
2015 and ending 20 years from the application date of the parent application (US Patent No.
7,558,730) of November 27, 2001, or November 27, 2021.  The deferred fees were capitalized

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations
The statements contained in this Quarterly Report that are not historical are “forward-looking
statements”, which can be identified by use of terms such as “may”, “could”, “should”, “expect”,
“plan”, “project”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “predict”, “potential”, “pursue”, “target” or
“continue”, the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology, although some forward-
looking statements may be expressed differently.
The forward-looking statements contained in this 10-Q are largely based on our expectations,
which reflect estimates and assumptions made by our management. These estimates and
assumptions reflect our best judgment based on currently known market conditions and other
factors. Although we believe such estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are
inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control. In
addition, management’s assumptions about future events may prove to be inaccurate.
Management cautions all readers that the forward-looking statements contained in this 10-Q are
not guarantees of future performance, and we cannot assure any reader that such statements will
be realized or the forward-looking events and circumstances will occur. Actual results may differ
materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements due to various
factors listed in this Quarterly Report. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of
this 10-Q. We do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result
of new information, future events or otherwise. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-
looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf.
Overview
We are a software development company headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona. We specialize in
creating interface and application solutions for speech recognition technologies. Our speech
recognition software and related firmware was first introduced in 1994 at an industry trade
show.  We currently have limited capital resources.  We are not currently engaged in marketing
any products.  Our principal assets are our patents.  Our business strategy will be to attempt to
interest other companies in entering into license agreements or other strategic relationships and to
support and defend our patents through infringement and interference proceedings, as
appropriate. We are currently engaged in discussions with firms that could assist us in
commercialization of our intellectual assets.
Results of Operations
We completed a stock exchange on May 19, 2008 and changed our business model. We have not
generated any revenue since the stock exchange and do not have any cash generating product or
licensing sales.
At June 30, 2016 we accrued $2,874 of interest on accounts payable and paid $3,500 in gross
payroll for the period.
At June 30, 2016, we had current assets of $7,030, and current liabilities of $284,321, as
compared to $2,703 current assets and $260,417 in current liabilities at June 30, 2015. Our
increase in current assets is attributed to increased sales of shares of our common stock. Our
decrease in current liabilities primarily is due to reduced professional fees.
We had a net loss of $36,972 and $67,740 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
respectively. The decrease in net loss is attributable to reduced professional fees incurred in the
six months ended June 30, 2016.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we used $22,867 of cash in operating activities and $-0-
of cash in investing activities, and we received $21,500 cash from sales of our common stock. As a
result, for the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized a $1,967 decrease in cash on hand.
For the six months ended June 30, 2015, $3,778 cash was used in operating activities, $17,811
cash in investing activities, and we received $6,000 cash from the sale of our common stock,
resulting in a $8,033 decrease in cash on hand for the period.  During the six months ended June
30, 2016 we paid in full the $600 related party loan.
Historically, our President has loaned or advanced to us funds for working capital on an “as
needed” basis. There is no assurance that these loans or advances will continue in the future. At
June 30, 2016, we owed our officers an aggregate of $162,383 for accrued payroll.  Because of
our history of losses, and lack of assurance of additional financing, the audit reports on our
financial statements at December 31, 2015 and 2014 contained a “going concern” opinion
regarding doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
On March 16, 2015 we entered into a letter agreement with Adapt IP Ventures, LLC (Adapt IP)
confirming the retention of Adapt IP to assist us in identifying companies that might be interested in
acquiring and / or licensing our patents, to attempt to negotiate financial terms and conditions for
acquisition and / or licensing and to assist with collection of compensation from such entities. 
Adapt IP will receive a success fee of 15% of net compensation received from such entities based
upon Adapt IP’s efforts.  We or Adapt IP may terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ notice to the
other party.
On April 20, 2015 we made a Promissory Note to Adapt IP for up to $20,000, and Adapt IP agreed
to pay to our patent counsel 19,935 for patent work on our behalf.  The Note matures one year from
the date of the Note.  We are obligated to repay the funds advanced by Adapt IP plus a premium of
10% of the principal amount and a percentage of proceeds received by us from any monetization
event involving the patents.  If we repay the Note within the six months of the date of the Note, the
percentage will be 1%, and it will be 2% after six months.
On August 20, 2015, AVRS entered into a letter agreement with Dominion Harbor Group, LLC
pursuant to which Dominion will provide strategic advisory services to AVRS to support the
common goal of the acquisition, sale, licensing, prosecution, enforcement, and settlement with
respect to AVRS’s intellectual property, including patents held by AVRS.
In carrying out our business strategy, we will likely continue to incur expenses in defending our
patents and pursuing license agreements.  We plan to raise additional funds through future sales
of our securities or other means, until such time as our revenues are sufficient to meet our cost
structure, and ultimately achieve profitable operations. There is no assurance we will be
successful in raising additional capital or achieving profitable operations. Our board of directors
may attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations that may consist of restricted
shares of our common stock. These actions would result in dilution of the ownership interests of
existing shareholders and may further dilute our common stock book value.
To obtain sufficient funds to meet our future needs for capital, we will from time to time, evaluate
opportunities to raise financing through sales of our securities. However, future equity or debt
financing may not be available to us at all, or if available, may not be on terms acceptable to us.
We do not intend to pay dividends to shareholders in the foreseeable future.
We have increased our efforts to monetize our assets.  We are currently engaged in discussion
with certain firms dedicated to assisting in the commercialization of intellectual assets
U.S. Patent #7,558,730 expands an extremely broad base of features in speech recognition and
transcription across heterogeneous protocols.  Costs totaling $58,277 have been capitalized and
amortization began in the third quarter 2009.
U.S. Patent #7,949,534 is an expansion of the coverage of our second patent and incorporates
speech recognition and transcription among transcription engines employing incompatible
protocols.  Costs totaling $3,365 have been capitalized and amortization began in the second
quarter 2011.
U.S. Patent #8,131,557 is an expansion of our second and third patent.  Costs totaling $5,092
have been capitalized and amortization began in the first quarter 2012.
U.S. 8,498,871 titled “Dynamic Speech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having
Heterogeneous Protocols” was issued July 30, 2013 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
Costs totaling $21,114 have been capitalized and amortization began in the third quarter 2013.
On September 22, 2015, Patent #9,142,217 titled “Speech Recognition and Transcription Among
Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols” (an expansion of our fourth patent) was issued by the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 154, the patent shall be for a
term beginning September 22, 2015 and ending 20 years from the application date of the parent
application (U.S. Patent No 7,558,730) of November 27, 2001, or November 27, 2021.  Costs
totaling $35,068 have been capitalized and amortization began in the third quarter 2015.
In order for our operations to continue, we will need to generate revenues from our intended
operations sufficient to meet our anticipated cost structure. We may encounter difficulties in
establishing these operations due to our inability to successfully prosecute any patent enforcement
actions or our inability to effectively execute our business plan.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk
As a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to
provide information required by this Item.
Item 4.   Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer, who also is our chief
financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) and pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as of December 31, 2015.
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, such
as this Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and is
communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In
addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Based on our evaluation, our chief executive officer, who also is our chief financial officer,
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance
level and were fully effective as of June 30, 2016 in providing reasonable assurance that
information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated  to our management, including
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to
our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we
maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as
implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes.
There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the
period covered by this Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
