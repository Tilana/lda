<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present document is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the rights to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and of association pursuant to Human Rights Council 
resolution 15/21. The document provides observations on the communications addressed by 
the Special Rapporteur to States, and on the replies received. 
</p>
<p>2. The cases raised by the Special Rapporteur in this addendum include 
communications sent between 16 March 2012 to 28 February 2013. The addendum 
contains observations on these communications and on responses received from States until 
28 April 2013. 
</p>
<p>3. For ease of reference, communications have been grouped by country, with 
countries listed alphabetically according to their names in English. Each communication is 
referenced as urgent appeal (UA), allegation letter (AL), joint urgent appeal (JUA) and 
joint allegation letter (JAL). This is followed by the date the communication was issued, as 
well as the case number and the State reply. The electronic version of the present document 
has both of these items hyperlinked, and clicking on them will open the communication 
sent and the reply from the concerned State, respectively, as uploaded on the OHCHR 
website. Finally, a summary of the allegations contained in the communication has been 
inserted in the language of submission. All communications are available in full in the 
Special Procedures&#8223; joint communication reports. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to all States which have transmitted 
responses to communications sent. He considers responses to his communications an 
important part of cooperation by States with his mandate. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur recalls paragraph 6 of the Human Rights Council resolution 15/21 which calls 
upon States &#8220;to cooperate fully with and assist the special rapporteur in the performance of 
</p>
<p>his or her tasks, to provide all necessary information requested by him or her, to respond 
promptly to his or her urgent appeals and other communications.&#8221; He therefore urges all 
States which have not yet replied to his communications to do so as soon as possible.

</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>9. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial remercie le Gouvernement de l&#8223;Alg&#233;rie pour avoir r&#233;pondu &#224; 
toutes les communications envoy&#233;es durant la p&#233;riode examin&#233;e. En particulier, il a lu avec 
attention la r&#233;ponse d&#233;taill&#233;e apport&#233;e par le Gouvernement en ce qui concerne la nouvelle </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/39/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6  
</b></p>
<p>loi sur les associations. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial se satisfait que la nouvelle loi sur les 
associations r&#233;ponde au souhait d&#8223;&#233;largir le champ ouvert &#224; l&#8223;initative associative mais 
regrette que cette volont&#233; ne soit pas ad&#233;quatement reflet&#233;e dans les dispositions l&#233;gales. En 
d&#233;pit des assurances transmises par le Gouvernement de l&#8223;Alg&#233;rie, il r&#233;it&#232;re ses vives 
pr&#233;occupations quant &#224; de nombreuses dispositions du texte, notamment celles relatives aux 
procedures permettant la cr&#233;ation d&#8223;associations, y compris les associations &#233;trang&#232;res, la 
</p>
<p>r&#233;ception de financement, ou la suspension ou la dissolution d&#8223;associations, notamment 
possible en cas &#171; d&#8223;ing&#233;rences dans les affaires internes du pays ou d&#8223;atteinte &#224; la 
souverainet&#233; nationale &#187;. Il recommande de nouveau au Gouvernement de l&#8223;Alg&#233;rie de 
r&#233;viser cette loi de sorte qu&#8223;elle soit conforme aux normes et standards relatifs &#224; la libert&#233; 
d&#8223;association et de r&#233;union pacifique, tels que ceux-ci sont d&#233;taill&#233;s dans ses rapports 
th&#233;matiques (voir notamment le rapport sur les meilleures pratiques A/HRC/20/27). Il 
encourage les autorit&#233;s &#224; consulter la soci&#233;t&#233; civile ind&#233;pendante qui est directement 
affect&#233;e par cette legislation.  Il invite les autorit&#233;s &#224; le tenir inform&#233; des mesures prises &#224; 
cet &#233;gard et indique se tenir pr&#234;t &#224; fournir tout appui technique dont le Gouvernement aurait 
besoin. 
</p>
<p>10. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a &#233;galement lu les r&#233;ponses apport&#233;es par le Gouvernement de 
l&#8223;Alg&#233;rie concernant les restrictions &#224; la libert&#233; de r&#233;union pacifique, mais reste vivement 
pr&#233;occup&#233; par le fait que des manifestations pacifiques puissent &#234;tre interrompues ou 
soumis &#224; un usage excessif de la force, comme lors de la manifestation du 5 juillet 2012 &#224; 
Alger. Il est conscient du risque d&#8223;actes de terrorisme mentionn&#233; par les autorit&#233;s dans une 
des r&#233;ponses transmises, mais il insiste que cet argument ne doit pas &#234;tre utilis&#233; afin de 
reduire au silence les critiques. Il recommande aux autorit&#233;s de prendre des mesures 
positives afin de favoriser l&#8223;exercice de la libert&#233; d&#8223;association et de reunion pacifique de la 
soci&#233;t&#233; civile, y compris des membres d&#8223;associations non enregistr&#233;es et de syndicalistes, et 
de s&#8223;assurer que ceux-ci ne soient soumis &#224;, ou &#234;tre menac&#233; d&#8223;&#234;tre soumis &#224; des faits de 
discrimination, de menace, de recours &#224; la violence, de harc&#232;lement, de pers&#233;cution, 
d&#8223;intimidation ou de repr&#233;sailles.. 
</p>
<p>11. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial rappelle l&#8223;article 1 de la resolution du Conseil des droits de 
l&#8223;homme 21/16, selon lequel les &#201;tats ont l&#8223;obligation &#171; de respecter et de prot&#233;ger 
pleinement le droit de tous les individus de se r&#233;unir pacifiquement et de s&#8223;associer 
librement, &#224; la fois en ligne et hors ligne, notamment &#224; l&#8223;occasion des &#233;lections, y compris 
les personnes qui professent des opinions ou des croyances minoritaires ou dissidentes, <i>les 
</i>d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme, les syndicalistes et tous ceux, notamment les migrants, 
qui cherchent &#224; exercer ou &#224; promouvoir ce droit &#187; (italiques ajout&#233;s). 
</p>
<p>12. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial rappelle au Gouvernement de l&#8223;Alg&#233;rie la demande de visite 
pays qu&#8223;il a formul&#233;e en d&#233;cembre 2011. Suite &#224; l&#8223;accus&#233; de r&#233;ception de sa demande, il 
r&#233;it&#232;re de nouveau sa demande afin de discuter des dates d&#8223;une visite en Alg&#233;rie, qui 
pourrait notamment permettre d&#8223;aborder la question de l&#8223;assistance technique dont le 
Gouvernement pourrait avoir besoin.

to the fundamental right to freedom of peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p>16. JUA 01/02/2013. Case no. AZE 2/2013. State Reply: 23/04/2013. Allegations of 
arrest of 63 participants in a peaceful protest held in Baku, of whom 26 were sentenced to

</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Azerbaijan for its responses to his 
communications of 22 March 2012 and 1 February 2013, but regrets that it did not respond 
to the other communications. He considers responses to his communications as an 
important part of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate, and urges the 
authorities to provide as soon as possible detailed responses to all the concerns raised in his 
communications. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur remains seriously concerned about the legislative 
amendments to the law on Freedom of Assembly, the Administrative Offences Code and 
the Criminal Code adopted in November 2012 increasing fines and criminalizing breaches 
of the regulations regarding the organization and participation in peaceful assemblies. He 
calls on the authorities to bring the legal framework governing the exercise of the right to 
freedom of peaceful assembly in conformity with international human rights norms and 
standards. He is available to provide any technical assistance deemed necessary in this 
regard (see notably A/HRC/20/27). 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur urges again the authorities to ensure that no individual is 
criminalised for the peaceful exercise of his fundamental freedoms, and to take all relevant 
measures to ensure that any individual and legal entity can peacefully exercise their rights 
of freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. He recommends again that the 
Government put in place an enabling and safe environment allowing individuals to exercise 
their legitimate freedoms without undue hindrances. A thorough and independent 
investigation over any allegations of human rights violations or abuses should be 
conducted, those responsible should be held accountable, and victims should be provided 
with full redress. 
</p>
<p>20. In the run-up to the presidential election scheduled in October 2013, full respect for 
the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association is paramount. In this context, 
the Special Rapporteur refers to Human Rights Council resolution 21/16, and in particular 
operative paragraph 1 that &#8220;[r]eminds States of their obligation to respect and fully protect 
the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely, online as well as 
offline, including in the context of elections, and including persons espousing minority or 
dissenting views or beliefs, human rights defenders, trade unionists and others, including 
migrants, seeking to exercise or to promote these rights, and to take all necessary measures 
to ensure that any restrictions on the free exercise of the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association are in accordance with their obligations under international 
human rights law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Azerbaijan for its invitation to 
conduct an official visit to the country, and hopes to honour the invitation in the near future.

</p>
<p>  <b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>30.  The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Bahrain for replying 
to all the communications he sent during the reporting period, but he is deeply concerned 
about the significant number of, and the grave nature of the allegations received during the 
period under review. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur remains gravely concerned about the physical and 
psychological integrity of individuals exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association, as well as of those monitoring the exercise of these rights. He 
urges the authorities to ensure that the legislation related to the right of peaceful assembly 
and its implementation meet international norms and standards related to freedom of 
peaceful assembly (see notably A/HRC/20/27). In this regard, he underscores that, 
according to Article 21 of the International Covenant on civil and political rights, &#8220;<i>No 
</i></p>
<p><i>restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those</i> imposed in 
conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of 
national security or public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of public health 
or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others&#8221; (emphasis added). 
International law therefore does not &#8220;give the State any right to take measures and place 
restrictions&#8230; in order to guarantee national security&#8221;, as mentioned in one of the responses 
</p>
<p>transmitted (unofficial translation), but rather imposes an obligation on States to facilitate 
the exercise of peaceful assembly. In this respect, he also reminds that assembly organizers 
and participants should not be held responsible and liable for the violent behaviour of 
others.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur is further dismayed about the killing of two children during 
demonstrations. Even when demonstrations turn violent, the Special Rapporteur emphasises 
that the right to life and to be free from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment are a non-derogable right in international human rights law, including in the 
context of assemblies. In this regard, he refers to Article 5 of the Basic Principles on the 
Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials Adopted by the Eighth United 
Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (1990), 
which provides that &#8220;whenever the lawful use of force and firearms is unavoidable, law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officials shall minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve human 
life.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur calls upon the authorities to carry out a thorough and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/39/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>independent investigation into any allegations of excessive use of force during 
demonstrations that took place during the period under review. He also underlines that 
&#8220;States Party shall ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains 
redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation, including the 
means for as full rehabilitation as possible. In the event of the death of the victim as a result 
of an act of torture, his dependants shall be entitled to compensation.&#8221; (Article 14 of the UN 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, to which the Syrian Arab Republic is a State party). The Special Rapporteur 
notes that a code of conduct for police officers has recently been drafted and he reiterates 
that he stands ready to provide any technical assistance the Government may require in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur is also seriously concerned about acts of harassment and 
intimidation against human rights defenders who are members of associations. More 
specifically, he is concerned about allegations of reprisals against individuals who have 
taken part in the Universal Periodical Review of Bahrain at the UN Human Rights Council 
in Geneva. He urges again the authorities to ensure that no one is criminalised for the 
peaceful exercise of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. In this 
regard, he also refers to the press release he issued, together with other mandate holders, on 
23 August 2012, where he urges the authorities to immediately and unconditionally release 
all persons convicted for exercising their legitimate rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur refers to Human Rights Council resolution 21/16, and in 
particular operative paragraph 1 which &#8220;reminds States of their obligation to respect and 
fully protect the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely, online 
as well as offline, including in the context of elections, and including persons espousing 
minority or dissenting views or beliefs, human rights defenders, trade unionists and others, 
including migrants, seeking to exercise or to promote these rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Bahrain of his country visit 
request sent in September 2011, to which a response is yet to be received.  He believes such 
a country visit may provide with a significant opportunity to discuss the technical assistance 
the Government may require.

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the responses of the Government of 
Bangladesh acknowledging receipt of his other communications. He however regrets that 
the Government of Bangladesh provided no substantial response to any of the 
communications sent since 2011. He considers responses to his communications as an 
important part of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate, and urges the 
authorities to provide as soon as possible detailed responses to all the concerns raised in the 
communications. 
</p>
<p>42.  The Special Rapporteur further reminds that the right for association to access 
funding and resources is an integral and vital part of the right to freedom of association. He 
therefore urges the authorities not to adopt the current draft law on non-governmental 
organization which unduly restricts the right to freedom of association. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur remains preoccupied about the situation of human rights 
defenders promoting and protecting economic, social and cultural rights. He urges to 
authorities to ensure their protection when exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and/or association. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to take all relevant measures to ensure 
that any individual and legal entity can peacefully exercise their rights of freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association. He recommends that the Government put in place an 
enabling and safe environment allowing individuals to exercise their legitimate freedoms 
without undue hindrances. A thorough and independent investigation into any allegations of 
any human rights violations, including acts of intimidations or harassments, committed 
against those exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, 
should be conducted; those responsible should be held accountable; and victims should be 
provided with full redress.

</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Belarus for its responses to his 
communication, but regrets that it did not respond to the communication dated 19 February 
</p><p>2013. He considers responses to his communications as an important part of the 
cooperation of Governments with his mandate, and urges the authorities to provide as soon 
as possible detailed responses to all the concerns raised in his communication. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur remains seriously concerned about the closure of the non-
governmental organization Platforma, and more largely about a continued campaign of 
harassment of members of human rights organizations in order to arbitrarily prevent them 
from carrying out their legitimate work in defence of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to ensure that no individual is 
criminalised for the peaceful exercise of his fundamental freedoms, and to take all relevant 
measures to ensure that any individual and legal entity can peacefully exercise their rights 
of freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. He recommends again that the 
Government put in place an enabling and safe environment allowing individuals to exercise 
their legitimate freedoms without undue hindrances. A thorough and independent

<p>58. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Brazil for its response to his

cooperation of Governments with his mandate, and urges the authorities to provide as soon

<p>59. The Special Rapporteur remains deeply disturbed by the killings of Messrs. Almir 
Nogueira de Amorim and Jo&#227;o Luiz Telles Penetra. He stresses the utmost importance to 
investigate thoroughly these killings, and hold the perpetrators fully accountable. He 
requests the Government to keep him informed on the progress made into the investigations 
conducted in relation to the aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to take all relevant measures to ensure 
that any individual and legal entity, including those promoting and protecting economic, 
social and cultural rights, can peacefully exercise their rights of freedom of peaceful

<p>72. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Cambodia for its response to his

cooperation of Governments with his mandate, and urges the authorities to provide as soon

</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the consultations organized by the authorities

does not meet international human rights standards governing the right to freedom of

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the People&#8223;s Republic of China 
for its responses to the communications sent.  
</p>
<p>99. The Special Rapporteur remains very preoccupied about the on-going repression 
against peaceful protestors in China, in particular in the Tibet Autonomous Region. He 
urges the authorities to protect and facilitate peaceful demonstrations, and refrain from 
using force during such demonstrations. He reminds that the rights to life and to be free 
from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are non-derogable 
rights in international human rights law, including in the context of assemblies. In this 
regard, he refers to Article 5 of the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by 
Law Enforcement Officials Adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the 
Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (1990), which provides that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/39/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;whenever the lawful use of force and firearms is unavoidable, law enforcement officials 
</p>
<p>shall minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve human life.&#8221; A thorough and 
</p>
<p>independent investigation over any allegations of excessive use of force and of torture and 
ill treatment during peaceful demonstrations should be conducted, those responsible should 
be held accountable, and victims should be provided with full redress. He requests the 
Government to keep him informed about the investigations conducted in relation to the 
aforementioned case. 
</p>
<p>100. The Special Rapporteur further recommends that the Government put in place an 
enabling and safe environment allowing individuals to exercise their legitimate freedoms 
without undue hindrances. 
</p>
<p>101. The Special Rapporteur refers to Human Rights Council resolution 21/16, and in 
particular operative paragraph 1 that &#8220;[r]eminds States of their obligation to respect and 
fully protect the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely, online 
as well as offline, including in the context of elections, and including persons espousing 
minority or dissenting views or beliefs, human rights defenders, trade unionists and others, 
including migrants, seeking to exercise or to promote these rights, and to take all necessary 
measures to ensure that any restrictions on the free exercise of the rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association are in accordance with their obligations under 
international human rights law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>102. The Special Rapporteur reminds again the Government of his country visit request 
sent in September 2011, to which a response is yet to be received. In this connection, OP6 
of resolution 15/21 states that the &#8220;Human Rights Council&#8230; [c]alls upon States to 
cooperate fully with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of his or her 
tasks, to provide all necessary information requested by him or her, &#8230; and to consider 
</p>
<p>favourably his or her requests for visits&#8221;.

Miller Angulo y la Sra. Rosa Helena Bernal Pinto.  En este sentido, se considera que las 
alegaciones son muy serias y se reitera la necesidad por llevar a cabo investigaciones 
independientes y efectivas sobre dichas alegaciones, y en su caso, sancionar a los 
responsables y ofrezcer reparaci&#243;n adecuada a los familiares de las v&#237;ctimas. 
</p>
<p>113. Se reconoce el esfuerzo del Gobierno de Colombia en la protecci&#243;n de algunas de

<p>137. The Special Rapporteur is very concerned about several provisions of various 
versions of a draft law on non governmental organisations which, if passed without further 
changes, would severly curtail the exercise of freedom of association in Egypt. On 28 
March 2013, the Special Rapporteur joined a press statement issued by several special 
procedures mandate holders, in which they voiced concern over several provisions of the 
different versions of the draft law. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Egyptian 
authorities&#8223; initiative to revise law 84/2002 due to its lack of compliance with international 
law and standards; however, he warns that the draft legislation being considered by the 
Shura Council has a number of serious shortcomings, notably in relation to the issue of 
funding. He recommends that the Government take into account the draft put forward by 
civil society actors as they will be primary affected by this new legislation; and adopt a new 
law on NGO to be in compliance with the best practices detailed in his thematic report (see 
notably A/HRC/20/27). He stands ready to provide any technical assistance.  
</p>
<p>138. In relation to violence during peaceful demonstrations, the Special Rapporteur urges 
the authorities to investigate into any allegations of excessive use of force as well as any 
allegations of gender violence, including sexual violence, against women during peaceful 
assembly which are inacceptable. Any allegations of human rights violations should be 
subject to a thorough and independent investigation and those responsible should be held 
accountable; and victims should be provided with full redress.  
</p>
<p>139. The Special Rapporteur refers to Human Rights Council resolution 21/16, and in 
particular operative paragraph 1 which &#8220;reminds States of their obligation to respect and 
fully protect the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely, online 
as well as offline, including in the context of elections, and including persons espousing 
minority or dissenting views or beliefs, human rights defenders, trade unionists and others, 
including migrants, seeking to exercise or to promote these rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>140. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Egypt of his country visit 
request sent in September 2011, to which a response is yet to be received.  He believes such 
a country visit may provide with a significant opportunity to discuss the technical assistance 
the Government may require. </p>

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>143.  The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Ethiopia for its response 
to his communication dated 31 July 2012, but he regrets no response was received to the 
other communication he sent on 23 November 2012. A response to a communication on 
alleged strict implementation of the Charities and Societies Proclamation 621/2009, sent on 
9/12/2011, is still to be received. The Special Rapporteur considers responses to his 
communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate, 
and urges the authorities to provide as soon as possible detailed responses to all the 
concerns raised in the latter communication. 
</p>
<p>144.  The Special Rapporteur remains seriously concerned by several provisions of the 
Charities and Societies Proclamation 621/2009 which continue to severly and unduly 
restrict the ability for individuals to form associations, and when formed, to operate freely. 
He is gravely concerned that such a strict legal framework governing civil society has had 
adverse consequences on human rights associations and has had forced many of them to 
discontinue their activities. He warns against the implementation of any legislation which 
would ultimately be used to silence critics. He recommends again that the Government  
revise the 2009 CSO law due to its lack of compliance with international norms and 
standards related to freedom of associaiton, notably with respect to access to funding; and 
to ensure that the revised version complies with the best practices detailed in his thematic 
reports (see notably A/HRC/20/27). He further urges the authorities to consult with 
independent civil society organisations which will primary be affected by this legislation. In 
this respect, he refers to a number of recommendations put forward by the Human Rights 
Council, within the framework of the Universal Periodic Review, including 
recommendation 97.55, or by the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8223; Rights, 
which recommended that the law be amended. He stands ready to provide any technical 
assistance the Government may require in this regard. 
</p>
<p>145.  The Special Rapporteur refers to Human Rights Council resolution 21/16, and in

</p>
<p>149. The Special Rapporteur urges again the authorities to ensure that no individual is 
criminalised for the peaceful exercise of his fundamental freedoms. He recommends that 
the Government put in place an enabling and safe environment allowing individuals to 
exercise their legitimate freedoms without undue hindrances. A thorough and independent 
investigation over any allegations of human rights violations or abuses should be 
conducted, those responsible should be held accountable, and victims should be provided 
with full redress.

<p>191. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Indonesia for its response, but 
regrets that the Government of Indonesia did not respond to his communications of 31 
August 2012, 23 February 2012, and 8 July 2011. He considers responses to his 
communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate, 
and urges the authorities to provide as soon as possible detailed responses to all the 
concerns raised in these communications. 
</p>
<p>192. The Special Rapporteur remains very concerned about the situation of human rights

<p>193. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concerns about the Bill on Societal 
Organizations, which, as highlighted in a press release issued jointly on 14 February 2013 
by the Special Rapporteurs on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association, on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, on the situation of human rights defenders, and on freedom of religion or belief, 
&#8220;threatens with undue restrictions the rights to freedom of association, expression, and 
religion. They urged Members of Parliament to amend the Bill to bring it in line with 
international human rights norms and standards&#8221;1 (see notably A/HRC/20/27). He urges 
again the authorities to amend the Bill accordingly. 
</p>
<p>194. The Special Rapporteur refers to Human Rights Council resolution 21/16, and in 
particular operative paragraph 1 that &#8220;[r]eminds States of their obligation to respect and 
fully protect the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely, online 
as well as offline, including in the context of elections, and including persons espousing 
minority or dissenting views or beliefs, human rights defenders, trade unionists and others, 
including migrants, seeking to exercise or to promote these rights, and to take all necessary 
measures to ensure that any restrictions on the free exercise of the rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association are in accordance with their obligations under 
international human rights law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>195. The Special Rapporteur reminds again the Government of Indonesia of his country 
visit request sent in September 2011, to which a response is yet to be received. In this 
connection, OP6 of resolution 15/21 states that the &#8220;Human Rights Council&#8230; [c]alls upon

soon as possible detailed responses to all the concerns raised in these communications due 
to the grave nature of the allegations received. 
</p>
<p>202. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the physical and psychological 
integrity of people exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association in the Islamic Republic of Iran, including the arrest of prominent women human 
rights defenders. He recommends again that the Government put in place an enabling and 
safe environment that is conducive to the free expression of civil society allowing 
individuals to exercise their legitimate freedom of association without undue hindrances. A 
thorough and independent investigation into any allegations of any human rights violations, 
including acts of intimidations or harassments, committed against those exercising their 
rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, should be conducted; those 
responsible should be held accountable; and victims should be provided with full redress. 
</p>
<p>203. The Special Rapporteur remains particularly preoccupied about the situation of 
representatives of the Ahwazi Arab minority, as expressed in a press statement dated 25 
January 2013 in which he urged, jointly with four other Special Procedures mandate 
holders, to &#8220;halt the execution of five Ahwazi activists&#8221;.2  
</p>
<p>204. The Special Rapporteur remains similarly preoccupied about the situation of Ms.

urges the authorities to release them and/or end the harassment against them. 
</p>
<p>205. The Special Rapporteur is further seriously concerned about the detention of key 
opposition leaders ahead of presidential elections, as expressed in a press statement dated 
11 February 2013, and calls again for their immediate release.3

<p><b>  Observations

<p>210. The Special Rapporteur regrets no reply has been received from the Government of 
Israel to any of the communications he sent during the reporting period. He considers 
responses to his communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments 
with his mandate, and urges the authorities to provide as soon as possible detailed responses 
to all the concerns raised in his communications. 
</p>
<p>211. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about increased restrictions on the rights of 
individuals to freedom of association and of peaceful assembly. He reminds that one of the 
key principles of freedom of association is the presumption that the activities of the 
associations are lawful. He urges authorities to refrain from unduly interfering in the 
internal affairs of associations and to take positive measures to ensure individuals 
exercising their right to freedom of association and of peaceful assembly are not subject to, 
or threaten to be subject to, discrimination, threats or use of violence, harassment, 
persecution, intimidation or reprisals. He requests the authorities to keep him informed 
about the measures taken to ensure the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Ayman 
Nasser. 
</p>
<p>212. In light of increased restrictions faced by human rights defenders who are members 
of associations, the Special Rapporteur refers to Human Rights Council resolution 21/16, 
and in particular operative paragraph 1 which &#8220;reminds States of their obligation to respect 
and fully protect the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely, 
online as well as offline, including in the context of elections, and including persons 
espousing minority or dissenting views or beliefs, human rights defenders, trade unionists

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>214. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Jordan for its 
response to his communication dated 1 October 2012.  
</p>
<p>215. Despite the assurances provided by the Government of Jordan, the Special 
Rapporteur remains seriously concerned by several provisions of the 2008 Societies Law, 
amended in 2009, which do not comply with international norms and standards related to 
</p>
<p>freedom of association. He recommends that the Government revise the 2008 Societies 
Law, amended in 2009, notably with respect to access to funding; and, to ensure that the 
revised version complies with the best practices detailed in his reports (see notably 
A/HRC/20/27). He encourages the Government to consult with civil society organisations 
which are primary affected by this legislation. He stands ready to provide any technical 
assistance the Government may require in this regard. 
</p>
<p>216. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Jordan of his country visit 
request sent in September 2011, to which a response is yet to be received.  He considers 
such a country visit may provide with a significant opportunity to discuss the technical 
assistance the Government may require. </p>

to the country and deported on the grounds that her name appeared on a list, provided by 
the Government of Bahrain to the authorities of Kuwait in July 2012, enumerating Bahraini 
citizens who should be denied entry to the country. He urges the authorities to take positive 
measures to ensure individuals can freely exercise their right to freedom of association and

threats or use of violence, harassment, persecution, intimidation or reprisals.

he is very concerned about several provisions of a new law on peaceful assembly which do

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>258. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Malaysia for having replied to 
four of his communications sent during the reported period, but regrets that his 
communications dated 12 and 14 February 2013 remain unanswered at the time of drafting 
the present report. He considers responses to his communications as an important part of 
the cooperation of Governments with his mandate, and urges the authorities to provide as </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/39/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>37 
</b></p>
<p>soon as possible detailed responses to all the concerns raised in these communications due 
to the grave nature of the allegations received. 
</p>
<p>259. The Special Rapporteur further urges the authorities to ensure that no individual is 
criminalised for the exercise of his or her legitimate fundamental freedoms. He also urges 
the authorities to take all relevant measures to ensure that any individual and legal entity 
can peacefully exercise their rights of freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. He 
recommends that the Government put in place an enabling and safe environment allowing 
individuals to exercise their legitimate freedoms without undue hindrances. A thorough and 
independent investigation into any allegations of any alleged human rights violations, 
including acts of intimidations or harassments, committed against those exercising their 
rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, should be conducted; those 
responsible should be held accountable; and victims should be provided with full redress. 
</p>
<p>260. While welcoming the fact that the Companies Commission of Malaysia and the 
Registrar of Societies ended their investigations on SUARAM in the absence of conclusive 
elements, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the latest investigations 
launched against SUARAM under the Peaceful Assembly Act. He calls on the authorities 
and other stakeholders, including the media, to respect the legitimate work of SUARAM. 
</p>
<p>261. In a press statement dated 7 June 2012, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with other 
special procedures mandate holders, &#8220;called on the Government of Malaysia and other 
</p>
<p>parties involved to respect and protect the legitimate work of an umbrella group of NGOs 
campaigning for reform of the electoral process in the lead-up to the general election&#8221;4 
which took place in early May 2013. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur is 
concerned about the alleged attacks against human rights defenders following this election, 
and calls on the authorities to investigate all allegations of human rights violations and 
bring the perpetrators to justice. 
</p>
<p>262. The Special Rapporteur refers to Human Rights Council resolution 21/16, and in 
particular operative paragraph 1 that &#8220;[r]eminds States of their obligation to respect and 
fully protect the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely, online 
as well as offline, including in the context of elections, and including persons espousing 
minority or dissenting views or beliefs, human rights defenders, trade unionists and others, 
including migrants, seeking to exercise or to promote these rights, and to take all necessary 
measures to ensure that any restrictions on the free exercise of the rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association are in accordance with their obligations under 
international human rights law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>263. The Special Rapporteur thanks all the stakeholders with whom he met during his 
academic visit to Malaysia from 6 to 8 September 2012. 
</p>
<p>264. Finally, the Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Malaysia for its invitation 
to undertake a country visit. He hopes that the Government will eventually agree on dates 
for the mission to materialize.

<p>266. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Maldives did not respond 
to his communication dated 22 March 2012. He considers responses to his communications 
as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate, and urges the 
authorities to provide as soon as possible detailed responses to all the concerned he raised 
in his communication. 
</p>
<p>267. The Special Rapporteur urges again the authorities to ensure that any individual and 
legal entity, including political parties, can peacefully exercise their right of freedom of 
peaceful assembly. A thorough and independent investigation into any allegations of 
excessive use of force and of torture and ill treatment, including against women, during 
peaceful demonstrations, should be conducted; those responsible should be held 
accountable; and victims should be provided with full redress. 
</p>
<p>268. The Special Rapporteur refers to Human Rights Council resolution 21/16, and in 
particular operative paragraph 1 that &#8220;[r]eminds States of their obligation to respect and 
fully protect the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely, online 
as well as offline, including in the context of elections, and including persons espousing

the Government in 2011 to conduct a field visit to the Maldives.

his communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with his

the authorities to take all relevant measures to ensure that any individual and legal entity, 
including political parties, can peacefully exercise their rights of freedom of peaceful

broad interpretations of laws that have resulted in undue restrictions on individuals&#8223; rights

<p>301. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about repeated allegations of excessive 
use of force during demonstrations that have largely been peaceful in the reporting period 
he continues to receive. He urges the authorities to ensure its legislation and its 
implementation pertaining to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association comply with 
the best practices detailed in his reports (see notably A/HRC/20/27). He remains available 
to provide any technical assistance the Government might require in this regard. 
</p>
<p>302. The Special Rapporteur refers to Human Rights Council resolution 21/16, and in

<p>357. The Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned about the physical and psychological 
integrity of individuals exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association in the country, particularly of those promoting and protecting human rights. He 
calls upon the relevant authorities to ensure that no one is criminalised for the exercise of 
his legitimate rights and freedoms, and to release immediately and unconditionally all 
persons convicted for exercising their legitimate rights and freedoms. In light of the gravity 
of the allegations received during the reporting period, he requests the Government to keep 
him informed about any evolution of the situation of those mentioned in his 
communications who were arrested, charged or convicted in relation of the exercise of their 
rights and freedoms; and about the steps taken to secure the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association, in law and in practice. 
</p>
<p>358. The Special Rapporteur is also very disturbed about allegations of killings during 
demonstrations. He reminds that the right to life and to be free from torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are a non-derogable right in international 
human rights law, including in the context of assemblies. In this regard, he refers to Article 
5 of the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials 
Adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the 
Treatment of Offenders (1990), which provides that &#8220;whenever the lawful use of force and 
</p>
<p>firearms is unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall minimize damage and injury, and 
respect and preserve human life.&#8221; He calls upon the authorities to carry out a thorough and 
</p>
<p>independent investigation into any allegations of excessive use of force and of torture and 
ill treatment during peaceful demonstrations that took place in July 2012; to hold 
accountable those responsible; and to provide full redress to victims. 
</p>
<p>359. The Special Rapporteur refers to Human Rights Council resolution 21/16, and in 
particular operative paragraph 1 which &#8220;reminds States of their obligation to respect and

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>374. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Sudan for the replies it 
transmitted to three of the communications he sent during the reporting period, but he 
regrets that two communications have remained unanswered. He considers responses to his 
communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate, 
and urges the authorities to provide as soon as possible detailed responses to all the 
concerns raised in his communications. 
</p>
<p>375. The Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned about the physical and psychological 
integrity of individuals exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and 
association in Sudan. He is seriously concerned about reports indicating that on the 
occasion of demonstrations largely peaceful that have been taken place during the reporting 
period, law enforcement officials used teargas, rubber bullets and batons to disperse and 
arrest peaceful protesters; and that several demonstrators were subject to torture while in 
detention.  The Special Rapporteur is particularly disturbed about allegations of deaths 
during demonstrations. He reminds that the right to life and to be free from torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are a non-derogable right in international 
human rights law, including in the context of assemblies. In this regard, he refers to Article 
5 of the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials 
Adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the 
Treatment of Offenders (1990), which provides that &#8220;whenever the lawful use of force and 
</p>
<p>firearms is unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall minimize damage and injury, and 
respect and preserve human life.&#8221; He also underlines that &#8220;States Party shall ensure in its 
legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right 
to fair and adequate compensation, including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible. 
In the event of the death of the victim as a result of an act of torture, his dependants shall be 
entitled to compensation.&#8221; (Article 14 of the UN Convention against Torture and Other 
</p>
<p>Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which the Syrian Arab Republic 
is a State party). He calls upon the authorities to carry out a thorough and independent 
investigation; to hold accountable those responsible; and to provide full redress to victims. 
He further calls upon the authorities to release immediately and unconditionally all persons 
convicted for exercising their legitimate rights and freedoms. He requests the Government 
to keep him informed about the investigations conducted in relation to the aforementioned 
cases.  
</p>
<p>376. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the closure of several 
human rights associations in the country. He notes the reply transmitted by the Government 
of Sudan, but he remains preoccupied that these measures may be related to the human 
rights work carried out by the concerned associations and may be a direct attempt to silence 
and intimidate independent civil society actors. He urges the authorities to take positive 
measures to ensure individuals can freely exercise their right to freedom of association and 
of peaceful assembly and are not subject to, or threaten to be subject to, discrimination, 
threats or use of violence, harassment, persecution, intimidation or reprisals. </p>

fully protect the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely, online 
as well as offline, including in the context of elections, and including persons espousing

<p>380. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no reply has been received from the 
Government of Swaziland to the communications he sent on 26/04/2012 and on 
29/09/2012. He considers responses to his communications as an important part of the 
cooperation of Governments with his mandate, and urges the authorities to provide as soon 
as possible detailed responses to all the concerns raised in his communications. 
</p>
<p>381. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about increasing restrictions on freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association in the country. The Special Rapporteur considers 
crucial that individuals can take part in associations, including political parties, unions or 
civic organisations, to express their opinions and views, including in relation to economic, 
social and cultural rights. He urges the authorities to reconsider the decision to de-register 
the Trade Union Congress of Swaziland and to take steps to secure the right to freedom of 
association and of peaceful assembly.   
</p>
<p>382. In this context, the Special Rapporteur refers to Human Rights Council resolution 
21/16, and in particular operative paragraph 1 which &#8220;reminds States of their obligation to 
respect and fully protect the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate 
freely, online as well as offline, including in the context of elections, and including persons

<p>387. The Special Rapporteur remains extremely concerned about the physical and

assembly and association in the Syrian Arab Republic. He is deeply disturbed by 
allegations of excessive use of force during demonstrations, killings and torture, arbitrary 
arrest, incommunicado detention, enforced disappearances in the context of the exercise of 
the rights to freedom of association and of peaceful assembly. He reminds that the right to 
life and to be free from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are 
a non-derogable right in international human rights law, including in the context of 
assemblies. In this regard, he refers to Article 5 of the Basic Principles on the Use of Force

provides that &#8220;whenever the lawful use of force and firearms is unavoidable, law

of force and of torture and ill treatment during peaceful demonstrations should be 
conducted; those responsible should be held accountable; and victims should be provided

conducted in relation to the aforementioned cases.  
</p>
<p>388. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the relevant authorities to ensure that no one is 
criminalised for the exercise of his legitimate rights and freedoms. He urges the authorities 
to release immediately and unconditionally all persons convicted for exercising their 
legitimate rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p>389. The Special Rapporteur regrets the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic did not 
respond to his letter dated 1 December 2011, in which he proposed dates for a visit when 
conditions were conducive for such a visit, after the Government extended an invitation for 
such a visit to take place &#8220;during the first months of [2012]&#8221;.

all the more disturbing that Amparo had actively engaged with United Nations human

</p>

that any individual and legal entity can peacefully exercise their rights of freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association. He recommends that the Government put in place an 
enabling and safe environment allowing individuals to exercise their legitimate freedoms 
without undue hindrances. A thorough and independent investigation into any allegations of

to his communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with his

</p>
<p>421. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about different draft laws which may 
negatively impact on the enjoyment of freedom of association and of peaceful assembly. He 
urges the authorities to ensure the rights to freedom of association and of peaceful assembly 
is enjoyed by all, without any kind of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>422. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about several provisions of the 
Public Order Management Bill which do not comply with international norms and 
standards pertaining to freedom of association and of peaceful assembly. He urges the

practices detailed in his reports (see notably A/HRC/20/27). He stands ready to provide any

the Government may require.

<p>432. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of the United Arab 
Emirates for its reply to the communication he sent on 7 November 2012, but he regrets 
that the two other communications he sent during the reporting period remain unanswered.

Governments with his mandate, and urges the authorities to provide as soon as possible 
detailed responses to all the concerns raised in his communications. 
</p>
<p>433. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the increasing restrictions to the exercise 
of freedom of association and of peaceful assembly in the country, which include 
withdrawal of nationality, arrests, detention and convictions against individuals who have 
solely exercised their fundamental rights and freedoms. The Special Rapporteur is 
increasingly concerned about the physical and psychological integrity of individuals

and organizations which oppose the impact of legislation, and other measures, on the 
enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
including access to adequate sexual and reproductive healthcare services. He urges the

</p>
<p>451. The Special Rapporteur urges once again the authorities to ensure that no individual 
is criminalised for the exercise of his or her legitimate fundamental freedoms. He further 
urges the authorities to take all relevant measures to ensure that any individual and legal 
entity can peacefully exercise their rights of freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association. He recommends that the Government put in place an enabling and safe 
environment allowing individuals to exercise their legitimate freedoms without undue 
hindrances. A thorough and independent investigation into any allegations of any human 
rights violations, including acts of intimidations or harassments, committed against those 
exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, should be 
conducted; those responsible should be held accountable; and victims should be provided 
with full redress. 
</p>
<p>452. The Special Rapporteur refers to Human Rights Council resolution 21/16, and in 
particular operative paragraph 1 that &#8220;[r]eminds States of their obligation to respect and 
fully protect the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely, online 
as well as offline, including in the context of elections, and including persons espousing 
minority or dissenting views or beliefs, human rights defenders, trade unionists and others, 
including migrants, seeking to exercise or to promote these rights, and to take all necessary 
measures to ensure that any restrictions on the free exercise of the rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association are in accordance with their obligations under 
international human rights law&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>459. The Special Rapporteur regrets the Government of Zimbabwe only replied to one of 
the communication he sent during the reporting period. He considers responses to his 
communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with his mandate, 
and urges urges the authorities to provide as soon as possible detailed responses to all the 
concerns raised in his communications, including those from the previous reporting period 
to which no reply has yet been received. 
</p>
<p>460. The Special Rapporteur remains very concerned about repeated acts of harasments 
and indimidation, including raids on civic associations and criminalisation of individuals 
for running an &#8220;unregistered&#8221; organization. On 27 February 2013, the Special Rapporteur 
joined a press statement issued by several special procedures mandate holders, in which 
they voiced concern over undue restrictions to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association in the run up to the constitutional referendum on 16 March and subsequent 
elections. The Special Rapporteur believes that undue restrictions to the rights to freedom 
of peaceful assembly and of association, which are essential components of democracy, 
especially during electoral period, have a detrimental effect on the electoral process.  
</p>
<p>461. He urges the authorities to ensure the physical and psychological integrity of people 
exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association and to ensure 
these rights are enjoyed by all without any kind of discrimination. He urges the authorities 
to take positive measures to ensure individuals can freely exercise their right to freedom of 
association and of peaceful assembly and are not subject to, or threaten to be subject to, 
discrimination, threats or use of violence, harassment, persecution, intimidation or reprisals. 
</p>
<p>462. In relation to reported acts of harassment and intimidation against human rights 
defenders members of associations, the Special Rapporteur refers to Human Rights Council 
resolution 21/16, and in particular operative paragraph 1 which &#8220;reminds States of their 
obligation to respect and fully protect the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully 
and associate freely, online as well as offline, including in the context of elections, and
