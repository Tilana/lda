</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are engaged in uranium mining and related activities, 
including exploration, pre-extraction, extraction and processing, on uranium 
projects located in the United States and Paraguay.  We utilize in-situ recovery
("ISR") mining where possible which we believe, when compared to conventional 
open pit or underground mining, requires lower capital and operating 
expenditures with a shorter lead time to extraction and a reduced impact on the 
environment.  We do not expect, however, to utilize ISR mining for all of our 
mineral rights in which case we would expect to rely on conventional open pit 
and/or underground mining techniques.  We have one uranium mine located in the 
State of Texas, the Palangana Mine, which utilizes ISR mining and commenced 
extraction of uranium oxide ("U<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>8</SUB>"), or yellowcake, in 
November 2010.  We have one uranium processing facility or mill located in the 
State of Texas, the Hobson Processing Facility, which processes material from 
the Palangana Mine into drums of U<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>8</SUB>, our only sales 
product and source of revenue, for shipping to a third-party storage and sales 
facility.  At July&nbsp;31, 2016, we had no uranium supply or "off-take" 
agreements in place.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our fully-licensed and 100%-owned Hobson Processing Facility 
forms the basis for our regional operating strategy in the State of Texas, 
specifically the South Texas Uranium Belt where we utilize ISR mining.  We 
utilize a "hub-and-spoke" strategy whereby the Hobson Processing Facility acts 
as the central processing site (the "hub") for our Palangana Mine and future 
satellite uranium mining activities, such as our Burke Hollow and Goliad 
Projects, located within the South Texas Uranium Belt (the "spokes").  The 
Hobson Processing Facility has a physical capacity to process uranium-loaded 
resins up to a total of two million pounds of U<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>8</SUB> 
annually and is licensed to process up to one million pounds of 
U<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>8</SUB> annually.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also hold certain mineral rights in various stages in the 
States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming and in the Republic 
of Paraguay, many of which are located in historically successful mining areas 
and have been the subject of past exploration and pre-extraction activities by 
other mining companies.  We do not expect, however, to utilize ISR mining for 
all of our mineral rights in which case we would expect to rely on conventional 
open pit and/or underground mining techniques.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our operating and strategic framework is based on expanding 
our uranium extraction activities, which includes advancing certain uranium 
projects with established mineralized materials towards uranium extraction, and 
establishing additional mineralized materials on our existing uranium projects 
or through acquisition of additional uranium projects.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016, uranium 
extraction at PAA-1, 2 and 3 of the Palangana Mine continued to operate at a 
reduced pace since implementing our strategic plan in September 2013, to align 
our operations to a weak uranium market in a challenging post-Fukushima 
environment.  This strategy has included the deferral of major pre-extraction 
expenditures and remaining in a state of operational readiness in anticipation 
of a recovery in uranium prices.</P>

we have a limited financial and operating history, with significant negative 
cash flow and accumulated deficit to date.  Furthermore, there is no assurance 
that we will be successful in securing any form of additional financing in the 
future, therefore substantial doubt exists as to whether our cash resources

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As more fully described under Item 1. Business, in our Form 
10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015, we were incorporated
under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 16, 2003 and since 2004, we have 
been engaged in uranium mining and related activities, including exploration, 
pre-extraction, extraction and processing, on projects located in the United 
States and Paraguay. In November 2010, we commenced uranium extraction for the 
first time at the Palangana Mine utilizing ISR and processed those materials at 
the Hobson Processing Facility into drums of U<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>8</SUB>, our 
only sales product and source of revenue.  We also hold uranium projects in 
various stages of exploration and pre-extraction in the States of Arizona, 
Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming and the Republic of Paraguay.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As more fully described under "Liquidity and Capital 
Resources" of Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Result of Operations, in our Form 10-Q Quarterly Report for the 
period ended April 30, 2016, we have a history of significant negative cash flow
and net losses, with an accumulated deficit balance of $205.6 million at April 
30, 2016.  Historically, we have been reliant primarily on equity financings 
from the sale of our common stock and, for Fiscal 2014 and 2013, on debt 
financing in order to fund our operations.  Although we generated revenues from 
sales of U<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>8</SUB> during Fiscal 2015, 2013 and 2012 of $3.1 
million, $9.0 million and $13.8 million, respectively, with no revenues from 
sales of U<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>8</SUB> generated during the nine months ended April
30, 2016, Fiscal 2014 or for any periods prior to Fiscal 2012, we have yet to 
achieve profitability or develop positive cash flow from our operations, and we 
do not expect to achieve profitability or develop positive cash flow from 
operations in the near term.  As a result of our limited financial and operating
history, including our significant negative cash flow and net losses to date, it
may be difficult to evaluate our future performance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At April 30, 2016, we had a working capital of $9.0 million 
including cash and cash equivalents of $10.1 million.  As the Company does not 
expect to achieve and maintain profitability in the near term, the continuation 
of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain 
adequate additional financing which we have successfully secured since 
inception, including those from asset divestitures.  However, there is no 
assurance that we will be successful in securing any form of additional 
financing in the future, therefore, substantial doubt exists as to whether our 
cash resources and/or working capital will be sufficient to enable the Company 
to continue its operations over the next twelve months.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our reliance on equity and debt financings is expected to 
continue for the foreseeable future, and their availability whenever such 
additional financing is required, will be dependent on many factors beyond our 
control including, but not limited to, the market price of uranium, the 
continuing public support of nuclear power as a viable source of electrical 
generation, the volatility in the global financial markets affecting our stock 
price and the status of the worldwide economy, any one of which may cause 
significant challenges in our ability to access additional financing, including 
access to the equity and credit markets.  We may also be required to seek other 
forms of financing, such as asset divestitures or joint venture arrangements to 
continue advancing our uranium projects which would depend entirely on finding a
suitable third party willing to enter into such an arrangement, typically 
involving an assignment of a percentage interest in the mineral project.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our long-term success, including the recoverability of the 
carrying values of our assets and our ability to acquire additional uranium 
projects and continue with exploration and pre-extraction activities and mining 
activities on our existing uranium projects, will depend ultimately on our 
ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow from our 
operations by establishing ore bodies that contain commercially recoverable 
uranium and to develop these into profitable mining activities.  The economic 
viability of our mining activities, including the expected duration and 
profitability of the Palangana Mine and of any future satellite ISR mines, such 
as the Burke Hollow and Goliad Projects, located within the South Texas Uranium 
Belt, has many risks and uncertainties.  These include, but are not limited to: 
(i) a significant, prolonged decrease in the market price of uranium; (ii) 
difficulty in marketing and/or selling uranium concentrates; (iii) significantly
higher than expected capital costs to construct the mine and/or processing 
plant; (iv) significantly higher than expected extraction costs; (v) 
significantly lower than expected uranium extraction; (vi) significant delays, 
reductions or stoppages of uranium extraction activities; and (vi) the 
introduction of significantly more stringent regulatory laws and regulations.  
Our mining activities may change as a result of any one or more of these risks 
and uncertainties and there is no assurance that any ore body that we extract 
mineralized materials from will result in achieving and maintaining 
profitability and developing positive cash flow.</P>

capital expenditures are expected to be substantial.  We will require 
significant additional financing to fund our operations, including acquiring 
additional uranium projects and continuing with our exploration and pre-
extraction activities which include assaying, drilling, geological and 
geochemical analysis and mine construction costs.  In the absence of such 
additional financing we would not be able to fund our operations or continue 
with our exploration and pre-extraction activities, which may result in delays, 
curtailment or abandonment of any one or all of our uranium projects.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are unable to service our indebtedness, we may be
faced with accelerated repayments or lose the assets securing our indebtedness. 
Furthermore, restrictive covenants governing our indebtedness may restrict our 
ability to pursue our business strategies.</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Effective on February 9, 2016, we entered into a 
Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Second Amended and Restated 
Credit Agreement") with our lenders under which we had previously drawn down the
maximum $20 million in principal as of April 30, 2016.  The Second Amended and 
Restated Credit Agreement requires monthly interest payments calculated at 8% 
per annum and other periodic fees, and principal repayments of $1.67 million per
month over a twelve-month period commencing on February 1, 2019.  Our ability to
continue making these scheduled payments will be dependent on and may change as 
a result of our financial condition and operating results.  Failure to make any 
one of these scheduled payments will put us in default with the Second Amended 
and Restated Credit Agreement which, if not addressed or waived, could require 
accelerated repayment of our indebtedness and/or enforcement by the lenders 
against our assets.  Enforcement against our assets would have a material 
adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
includes restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to 
sell our assets or to incur additional indebtedness other than permitted 
indebtedness, which may restrict our ability to pursue certain business 
strategies from time to time.  If we do not comply with these restrictive 
covenants, we could be in default which, if not addressed or waived, could 
require accelerated repayment of our indebtedness and/or enforcement by the 
lenders against our assets. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a limited history of uranium extraction and 
generating revenue.  In November 2010, we commenced uranium extraction at a

significantly lower than expected uranium extraction; (vi) significant delays, 
reductions or stoppages of uranium extraction activities; and (vii) the 
introduction of significantly more stringent regulatory laws and regulations.  
Furthermore, continued mining activities at the Palangana Mine will eventually 
deplete the Palangana Mine or cause such activities to become uneconomical, and 
if we are unable to directly acquire or develop existing uranium projects, such 
as the Burke Hollow and Goliad Projects, into additional uranium mines from 
which we can commence uranium extraction, it will negatively impact our ability 
to generate revenues.  Any one or more of these occurrences may adversely affect
our financial condition and operating results.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Uranium exploration and pre-extraction programs and 
mining activities are inherently subject to numerous significant risks and 
uncertainties, and actual results may differ significantly from expectations or 
anticipated amounts. Furthermore, exploration programs conducted on our uranium 
projects may not result in the establishment of ore bodies that contain 
commercially recoverable uranium.</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Uranium exploration and pre-extraction programs and 
mining activities are inherently subject to numerous significant risks and 
uncertainties, many beyond our control, including, but not limited to: (i) 
unanticipated ground and water conditions and adverse claims to water rights; 
(ii) unusual or unexpected geological formations; (iii) metallurgical and other 
processing problems; (iv) the occurrence of unusual weather or operating 
conditions and other force majeure events; (v) lower than expected ore grades;

of contractors and labor; (x) government permit restrictions and regulation 
restrictions; (xi) unavailability of materials and equipment; and (xii) the 
failure of equipment or processes to operate in accordance with specifications 
or expectations.  These risks and uncertainties could result in: (i) delays,

extraction costs; (iii) damage to, or destruction of, our mineral projects, 
extraction facilities or other properties; (iv) personal injuries; (v) 
environmental damage; (vi) monetary losses; and (vii) legal claims.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Success in uranium exploration is dependent on many factors, 
including, without limitation, the experience and capabilities of a company's 
management, the availability of geological expertise and the availability of 
sufficient funds to conduct the exploration program.  Even if an exploration 
program is successful and commercially recoverable uranium is established, it 
may take a number of years from the initial phases of drilling and 
identification of the mineralization until extraction is possible, during which 
time the economic feasibility of extraction may change such that the uranium 
ceases to be economically recoverable.  Uranium exploration is frequently non-
productive due, for example, to poor exploration results or the inability to 
establish ore bodies that contain commercially recoverable uranium, in which 
case the uranium project may be abandoned and written-off.  Furthermore, we will
not be able to benefit from our exploration efforts and recover the expenditures
that we incur on our exploration programs if we do not establish ore bodies that
contain commercially recoverable uranium and develop these uranium projects into
profitable mining activities, and there is no assurance that we will be 
successful in doing so for any of our uranium projects.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">P-7</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><HR NOSHADE SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether an ore body contains commercially recoverable uranium
depends on many factors including, without limitation: (i) the particular 
attributes, including material changes to those attributes, of the ore body such
as size, grade, recovery rates and proximity to infrastructure; (ii) the market 
price of uranium, which may be volatile; and (iii) government regulations and 
regulatory requirements including, without limitation, those relating to 
environmental protection, permitting and land use, taxes, land tenure and 
transportation.</P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have not established proven or probable reserves 
through the completion of a "final" or "bankable" feasibility study for any of 
our uranium projects, including the Palangana Mine.  Furthermore, we have no 
plans to establish proven or probable reserves for any of our uranium projects
for which we plan on utilizing ISR mining, such as the Palangana Mine.  Since we
commenced extraction of mineralized materials from the Palangana Mine without 
having established proven or probable reserves, it may result in our mining 
activities at the Palangana Mine, and at any future uranium projects for which 
proven or probable reserves are not established, being inherently riskier than 
other mining activities for which proven or probable reserves have been 
established.</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have established the existence of mineralized 
materials for certain uranium projects, including the Palangana Mine.  We have 
not established proven or probable reserves, as defined by the SEC under 
Industry Guide 7, through the completion of a "final" or "bankable" feasibility 
study for any of our uranium projects, including the Palangana Mine.  
Furthermore, we have no plans to establish proven or probable reserves for any 
of our uranium projects for which we plan on utilizing ISR mining, such as the 
Palangana Mine.  Since we commenced uranium extraction at the Palangana Mine 
without having established proven or probable reserves, there may be greater 
inherent uncertainty as to whether or not any mineralized material can be 
economically extracted as originally planned and anticipated.  Any mineralized 
materials established or extracted from the Palangana Mine should not in any way
be associated with having established or produced from proven or probable

</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the fact that we commenced uranium extraction
at the Palangana Mine in November 2010, we remain in the Exploration Stage as 
defined under Industry Guide 7, and will continue to remain in the Exploration 
Stage until such time proven or probable reserves have been established, which 
may never occur.  We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") under 
which acquisition costs of mineral rights are initially capitalized as incurred 
while pre-production expenditures are expensed as incurred until such time we 
exit the Exploration Stage.&nbsp; Expenditures relating to exploration 
activities are expensed as incurred and expenditures relating to pre-extraction 
activities are expensed as incurred until such time proven or probable reserves 
are established for that uranium project, after which subsequent expenditures 
relating to mine development activities for that particular project are 
capitalized as incurred.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have neither established nor have any plans to establish 
proven or probable reserves for our uranium projects for which we plan on 
utilizing ISR mining, such as the Palangana Mine.  Companies in the Production 
Stage as defined by the SEC under Industry Guide 7, having established proven 
and probable reserves and exited the Exploration Stage, typically capitalize 
expenditures relating to ongoing development activities, with corresponding 
depletion calculated over proven and probable reserves using the units-of-
production method and allocated to future reporting periods to inventory and, as
that inventory is sold, to cost of goods sold.  As we are in the Exploration 
Stage, it has resulted in us reporting larger losses than if we had been in the 
Production Stage due to the expensing, instead of capitalization, of 
expenditures relating to ongoing mill and mine pre-extraction activities.  
Additionally, there would be no corresponding amortization allocated to our 
future reporting periods since those costs would have been expensed previously, 
resulting in both lower inventory costs and cost of goods sold and results of 
operations with higher gross profits and lower losses than if we had been in the
Production Stage.  Any capitalized costs, such as acquisition costs of mineral 
rights, are depleted over the estimated extraction life using the straight-line 
method.  As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be directly 
comparable to the financial statements of companies in the Production Stage.</P>

trading on the NYSE MKT (formerly known as the American Stock Exchange and the 
NYSE Amex Equities Exchange) and prior to that, traded on the OTC Bulletin 
Board.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The global markets have experienced significant and increased
volatility in the past, and have been impacted by the effects of mass sub-prime
mortgage defaults and liquidity problems of the asset-backed commercial paper 
market, resulting in a number of large financial institutions requiring 
government bailouts or filing for bankruptcy.  The effects of these past events 
and any similar events in the future may continue to or further affect the 
global markets, which may directly affect the market price of our common stock 
and our accessibility for additional financing.  Although this volatility may be
unrelated to specific company performance, it can have an adverse effect on the 
market price of our shares which, historically, has fluctuated significantly and
may continue to do so in the future.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the volatility associated with general 
economic trends and market conditions, the market price of our common stock 
could decline significantly due to the impact of any one or more events, 
including, but not limited to, the following: (i) volatility in the uranium 
market; (ii) occurrence of a major nuclear incident such as the events in 
Fukushima in March 2011; (iii) changes in the outlook for the nuclear power and 
uranium industries; (iv) failure to meet market expectations on our exploration,
pre-extraction or extraction activities, including abandonment of key uranium 
projects; (v) sales of a large number of our shares held by certain stockholders
including institutions and insiders; (vi) downward revisions to previous 
estimates on us by analysts; (vii) removal from market indices; (viii) legal 
claims brought forth against us; and (ix) introduction of technological 
innovations by competitors or in competing technologies.</P>

exercise of stock options and share purchase warrants and for other reasons may 
result in significant dilution to and be issued at prices substantially below 
the price paid for our shares held by our existing stockholders.  Significant

and conditions of the awards granted.  The Company may issue restricted shares,
options, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock rights and dividend 
equivalent rights, among others, under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan.  As 
indicated above, an aggregate of 18,892,856 of our shares may be issued pursuant
to the grant of awards under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan.  12,392,856 of such 
18,892,856 shares are registered pursuant to prior Form S-8 registration

power to vote, or to direct the voting of such security; and (ii) investment 
power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the 
security.  Certain shares of common stock may be deemed to be beneficially owned
by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the
power to dispose of the shares).  In addition, shares of common stock are deemed
to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the 
shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as 
of which the information is provided.  In computing the percentage ownership of 
any person, the amount of shares of common stock outstanding is deemed to 
include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such 
person) by reason of these acquisition rights.  As a result, the percentage of 
outstanding shares of common stock of any person as shown in this table does not
necessarily reflect the person's actual ownership or voting power with respect

price prevailing at the time of sale;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><HR NOSHADE SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The selling stockholders may sell their shares directly to 
purchasers or may use brokers, dealers, underwriters or agents to sell their 
shares.  Brokers or dealers engaged by the selling stockholders may arrange for 
other brokers or dealers to participate.  Brokers or dealers may receive 
commissions, discounts or concessions from the selling stockholders, or, if any 
such broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser
in amounts to be negotiated immediately prior to the sale.  The compensation 
received by brokers or dealers may, but is not expected to, exceed that which is
customary for the types of transactions involved.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Broker-dealers may agree with a selling stockholder to sell a
specified number of shares at a stipulated price per share, and, to the extent 
the broker-dealer is unable to do so acting as agent for a selling stockholder, 
to purchase as principal any unsold shares at the price required to fulfill the 
broker-dealer commitment to the selling stockholder.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Broker-dealers who acquire shares as principal may thereafter
resell the shares from time to time in transactions, which may involve block 
transactions and sales to and through other broker-dealers, including 
transactions of the nature described above, in the over-the-counter market or 
otherwise at prices and on terms then prevailing at the time of sale, at prices 
then related to the then-current market price or in negotiated transactions.  In
connection with resales of the shares, broker-dealers may pay to or receive from
the purchasers of shares commissions as described above.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If our selling stockholders enter into arrangements with 
brokers or dealers, as described above, we are obligated to file a post-
effective amendment to this registration statement disclosing such arrangements,
including the names of any broker-dealers acting as underwriters.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The selling stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents 
that participate with the selling stockholders in the sale of the shares may be 
deemed to be "underwriters" within the meaning of the Securities Act.  In that 
event, any commissions received by broker-dealers or agents and any profit on 
the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting 
commissions or discounts under the Securities Act.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sales Pursuant to Rule 144</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any common shares covered by this prospectus which 
qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under
Rule 144 rather than pursuant to this prospectus.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regulation M</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The selling stockholders must comply with the 
requirements of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended (the "Exchange Act") in the offer and sale of the common stock.  In 
particular we will advise the selling stockholders that the anti-manipulation 
rules of Regulation M under the Exchange Act may apply to sales of shares in the
market and to the activities of the selling stockholders and their affiliates.  
Regulation M under the Exchange Act prohibits, with certain exceptions, 
participants in a distribution from bidding for, or purchasing for an account in
which the participant has a beneficial interest, any of the securities that are 
the subject of the distribution. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accordingly, during such times as a selling stockholder may 
be deemed to be engaged in a distribution of the common stock, and therefore be 
considered to be an underwriter, the selling stockholder must comply with 
applicable law and, among other things:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may not bid
for or purchase any of our securities or attempt to induce any person to 
purchase any of our securities other than as permitted under the Exchange 
Act.</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, we will make copies of this prospectus available
to the selling stockholders for the purpose of satisfying the prospectus 
delivery requirements of the Securities Act.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">State Securities Laws</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the securities laws of some states, the common 
shares may be sold in such states only through registered or licensed brokers or
dealers.  In addition, in some states the common shares may not be sold unless 
the shares have been registered or qualified for sale in the state or an 
exemption from registration or qualification is available and is complied with. 
</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Expenses of Registration</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are bearing all costs relating to the registration of 
the common stock.  These expenses include, but are not limited to, legal, 
accounting, printing and mailing fees.  The selling stockholders, however, will 
pay any commissions or other fees payable to brokers or dealers in connection 
with any sale of the common stock.</P>

corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint 
venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses, including amounts paid in 
settlement and attorneys' fees actually and reasonably incurred by him in 
connection with the defense or settlement of the action or suit if he acted in 
good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed 
to the best interests of the corporation. Indemnification may not be made for 
any claim, issue or matter as to which such a person has been adjudged by a 
court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals therefrom, to 
be liable to the corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the 
corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action or
suit was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction determines upon 
application that in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is 
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems
proper; and</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NRS Section 78.751 provides that we may make any

brought or threatened by such person unless such action, suit or proceeding has 
been authorized by a majority of the entire Board of Directors.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To file, 
during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective 
amendment to this registration statement:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to include
any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to reflect
in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent
a fundamental change in the information set forth in this registration 
statement; provided that any increase or decrease in volume of securities 
offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that 
which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the 
estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus 
filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in 
the volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum 
aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" 
table in the effective registration statement; and</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to include
any material information with respect to the plan of distribution.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">provided, however, that paragraphs (a) and (b) do not apply 
if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by 
those paragraphs is contained in periodic reports filed  with or furnished to 
the SEC by the registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 14(d) of the 
Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference into this registration 
statement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, for 
the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such 
post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement 
relating to the securities offered herein, and the offering of such securities 
at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To remove 
from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities 
being registered hereby which remain unsold at the termination of the 
offering.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for 
purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of 
the registrant's annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan's 
annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is 
incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a 
new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the 
offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the 
Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons 
of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the 
registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification 
is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, 
unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification against such 
liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or 
paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the 
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such 
director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate 
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public policy 
as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final 
adjudication of such issue.</P>

reinvestment shall be at Fair Market Value on the date of reinvestment. Dividend
Equivalent Rights may be settled in cash or Shares or a combination thereof, in

Administrator.  A Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of another 
Award may provide that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall be settled upon

connection with the preparation of a registration statement on Form S-8 (the 
"<B>Registration Statement</B>") to be filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the "<B>Commission</B>") pursuant to the United States <I>Securities
Act of 1933</I>, as amended (the "<B>Act</B>").</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Registration Statement relates to the registration of 
6,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock (the "<B>Shares</B>") reserved 
for issuance with respect to the exercise of stock options and other awards that
have been granted or may be granted pursuant to and in accordance with the 
Company's 2016 <A NAME="_DV_C1">Stock Incentive Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company previously registered a total of 22,000,000 
shares of common stock on registration statements on Form S-8 (the "<B>Prior 
Registration Statements</B>"), filed with the Commission pursuant to the Act on 
the following dates:</P>
<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>5,500,000 shares of common stock issuable pursuant to 
stock options and other equity incentive awards under the Company's 2006 Stock 
Incentive Plan were registered on a Prior Registration Statement filed on 
November 27, 2007 (Registration No. 333-147626); </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>7,000,000 shares of common stock issuable pursuant to

filed on, respectively, October 1, 2009 and February 7, 2011 (Registration Nos.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>2,000,000 shares of common stock issuable pursuant to 
stock options and other equity incentive awards under the Company's 2013 Stock 
Incentive Plan were registered on a Prior Registration Statement filed on 
November 21, 2013 (Registration No. 333-192462); and </LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's 2006 Stock Incentive Plan and the Company's 
2009 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, were superseded and replaced by the 
Company's 2013 Stock Incentive Plan</A>, and all previously granted awards that 
were outstanding under the 2006 and 2009 Stock Incentive Plans became subject to
the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan.  The Company's 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, in 
turn, was superseded and replaced by the Company's 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, 
and all previously granted awards that were outstanding under the 2013 Stock 
Incentive Plan became subject to the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan.  The Company's 
2014 Stock Incentive Plan, in turn, was superseded and replaced by the Company's
2015 Stock Incentive Plan, and all previously granted awards that were 
outstanding under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan became subject to the 2015 Stock
Incentive Plan.  The Company's 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, in turn, was 
superseded and replaced by the Company's 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, and all 
previously granted awards that were outstanding under the 2015 Stock Incentive 
Plan became subject to the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Prior Registration Statements are incorporated in the 
Registration Statement by reference and made a part thereof.  The Prior 
Registration Statements included reoffer prospectuses which are not being 
incorporated in the Registration Statement; the Registration Statement includes 
a revised reoffer prospectus covering certain shares of common stock registered 
under the Prior Registration Statements and the Shares being registered under 
the Registration Statement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In rendering the opinion set forth below, we have reviewed:

Statement and the exhibits thereto; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Articles and

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certain records 
of the Company's corporate proceedings as reflected in its minute book, 
including resolutions of the board of directors approving the 2016 Stock 
Incentive Plan and various stock options granted pursuant to the 2016 Stock 
Incentive Plan;</P>

Incentive Plan; </P>

documents as we have deemed relevant.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subject to the foregoing and the assumptions, limitations and
qualifications set forth in this letter, it is our opinion that the Shares will 
be validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable common shares in the capital
of the Company when issued and sold pursuant to grants of stock options and 
other awards made pursuant to the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, provided that: 
</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such stock

required exercise price with respect to stock options, or the payment of the 
required purchase price or the performance of the required services with respect

considered, and have not expressed any opinion with regard to, or as to the 
effect of, any other law, rule or regulation, state or federal, applicable to 
the Company.  In particular, we express no opinion as to United States federal 
securities laws;</P>

(i) the genuineness of all signatures on documents examined by us, (ii) the 
legal capacity of the officers of the Company, (iii) the authenticity of all 
documents submitted to us as originals, (iv) the conformity to authentic 
originals of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic 
or other copies, and (v) that the documents, in the forms submitted to us for 
our review, have not been and will not be altered or amended in any respect;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have assumed 
that (i) each stock option or other award granted or to be granted pursuant to 
the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan has been or will be duly authorized by the board
of directors of the Company in accordance with the Articles and Bylaws of the 
Company, the Nevada Statutes and the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, and (ii) each 
agreement governing a stock option or other award under the 2016 Stock Incentive
Plan has been or will be duly executed by each party thereto and constitutes or 
will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the parties thereto,
and that such agreements are or will be enforceable against each of the parties 
thereto in accordance with their respective terms;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have assumed 
that each of the statements made and certified in the Officer's Certificate was 
true and correct when made, has at no time since being made and certified become
untrue or incorrect and remains true and correct on the date hereof;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the opinion 
expressed in this letter is rendered as of the date hereof and is based on our 
understandings and assumptions as to present facts and on the application of the
laws of the State of Nevada as the same exists on the date hereof.  We assume no
obligation to update or supplement this opinion letter after the date hereof 
with respect to any facts or circumstances that may hereafter come to our 
attention or to reflect any changes in the facts or law that may hereafter occur
or take effect;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have assumed 
that at the time the Company is or becomes obligated to issue any Shares upon 
exercise of stock options or other awards granted pursuant to the 2016 Stock 
Incentive Plan, the Company (i) will have adequate authorized and unissued 
Shares to fulfill such obligations, and (ii) will be in good standing with the 
Nevada Secretary of State; and</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have assumed 
the absence of fraud in any transaction pursuant to which Shares have been or 
may be issued pursuant to any option or other award under the 2016 Stock 
Incentive Plan, and that the consideration authorized by the board of directors 
for the Shares will have been received by the Company prior to their 
issuance.</P></DIR>
