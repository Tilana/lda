Notes to Condensed Unaudited Interim Financial Statements
June 30, 2013
Note 1.  Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information.  They do not include all of the information and
footnotes  required  by  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  for  complete  financial
statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered
necessary  for a  fair  presentation, have  been  included in  the  accompanying unaudited  financial  statements.   Operating
results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.  For
further information, refer to the financial statements and notes thereto, included in the Company’s Form 10-K as of and for
the year ended March 31, 2013 (“The Annual Report”).
Effective June 1, 2008, the Company sold all of its oil and gas properties in the Smoky Hill area of Alberta and is currently
reviewing other prospects.  To implement any new business plan, significant financing will be required and the Company
will need to be successful in its efforts to identify, acquire and develop a new business venture.
The  Company  is  currently  in  the  development  stage  as  defined  by  Accounting  Standards  Codification  subtopic  915-10
“Development Stage  Entities” (“ASC  915-10”).  Upon  the sale  of all of  its oil  and gas assets,  the Company  re-entered the
development  stage  effective  June  1,  2008.  Consequently,  its  operations  are  subject  to  all  the  risks  inherent  in  the
establishment of  a new business enterprise.   For the period  from inception through June  30, 2013, the Company  has an
accumulated  (deficit) of  ($6,839,714)  prior to  the  development stage  and accumulated  (deficit)  during the  development
stage of ($1,258,651).
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes.
Note 2.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements
There have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements compared to the recent
accounting pronouncements described in the Annual Report that are of material significance, or have potential material
significance, to the Company.
Note 3.  Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern.  The Company has
incurred  (losses)  from  inception  through  June  1,  2008  of  ($6,839,714)  and  further  (losses)  of  ($1,258,651)  during  the
development stage.  The Company has working capital and  stockholders’ (deficits) of ($1,424,154) at June 30, 2013, and
working capital and stockholders’ (deficits) of ($1,414,502) at March 31, 2013. The Company is reliant on raising capital
to initiate its business plan.  The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon being able to secure
financing and attain profitable operations.
The financial  statements do  not include any  adjustments to  reflect the  possible future effects  on the  recoverability and
classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the
Company to continue as a going concern.
Note 4.  Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period.   Diluted earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing  net income (loss) by the
weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding.
Note 5.  Related Party Transactions
On January  1, 2009  the Company entered  into a  written agreement  revising the previous  verbal agreement  with Caravel
Management Corp (“Caravel”).  The agreement provided for administrative services, office rent and supplies for $8,258 per
month.  On November 1,  2010, the Company revised its written agreement to  provide administrative services, office rent
and supplies for $3,500 per month.  Caravel is wholly owned by the Company’s sole officer and director. Total expenses
recognized under this agreement for the three ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 were $10,500 and $10,500 for each period,
respectively.
On March  31, 2006, we  entered into a  revised loan agreement with  a related party.   The loan  bears interest at  15% per
annum, calculated and compounded monthly and is payable quarterly.  Any principal amount outstanding under the loan
is payable upon demand.  The loan payable is in Canadian dollars and is secured by a Promissory Note.
As of June 30, 2013, the balance of the loan and accrued interest payable was US $1,006,065 compared to US $1,002,700
at March 31, 2013.
  
Note 6.   Subsequent Events
There were no events subsequent to the balance sheet date through the date of this filing that would require disclosure.
ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Forward Looking Statements
This  quarterly  report  contains  forward-looking  statements.  Forward-looking  statements  are  projections  of  events,
revenues, income, future economic performance or management’s plans and objectives for our future operations. In some
cases,  you  can  identify  forward-looking  statements  by  terminology  such  as  "may",  "should",  "expects",  "plans",
"anticipates",  "believes",  "estimates",  "predicts",  "potential"  or  "continue"  or  the  negative  of  these  terms  or  other
comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors, including the risks in the section entitled "Risk Factors" and the risks set out below, any of which may cause
our industry's actual  results, levels of activity, performance  or achievements to be materially different  from any future
results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These
risks include, by way of example and not in limitation:
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
risks and uncertainties relating to the interpretation of drill results, the geology, range and continuity of mineral
deposits;
results  of  initial  feasibility,  pre-feasibility  and  feasibility  studies,  and  the  possibility  that  future  exploration,
development or mining results will not be consistent with our expectations;
mining  and  development  risks,  including  risks  related  to  accidents,  equipment  breakdowns,  labor  disputes  or
other unanticipated difficulties with or interruptions in production;
the potential for delays in exploration or development activities or the completion of feasibility studies;
risks related to the inherent uncertainty of production and cost estimates and the potential for unexpected costs
and expenses;
risks related to commodity price fluctuations;
the uncertainty of profitability based upon our history of losses;
risks related to failure to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis and on acceptable terms for our planned
exploration and development projects;
risks related to environmental regulation and liability;
risks  that  the  amounts  reserved  or  allocated for  environmental  compliance,  reclamation,  post-closure  control
measures, monitoring and on-going maintenance may not be sufficient to cover such costs;
risks related to tax assessments;
political and regulatory risks associated with mining development and exploration;
other risks and uncertainties related to our prospects, properties and business strategy; and
our company is categorized as a “shell company” as that term is used in the Commission’s rules.
This list  is not an  exhaustive list of  the factors  that may affect  any of our  forward-looking statements. These  and other
factors should be considered carefully and readers should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.
Forward looking statements are made based on management’s beliefs, estimates, and opinions on the date the statements
are made and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements if these beliefs, estimates and opinions or
other circumstances should change. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements
are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performances or achievements. Except as required
by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking
statements to conform these statements to actual results.
Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (“US GAAP”).
As used in this quarterly report, the terms "we", "us", "our", and "Nation Energy" mean Nation Energy Inc., unless otherwise
indicated.
In  this  quarterly  report,  unless  otherwise  specified,  all  dollar amounts  are  expressed  in  United  States  dollars  and  all
references to “common shares” refer to the common shares in our capital stock.
Our Current Business
We currently have  no business and operate as  a shell company. We are in  the process of evaluating the  merits of joint
venture opportunities in the resource sector.
Plan of Operation
The following is a discussion and analysis of our plan of operation and the factors that could affect our future financial
condition. This discussion and  analysis should be read in conjunction with our  unaudited financial statements and the
notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report.
For the next twelve months we plan to continue to evaluate joint venture opportunities and oil and gas development and
production opportunities.
Cash Requirements During the Next Twelve Months
Over the next twelve months, we intend to use funds to evaluate new business acquisitions, as follows:
Estimated Funding Required During the Next Twelve Months
General and Administrative
 
Professional Fees
 
Total
$60,000
50,000
$110,000
We have  suffered recurring losses  from operations.   The continuation of  our company as  a going concern  is dependent
upon  our  company  attaining  and  maintaining  profitable  operations  and  raising  additional  capital  as  needed.
Management's  plan  in  this  regard  is  to  raise  additional  capital  through  a  debt  or  an  equity  offering.    The  financial
statements  do not  include any  adjustment relating  to the  recovery and  classification of  recorded asset  amounts or  the
amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should our company discontinue operations.
Due to  the uncertainty  of our ability  to meet  our current operating  expenses noted  above, in their  report on  the annual
financial  statements for  the year  ended  March 31,  2013, our  independent  auditors included  an explanatory  paragraph
regarding concerns about  our ability to continue  as a going concern.   Our financial statements  contain additional note
disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors.
The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing, a successful program of exploration, and,
finally  achieving a  profitable  level  of operations.    The  issuance of  additional  equity  securities by  us  could  result in  a
significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders.  Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans
would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.
There  are  no  assurances  that  we  will  be  able  to  obtain  further  funds  required  for  our  continued  operations.    We  are
pursuing  various financing  alternatives to  meet our  immediate  and long-term  financial requirements.   There  can be  no
assurance  that  additional  financing  will  be  available  to  us  when  needed  or,  if  available,  that  it  can  be  obtained  on
commercially reasonable terms.  If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable
to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due.  In such
event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.
Disclosure of Outstanding Share Data
As at  the date of this  quarterly report, we  had 16,020,000 shares of  common stock issued  and outstanding.  We  do not
have any warrants, options or shares of any other class issued and outstanding as of the date of this annual report.

We generated a net (loss) of $(44,499) for the three months ended June 20, 2013 compared to a net (loss) of $(47,967) for
the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2012.    Net  (loss)  per  common  share  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2013  was
($0.005) compared to ($0.003) per common share for the three months ended June 30, 2012.  General and administrative
expenses decreased to $6,329 during the three months ended June 30, 2013 from $14,093 during the three months ended
June 30, 2012.   The decrease was primarily due to the higher amount of legal fees during 2012.
Interest  expense for  the three  months ended  June 30,  2013  totalled $38,170  compared to  $33,874 for  the three  months
ended June 30, 2012.  The increase was primarily due to the foreign exchange revaluation for the three months ended June
30, 2013.
We reported a foreign currency translation loss of $34,848 to June 30, 2013 compared to a gain of $68 to June 30, 2012.
 Our loan and accrued interest were incurred and are calculated in Canadian dollars while the reporting currency is the
US  dollar.   The  value  of  the Canadian  dollar  in  the first  quarter  of  fiscal 2014  was  C$0.9508  to US$1.00  compared  to
C$0.9822 to US$1.00 in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.
The major components of our general and administrative expenses for the year are outlined in the table below:

General and administrative expenses decreased to $6,329 in fiscal 2014 from $14,093 in fiscal 2013.  General expenses
included  administration  fees  which  remained  the  same  as  the  comparative  period.    Office  expenses  and  Management
Information System fees increased to $681 in fiscal 2014 from $455. Legal fees decreased to $(4,872) in fiscal 2014 from
$118 in the prior fiscal year mainly due to an over accrual of legal fees in fiscal 2013.  Filing fees and transfer agent fees
remained the same  in fiscal 2014 compared  to fiscal 2013 at  $20.  Accounting fees  decreased to $0 from  $3,000 in the
comparative period in fiscal 2013 due to over accrual of accounting fees in fiscal 2013.

Net cash  (used in)  operating activities  was $(34,953) in  the three  months ended June  30, 2013  compared with  net cash
used in operating activities of $(25,187) in the same period in 2012.  The increase in cash (used in) operating activities of
$9,766 is mainly attributed to both a decrease in the net (loss) for the current year and a decrease in accounts payable to
a related party compared to the same period in 2012.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities amounted to $Nil for both years.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $Nil in the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to net cash provided
by financing activities of $24,905 in the three months ended June 30, 2012.  All activities derive from a loan from a related
party.
Loans Payable
On March  31, 2006, we  entered into a  revised loan agreement with  a related party.   The loan  bears interest at  15% per
annum, calculated and compounded monthly and payable quarterly.  Any principal amount outstanding under the loan is
payable upon demand.  The loan  payable is in Canadian dollars and is secured by a Promissory  Note.  As at March 31,
2013  the  loan,  together  with  accrued  interest  totalled US$1,002,700.  Together,  with  accrued  interest,  the  loan  balance
totaled US$1,006,065 at June 30, 2013.
Going Concern
The unaudited financial statements accompanying this report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies
that our company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of
business.    Our  company  has  incurred  losses  since  inception  in  excess  of  $8  million  and  has  only  generated  modest
profitable operations when we commenced gas production in fiscal 2006.  We have relied solely on shareholder advances
to participate and continue operations.
Our  company’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  is  contingent  upon  being  able  to  secure  financing  and  attain
profitable  operations.    Our  company  is  currently  evaluating  business  opportunities  and  will  require  financing  for
acquisition of any new business venture.
Net  cash  (used  in)  operating  activities  in  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2014  totalled  $(34,953)  versus  net  cash  used  in
operating activities of $(25,187) in fiscal 2013.  Cash balances were $1,461 and $10,580 as of June 30, 2013 and June 30,
2012, respectively.
We  entered  into loan  agreements  with  a related  party,  in  2003 and  2004  to  fund operations.    The  terms of  these  loan
agreements  provided  that  any  principal  amount  outstanding  is  payable  upon  demand  and  bears  interest  at  15%  per
annum, payable quarterly. On March 31, 2006, we consolidated and restructured our loans with the related party.  As part
of  the restructuring,  we borrowed  an additional  CDN  $250,000 (US  $203,932).   The  new loan  bears interest  at 15%  per
annum, calculated and compounded monthly and is payable quarterly. Any principal amount outstanding under the loan
is payable upon demand.  The loan is payable in Canadian dollars and is secured by a Promissory Note.
As at  March 31,  2013 the  loan, together  with accrued  interest totaled  US$1,002,700. Together  with accrued  interest the
loan balance totalled US$1,006,065 at June 30, 2013.
We have limited operating history.  We can only estimate the future needs for capital based on the current status of our
operations, our current plans and current economic condition.  Due to the uncertainties regarding our future activities, we
are unable to predict precisely what amount will be used for any particular purpose.
Future Financings
As of June 30, 2013, we had cash of $1,461.  We currently do not have sufficient funds to acquire and develop any future
joint ventures.   We anticipate  continuing to rely  on shareholder  loans or equity  sales of our  common stock in  order to
fund our business operations.   Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders.  There is
no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity or arrange for more debt or other financing to fund
any future activities.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Not Applicable.
ITEM 4 . CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our principal executive officer and financial officer
evaluated our company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as define in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and
financial  officer  concluded  that  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report,  these  disclosure  controls  and
procedures were not effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by our company in reports it files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities Exchange Commission and to ensure that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our company’s management, including our principal executive officer and financial
officer,  to  allow  timely  decisions  regarding  required  disclosure.  The  conclusion  that  our  disclosure  controls  and
procedures  were  not effective  was  due  to the  presence  of  the following  material  weaknesses  in internal  control  over
financial reporting which are indicative of many small companies with small staff:
1.
2.
Lack of a sufficient number of independent directors for our board and audit committee. We currently have no
independent  director on  our board,  which is  comprised of  one director.  As a  publicly-traded company,  we
strive to have a majority of our board of directors be independent;
Insufficient segregation  of duties in  our finance  and accounting functions  due to limited  personnel. During
the three months ended June 30, 2013, we had limited staff that performed nearly all aspects of our financial
reporting process, including, but not limited to, access to the underlying accounting records and systems, the
ability to post and  record journal entries and responsibility for the preparation  of the financial statement.
This creates certain incompatible duties and lack of review over the financial reporting process that would
likely result in a  failure to detect errors in spreadsheets, calculations, or  assumptions used to compile the
financial statements and related disclosures as filed with the SEC. These control deficiencies could result in a
material misstatement of our interim or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected;
and
3.
Insufficient  corporate  governance  policies.  Although  we  have  a  code  of  ethics  which  provides  broad
guidelines  for  corporate  governance,  our  corporate  governance  activities  and  processes  are  not  always
formally documented. Specifically, decisions made by the board to be carried out by management should be
documented  and  communicated  on  a  timely  basis  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of  any  misunderstandings
regarding key decisions affecting our operations and management.
We  intend  to  take  appropriate  and  reasonable  steps  to  make  the  necessary  improvements  to  remediate  these
deficiencies.  We intend  to consider  the  results of  our  remediation efforts  and related  testing  as part  of our  year-end
2013  assessment of  the effectiveness  of our  internal control  over financial  reporting. Subject  to receipt  of additional
financing, we intend to undertake the below remediation measures to address the material weaknesses described in this
annual report. Such remediation activities include the following:
1.
2.
We plan to recruit at  least one, preferably two or more, additional independent  board members to join our
board of directors and audit committee at such time as additional board members are retained; and
We  intend  to  continue  to  update  the  documentation  of  our  corporate  governance  and  internal  control
processes, including formal risk assessment of our financial reporting processes.
It  should be  noted  that a  control  system, no  matter  how  well conceived  or  operated, can  provide  only reasonable,  not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
of  the  inherent  limitations  in  all  control  systems,  no  evaluation  of  controls  can  provide  absolute  assurance  that  all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
people,  or by  management override  of the  controls. The  design  of any  system of  internal control  is based  in part  upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
achieving its  stated goals  under all  potential future  conditions. Over time  controls may  become inadequate  because of
changes  in  conditions,  or  the  degree  of  compliance  with  the  policies  or  procedures  may  deteriorate.  Because  of  the
inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three month period ended June 30, 2013
that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
