AMENDED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
The following amended Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD & A"), dated as
of August 11, 2005, provides a detailed explanation of the financial and
operating results of Advantage Energy Income Fund ("Advantage", the "Trust" or
the "Fund") for the year ended December 31, 2004 and should be read in
conjunction with the audited amended consolidated financial statements. All per
barrel of oil equivalent ("boe") amounts are stated at 6:1 conversion rate for
natural gas to oil.
CASH DISTRIBUTIONS
Total cash distributions to Unitholders for the year ended December 31, 2004
amounted to $117.7 million or $2.82 per Unit. This represents a 41% increase
over 2003 cash distributions which amounted to $83.4 million or $2.71 per Unit.
Cash distributions in the fourth quarter of 2004 amounted to $35.2 million or
$0.75 per Unit. Since inception, the Fund has distributed $270.0 million or
$8.71 per Unit. Cash distributions are dependent on the Fund's current level of
production and prevailing commodity prices and are announced monthly based on
cash flow available after retaining a portion for capital expenditures and debt
repayment.

For U.S. holders of Advantage Units the distributions paid in 2004 were 57.17%
non-taxable return of capital and 42.83% taxable. Unitholders should consult
their tax advisors as to the proper treatment of Advantage distributions for
income tax purposes.
PRODUCTION
Natural gas production for the year ended December 31, 2004 averaged 77.2
mmcf/d, an increase of 34% over the 57.6 mmcf/d produced in 2003. The growth in
gas production over 2003 was the result of the acquisition of MarkWest Resources
on December 2, 2003 and the acquisition of the Anadarko assets on September 15,
2004. In addition, successful drilling during the year at Medicine Hat, Bantry
and Shouldice areas of Alberta assisted the Fund in replacing natural production
declines that occurred over the year. Natural gas production during the fourth
quarter of 2004 averaged 84.3 mmcf/d. On December 21, 2004 Advantage closed the
acquisition of Defiant Energy Corporation ("Defiant") which will further
increase production volumes for 2005. Advantage exited 2004 producing
approximately 93 mmcf/d of natural gas. Crude oil and NGLs production in 2004
averaged 4,084 bbls/d compared with 2,756 bbls/d produced in 2003. The 48%
increase in oil and NGLs production in 2004 was the result of the acquisition of
MarkWest Resources on December 2, 2003 and the acquisition of the Anadarko
assets which was effective September 15, 2004. In addition, production volumes
increased as a result of the ongoing success of the Fund's drilling program at
Nevis, Alberta. Crude oil and NGL production average 6,815 bbls/d in the fourth
quarter of 2004. This increased production reflects a full quarter of production
related to the Anadarko assets acquired. Including the acquisition of Defiant on
December 21, 2004 the Fund's 2004 crude oil and NGL's exit production
approximated 7,500 bbls/d.

COMMODITY PRICES & MARKETING
NATURAL GAS
Natural gas prices for the year ended December 31, 2004 averaged $6.43/mcf
($6.08/mcf including hedging), compared to $6.30/mcf ($6.07/mcf including
hedging) in the year ended December 31, 2003. Advantage's natural gas hedging
program resulted in losses of $9.7 million in 2004 or $0.35/mcf compared to $4.8
million of losses or $0.23/mcf in 2003. During the fourth quarter Advantage's
natural gas prices averaged $6.64/mcf ($6.09/mcf including hedging) and included
$4.3 million of hedging losses. Natural gas prices remained strong throughout
2004 and have traded in a $5.00 to $7.50 per mcf range since the spring of 2003.
Recent weakness in natural gas prices is due to reduced heating demand resulting
from the extremely mild 2004/2005 winter, causing North American storage levels
to be higher than normal. Advantage continues to believe that the long term
pricing fundamentals for natural gas remain strong. These fundamentals include
(i) the continued strength of crude oil prices which has eliminated the economic
advantage of fuel switching away from natural gas, (ii) continued tightness in
supply that has resulted from increased demand and the decline in North American
natural gas production levels and (iii) ongoing weather related factors such as
hot summers, cold winters and annual hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico all
of which have an impact on the delicate supply/demand balance that exists. The
price the Fund receives for natural gas is primarily based on the AECO benchmark
price with approximately 23% of production sold to aggregators and the remainder
sold on the spot market. Advantage's 2004 exit production is weighted
approximately 65% towards natural gas.

CRUDE OIL
Crude oil and NGLs prices averaged $46.58/bbl in 2004 compared with $38.58/bbl
($38.14/bbl including hedging) in 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2004 crude oil
and NGLs prices averaged $47.05/bbl. During 2004 the Fund had no crude oil
hedges in place. Advantage's crude oil prices are based on the benchmark pricing
of West Texas Intermediate Crude ("WTI") adjusted for quality, transportation
costs and Canadian/US exchange rate. The price of WTI fluctuates based on
worldwide supply and demand fundamentals. Crude oil prices continue to be
strong. Factors that affect the continued strength of crude oil prices include
(i) supply management by the OPEC cartel, (ii) ongoing civil unrest in the
Middle East, Venezuela and Nigeria and (iii) increased world wide demand
particularly in China and India. The price of WTI averaged $US41.43/bbl in 2004
compared to $US31.06/bbl in 2003. Partially offsetting the strength of WTI oil
prices in 2004 was the strength of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S.
dollar. Despite the 33% increase in U.S. denominated WTI crude oil the Fund's
realized price only increased by 21% from the previous year due to the Canadian
dollar's strength in 2004.

At December 31, 2004, the mark-to-market valuation of Advantage's outstanding
hedges was a loss of $0.2 million. This amount has been included in the income
statement as an unrealized hedging loss with a corresponding hedging liability
recorded on the balance sheet. Advantage had no crude oil hedges in place during
2004. The Fund will continue to monitor commodity markets with a view to provide
cash flow stability.
ROYALTIES
Total royalties amounted to $47.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004
or 19.0% of pre-hedged revenue compared with $28.5 million or 16.6% of
pre-hedged revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003. Total royalties in the
fourth quarter of 2004 amounted to $15.6 million or 19.2% of pre-hedged revenue.
Total royalties are significantly higher in 2004 as a result of higher revenues.
The increase in Advantage's royalty rate in 2004 is the result of the
acquisition of MarkWest Resources properties in December 2003 which attract
higher royalty rates than other Advantage properties. In addition, the
properties acquired from Anadarko in September 2004 have higher royalty rates
than the Advantage properties.

OPERATING COSTS
Operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2004 amounted to $38.8 million

December 31, 2003. Operating costs in the fourth quarter of 2004 amounted to
$13.1 million or $6.81/boe. The increase in operating cost amounts reflects the
37% increase in boe production in 2004. Higher per boe operating costs in 2004
are due to the higher costs associated with the properties acquired from
Anadarko in September 2004. In addition, operating costs have steadily increased
over the past two years due to higher power costs and higher field costs
associated with the shortage of supplies, services and materials that has
resulted from the high level of industry activity.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND MANAGEMENT FEES
General and administrative ("G&A") expense for the year ended December 31, 2004
amounted to $3.9 million or $0.62/boe compared with $3.2 million or $0.71/boe
for the year ended December 31, 2003. G&A expense was higher in 2004 due to
increased staff levels that resulted from the growth of the Fund. G&A expense in
the fourth quarter of 2004 amounted to $1.3 million or $0.69/boe. Management
fees for the year ended December 31, 2004 amounted to $2.3 million compared to
$1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. On a boe basis, management
fees were $0.37/boe compared to $0.37/boe in 2003. Fourth quarter 2004
management fees amounted $0.7 million or $0.38/boe. Management fees are
calculated based on 1.5% of operating cash flow, which is defined as revenues
less royalties and operating expenses. The Fund Manager is entitled to earn a
performance fee to the extent that the total annual return of the Fund exceeds
8%. The total annual return is calculated at the end of each year by dividing
the year over year change in Unit price plus cash distributions by the opening
Unit price. One tenth (10%) of the amount of the total annual return in excess
of 8% is multiplied by the market capitalization (defined as the opening Unit
price times the weighted average number of Trust Units outstanding during the
year) to determine the performance fee. For the year ending December 31, 2004
the total return of the Fund was 38% (57% return in 2003) based on an opening
unit price of $17.83 per unit ($13.07 per unit in 2003), a closing unit price of
$21.71 per unit ($17.83 per unit in 2003) and cash distributions of $2.82 per
unit for the year ($2.71 per unit in 2003). This 38% return for Unitholders
resulted in a performance fee of $21.6 million in 2004 ($19.6 million in 2003).
On January 19, 2004 the Fund issued 763,371 Advantage Trust Units plus $5.1
million to Advantage Investment Management Ltd. and the employees of the Fund to
satisfy the performance fee obligation. The cash component of the fee payment
was used by the Fund Manager to pay income taxes. The Manager does not receive
any form of compensation in respect of acquisition or divestiture fees nor is
there any form of stock option plan for the Manager or the employees of
Advantage.

INTEREST
Interest expense on bank debt for the year ended December 31, 2004 amounted to
$6.4 million comparable to the $6.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2003. Average debt levels were higher in 2004 but were offset by lower interest
rates. The Fund's interest rates are primarily based on short term Bankers
Acceptance rates plus a stamping fee. The average rate of interest on
Advantage's bank debt at December 31, 2004 was approximately 4.0%.
INTEREST AND ACCRETION ON CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES
Interest on convertible debentures for the year ended December 31, 2004 amounted
to $8.7 million or $1.40/boe compared with $4.7 million or $1.04/boe for the
year ended December 31, 2003. Accretion on convertible debentures for the year
ended December 31, 2004 amounted to $1.7 million or $0.28/boe compared with $0.8
million or $0.18/boe for the year ended December 31, 2003. Interest and
accretion expense increased primarily due to the issuance of convertible
debentures including $30 million 9% in July 2003, $60 million 8.25% in December
2003, and $50 million 7.75% and $75 million 7.5% in September 2004. The
increased interest and accretion from the additional debentures is partially
offset by a general reduction of the other outstanding debenture balances
resulting from holders exercising the conversion option. Interest and accretion
will continue to decrease in the future as debentures are continually converted
to Trust Units.

DEPLETION, DEPRECIATION AND SITE RESTORATION
Depletion and depreciation of property and equipment is provided on the unit of
production method based on total proved reserves. The depletion, depreciation
and accretion ("D,D&A") provision for 2004 increased to $99.3 million from $54.0
million in 2003. The increased provision in 2004 is the result of higher
production volumes and a higher per boe rate. The DD&A rate for the year ended
December 31, 2004 was $16.00/boe compared with $11.97/boe in 2003. Included in
D,D&A in 2004 is $0.9 million of accretion expense related to the asset
retirement obligations. The retroactive application of the new accounting policy
for asset retirement obligations requires restatement of periods, which resulted
in the 2003 D,D&A expense to increase by $0.2 million compared to the previously
reported expense.
TAXES
Current taxes paid or payable for the period ending December 31, 2004 primarily
represent capital tax and amounted to $2.0 million, compared to $1.3 million
expensed in 2003. Capital taxes are based on debt and equity levels of the Trust
at the end of the year and are higher in 2004 due to Advantage's growth during
the year. As a result of new legislation in 2003, capital taxes are to be
gradually eliminated over the next four years. Future income taxes arise from
differences between the accounting and tax bases of the operating company's
assets and liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2004 the Fund recognized
an income tax recovery of $16.4 million compared to an $18.2 million recovery in
2003. In the first quarter of 2004 the Alberta Government enacted a tax rate
reduction of 1%, reducing the tax rate from 12.5% to 11.5% effective April 1,
2004. This resulted in an additional tax recovery during the first quarter of
approximately $2.2 million.
In the Fund's structure, payments are made between the operating company and the
Trust transferring both income and future income tax liability to the
Unitholders. Therefore, it is expected, based on current legislation that no
cash income taxes are to be paid by the operating company in the future, and as
such, the future income tax liability recorded on the balance sheet will be
recovered through earnings over time. As at December 31, 2004 the operating
company had a future income tax liability balance of $112.3 million. Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles require that a future income tax
liability be recorded when the book value of assets exceeds the balance of tax
pools. It further requires that a future tax liability be recorded on an
acquisition when a corporation acquires assets with associated tax pools that
are less than the purchase price. As a result of the Defiant acquisition,
Advantage recorded a future tax liability of $51.5 million.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
Capital expenditures including acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2004
totalled $482.3 million net of property dispositions of $6.5 million compared to
$168.6 million net of property dispositions of $6.1 million in 2003.
Expenditures on property and equipment in 2004 amounted to $107.9 million. The
majority of the capital expenditures were incurred on natural gas development
drilling, completions and tie-ins at the Fund's Nevis, Medicine Hat, Bantry and
Shouldice properties.

ANADARKO PROPERTY ACQUISITION
On September 15, 2004 Advantage closed the acquisition of petroleum and natural
gas properties located in central Alberta, southern Alberta and southeast
Saskatchewan from Anadarko Canada Corporation for net consideration after
adjustments of approximately $179.1 million. The acquisition was financed
through the issuance of 3.5 million Advantage Trust Units at $18.80 per Unit,
$75 million of 5 year 7.50% and $50 million of 7 year 7.75% subordinated
convertible debentures. The 7.5% debentures are convertible into Advantage Trust
Units at $20.25 per Unit and the 7.75% debentures are convertible into Advantage
Units at $21.00 per Unit. Total net proceeds of the offering amounted to $181.8
million.
DEFIANT ENERGY CORPORATION
On December 21, 2004 Advantage acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares
of Defiant for consideration of $144.2 million. The acquisition was financed
through the issuance of 3,666,286 Advantage Trust Units, the issuance of
1,450,030 Exchangeable Shares and cash consideration of $34 million (see note
3(i) to the consolidated financial statements).
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITTMENTS
The Trust has contractual obligations in the normal course of operations
including purchases of assets and services, operating agreements, transportation
commitments and sales contracts. These obligations are of a recurring and

* CAPITAL LEASES OF $7.3 MILLION THAT WERE ASSUMED BY ADVANTAGE ON THE
ACQUISITION OF DEFIANT IN DECEMBER 2004 WERE FULLY REPAID IN 2005.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
On September 14, 2004 Advantage issued 3,500,000 Advantage Trust Units at $18.80
per Unit, $75 million of 5 year 7.5% and $50 million of 7 year 7.75%
subordinated convertible debentures. The 7.5% debentures are convertible into
Advantage Trust Units at $20.25 per Unit and the 7.75% debentures are
convertible into Advantage Units at $21.00 per Unit. Total net proceeds of the
offering amounted to $181.8 million and was used to finance the acquisition of
the Anadarko properties. On December 21, 2004 Advantage issued 3,666,286
Advantage Trust Units and 1,450,030 Exchangeable Shares to Defiant shareholders
as partial consideration related to the acquisition of Defiant. Each
Exchangeable Share issued by Advantage Oil & Gas Ltd. is exchangeable for
Advantage Trust Units at any time on the basis of the applicable exchange ratio
in effect at that time. The remainder of the consideration of $34 million was
paid to Defiant shareholders in cash. As at December 31, 2004 the Fund had 49.7
million Trust Units outstanding. On January 19, 2005 Advantage issued 763,371
Trust Units to partially satisfy the obligation related to the 2004 year end
performance fee. On February 9, 2005 the fund issued 5,250,000 Advantage Trust
Units at $21.65 per Unit. Total net proceeds of $107.6 million will be used to
pay down debt incurred on the December 2004 acquisition of Defiant, to fund the
2005 capital expenditure program and to pay down bank debt. As at August 11,
2005, Advantage has 57.4 million Trust Units and 0.1 million Exchangeable Shares
issued and outstanding. The exchange ratio of the Exchangeable Shares adjusts
each month on the distribution payment date and the number of Trust Units
ultimately issuable will increase over time. The Exchangeable Shares are
currently exchangeable for the issuance of 0.1 million Trust Units. The Trust
also had $143.7 million convertible debentures outstanding at August 11, 2005
that can be immediately converted to 7.3 million Trust Units.
At December 31, 2004 Advantage had bank debt outstanding of $267.1 million.
Advantage has an agreement with a syndicate of four Canadian chartered banks
that provides for a $335 million facility consisting of a $325 million
extendible revolving loan facility and a $10 million operating loan facility
both of which mature in May 2006. The credit facilities are secured by a $500
million floating charge demand debenture, a general security agreement and a
subordination agreement from the Trust covering all assets and cash flows. At
December 31, 2004 Advantage also had a working capital deficiency of $56.4
million. The following table outlines Advantage's sources and uses of funds

The table above highlights the Trust's performance for the fourth quarter of
2004 and also for the preceding seven quarters through 2003. Net revenues are
primarily impacted by commodity prices, production volumes and royalties.
RISK FACTORS
The following is a summary of certain risk factors relating to the business of
the Trust.
EXPLOITATION AND DEVELOPMENT
Exploitation and development risks are due to the uncertain results of searching
for and producing oil and natural gas using imperfect scientific methods. These
risks are mitigated by using highly skilled staff, focusing exploitation efforts
in areas in which Advantage has existing knowledge and expertise or access to
such expertise, using up to date technology to enhance methods, and controlling
costs to maximize returns. Advanced oil and natural gas related technologies
such as three-dimensional seismography, reservoir simulation studies and
horizontal drilling have been used by Advantage and will be used by Advantage to
improve its ability to find, develop and produce oil and natural gas.
OPERATIONS
Advantage's operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the
operation and development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of
oil and natural gas wells, including encountering unexpected formations or
pressures, blowouts, craterings and fires, all of which could result in personal
injuries, loss of life and damage to the property of the Fund and others.
Advantage has both safety and environmental policies in place to protect its
operators and employees, as well as to meet the regulatory requirements in those
areas where it operates. In addition, the Fund has liability insurance policies
in place, in such amounts as it considers adequate, however, it will not be
fully insured against all of these risks, nor are all such risks insurable.
Continuing production from non-operated properties, and, to some extent the
marketing of production therefrom, are largely dependent upon the ability of the
operator of the property. To the extent the operator fails to perform these
functions properly, revenue may be reduced. Payments from production generally
flow through the operator and there is a risk of delay and additional expense in
receiving such revenues if the operator becomes insolvent. Although satisfactory
title reviews are generally conducted in accordance with industry standards,
such reviews do not guarantee or certify that a defect in the chain of title may
not arise to defeat the claim of Advantage to certain properties. A reduction of
cash flow could result in such circumstances. Advantage mitigates this risk by
operating a high percentage of its properties.
OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES
The price of oil and natural gas will fluctuate and price and demand are factors
beyond Advantage's control. Such fluctuations will have a positive or negative
effect on the revenue to be received by it. Such fluctuations will also have an
effect on the acquisition costs of any future oil and natural gas properties
that Advantage may acquire. As well, cash distributions from the Trust will be
highly sensitive to the prevailing price of crude oil and natural gas. The Trust
mitigates risk through closely monitoring the various commodity markets and
establishing hedging programs as deemed necessary.
MARKETING
The marketability and price of oil and natural gas that may be acquired or
discovered by Advantage will be affected by numerous factors beyond its control.
These factors include demand for oil and natural gas, market fluctuations, the
proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and processing equipment
and government regulations, including regulations relating to environmental
protection, royalties, allowable production, pricing, importing and exporting of
oil and natural gas. Advantage mitigates this risk by maintaining a portfolio of
assets that are geographically diversified.
CAPITAL INVESTMENT
The timing and amount of capital expenditures will directly affect the amount of
income for distribution to Trust Unitholders. Distributions may be reduced, or
even eliminated, at times when significant capital or other expenditures are
made.
DEBT SERVICE
Advantage has credit facilities in the amount of $335 million. Variations in
interest rates and scheduled principal repayments could result in significant
changes in the amount required to be applied to debt service before payment of
any amounts to Unitholders. Although it is believed that the bank line of credit
is sufficient, there can be no assurance that the amount will be adequate for
the financial obligations of Advantage or that additional funds can be obtained.
The lenders have been provided with security over substantially all of the
assets of Advantage. If Advantage becomes unable to pay its debt service charges
or otherwise commits an event of default such as bankruptcy, the lenders may
foreclose on or sell the properties of the Fund.
RESERVES
Although Sproule Associates Limited and the Trust have carefully prepared the
reserve figures included herein and believe that the methods of estimating
reserves have been verified by operating experience, such figures are estimates
and no assurance can be given that the indicated levels of reserves will be
produced. Probable reserves estimated for properties may require revision based
on the actual development strategies employed to prove such reserves. Declines
in the reserves of Advantage which are not offset by the acquisition or
development of additional reserves may reduce the underlying value of Trust
Units to Trust Unitholders. Trust Units will have no value once all of the oil
and natural gas reserves of Advantage have been produced. As a result, holders
of Trust Units will have to obtain the return of capital invested out of cash
flow derived from their investment in such Trust Units.
<PAGE>
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
The oil and natural gas industry is subject to environmental regulation pursuant
to local, provincial and federal legislation. A breach of such legislation may
result in the imposition of fines or issuance of clean-up orders in respect of
Advantage or the properties. Such legislation may be changed to impose higher
standards and potentially more costly obligations on Advantage. There can be no
assurance that the Trust will be able to satisfy its actual future environmental
and reclamation obligations.
DEPLETION OF RESERVES
The Trust has certain unique attributes that differentiate it from other oil and
gas industry participants. Distributions of cash flow in respect of the oil and
gas properties, absent commodity price increases or cost effective acquisition
and development activities will decline over time in a manner consistent with
declining production from typical oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids
reserves. Advantage will not be reinvesting cash flow in the same manner as
other industry participants. Accordingly, absent capital injections, Advantage's
initial production levels and reserves will decline. Advantage's future oil and
natural gas reserves and production, and therefore its cash flows, will be
highly dependent on Advantage's success in exploiting its reserve base and
acquiring additional reserves. Without reserve additions through acquisition or
development activities, Advantage's reserves and production will decline over
time as reserves are exploited. To the extent that external sources of capital,
including the issuance of additional Trust Units, become limited or unavailable,
Advantage's ability to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or
expand its oil and natural gas reserves will be impaired. To the extent that
Advantage is required to use cash flow to finance capital expenditures or
property acquisitions, the level of cash available for distribution will be
reduced. There can be no assurance that Advantage will be successful in
developing or acquiring additional reserves on terms that meet the Trust's
investment objectives.
REGULATORY MATTERS
The Corporation's operations are subject to a variety of federal and provincial
laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection
of the environment.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Advantage Investment Management Ltd. has been retained by the Trustee of the
Fund and by Advantage Oil & Gas ("AOG") to provide advisory and management
services to the Fund and to AOG. The Board of Directors' mandate is to supervise
the management of the business and affairs of the Fund including the business
and affairs of the Fund delegated to AOG. In particular, all decisions relating
to: (i) the acquisition and disposition of properties for a purchase price or
proceeds in excess of $2 million; (ii) the approval of annual operating and
capital expenditure budgets; and (iii) the establishment of credit facilities,
will be made by the Board.
Computershare Trust Company of Canada, the Trustee of the Fund, has delegated
certain matters to the Board of Directors. These include all decisions relating
to issuance of additional Trust Units and the determination of the amount of
distributions. Any amendment to any material contract to which the Fund is a
party will require the approval of the Board of Directors and, in some cases,
Unitholder approval. The Board of Directors meets regularly to review the
business and affairs of the Fund and AOG and to make any required decisions. The
Board of Directors consists of eight members, six of whom are unrelated to the
Fund. The Audit Committee and the Independent Reserve Evaluation Committee each
have three members, all of whom are independent. The Human Resources,
Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee has four members, all of whom
are independent. In addition, the Chairman of the Board is not related and is
not an executive officer of the Fund. A further discussion of the Fund's
corporate governance practices can be found in the Management Proxy Circular.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires
management to make certain judgments and estimates. Changes in these judgments
and estimates could have a material impact on the Trust's financial results and
financial condition. The process of estimating reserves is critical to several
accounting estimates. The process of estimating reserves is complex and requires
significant judgments and decisions based on available geological, geophysical,
engineering and economic data. These estimates may change substantially as
additional data from ongoing development and production activities becomes
available, and as economic conditions impact oil and natural gas prices,
operating costs, and royalty burdens change. Reserve estimates impact net income
through depletion, the provision for site reclamation and abandonment and in the
application of the ceiling test, whereby the value of the oil and natural gas
assets are subjected to an impairment test. The reserve estimates are also used
to assess the borrowing base for the Trust's credit facilities. Revision or
changes in the reserve estimates can have either a positive or a negative impact
on net income or the borrowing base of the Trust.
FINANCIAL REPORTING AND REGULATORY UPDATE
During 2004 there were a number of changes to financial reporting and regulatory
requirements. The changes that will impact Advantage are noted below.
FULL COST ACCOUNTING GUIDELINE
In September 2003 the CICA issued Accounting Guideline 16, "Oil and Gas
Accounting - Full Cost" which is effective for fiscal years beginning on or
after January 1, 2004. The new Guideline limits the carrying value of oil and
natural gas properties to their fair value. The fair value is equal to estimated
future cash flows from proved plus probable reserves using future price
forecasts and costs discounted at a risk-free rate. This differs from the
current cost recovery ceiling test that uses undiscounted cash flows and
constant prices and costs less general and administrative and financing costs.
There is no write-down of the Fund's oil and gas assets at December 31, 2004.
ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
In March 2003 the CICA issued handbook section 3110 "Asset Retirement
Obligations" which requires liability recognition for retirement obligations
associated with the Fund's property and equipment. The obligations are initially
measured at fair value, which is the discounted future value of the liability.
The fair value is capitalized as part of the cost of the related assets and
depleted to earnings over the assets useful life. The liability accretes until
the retirement obligations are settled. Advantage adopted the new standard in
the first quarter of 2004.
HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS
Effective for the Fund's 2004 fiscal year, the new CICA Accounting Guideline 13
"Hedging Relationships" requires that hedging relationship be identified,
designated, documented and measured in order for the Fund to apply hedge
accounting. All of the hedges Advantage enters into are effective economic
hedges and Advantage has elected to use the fair value method of accounting for
all derivative transactions as the Fund believes this method provides better
information to readers of the Fund's financial statements. Effective the first
quarter of 2004 Advantage recorded the fair value of the derivative financial
instruments at each balance sheet date. The change in fair value from period to
period has been recorded in the income statement on a separate line as
unrealized gains/losses.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
In September 2003 the CICA issued an amendment to section 3870 "Stock Based
compensation and other stock based payments". The amended section is effective
for years beginning on or after January 1, 2004 and requires that companies
measure all stock based payments using the fair value method of accounting and
recognize the compensation expense in their financial statements. The Trust
implemented this standard prospectively commencing in 2004.
CONTINUOUS DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS
Commencing in the first quarter of 2004 Advantage was subject to new disclosure
requirements as per National Instrument 51-102 "Continuous Disclosure
Obligations". This new instrument requires shorter reporting periods for filing
annual and interim financial statements, MD&A and Annual Information Form (AIF).
The Instrument also proposes enhanced disclosure in the annual and interim
financial statements, MD&A and AIF.
<PAGE>
EXCHANGEABLE SHARES
In March 2005, the CICA's Emerging Issues Committee amended EIC-151
"Exchangeable Securities Issued by Subsidiaries of Income Trusts". The EIC
specifies the required criteria to present exchangeable shares as a component of
Unitholders' equity. Exchangeable shares that do not meet both criteria are
classified as either debt or non-controlling interest depending on the nature of
the instrument. Prior to the amendment, Exchangeable Shares of AOG were shown as
a component of Unitholders' equity. However, the Exchangeable Shares do not meet
the requirements of the amended standard given that the shares are transferable,
although not publicly traded. Therefore, Exchangeable Shares are now classified
as non-controlling interest, outside of Unitholders' equity. The Exchangeable
Shares and Trust Units are considered economically equivalent since the exchange
ratio is increased on each date that a distribution is paid on the Trust Units
and all shares must be exchanged for either Trust Units or cash, based on the
current market price of the Trust Units. Since the Exchangeable Shares are
required to be exchanged, there is no permanent non-controlling interest. As a
consequence of presenting Exchangeable Shares as non-controlling interest, a
corresponding expense is recorded that reflects the earnings attributable to the
non-controlling interest. When Exchangeable Shares are converted to Trust Units,
the carrying value of non-controlling interest on the balance sheet is
reclassified to Unitholders' capital. The Fund retroactively implemented the
revised standard but there was no income impact on periods prior to 2005 given
that the Exchangeable Shares were issued at the end of 2004.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Fund retroactively adopted the revised accounting standard Section 3860
"Financial Instruments - Presentation and Disclosure" as issued by the Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants ("CICA") effective January 1, 2005. The
revised standard applies to financial instruments that may be settled at the
issuer's option in cash or its own equity instruments and impacts the Fund's
prior accounting for convertible debentures and the performance incentive fee.
The Fund previously classified the issuance of convertible debentures and the
performance fee obligation as components of equity on the basis that the
obligations could be settled with the issuance of Trust Units. Interest expense
and issuance costs related to the debentures were charged to accumulated income
as a component of equity. Based on the revised standard, a financial instrument
is presented based on the substance of the contractual arrangement regardless of
the means of settlement. This results in the reclassification of convertible
debentures to long-term liabilities and the performance fee to current
liabilities. Additionally, a financial instrument with an embedded conversion
feature must be segregated between liabilities and equity based on the relative
fair market value of the liability and equity portions. Therefore, the debenture
liabilities are presented at less than their eventual maturity values. The
liability and equity components are further reduced for issuance costs initially
incurred. The discount of the liability component as compared to maturity value
is accreted by the effective interest method over the debenture term. As
debentures are converted to Trust Units, an appropriate portion of the liability
and equity components are transferred to Unitholders' capital. Interest and
accretion expense on the convertible debentures are shown on the Consolidated
Statement of Income.
OUTLOOK
Advantage's cash flow from operations in 2005 will continue to be impacted by
the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices and the $Cdn/$US exchange
rate. Advantage will continue to distribute a substantial portion of its cash
flow in 2005 with the distribution level set by the Board of Directors of AOG
dependent on the level of commodity prices and success of the Fund's drilling
and development program and acquisition activities. In 2005, Advantage will
continue to follow its strategy of acquiring properties that provide low risk
development opportunities and enhance long term cash flow. The market for
property acquisitions in 2005 will be very competitive as a result of strong
commodity prices, ease of access to capital for acquiring companies, and the
increased demand for production that has resulted from the larger number of
trusts in the market place. Advantage will also continue to focus on low cost
production and reserve additions through low to medium risk development drilling
opportunities that have arisen as a result of the acquisitions completed in 2003
and 2004. Advantage's Board of Directors approved a 2005 capital expenditures
budget of $82 million which will include the drilling, completion and tie-in of
70 wells, 32 of which are planned to be drilled at the Fund's Nevis property. In
addition, the 2005 budget includes numerous low risk recompletion and workover
projects, facility enhancements and land and seismic purchases.
The following table indicates the Fund's cash flow from operations sensitivity
(prior to hedging) to changes in prices and production of natural gas, crude oil
and NGLs, exchange rates and interest rates for 2005 based on production of
23,000 boe/d comprised of 93,000 mcf/d of natural gas and 7,500 bbls/d of crude
oil and NGLs. Advantage is considerably more sensitive to changes in natural gas
prices as compared to oil due to the Fund's higher natural gas weighting.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
The information in this report contains certain forward-looking statements that
involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties, certain of which
are beyond Advantage's control, including: the impact of general economic
conditions, industry conditions, changes in laws and regulations including the
adoption of new environmental laws and regulations and changes in how they are
interpreted and enforced, increased competition, fluctuations in commodity
prices and foreign exchange and interest rates, stock market volatility and
obtaining required approvals of regulatory authorities. Advantage's actual
results, performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed
in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements and, accordingly, no
assurances can be given that any of the events anticipated by the
forward-looking statements will transpire or occur or, if any of them do, what
benefits that Advantage will derive from them.
NON-GAAP MEASURES
Cash flow from operations and per Unit cash flow from operations are not
recognized measures under the Canadian generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP). Management believes that cash flow from operations is a useful
supplemental measure to analyze operating performance and provide an indication
of the results generated by the Trust's principal business activities prior to
the consideration of how those activities are financed or how the results are
taxed. Investors should be cautioned, however, that these measures should not be
construed as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as
an indication of Advantage's performance. Advantage's method of calculating
these measures may differ from other companies, and accordingly, they may not be
comparable to measures used by other companies.

form, can be found on SEDAR at WWW.SEDAR.COM.
