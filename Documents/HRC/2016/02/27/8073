<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 18/8 the Human Rights Council requested the Expert Mechanism on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to undertake, with the assistance of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, a questionnaire to seek the views of 
States on best practices regarding possible appropriate measures and implementation 
strategies to attain the goals of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples. 
</p>
<p>2. The questionnaire asked whether States had developed a national implementation 
strategy; whether specific legal, policy or other measures had been adopted to implement 
the Declaration; whether Governments take the Declaration into account when devising 
new laws, policies and other measures; whether steps have been taken to raise awareness of 
the Declaration at community and Government level; whether the Government had  
encountered any challenges when adopting measures to attain the goals of the Declaration; 
and States&#8217; views on best practices regarding appropriate measures and implementation 
strategies to attain the goals of the Declaration.  In their responses, States were asked to 
consider six different thematic areas: self-determination and autonomy; participation in 
decision-making, including obligations to seek to obtain indigenous peoples&#8217; free, prior and 
informed consent; culture and languages; non-discrimination and equality; lands, territories 
and resources; and treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with States. 
</p>
<p>3. The Expert Mechanism thanks the States that responded to the questionnaire.  State 
responses were received from Australia, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Burkina Faso, 
Chile, Congo, Denmark, France, Guyana, Iraq, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, 
Mexico, Myanmar, New Zealand, Norway, Peru and the United States of America.  The 
responses are available in full on the website of the Expert Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>4. The Expert Mechanism also thanks the Faculty of Law, University of Manitoba, 
Canada, for its technical assistance in reviewing the responses from States 
</p>

</p>
<p><b> In the light of the information provided above, what are your views on 
</b></p>
<p><b>best practices regarding possible appropriate measures and implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategies to attain the goals of the Declaration?</b> 
</p>
<p><b> Please also consider and, if relevant, comment on the role that can be 
</b></p>
<p><b>played by international institutions, including the Expert Mechanism on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to assist States in adopting measures and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation strategies to attain the goals of the Declaration</b> 
</p>
<p><b> III. State responses 
</b></p>
<p>6. This section summarizes the responses from States to the questionnaire. It must be 
borne in mind that non-State actors, including indigenous peoples, may have conflicting 
views on the benefits of measures adopted to implement the Declaration or ideal strategies 
to achieve its implementation.  
</p>
<p><b> A. National implementation strategies 
</b></p>
<p>7. Many States indicated that they had a national strategy to implement the 
Declaration.   Guyana indicated that its implementation strategy was adumbrated in several 
policy documents, at least one of which was developed in consultation with the great 
majority of Amerindian communities. Mexico&#8217;s National Development Plan addresses 
indigenous peoples specifically and its Commission for the Development of Indigenous 
Peoples is required to assist indigenous peoples in their exercise of their self-determination.  
</p>
<p>8. Several States indicated that the principles of the Declaration are reflected in 
national legislation.  For example, the Congo indicated that the fundamental principles of 
the Declaration are incorporated in its Loi No. 5-2011, &#8220;Promotion et protection des droits 
des populations autochtones&#8221;.  Some States, for example Peru and Myanmar, identified </p>


<p>existing national laws and policies which relate to specific areas of the Declaration such as 
education and culture.  However, it is unclear whether these laws and policies were 
developed to specifically to implement the goals of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>9. Some States, such as New Zealand and Norway, indicated that existing national laws 
and policies already conformed to the principles contained in the Declaration and therefore 
they have not developed additional strategies to implement the Declaration.  Australia noted 
synergies between existing policies addressing Aboriginal peoples and the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>10. The response of the Plurinational State of Bolivia did not explicitly indicate whether 
it had a specific strategy to implement the Declaration.  However, its national development 
plan, entitled &#8220;Bolivia digna, soberana, productiva y democr&#225;tica para vivir bien&#8221;, was 
developed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and the objectives of the second 
International Decade of Indigenous Peoples.  Chile&#8217;s strategy to implement its international 
obligations in relation to indigenous peoples domestically is focused on five areas: culture, 
identity and education; land; institutional capacity; participation and consultation; and 
integral development.  This policy was developed through dialogue with the nine 
indigenous peoples in the country.  
</p>
<p>11. Australia, despite not having a formal strategy for implementing the Declaration, 
cited its 2009 National Apology to Australia&#8217;s indigenous peoples, and in particular to the 
stolen generations, as a symbolic gesture signalling its commitment to implementing the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p>12. The majority of the responses did not provide details on the scope and nature of 
States&#8217; national implementation plans.  Nor did State responses indicate how these laws and 
policies were developed or whether they were developed in consultation with indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal, policy or other measures adopted especially to implement the 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights in the Declaration 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. All the rights in the Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Plurinational State of Bolivia has passed Law No. 3760 of 7 November 2007, 
on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  In its response, 
Bolivia provided extensive information on laws and programmes that are relevant to the 
implementation of the rights in the Declaration, including in the areas of education and 
languages, communications and media, housing, economic policies, food security, land and 
agricultural development, justice and women&#8217;s rights in the administration of justice in 
particular, human rights, land, water, consultation processes, decolonization and processes 
to reduce patriarchy. 
</p>
<p>14. Chile also provided a comprehensive overview (article by article) of measures to 
implement the rights set out in the Declaration.  Its response focused on five areas: culture, 
identity and language; land; institutions; participation and consultation; and development.  
These measures ranged from laws to policies and programmes.  
</p>
<p>15. In 2011, the Congo passed a law for the promotion and protection of the rights of 
indigenous peoples, which incorporates the fundamental principles of the Declaration.  The 
law addresses many areas including consultation, administration of internal affairs and 
recourse to customs to resolve internal conflicts, protection of customs and traditional 
institutions, intellectual property relating to traditional knowledge, protection of sacred 
sites, education, and individual and collective property rights. </p>


<p>16. The Mexican Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples has as one of 
its principal objectives the harmonization of federal and state-level laws with respect to the 
rights of indigenous peoples. It has referenced the Declaration in its work in this area. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Self-determination and autonomy 
</b></p>
<p>17. Mexico&#8217;s Constitution, as a result of amendments in 2001, recognizes indigenous 
peoples&#8217; self-determination and their collective rights. 
</p>
<p>18. Several States identified legislation that recognized indigenous peoples&#8217; right to 
autonomy.  Most of the legislative provisions recognizing or creating indigenous 
autonomous areas require indigenous peoples to vote in favour of becoming autonomous.  
Indigenous jurisdiction over these autonomous areas varies.  Some States indicated that 
these autonomous areas utilize indigenous peoples&#8217; own laws and institutions.  
</p>
<p>19. Bolivia has begun a process of recognizing the autonomy of indigenous 
communities.  Several communities have voted in favour of autonomy and have begun the 
process of developing their statute for autonomy with technical support from the Ministry 
of Autonomy.  The process recognizes the need for equal participation of women in the 
governance structure. 
</p>
<p>20. Burkina Faso has also begun a process of decentralization through its Loi LNo. 055-
2004/AN.  This law entrenches the right of territories to govern themselves and to manage 
their own affairs to promote their own development and reinforce local governance.  This 
decentralization process has transferred jurisdiction in socio-economic and cultural matters, 
specifically in the areas of education, health, culture and economic development projects. 
</p>
<p>21. The law in the Congo guarantees indigenous peoples the right to administer their 
internal affairs and to have recourse to their customs to resolve internal conflicts.  The law 
also protects indigenous peoples&#8217; customs and traditional institutions. 
</p>
<p>22. The Constitution of Guyana established the Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Commission, which 
is one of five constitutional rights commissions.  The objective of the Indigenous Peoples&#8217; 
Commission is to &#8220;establish mechanisms to enhance the status of indigenous peoples and to 
</p>
<p>respond to their legitimate demands and needs&#8221;.  As part of its mandate, the Indigenous 
Peoples&#8217; Commission offers recommendations on indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in 
national decision-making and other decisions that affect their lives.  In Guyana, the 
Amerindian Act 2006 provides for Village Councils to govern internal affairs. 
</p>
<p>23.  Denmark passed the Act on Greenland self-government in 2009.  Under the preamble, 
the people of Greenland are recognized as a people under international law with the right to 
self-determination.  The current Government of Greenland is a democratically elected 
public Government where all the current members of Parliament and Government are of 
Inuit descent. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Participation in decision-making, including obligations to seek to obtain indigenous 
</b></p>
<p>peoples&#8217; free, prior and informed consent<b> 
</b></p>
<p>24. Most States provided information on legislative and policy measures to implement 
the right to participate in decision-making.  There were two aspects to the information 
provided: participation in national decision-making and consultation on decisions affecting 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. 
</p>
<p>25. In Bolivia, indigenous peoples are represented in legislative bodies.  In the 
Parliament of Burkina Faso there are Peulh and Tourareg elected representatives and 
ministers of the Government. </p>


<p>26. In the Congo, legislation ensures the participation of indigenous peoples in decision-
making. Peru has also passed a law on the right to prior consultation as recognized in ILO 
Convention 169, which was promulgated on 23 August 2011. 
</p>
<p>27. France indicated that in its department of French Guiana an advisory board of 
Amerindians and Bushinengu&#233; was established in 2010.  The regional councils and the 
general council consult this board on any plans or proposals which may affect the 
environment or the cultural activities of the Amerindians and Bushinengu&#233;. 
</p>
<p>28. Chile undertook a consultation on indigenous institutions, which was modified after 
receiving complaints from indigenous leaders on the process.  The first stage of 
consultation is now aimed at a consultation on developing consultation procedures. 
</p>
<p>29. In 2005 the Government of Norway and the Sami Parliament concluded an 
agreement on procedures for consultations to ensure that new measures and legal provisions 
are in accordance with the Sami peoples&#8217; rights. The Procedures for Consultations also seek 
to ensure that the Sami peoples can genuinely participate in and have a real influence on 
decision-making processes that may directly affect Sami interests. The Government has by 
Royal Decree confirmed that the agreed procedures apply to the whole central Government 
administration. 
</p>
<p>30. In Guyana, titling and demarcation of Amerindian lands and territories requires their 
free, prior and informed consent.  
</p>
<p>31. Australia has an indigenous engagement framework which, it states, captures its 
aspirations to engage effectively with indigenous peoples.  The National Congress of 
Australia&#8217;s First Peoples is a vehicle to provide a voice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander peoples in strategic national matters. 
</p>
<p>32. In the United States of America, pursuant to Executive Order 13175 on 
&#8220;Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments&#8221;, federal agencies are 
required to consult with tribal officials when making decisions that affect tribal 
communities. 
</p>
<p>33. Mexico&#8217;s Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples has established a 
system for consultation with indigenous peoples which allows for their participation in the 
definition, design, implementation and evaluation of programs, projects and Government 
actions. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Culture and languages 
</b></p>
<p>34. There were examples of indigenous languages being recognized in State 
constitutions.  However, the most common response was to highlight the importance of 
education to promote and implement indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to culture and language.  
</p>
<p>There were a few examples of indigenous languages being taught in national schools.  A 
few States explicitly indicated that curricula were developed in consultation with 
indigenous peoples.  Some States indicated a need to overcome negative stereotypes of 
indigenous cultures and languages in order to preserve and promote their use. 
</p>
<p>35. The Bolivian education system has been undergoing changes, based on an ideology 
and political practice of decolonization, liberation, revolution, anti-imperialism and 
transformation without discrimination or exploitation.  The revamped education system 
provides cultural education, which contributes to the affirmation and strengthening of 
cultural identities, recognition, assessment and development of indigenous peoples&#8217; culture 
</p>
<p>in dialogue with other cultures and language.  The Bolivian Constitution provides for 
education to begin in the mother tongue of each region.  The Bolivian Constitution also 
provides for the creation of indigenous universities for indigenous youth. </p>


<p>36. In Peru, the Declaration was explicitly invoked by the Minister of Education in the 
creation of the National Commission on Intercultural Bilingual Education (CONEIB).  Peru 
has also passed a law on Intercultural Bilingual Education, which aims to recognize cultural 
diversity and promote intercultural bilingual education in regions inhabited by indigenous 
peoples.  Peruvian law also recognizes and guarantees the right of indigenous peoples to 
conditions of education equal to the rest of the nation.  The Minister of Education is to 
design and implement a national plan for intercultural bilingual education. Indigenous 
peoples are to participate in the formulation and implementation of these education 
programs. 
</p>
<p>37. Chile identified programmes for the teaching and learning of indigenous languages 
and cultures in the nation&#8217;s schools.  The Constitution of Guyana provides protection of 
indigenous peoples right &#8220;to protection, preservation and promulgation of their languages, 
</p>
<p>cultural heritage and way of life.&#8221;  The Constitution of Iraq guarantees an Iraqi individual&#8217;s 
right to education in his or her mother tongue. 
</p>
<p>38. The Constitution of the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic recognizes the Lao 
language as the official language and dialect of the country.  However, in day-to-day life, 
each ethnic group is free to preserve and use its dialect in family and community for the 
preservation of their culture and traditions. 
</p>
<p>39. In the Congo, the law guarantees collective and individual rights of indigenous 
peoples to their intellectual property relating to traditional knowledge.  The law also 
protects cultural, religious and spiritual property. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Non-discrimination and equality 
</b></p>
<p>40. Several States indicated that their constitutions provide for non-discrimination and 
equality, such as the Chilean Constitution.  The Guyana Constitution also prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of race. 
</p>
<p>41. Some States indicated that the principle of equality prohibited States from treating 
any one group differently from another group.  The Constitution of the Lao People&#8217;s 
Democratic Republic stipulates that all Lao citizens are equal before the law.  According to 
the Government, in accordance with the principle of equality, every ethnic group is special 
and therefore no one is more special than any other group, which has contributed to peace 
and harmony and solidarity among Lao&#8217;s multi-ethnic peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Lands, territories and resources; 
</b></p>
<p>42. Several States mentioned processes under way to demarcate and title indigenous 
peoples&#8217; lands.  A few States referenced the collective nature of these titles.  Several States 
indicated that indigenous peoples have certain governmental authority or jurisdiction over 
their lands. 
</p>
<p>43. Bolivia is strengthening the process of land redistribution and community self-
management.  Bolivia has also published and distributed an Atlas of Indigenous Territories.  
Chile relaunched mechanisms to transfer land to indigenous peoples in transparent and 
objective conditions.  The collective property rights of indigenous peoples in the Republic 
of Congo are protected by the law. 
</p>
<p>44. France identified the creation of the Guyana Amazonian Park in French Guiana as 
providing protection to indigenous peoples in the area to maintain and preserve their 
subsistence practices, as well as preserving the natural resources they exploit. 
</p>
<p>45. In Guyana, the 2003 Constitution provides protection over property, including 
Amerindian property.  Under the Amerindian Act 2006, Amerindians are granted title to 
their lands absolutely and forever.  Titling and demarcation of Amerindian villages must </p>


<p>occur with Amerindians&#8217; free, prior and informed consent.  These lands and resources are 
governed by Village Councils, who have rule-making powers governing &#8220;the management, 
use, preservation, protection and conservation of village lands and resources or any part 
thereof&#8221;.  To date, there has been an increase in the percentage of Amerindian land titled 
and demarcated. 
</p>
<p>46. New Zealand respects the importance of Maori peoples&#8217; relationship with their land 
and resources, but also maintains the existing legal regimes for ownership and management 
of land and natural resources. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with States 
</b></p>
<p>47. New Zealand indicated that the Treaty of Waitangi is the foundational document for 
the relationship between the Government and Maori.  New Zealand is committed to settling 
outstanding treaty grievances by 2014.   New Zealand indicated that increased resources 
and funding are being provided to continue the settlement process. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Consideration of the Declaration when devising new laws and policies 
</b></p>
<p>48. Based on the responses, no State has passed explicit laws requiring the Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to be considered when devising new laws, policies or 
other measures.  However, there are examples where the goals and principles of the 
Declaration inform processes leading to new laws and policies. 
</p>
<p>49. Several States have formalized processes and enacted legislation requiring 
indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in decision-making.  These laws generally require prior 
consultation when States make decisions that directly affect indigenous peoples&#8217; rights.  
Some States make specific reference to the requirement of free, prior and informed consent 
in relevant laws and policies.  Many States indicated that measures requiring consultation 
were developed in consultation with indigenous peoples.  There were a few examples of 
consultation occurring through indigenous peoples&#8217; own institutions and decision-making 
processes. 
</p>
<p>50. The Congo&#8217;s law on the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous 
peoples was elaborated through a process which allowed for public participation including 
governmental actors, civil society and international experts.  Indigenous peoples were 
consulted in their localities in all departments where there is a significant concentration of 
indigenous peoples.  Indigenous peoples also played an active role in the discussions 
leading to the final draft of the legislation. 
</p>
<p>51. Consultation with indigenous peoples in the Plurinational State of Bolivia is part of 
the principles of openness and transparency promoted by the Government.  In Bolivia, there 
are several laws in place that require consultation with indigenous peoples and their 
participation in decision-making. 
</p>
<p>52. The Chilean Indigenous Act recognizes and safeguards indigenous peoples and their 
lands in Chile, as well as recognizes indigenous institutions and cultures.  The Indigenous 
Act provides special measures for the practical application of the obligations of 
consultation and participation.  This Chilean law recognizes that indigenous peoples should 
be consulted through their traditional organizations as well as those communities, 
organizations and associations recognized under the Indigenous Act.  In one instance, when 
indigenous peoples expressed concern with the process used for consultation, the 
government adjusted the process for discussing new indigenous institutions and 
constitutional recognition. </p>


<p>53. In Guyana, the Amerindian Law 2006 requires free, prior and informed consent of 
Amerindian Villagers on issues that require their involvement or support in the areas of 
land or mining, titling and demarcating lands, entry and access to Amerindian villages, and 
use of natural resources. 
</p>
<p>54. In New Zealand, one example of Maori participation in decision-making occurs 
through negotiated agreements for the co-management of resources, such as Crown-owned 
conservation lands and National Parks.  Additionally, recent jurisprudence concluded that 
the common law is to be developed consistently with emerging human rights norms and the 
Treaty of Waitangi. 
</p>
<p>55. Peru has enacted a law that recognizes the right of indigenous peoples to prior 
consultation on legislative or administrative measures that directly affect their collective 
rights in the areas of physical existence, cultural identity, territory, education, health, 
quality of life and development of their peoples.  This law also extends to national and 
regional plans, programmes and development projects that directly affect indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights.  The regulations of this Act are being drafted with the participation of 
various government agencies and representatives of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>56. Several States indicated that, based on principles of formal equality of all citizens, 
there is no law that provides special recognition or processes for indigenous peoples to 
participate in decision-making.  In Burkina Faso, the decentralization law takes into 
account the considerations set out in the Declaration.  However, Burkina Faso does not 
wish to create a hierarchy among populations within the State and thus does not explicitly 
consider the Declaration when devising new laws and policies. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Initiatives to raise awareness of the Declaration at community and 
</b></p>
<p><b>government levels 
</b></p>
<p>57. State responses indicated several direct measures to raise awareness of the 
Declaration.  Some States indicated a preference to focus awareness campaigns on general 
human rights instruments, such as national laws or human rights treaties. Awareness-raising 
initiatives were aimed at both Government and indigenous peoples.  There were a few 
examples where education and training on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights was part of the 
</p>
<p>awareness initiatives 
</p>
<p>58. The Mexican Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples has 
disseminated the Declaration within the Government and been instrumental in the 
translation of the Declaration into 18 indigenous languages. 
</p>
<p>59. The Congo has focused awareness-raising on national and international human 
rights and indigenous peoples&#8217; rights instruments.  During &#8220;Parliamentary days&#8221; there were 
efforts taken to educate Congolese parliamentarians on the rights of indigenous peoples and 
the Declaration was explained to the parliamentarians. 
</p>
<p>60. The Ministry of External Relations of Bolivia, with the International Labour 
Organization South America Regional Office, developed a series of workshops on &#8220;The 
scope of the ILO Convention 169: Challenges for application and implementation and 
strategies for action&#8221;.  These workshops were directed at various officials in Bolivia, public 
servants and indigenous peoples.  Bolivia has also created and distributed materials (books, 
pamphlets and audio-visual material) on collective rights. 
</p>
<p>61. Chile has a programme, &#8220;Strengthening national capacities for conflict prevention 
and intercultural management in Chile&#8221;, which includes support for activities whose 
purpose is the dissemination of information and training related to indigenous peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>rights recognized by international law with an emphasis on ILO Convention No 169. </p>


<p>62. France indicated that it has an ambassador for human rights and that on International 
Day of Indigenous Peoples, round tables were organized as well as cultural events held in 
Guyana. 
</p>
<p>63. Following the enactment of the Amerindian Act in Guyana, there was a recognized 
need for education and awareness for the Village Councils and community members.  
Several training programmes have been conducted and an &#8220;Amerindian Act Made Simple&#8221; 
</p>
<p>brochure was published and distributed to all leaders and community members, which 
provided a non-technical explanation of the law.  The Government of Guyana also executes 
capacity building programmes and workshops for government employees.  As well, 
indigenous leaders can seek clarification of the Amerindian law during their biennial 
meetings. 
</p>
<p>64.  Australia&#8217;s national human rights institution developed an overview, a community 
guide and a poster on the Declaration, which sought to highlight practical examples of how 
the Declaration can benefit indigenous Australians. 
</p>
<p>65. A few States indicated that, while they were not taking action to promote the 
Declaration, however, information on the Declaration is distributed by other organizations 
within the State. With the announcement of support for the Declaration, there was 
widespread publicity of the Declaration in New Zealand.  The New Zealand Human Rights 
Commission has translated the Declaration into Te Reo Maori and has publicized the 
content and significance of the Declaration.  While different organizations that work in 
Peru have produced some materials, there is no national campaign to provide understanding 
of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>66. Some States expressed hesitation about directly promoting the Declaration and the 
rights of indigenous peoples.  Burkina Faso notes that its national cultural policy promotes 
principles of respect, but does not indicate any measures to promote the rights of 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Challenges in adopting measures and implementing strategies to attain 
</b></p>
<p><b>goals of the Declaration 
</b></p>
<p>67. One of the biggest challenges identified is the lack of awareness and knowledge of 
the Declaration and other international instruments on the rights of indigenous peoples to 
ensure the respect for these rights.  One State indicated that this lack of knowledge is 
exacerbated by a lack of larger civil society engagement in indigenous peoples&#8217; rights.  
Moreover, the rights of indigenous peoples are often not priorities. 
</p>
<p>68. A few States indicated that a challenge they experienced was a lack of information 
on how to implement the Declaration.  In particular, there was an identified need to 
improve mechanisms for dialogue and information exchange between the State and 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>69.  One State cited the lack of definitional consensus on the meaning of terms such as 
self-determination, sovereignty and free, prior and informed consent as an impediment to 
the practical implementation of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>70.  Another main challenge identified was the cost of implementing the Declaration and 
the limited resources available to undertake this work.  Specifically, the cost of land 
demarcation and titling was identified.  One State indicated that the remoteness of 
indigenous communities poses challenges to access to and timely delivery of goods and 
services, as well the inherent prohibitive costs in delivering these goods and services.  In 
addition, there are challenges in preserving and publishing State materials in all of the many 
indigenous languages that may exist within a single State. </p>


<p>71. Another challenge identified was the need for regional variances in implementation.  
Specifically, each Government&#8217;s policies are not organized in the same manner. 
</p>
<p>72. One State indicated that it is a challenge to develop national legislation.  Further, 
there is a need to incorporate and implement international commitments in public policies.  
Also, one state expressed concern because there is a need to ensure that policies developed 
for indigenous peoples also contribute to the development of the national society. 
</p>
<p>73. A major challenge discussed was in relation to monitoring and enforcement of laws, 
particularly mining and forestry laws.  One State indicated that it is a challenge to prevent 
unethical foreign researchers and non-governmental organizations from misappropriating 
indigenous peoples&#8217; intellectual property rights and traditional knowledge. 
</p>
<p>74. Some States did not identify any challenges but rather reiterated the rights enjoyed 
by indigenous peoples within the State. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Best practices 
</b></p>
<p>75. In their responses, States indicated many measures and best practices for 
implementing the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  To fully realize the 
goals of the Declaration, Governments need to commit to an ongoing implementation 
process and continue building on achievements. 
</p>
<p>76. Where treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements already exist, these 
instruments can provide the foundation for partnership, mutual respect, cooperation and 
good faith between States and indigenous peoples.  The Noum&#233;a Accord between France 
and the Kanaks of New Caledonia recognized the harmful effects of colonization, returned 
confiscated land to the indigenous peoples, provided full participation of Kanak people in 
decision-making, and established a consultation process. 
</p>
<p>77. Chile&#8217;s approach to hold regional round tables for a &#8220;historic reunion&#8221; is an example 
of a process to create a national plan to attain the goals of the Declaration.  Government, 
churches, civil society organizations, and indigenous representatives participated in these 
roundtables.  The goals were to build trust and identify topics that are important to 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>78. Many States set out a multi-pronged approach to implementing the rights in the 
Declaration.  Some States used constitutional, legislative and policy measures to implement 
the Declaration. Some States drafted new legislation, amended existing legislation, created 
new programs and initiatives, and increased involvement in international indigenous issues.  
This multi-pronged approach can include a special law recognizing the rights of indigenous 
peoples, which is developed with the effective participation of indigenous peoples based on 
the principle of free, prior and informed consent. 
</p>
<p>79. Bolivia particularly demonstrated good practices of gender equality by recognizing 
the need to ensure programmes specifically target and benefit indigenous women. 
</p>
<p>80. States can work with United Nations agencies to substantially improve the situation 
of indigenous peoples, especially with those agencies providing technical assistance. Chile 
identified the need for ongoing support by the international community in the 
implementation of strategies to achieve the Declaration, especially in the studying and 
publicizing best practices to assist States in achieving the goals of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>81. The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the United Nations 
Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples supported the Congo in the adoption 
of the special law for indigenous peoples.  Technical assistance from the international </p>


<p>community, including information and capacity building, will, in the opinion of some 
States, significantly benefit and improve implementation. 
</p>
<p>82. To attain the goals of the Declaration, States promoted capacity-building for 
indigenous peoples.  Further, States encouraged efforts to strengthen indigenous peoples&#8217; 
institutions, non-governmental organizations and self-government structures.  There was 
also a recognized need to provide opportunities for indigenous peoples to participate as 
equal partners in the development process of the entire country. Australia pursues a policy 
of focusing on addressing indigenous disadvantage in areas such as education, health 
services, community development and community safety. 
</p>
<p>83. States also identified best practices in the area of education and promoting 
indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and cultures.  It is important to include indigenous 
</p>
<p>languages within the education system. This includes developing strategies for 
implementing bilingual and intercultural education, which includes indigenous peoples&#8217; 
participation.  In addition, cultural centres can be created to promote indigenous cultures.  
Finally, some States recognized indigenous languages as official languages. 
</p>
<p>84. To attain the goals of the Declaration, some States indicated that a special budget for 
consultation with indigenous peoples was created.  Other States provided funds to address 
issues facing urban indigenous peoples and undertake studies on employability. To this end, 
States indicated that international financial institutions will need to aid developing countries 
throughout the implementation process. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Concluding comments 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Expert Mechanism very much appreciates States</b>&#8217; responses<b> to its 
questionnaire, especially because the responses can provide inspiration to creatively 
</b></p>
<p><b>devise strategies to implement the Declaration.  However, the Expert Mechanism is 
</b></p>
<p><b>disappointed with the low number of responses to its questionnaire overall and is 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerned that it could reflect a broader lack of political will on the part of States to 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement the Declaration.  The Expert Mechanism would therefore like to request 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Human Rights Council to extend the timeframe to enable states to respond to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>questionnaire so that the Expert Mechanism can prepare a more comprehensive 
</b></p>
<p><b>report in 2013. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The majority of responses received provided information at a very general 
level.  In particular, there was almost no information provided indicating the 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectiveness of the measures taken.  Most States only provided positive answers to 
</b></p>
<p><b>questions.  Negative answers would also provide greater context for understanding the 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges States face when implementing the Declaration. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>While not explicitly stated in the responses to the questionnaire, some States 
appear to perceive there to be a struggle to balance the recognition and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples as articulated in the Declaration 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the principle of equality.  Equality continues to be interpreted by some States to 
</b></p>
<p><b>prohibit specialized programmes aimed at achieving the goals of the Declaration.  The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Expert Mechanism stresses that substantive equality can require treating indigenous 
</b></p>
<p><b>peoples as distinct groups facing unique circumstances 
</b></p>
<p>88. One challenge raised by Guyana was that there are &#8220;attempts by a few persons 
<b>and NGOs to undermine the land titling and demarcation process by advising 
</b></p>
<p><b>Indigenous peoples to claim more lands than they traditionally occupy, reject the 
</b></p>
<p>process of titling and demarcation and or to make no request for such demarcation&#8221;<b>.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Such frustration indicates that a tension may exist between States and indigenous </b></p>


<p><b>peoples and non-governmental organizations on the best approach to achieving the 
</b></p>
<p><b>goals of the Declaration.  Again, additional information by States on how to work 
</b></p>
<p><b>through these differences to promote harmonious relations would greatly assist other 
</b></p>
<p><b>States to continue to work towards implementation. 
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
