</p>
<p> II. Activities of the Board of Trustees ..........................................................................  6&#8211;<footnote name="1">7. Technical cooperation activities implemented through the Voluntary Fund have been 
increasingly linked with international human rights monitoring mechanisms (see paragraphs 
18 to 31 below) following the spirit that human rights protection and promotion activities 
are intrinsically linked and inform each other (see also annexes I and II below). </footnote>3 4

</p>
<p>  B. Thirty-fifth session ..........................................................................................  10&#8211;<footnote name="1">6. At the end of 2011, the Voluntary Fund offered assistance in a wide range of 
substantive activities undertaken in 34 different countries and territories. Projects are 
formulated and implemented with the broadest possible participation of all elements of 
national societies, including civil society and national institutions (the judicial, legislative 
and executive branches of Government). The projects reflect national development 
objectives. Assistance includes, inter alia, support at the national level to incorporate 
international human rights standards into national laws, policies and practices; the 
establishment of more sustainable national capacities to adhere to these standards; 
strengthened administration of justice; greater emphasis on the development of human 
rights education programmes; the establishment of responsive national human rights 
institutions; the deployment of human rights advisers in United Nations country teams; and 
the development of national plans of action for the promotion and protection of human 
rights. Importantly, non-governmental organizations are increasingly involved in technical 
cooperation activities.

<p> III. Objectives, activities and results of the Voluntary Fund .........................................  14&#8211;<footnote name="1">5. Technical cooperation in the field of human rights, as supported by the Voluntary 
Fund, has developed greatly since its establishment, including owing to a greater number of 
institutions and actors playing a role in human rights. From ad hoc seminars and workshops 
in early years, the activities sponsored by the Voluntary Fund now cover multi-component 
institutional capacity-building projects developed as a result of an in-country assessment of 
needs with the involvement of various stakeholders.

technical cooperation, which aims at providing guidance to its field presences and staff on 
the approach of OHCHR to technical cooperation in the light of recent trends, such as a 
holistic approach to follow up on recommendations made by international human rights 
mechanisms. The Board expressed its expectation that the manual will serve as an 
important guidance tool in the implementation of technical cooperation activities.  </footnote> 6

Voluntary Fund. It is of the view that the ongoing global financial crisis should not alter the 
commitment to human rights, and encourages Member States to maintain and increase their 
contribution to the Fund. The Board encourages contribution from a wide range of donors, 
including from countries that benefit from the Fund, as even modest contributions are an 
important sign of support. The Board wishes also to remind inter-governmental and non-
governmental organizations and individuals that their contribution to the Fund is also 
encouraged (see annex IV).  </footnote>0 7

<p> V. Status of funding and donors ...................................................................................  32&#8211;<footnote name="3">2. OHCHR has continuously strengthened its provision of technical cooperation. 
Expenditures under the Voluntary Fund for the period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011 
amounted to $ 37.3 million, reflecting the constant increases of recent years. The increase 
in expenditure has not, however, been matched by an increase in contributions; indeed, for 
the same period, contributions only amounted to $33.78 million. Funds accumulated from 
previous years allowed OHCHR to implement many of its projects in 2011. By the end of 
2012, the financial situation of the Fund could become a subject of serious concern for the 
Office. Many projects have already suffered from cash-flow problems since the beginning 
of 2011; if trends continue, OHCHR might be limited in its capacity to deliver technical 
cooperation (see annex III).

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background  
</b></p>
<p>1. The Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights, 
established by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1987/83, receives 
voluntary contributions from Governments, organizations and individuals. The objective of 
the Fund is to provide financial support for international cooperation aimed at building up 
and strengthening national and regional institutions and infrastructures that will have long-
term impact on improved implementation of international human rights standards.<footnote name="1">4. The overarching objective of the work supported by the Voluntary Fund remains 
that of promoting institution-building and institutional changes for the benefit of rights-
holders. The objective is implemented through various approaches, including 
operationalizing thematic expertise, ensuring the linkage between protection and technical 
cooperation, the provision of support and guidance through the human rights components of 
United Nations peace missions and to United Nations country teams, including the 
placement of human rights advisers. 
</footnote> 
</p>
<p>2. The Board of Trustees has been operational since 1993 and its members are 
appointed by the Secretary-General for a three-year renewable term. The mandate of the 
Board is to assist the Secretary-General in streamlining and rationalizing the working 
methods and procedures of the technical cooperation programme. It meets twice a year and 
reports on its work to the Secretary-General and the Human Rights Council. Current 
members are Sozar Subari (Georgia), Fatima Mbaye (Mauritania), Cecilia Medina Quiroga 
(Chile), Christopher Dominic Sidoti (Australia) and Deepika Udagama (Sri Lanka). The 
second terms of office of Monica Pinto (Argentina) and William Schabas (Canada and 
Ireland) ended in December 2011. Ms. Medina and Mr. Sidoti were appointed by the 
Secretary-General in January 2012.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Mandate  
</b></p>
<p>3. Since 2004, the Board of Trustees has refocused its attention from more detailed 
revision of individual projects to advising the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on policy orientation and strategy in 
strengthening its technical cooperation programme in the field of human rights. Instead of 
focusing on smaller projects, funds are now injected into the work of existing field 
presences on the basis of the rationale that much of the activities undertaken by OHCHR 
field presences fall within the area of technical cooperation. This broader definition of 
technical cooperation agreed by the Board of Trustees was presented to Members States 
and reported in the annual reports of the Secretary-General submitted to the Human Rights 
Council.2  
</p>
<p>4. The new role played by the Board has been appreciated by  OHCHR, which has 
greatly benefited from the experience and wisdom of the Board members, particularly 
following the recent reforms in the OHCHR strategic planning process. 
</p>
<p>5. The present report covers the thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth sessions of the Board. At 
those sessions, the Board built on its previous experience, and continued to explore various 
components of the Human Rights Programme on Technical Cooperation, funded by the 
Voluntary Fund, with a view to providing policy guidance and advice on the technical 
cooperation activities carried out by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>

 2 See  A/HRC/16/66. </p>


<p><b> II. Activities of the Board of Trustees 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Thirty-fourth session 
</b></p>
<p>6. The thirty-fourth session of the Board of Trustees was held in Burundi, on 26 and 27 
April 2011, and in Kenya, on 28 and 29 April 2011. This was the first time in the history of 
the Board that a session was organized outside Geneva. The field mission provided the 
Board with an objective view of the real needs of field presences and a first-hand insight 
into the use of the Voluntary Fund with regard to achievements, thematic priorities, 
constraints and challenges.  
</p>
<p>7. The Board discussed technical cooperation activities by the OHCHR presence in 
Burundi, activities by the Regional Human Rights Adviser for the Great Lakes, as well as 
activities by the Human Rights Adviser in Kenya. The Board also met with different 
national authorities, United Nations partners, diplomatic missions and civil society 
organizations in Burundi and Kenya. The Board received also an overview of the human 
rights situation in different parts of Somalia.  
</p>
<p>8. During the field visit, the Board discussed various transitional justice programmes 
and mechanisms established in Burundi, Kenya and Somalia. With regard to transitional 
justice, the Board stressed that the challenge was to ensure that the right issues were being 
addressed. In this regard, the Board noted that a sustainable approach to institution-building 
was fundamental to ensure that a strong justice system was in place, taking into 
consideration the specific situation of each country. The Board was also briefed on the 
various thematic priorities addressed by the field presences in the countries visited, 
including thematic strategies relating to combatting impunity and strengthening the rule of 
law; the promotion and protection of economic, social and cultural rights; the promotion of 
democracy and good governance; and the strengthening of cooperation with international 
and regional human rights mechanisms and national human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p>9. The Board is of the view that its first field visit was very fruitful and should be 
followed by similar sessions in others countries. This would help to identify priority areas 
for technical cooperation and best practices.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Thirty-fifth session 
</b></p>
<p>10.  The thirty-fifth session of the Board of Trustees was held in Geneva from 31 
October to 3 November 2011. At the session, the Board was updated on the OHCHR 2012-
2013 management plan, in particular with regard to thematic priorities and the streamlining 
of planning.  
</p>
<p>11. The Board also received an overview on the use of the online performance 
monitoring system, which was designed to monitor and report on the results of the work of 
OHCHR. The Board expressed its appreciation with regard to the implementation of the 
computer-based performance monitoring system, and hopes that a long-term capacity-
building programme will enable OHCHR staff to use the system to improve the quality of 
their planning and monitoring and, ultimately, their impact on the ground.  
</p>

<p>America and the Caribbean. The Board was also briefed on the situation of human rights 
components of United Nations peace missions and on the situation of country offices. It 
acknowledged the challenges faced in all these different countries and welcomed the 
achievements made in the field.  
</p>
<p>13. In closing the session, the Board met with representatives of Member States and 
briefed them on the deliberations and major outcomes of the session, in a spirit of 
transparency and in keeping with its tradition. It highlighted the focus of its work, namely 
that of providing an oversight of priorities in the use of the Voluntary Fund, as well as 
guidance and advice on OHCHR technical cooperation activities in general. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Objectives, activities and results of the Voluntary Fund 
</b></p>

<p><b> IV. Technical cooperation: current trends, challenges and 
</b></p>
<p><b>synergies with other United Nations agencies, the work of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council and international treaty bodies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the special procedures 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Synergies with the Human Rights Council, the treaty bodies and special 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Board expressed its appreciation for the continued efforts of OHCHR to 
increase synergies in the delivery of its technical cooperation with United Nations partners 
and with the work of the Human Rights Council and international human rights 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>19. The Board underscored the critical importance of linking the treaty bodies, special 
procedures and the work of the Human Rights Council to, in particular with regard to the 
universal periodic review, technical cooperation. In this context, the Board stressed the 
potential of the technical cooperation programme to help in the implementation of the 
recommendations made by treaty bodies and special procedures, and at universal periodic 
review sessions, at the country level. 
</p>
<p>20. The Board strongly supports the holistic approach of OHCHR to support the 
implementation of the recommendations of all United Nations human rights mechanisms at 
the country level in an integrated way, in particular in the framework of the Office&#8217;s 
priority to strengthen human rights mechanisms and the progressive development of human 
rights law. 
</p>
<p>21. The Board noted that, in recent years, great progress had been made in incorporating 
the recommendations made by the above-mentioned mechanisms into OHCHR planning 
and programming at all levels, in accordance with its mandate, objectives and priorities.  
</p>
<p>22. More specifically with regard to the universal periodic review, the Board welcomes 
the positive developments of that process and emphasizes the importance for establishing 
credibility for the review through the implementation of its recommendations.  
</p>
<p>23. With regard to the funding mechanisms of the universal periodic review, the Board 
is of the view that the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human 
Rights and the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance  should not be 
competing funds, but rather complement each other. To date, the former has, to some 
extent, been used for universal periodic review follow-up activities and the implementation 
of review recommendations at the country and regional levels, noting that contributions and 
pledges to the latter fund remained modest. 
</p>
<p>24. The Board is prepared to play a role in ensuring that the experience of the Voluntary 
Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights is taken into account in the 
administration of the Universal Periodic Review Voluntary Fund for Financial and 
Technical Assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Synergies within the United Nations, including in the area of 
</b></p>
<p><b>development assistance 
</b></p>

<p>to the prevention of human rights violations and conflicts, and ultimately contribute to 
economic development.  
</p>
<p>26. The Board noted that OHCHR, together with its partners, has made significant 
progress in mainstreaming human rights into the work of the United Nations, providing 
countries with a more coherent source of support and optimising existing resources. It has 
strengthened cooperation with United Nations agencies, in particular the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP). In October 2011, OHCHR and UNDP launched the 
UNDG Human Rights Mainstreaming Mechanism Multi-donor Trust Fund to strengthen 
the capacity of United Nations country teams to support development of human rights 
capacities at the country level. A joint strategy to deploy human rights advisers within 
country team Resident Coordinator offices has been developed to operationalize that 
process and expand opportunities for technical assistance to countries. 
</p>
<p>27. The Board expressed its appreciation about the development of the joint strategy, 
and noted that OHCHR had received a great number of requests from Resident 
Coordinators for the deployment of human rights advisers in their respective country teams. 
As at December 2011, some 10 requests remain unanswered owing to lack of resources, 
given that the Multi-donor Trust Fund had not received sufficient funds. While it is hoped 
that the Human Rights Mainstreaming Mechanism will become a source of funding for a 
significant number of human rights advisers, it is not certain when this funding will be 
available, and it is unlikely that it will cover all needs. The Board therefore considers that 
support for human rights advisers by the Voluntary Fund remains crucial.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Challenges: a focus on measuring results 
</b></p>
<p>28. A key challenge inherent to above-mentioned technical cooperation activities is 
measuring impact at the country level. In this context, the Board commends OHCHR on its 
performance monitoring system. 
</p>
<p>29. The performance monitoring system is an important contribution to the commitment 
of OHCHR to become a fully results-based organization, transparent and accountable to all 
stakeholders. In order to advance towards this goal, OHCHR has invested in the 
establishment of a computer-based performance monitoring system, which allows for 
consistent, evidence-based reporting on the achievement of results. The system links 
planning, monitoring and the production of reports, and facilitates the definition of results, 
selection of relevant indicators and the establishment of targets for technical assistance, as 
well as ongoing, evidence-based assessment of results during the implementation of 
activities. The system thus facilitates decision-making by members of OHCHR 
management on issues relating to the performance of technical cooperation projects, 
supports the creation and maintenance of an institutional memory on assistance provided, 
and facilitates the sharing of experiences and lessons learned. 
</p>
<p>30. The Board strongly recommends that OHCHR and its field presences start making 
the performance monitoring system an integral part of their programming work.
