</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the context of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component 
of the right to an adequate standard of living receives a large number of communications alleging 
violations of the right to adequate housing and related rights worldwide. Such communications 
are received from national, regional and international non-governmental organizations, as well as 
intergovernmental organizations and other United Nations procedures concerned with the 
protection of human rights. This addendum to the report of the Special Rapporteur contains, on a 
country-by-country basis, summaries of communications sent to States, government replies, 
observations and follow-up relating to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate for the period of 
1 December 2005 to 1 December 2006. The report also reflects one communication that 
originated prior to 1 December 2005 but for which a government response was received after 
that date and therefore not included in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous report 
(E/CN.4/2006/41/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur has sought to condense details of communications sent and 
received. To the extent that his resources permit, the Special Rapporteur continues to follow up 
on communications sent and monitor the situation where no reply has been received or where 
questions remain outstanding. Where appropriate, the Special Rapporteur has sent joint urgent 
appeals or letters with one or more special procedures of the Human Rights Council where the 
allegations raised concerns relating to the right to adequate housing as well as rights addressed 
under other mandates. 
</p>
<p>3. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur sent a total of 29 communications 
concerning the right to adequate housing to 19 Member States as well as 1 communication to the 
United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Of the 29 communications 
sent, 11 replies were received from Governments and from UNMIK. One government reply was 
also received concerning a communication sent prior to 1 December 2005 (Australia). The 
Special Rapporteur appreciates these replies; however, he regrets once again that the majority of 
Governments have failed to respond at all, or have done so in a selective manner that does not 
respond to all the questions arising from the communication. These communications remain 
outstanding and the Special Rapporteur encourages Governments to respond to urgent actions, 
including all concerns raised in each communication. There are also a number of 
communications included in last year&#8217;s report for which a reply has still not been transmitted to 
the Special Rapporteur, including ones addressed to the Governments of Botswana, Cambodia, 
China, Israel, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand (see E/CN.4/2006/41/Add.1). The Special 
Rapporteur continues to follow with interest developments and information from various sources 
on the relevant issues. 
</p>
<p>4. Through his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has sought to engage in a constructive 
dialogue with Governments and to provide practical and concrete solutions aimed at the 
realization of the right to adequate housing. The communications sent by the Special Rapporteur 
to Governments have to be understood in this context. A large number of the communications in 
the period under review are related to cases of forced evictions. It was underlined that forced 
evictions constitute prima facie violations of a wide range of internationally recognized human 
rights and large-scale evictions can only be carried out under exceptional circumstances and in 
full accordance with international human rights law. The Special Rapporteur has indicated to the 
Governments the basic principles and guidelines on development-based evictions and </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/18/Add.1 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>displacement that can be used as a concrete tool in cases where evictions are unavoidable (see 
A/HRC/4/18). In a spirit of cooperation, the Special Rapporteur urges all Governments and other 
actors to respond promptly to his communications, to immediately take appropriate measures, to 
investigate allegations of the violation of the right to adequate housing and related rights and to 
take all steps necessary to redress the situation.

</b></p>
<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>5. On 23 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning 
the persistent practice of forced evictions in Luanda. According to reports received, on 24 
and 30 November 2005 forced evictions and demolitions of homes were undertaken by the 
Luanda Provincial Government in Cambamba I and II, Bairro 28 de Agosto and Banga W&#233;, in 
the municipality of Kilamba Kiaxi in Luanda, affecting over 600 families. It was indicated that 
there was a lack of consultation and no provision of adequate housing alternatives, and that the 
evictions were characterized by excessive use of force on the part of the police, security guards 
and agents of the fiscal department of the Luanda Provincial Government present on the eviction 
site. Most of the affected families reportedly returned to the area, and further demolitions and 
evictions took place on 22 December 2005. According to the latest information received, 
families still remaining in the neighbourhood are under renewed risk of forced evictions. On 
6 February 2006, the residents were given a collective radio-transmitted prior notice of 72 hours 
to leave the area by the private housing project Nova Vida, and the risk of such evictions is 
imminent. Concern was expressed about this situation given past examples of large-scale 
evictions in Luanda (more specifically in Boavista, Soba Kapassa and Benfica between 2001 
and 2003), where reports and testimonies indicate that the reality for the vast majority of those 
evicted was long-term temporary shelter or homelessness. Concern was equally expressed about 
allegations of a pattern of lack of prior notice, inadequate or no consultation, absence of 
information-sharing and no possibility of participation in the decision-making process for those 
affected, as well as violence, including targeting women. 
</p>
<p>6. On 27 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a follow-up urgent appeal in which he 
drew attention to a previous urgent appeal dated 23 February 2006, and reiterated the concerns 
expressed on it. According to additional information received, on 13 and 14 March 2006, 
families still remaining in the neighbourhood of Cambamba I and II were allegedly forcibly 
evicted by members of the National Police Force, members of the Fiscal Police of the Governor 
of Luanda, agents of a private security company (Visgo) as well as non-identified agents in 
civilian clothes. Reportedly, these were all acting on behalf of and protecting the interests of the 
governmental housing project &#8220;Nova Vida&#8221;, which was entering a second phase of construction 
planned on the land of Cambamba. It was indicated that the law enforcement agents shot into the 
crowd of residents, kicked and hit people with guns and whips, acting with excessive use of 
force and of firearms, in no proportion to the level of resistance offered by the unarmed 
population. Homes were demolished and according to reports residents have not been offered 
alternative housing or any type of compensation. The forced evictions took the same patterns as </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/18/Add.1 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>those undertaken in November and December 2005 and between 2001 and 2003. The Special 
Rapporteur also informed the Government that he intended to shortly issue a public statement 
regarding forced evictions in Angola.<b>1</b>  
</p>
<p>7. On 21 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a second follow-up urgent appeal regarding 
allegations of forced evictions in Luanda. Again, the Special Rapporteur drew attention to his 
previous urgent appeals. According to information received, a number of inhabitants of the 
&#8220;Communidade do Barrio da Cidadania&#8221; received on 18 April a communication from the 
Municipal Administration of Viana notifying them that they illegally occupied public land 
allocated to a specific project which required its availability. It appears that the authorities note 
that they have the capacity to grant other space to address the housing needs of those affected if 
they voluntarily abandon the land they occupy within 48 hours of receipt of communication. The 
communications allegedly received appear to indicate that expiry of the 48-hour deadline will 
trigger the procedure (under Act No. 10/87) to evict without the right to any benefit. Concern 
was expressed particularly about the allegations raised above, given past examples of forced 
evictions in Luanda. The Special Rapporteur restated his interest in conducting a country mission 
to Angola and entering into a constructive dialogue with the Government, with a view to offer 
any advice that may assist it in complying with its obligations under pertinent international 
instruments. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>8. While the Special Rapporteur appreciates the comments received in a letter to the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights from the Government with regard to his communication 
dated 23 February 2006, stating that his concerns and request had been brought to the attention 
of the competent authorities who were still in a process of gathering all necessary elements 
within the framework of an inter-ministerial task force set up for this purpose, he is not entirely 
satisfied as not all concerns raised in his communication have been addressed, and no further 
reply has been received. He hopes that the continued dialogue will result in a resolution of the 
human rights situation being faced by the people affected. The Special Rapporteur continues to 
monitor the situation closely. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur remains particularly concerned about the situations described 
above given past examples of large-scale forced evictions in Luanda, such as in the areas of 
Boavista, Soba Kapassa and Benfica between 2001 and 2003. Reports and testimonies indicate 
that whereas a small minority of those evicted was provided immediate alternative housing, the 
reality for the vast majority was long-term temporary shelter, or homelessness. He is also 
concerned that information from both international and national sources alleges a pattern of lack 
of prior notice, inadequate or no consultation, absence of information-sharing and no possibility 
of participation in the decision-making process for those affected. In addition, forced evictions 
seem to be, as a rule, accompanied by violence, including targeting women.

<p>10. Whilst the Government of Angola has agreed on the principle of a mission, the mission has 
not taken place due to the inability of the Government to schedule dates. As included in his 
communications, the Special Rapporteur restated his interest in conducting a country mission to 
Angola.  
</p>
<p><b>Australia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Response received on cases sent by the Special Rapporteur in preceding years 
</b></p>
<p>11. By letter dated 24 January 2006, the Government replied to the letter sent on 23 May 2005 
by the Special Rapporteur (E/CN.4/2006/41/Add.1, paras. 5 and 6). In this communication, the 
Government accepted the request for a mission by the Special Rapporteur to the country, and 
gave an initial response to the letter sent regarding the joint federal-state Supported 
Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP). The Government claimed that this visit would 
offer a good opportunity to pursue the issues raised in the letter and get a better sense of the 
situation on the ground. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>12. During his visit to Victoria, the Special Rapporteur was informed that under the latest 
Commonwealth State SAAP agreement, the Commonwealth withdrew funding for core services 
in Victoria resulting in Victoria making up the shortfall by committing an extra $13.8 million 
over the term of the agreement to maintain homelessness responses. This resulted in Victoria 
contributing over 57 per cent of funding for SAAP and SAAP-like services in Victoria over the 
5-year period of the agreement. Reportedly, this has had significant impact on Victoria&#8217;s 
capacity to encourage responses to homeless persons (Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on his mission 
to Australia: A/HRC/4/18/Add.2, appendix). The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for 
its response. 
</p>
<p><b>Bangladesh 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>13. On 20 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and 
the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, on an ongoing conflict between the Bengali 
settlers and the Marma indigenous peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, in the south-eastern part 
of Bangladesh, since mid-2005. According to the information received, Bengali settlers have, 
with the support of the army, illegally and forcibly occupied titled indigenous peoples&#8217; land. On 
5 March, Bengali settlers, with the support of the military, occupied land belonging to the 
Shishughar Buddhist Orphanage. On 3 April 2006, Bengali settlers allegedly attacked the Marma 
indigenous peoples in the villages of Sa Prue Para, Joy Sen Para, Sapru Karbabipara and 
Nuapara. The attacks reportedly left more than 30 casualties. It was reported that when the 
Marma women opposed the incident, Bengali settlers ill-treated four Marma women. It was 
reported that the Bengali settlers also raped several girls including a 16-year-old girl. 
Furthermore, it is also alleged that 13 of the indigenous wounded in the said attacks were 
hospitalized, 3 seriously wounded, and houses were destroyed and looted in the attacks.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>14. By letter dated 20 April 2006, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that his 
letter of 20 April 2006 had been transmitted to the relevant authorities in Bangladesh for 
necessary inquiry and further action as deemed appropriate. However, the Special Rapporteur 
regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the Government had not transmitted any 
further reply to his communication. The Special Rapporteur continues to monitor the situation 
with interest. 
</p>
<p><b>Cambodia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>15. On 5 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal, as part of a follow-up to his 
official mission to Cambodia from 22 August to 3 September 2005, concerning the threat of 
ongoing and imminent forced evictions of the people living, allegedly since the early 1990&#8217;s, in 
Sambok Chab Village in Phnom Penh, also known as the Bassac Commune, an area which he 
visited during his mission. The Special Rapporteur clearly set out the legal basis of his mandate 
and drew the Government&#8217;s attention to international human rights standards concerning the 
prohibition of forced evictions. According to information received, as part of plans to redevelop 
the land along the Bassac River from Koh Pich south to the Vietnamese Bridge, the city of 
Phnom Penh has decided on the eviction of the informal settlements on the bank of the 
Bassac River, home for around 1,700 families, living in extreme poverty, out of which 1,000 are 
at risk of immediate eviction. Reports indicate that some residents have been offered relocation 
to another site, including land, houses and access to basic services. Allegedly however, the 
designated site is currently a dusty field inclined to flooding, where basic services are 
non-existent and in the process of installation without established time frame, and that is situated 
over 20 km from the city which most of the residents depend upon to ensure their livelihoods or 
mere survival. It is also alleged that depending on ownership status, which in the area includes a 
combination of persons with ownership titles, formal and informal renters as well as &#8220;squatters&#8221;, 
all residents are not entitled to a plot in the resettlement site. According to the reports, the 
situation has not been properly documented by population surveys undertaken, serious problems 
having been observed in their conduct. It has also been reported that from 3 May 2006 a group 
of owners renting their homes in the area, voluntarily dismantled their homes and took their 
construction materials to the relocation plots they have been assigned, allegedly leaving 
100 families homeless. Although the municipality has allegedly stated that it will provide plots 
for these families, no formal assurances have been made. It has been further alleged that since 
the night of 3 May and during 4 May, municipal authorities formally intervened to stop 
non-governmental organizations from distributing tents and humanitarian aid to the homeless 
families, as well as from registering the names of the families who are homeless and do not want 
to leave the area. In his mission report (E/CN.4/2006/41/Add.3) submitted to the Human Rights 
Council, at its second session, in September 2006, the Special Rapporteur recommended in 
relation to this case that: the housing-related provisions of the 2001 Property Law should be 
immediately implemented, including those of the newly adopted sub-decrees; regulations should 
be adopted that include provisions regarding the housing situation of families living in State 
property and clarify the legal situation of all land swaps that occurred between the 2001 Property </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/18/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>Law and its own adoption; full attention should be given to the families already affected to 
guarantee adequate housing conditions and security of tenure in their relocation sites; and 
whenever evictions are still pending, all efforts should be made to actually consider relocation as 
a last resort and ensure consultation with the affected community. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of the present report, the 
Government had not transmitted any reply to his communications. The Special Rapporteur 
continues to monitor the situation with interest. Subsequent to the aforementioned 
communication, the Special Rapporteur tried on several occasions to engage with the Cambodian 
authorities on this issue. Unfortunately, the evictions were carried out leading to homelessness of 
many families. He continues to receive information that similar forced evictions are taking place 
in the capital and other regions of Cambodia. The Special Rapporteur urges once again the 
Cambodian authorities to urgently address the humanitarian plight suffered by those evicted, and 
to put a halt to evictions until a comprehensive national housing policy based on human rights 
obligations is adopted and implemented. 
</p>
<p><b>China 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>17. On 14 December 2005, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint letter with the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, and the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, regarding the detention of approximately 60 human rights defenders who attempted 
to express their concern over ongoing forced evictions and lack of protection of adequate 
housing of affected communities in Shanghai. According to information received, on 
1 December 2005, the 60 persons were detained in front of the Oriental Pearl building in 
Shanghai as they attempted to deliver a letter addressed to United Nations Secretary-General, 
Kofi Annan, and United Nations officials attending the Global Compact Summit. Reportedly, 
approximately 40 of them were detained at the Century Plaza police station in Pudong, Shanghai 
and have subsequently been released, while another 20 were returned to their home districts by 
local district officials. Of particular concern, one of the activists, Cai Wenjun, who had only just 
been released after serving one year of &#8220;Re-education through Labour&#8221;, was officially notified 
that she remains under police investigation on suspicion of &#8220;disturbing public order&#8221;. Concern 
was expressed that the obstruction and detention of these housing rights activists was an attempt 
to prevent them from raising human rights concerns. 
</p>
<p>18. On 28 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, and the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, regarding Mr. Liu Zhengyou, a human rights defender and land activist for the rights 
of farmers who have been allegedly forcibly evicted from their land and houses in Zigong, 
Sichuan province. According to the information received, on 16 June 2006 Mr. Zhengyou was 
arrested by police officers at Beijing airport, without presenting an arrest warrant, while on his 
way to Geneva, Switzerland in order to participate in a human rights training workshop 
organized by a non-governmental organization. Reportedly, the officers informed the detainee </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/18/Add.1 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>that Zigong Municipal Public Security Bureau (PSB) and Sichuan Provincial PSB had requested 
them to prevent him from going to the above-mentioned event. They then put him on a train back 
to Zigong, where he was detained in the Huidong Branch of the Zigong PSB and questioned as a 
&#8220;criminal suspect&#8221; in relation to his participation in a demonstration organized to protest against 
forced evictions in April 2005. He was reportedly released on 18 June 2006 and was told that he 
would have to return for further questioning at a later date. It is also reported that, in the spring 
of 2005, Mr. Zhengyou applied for a permit for the local farmers to hold the peaceful 
demonstration mentioned above but the request was denied. It is further reported that on 
20 April 2005, when he tried to submit a petition outlining local farmers&#8217; grievances, several 
villagers were beaten and detained by the authorities for &#8220;disorderly conduct&#8221; and &#8220;obstruction 
of traffic&#8221;. Allegedly, he has been detained and beaten by the police several times over the past 
decades for his activism. Concern was expressed that the above-mentioned events are connected 
with Mr. Zhengyou&#8217;s peaceful activities in defence of human rights, and particularly with his 
efforts to protect the rights of farmers in Zigong, who were allegedly forcibly evicted from their 
land and houses, and deprived of their livelihood without proper consultations, fair 
compensations and compliance with the provisions contained in international legal instruments. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>19. By letter dated 21 August 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal sent 
on 28 June 2006 by the Special Rapporteur with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. The Government 
after carefully investigating the matter stated that on numerous occasions Mr. Zhengyou sought 
to organize illegal meetings and disrupt traffic, and that the Huidong branch of the Zigong Public 
Security Bureau opened an investigation concerning Mr. Zhengyou as a suspect in connection 
with an illegal demonstration. Reportedly, when he tried to leave the country from Beijing in 
June 2006, he was a suspect in a criminal investigation that had just been opened by the public 
security authorities, which prohibited him from leaving the country according to article 8, 
paragraph 1, of the Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on Control of the Entry and Exits of 
Citizens. Acting in accordance with the law, the Zigong Public Security Bureau brought him 
back so that the investigation could be concluded. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>20. While the Special Rapporteur appreciates the response from the Government to the joint 
communication dated 28 June 2006, he is not entirely satisfied as not all concerns raised in the 
joint communication have been addressed. Furthermore, he regrets that at the time of the 
finalization of this report, the Government had not transmitted any reply to his communications 
dated 5 April 2005 and 14 December 2005.

escuela del recinto de La Yuca, obligando as&#237; a decenas de ni&#241;os a desalojar sus aulas. Adem&#225;s, 
seg&#250;n se alega, durante el desalojo la polic&#237;a utiliz&#243; excavadoras para destruir las viviendas, 
tanquetas antidisturbios y tambi&#233;n bombas lacrim&#243;genas para impedir cualquier concentraci&#243;n 
de los moradores. Al menos 12 viviendas, incluyendo la escuela, habr&#237;an sido destruidas. 
Tampoco se permiti&#243; la entrada de personas, defensores o abogados que pudieran ser testigos de 
estos actos. Se afirma que la orden del desalojo fue dada por el intendente de polic&#237;a, luego de 
que, seg&#250;n el Gobernador de Los R&#237;os, la orden fuera emitida por el Director del Instituto 
Nacional de Desarrollo Agrario (INDA). De acuerdo con los informes recibidos, este conflicto se 
inici&#243; hace nueve a&#241;os cuando el Instituto de Reforma Agraria y Colonizaci&#243;n (IERAC) fue 
sustituido por el INDA, el cual legaliz&#243; a favor de los herederos de una persona de apellido 
Pimentel Delgado una extensi&#243;n de 4.600 ha de tierra que corresponde al recinto La Yuca, entre 
otros. Las familias desalojadas al parecer tienen escrituras otorgadas por el IERAC, que fueron 
pagadas al banco y que han servido por a&#241;os a la obtenci&#243;n de cr&#233;ditos con el Banco Nacional de 
Fomento, pero que no son reconocidas por el INDA, aunque adem&#225;s &#233;stas pagan los respectivos 
impuestos en el municipio de Palenque.

<p>24. On 15 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint letter with the Representative of 
the Secretary-General on human rights of internally displaced persons and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, 
regarding alleged violations of the human rights of the various indigenous groups. According to 
information received, some of the Suri, Dizi, Mursi, Me&#8217;en and Nyangatom peoples have been 
forcibly removed from their traditional lands and territories, which fall within the boundaries of 
the Omo and Mago National Parks, which were established during the 1960s and 1970s, but 
whose bordering process began only last year. These communities used to gather, cultivate and 
herd their cattle within the parks due to their fertility and proximity of a river flood. The dry 
weather of the region and the recent prohibition of gathering food from those parks may not 
allow access to sufficient and adequate food and could render them dependant on food aid. 
Additional information states that the indigenous peoples have been threatened and forced by 
military officials to give their written consent to the new boundaries. It is also alleged that some 
indigenous villages have been burned in order to force residents to move to new lands and to 
prevent their return. Also information received alleges that Guji and Core peoples have been 
forcibly relocated outside the NechaSar National Park, with inadequate compensation. This 
relocation has been very harmful for these peoples since families were jeopardized and were 
forced by government officials to sign their agreement with their displacement. Allegedly, in 
February 2004, some villages were burned, again forcing residents to leave and preventing their 
return. Information received alleges that the parks will be managed by African Parks Foundation, 
which recently informed the affected communities that it will allow them to live within the 
boundaries only if they do not hunt wild animals. The Government was called upon to open 
avenues for constructive dialogue with all concerned parties, in order to find a long-term 
sustainable solution.

<p>28. On 11 September 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter regarding forced evictions 
carried out in Malabo which have allegedly left some 300 families homeless, as well as other 
development-based evictions. According to information received, on 22 and 23 July 2006, forced 
evictions accompanied by indiscriminate destruction of peoples&#8217; homes and possessions were 
carried out in the neighbourhoods of Atepa and Camaremy, in the Banapa district of Malabo, 
allegedly under the presence of government officials, civilian authorities, armed soldiers and 
police officers. Residents who protested against the demolition were ill-treated and intimidated 
by soldiers. Reportedly, one of the residents was arrested and briefly detained at Malabo central 
police station for protesting the demolition of his home. It is reported that these demolitions and 
evictions were carried out without consultation, prior notice or eviction orders and with no 
opportunities for residents to contest them. Reportedly, some residents who were absent, having 
gone to work, were unable to save their belongings. Many families were left homeless without 
any adequate alternative accommodation or any compensation for their loss offered to them. 
Concerns have been expressed that, because of lack of consultation, due process and security of 
tenure, thousands of families in Malabo and Bata are at risk of being evicted. It is further 
reported that the country is experiencing pressure on the land for commercial purposes and 
luxury housing, and that the authorities have undertaken a programme of rehabilitation of the 
main cities and infrastructure, expressing their intention to demolish shanty towns. According to 
reports, many of the houses demolished in the last two to three years were solid structures in 
well-established neighbourhoods and the vast majority of the occupants had titles to the land. 
Furthermore, it is reported that, in April 2006, residents of Comandachina who all had land titles, 
in Bata, were given three months to demolish their homes and build two to three storey houses 
instead, or leave the area apparently needed to build a supermarket, while others were simply 
instructed to leave. Also in the neighbourhoods of Atepa and Camaremy government officials 
reportedly began marking houses for demolition to build a road. However the section of the road 
has already been built and these houses are located 80 to 90 metres away from it. </p>

<p>30. On 7 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
the Special Rapporteur on human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to food, concerning environmental activists and human rights 
defenders involved with Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA - Save Narmada Movement), and in 
particular NBA&#8217;s leaders, Ms Medha Patkar, Mr. Jamsing Nargave and Ms. Bhagwatibai 
Jatpuria. Concerns are expressed regarding the impact of increasing water levels in the 
Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada River, and particularly about the most recent developments 
in this respect. According to information received on 8 March 2006, the Narmada Control 
Authority (NCA) took a decision to raise the height of the above-mentioned dam, which 
contravenes the judgement of the Supreme Court of India in 2000 according to which any further 
increase in height was to be linked to the implementation of resettlement and rehabilitation 
measures, and would allegedly result in the violation of a range of human rights of an estimated 
24,241 families in 177 villages of Madhya Pradesh. Reportedly, neither adequate rehabilitation 
nor alternative agricultural land has been provided for those affected, many of them indigenous 
peoples and farmers, leaving them homeless when submergence hits. Where land has been 
allotted, it is allegedly uncultivable and inadequate. The Resettlement and Rehabilitation 
Sub-group of NCA, the primary authority to assess the situation, has reportedly not visited the 
submergence area since November 2000, and the Grievance Redressal Authorities in the three 
concerned states are not functioning as expected in the light of the 2000 Supreme Court 
judgement. According to estimates from civil society organizations, there are at least another 
10,000 families, who were affected the previous time the water level of the dam was raised, that 
are still not rehabilitated. An indefinite sit-in (dharna) by over 300 dam-affected persons and 
activists of NBA in New Delhi since 17 March, demanding a halt to construction at the 
Sardar Sarovar dam has been taking place, and 3 NBA activists are on indefinite fast 
since 29 March 2006. Concern is expressed regarding the intervention by the Indian police force 
with respect to NBA activists on the night of 5 April 2006, when according to allegations, more 
than 300 police officials used force described as indiscriminate. Further reports claim that 
Ms. Medha Patkar and Mr. Jasming Nargave, who were on their eighth day of indefinite fast 
were arrested and over 25 activists were also detained, using excessive and disproportionate 
violence. The Government was urged to act immediately to ensure that the dam height is not 
raised without measures being taken to provide just and proper resettlement of all the affected. 
</p><p>31. On 11 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint letter with the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
regarding an incident of violence between Jat and Dalit communities in Gohana, Sonepat district 
of Haryana state, in August-September 2005, resulting in the burning of houses and loss of 
property belong to members of the Dalit community. According to information received, a </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/18/Add.1 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>dispute took place on 27 August 2005 between members of the two communities mentioned 
above that resulted in the death of one member of the Jat community. Four Dalits were 
immediately arrested by the police and charged, and a manhunt was organized to arrest the 
remaining alleged responsible people. Reportedly, the next day a Maha Panchayat (a Grand 
Caste court) was conveyed by the Jat community, threatening the authorities with an ultimatum 
saying that, if within 48 hours, the suspects were not apprehended and brought to justice, the Jats 
would burn the entire Balmiki Basti (Dalit district), near Samata Chowk, Gohana. Fearing 
reprisals, some 1,500 to 2,000 Dalits fled their houses by 30 August. On 31 August, while a 
second Maha Panchayat was taking place, a group of 1,500 to 2,000 armed persons of the Jat 
community entered the district and burned 55 to 60 houses, stealing and destroying valuables. 
Reportedly, about 150 to 200 policemen were present on the scene and did not react. According 
to reports received, several measures have been taken to redress the situation, including the 
reconstruction of burnt houses at government cost, helping children in the affected families to get 
back to schools and organizing nutritional programmes for children under the age of 5. It is 
alleged that while the Government claims to have paid Rs. 100,000 (Lakh) compensation 
to 55 affected families, local Dalits contest this claim. Allegedly, a probe by the Central Bureau 
of Investigation (CBI) was ordered but the report into the incident describes it as a simple case of 
arson letting many who were involved not indicted.<b>

on 11 May 2006 by the Special Rapporteur with the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. The Government reported 
that the Government of Haryana state has instituted an inquiry by the CBI to investigate the 
incident, and that various additional steps had been taken. A case has been filed against the 
23 accused and 4 have been arrested by the police, the Deputy Superintendent of Police and 
Sub-Inspector of Police have been suspended as departmental action is being taken against them, 
and compensation has been offered to the affected families. The 54 houses which were identified 
as severely affected have been reconstructed and an ad hoc grant of Rs. 100,000 has been given 
to each of these 54 families. A departmental grant of Rs. 275,000 has been given to 55 other 
persons affected, an amount of Rs. 200,000 had been distributed as daily allowances and 
Rs. 33.26 lakh has been given to 144 families for loss of their belongings during the riots. 
Furthermore, those who have left their houses at the time of the incident have returned to their 
homes. The National Human Rights Commission of India has taken suo-motu cognizance of the 
incident, appreciating the sensitivity and promptness shown by the State Government of Haryana 
in awarding compensation, repairing/reconstructing of the houses for the victims and taking 
action against those responsible for the incident.

<p>34. On 27 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the 
Special Rapporteur on the right to food, concerning the situation of more than 500,000 informal 
landowners in urban and rural areas, in different parts of Indonesia, including in those 
areas related to East Jakarta Canal project, the Pluit Dam project in Muara Baru and the 
Manggarai-Jatinegara-Cakung-Bekasi project. According to the information received, the 
implementation of Presidential Regulation 36/2005 on the Provision of Land for the 
Implementation of Public Interest Development threatens the access to land and livelihoods of 
the above-mentioned people, and may lead to mass forced evictions in relation to the 
above-mentioned projects. Allegedly, this Regulation widens the scope for revoking land titles 
and acquiring land for public projects. It also provides for compensatory programmes for those 
affected but only for those landowners who carry land certificates, are in possession of complete 
documentation and agree with the proposed compensation package, which is based on the selling 
price of taxed properties, reportedly below market price. Additionally, landowners shall have the 
right to complain within a set time frame if they do not agree with the proposed compensation. 
However, the relevant authorities retain the power to immediately evict people, whilst the case is 
pending in court. The information received alleges that this could result in the eviction without 
compensation of those landowners without valid land titles, whom are said to represent a 
majority particularly in rural areas where access to land and natural resources is often regulated 
by customary law. This land guarantees their access to an adequate standard of living as well as 
to livelihoods, as they use it to grow products for personal consumption or sale at markets.

<p>36. On 30 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter concerning reported threats of 
eviction of the family of Mr. Muhammad Is&#8217;hac and Ms. Yousra Herbawi including their six 
children, one of whom is severely disabled. According to information received, the municipality 
of Jerusalem is preparing to evict this family, who has almost no income and fears being left 
destitute, and to demolish their house in the Abu Tour neighbourhood in East Jerusalem. 
Reportedly, the family built their home in 1989 and was ordered the following year to pay a fine 
(which they did) and to either get a building permit or have their home demolished. When the 
municipality finally issued a building plan for the area in 2004, the house reportedly did not meet 
the exact specifications, even though up to then the family had spent significant sums of money 
to prepare and present building plans to the municipality. Reportedly, on 30 April 2006, the 
Jerusalem municipal court requested at a hearing that the house be demolished, and that the 
family pay a fine of 30,000 shekels. The court&#8217;s decision was expected on 7 June 2006. 
Furthermore, reports indicate a broader pattern of forced evictions and demolitions of Palestinian </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/18/Add.1 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>homes in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and elsewhere in the Occupied Territories on the 
grounds that homes have been built without a permit. Allegedly, the Israeli authorities have 
pursued a policy of limiting new construction in the Palestinian neighbourhoods since the 
occupation of East Jerusalem in 1967, obligating Palestinians to obtain a building permit from 
the Israeli army, which is almost impossible to obtain, if they want to build on their own land. 
Many are compelled to build without a permit having no other way to provide shelter for their 
families, only to then have their houses demolished. Allegedly, more than 2,000 Palestinian 
homes in the West Bank have been demolished in the past 10 years, reports indicating an 
increase in the past year, in addition to an estimated 160 in East Jerusalem since 2004, leaving 
500 individuals homeless, and 240 between 1999 and 2003. The Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights has urged Israel &#8220;to cease the practices of &#8230; demolishing houses and 
carrying out arbitrary evictions&#8221; and &#8220;to take immediate steps to respect and implement the right 
to an adequate standard of living, including housing, of the Palestinian residents of East 
Jerusalem &#8230;&#8221; (E/C.12/1/Add.90).

<p>37. On 19 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, 
concerning the alleged intention of destroying an indigenous Bedouin village, al-Sira, in the 
Negev (Southern Israel). The report indicated that half of the 160,000 indigenous Bedouin 
people in the Negev live in seven Government-planned towns without secure land tenure or 
sufficient development opportunities. The remainder live in 45 villages, among which is al-Sira, 
that do not appear on the official maps of Israel, are unrecognized by the Government, and do 
not receive basic services. The al-Sira community, located near the Nevatim Air Force Base, 
includes 350 indigenous people in 50 houses. Allegedly, they have been living in the area for 
generations, which is apparently proven by a number of documents of land acquisition dating 
back to the Ottoman period and by remaining works of infrastructure. It is reported that after 
Israel adopted &#8220;The Negev Land Acquisition (Peace Treaty with Egypt) Law&#8221; in 1980, which 
allowed for the expropriation of the village lands for the purpose of establishing the Nevatim Air 
Force Base, Israeli authorities allegedly declared all of the village lands to be a military zone, 
although lying outside the base. Residents were reportedly neither informed nor consulted about 
this decision. Furthermore, the information received alleges that police officers and officials 
from the Ministry of the Interior have posted warning notices of imminent house demolitions, in 
practice meaning that all houses of the village are to be destroyed. Community members have 
reportedly made several attempts to find a negotiated solution with the authorities. It is reported 
that on 4 June 2006, they were told by the commander of the base that there is no plan to enlarge 
the base in the direction of the village. On 6 June 2006, a meeting was held with the construction 
inspector of the Ministry of the Interior, who promised to hold the demolition for three months 
but no alternate housing solution was proposed. Moreover, on 8 June and 7 July 2006, the 
Bedouin Authority held meetings with community members but no solution was proposed to the 
people facing eviction. It is further alleged that the Government hopes to resettle the indigenous 
community in the townships by demolishing their houses, considered illegal, and by not 
providing avenues for alternative legal construction within the village. Reportedly, the Minister 
of the Interior announced at the Parliament, on 30 May 2006, that during the past three years, 
authorities demolished 560 houses in the unrecognized villages. It is reported that those 
demolitions have rendered thousands of people homeless, who now live in overcrowded 
conditions with their relatives, while some have built shacks from scrap. It is alleged that, most </p>

hidroel&#233;ctrico &quot;La Parota&quot; que consiste en construir una central hidroel&#233;ctrica en unas 17.000 ha 
de bienes mayoritariamente comunales y ejidales, y pretende explotar las aguas de los r&#237;os

(17 ejidos, 3 bienes comunales y 1 propiedad privada) y desplazando a m&#225;s de 25.000 personas. 
De acuerdo a la informaci&#243;n recibida, la construcci&#243;n del proyecto se viene planeando

irregularidades. Durante los &#250;ltimos meses de 2005 el conflicto entre las comunidades afectadas 
y las autoridades se ha agudizado, habi&#233;ndose registrado enfrentamientos en tres ocasiones, entre 
agosto y diciembre, dejando en cada uno m&#225;s de diez heridos. </p>

<p>40. Por carta de fecha 13 de julio de 2006, el Gobierno respondi&#243; al llamamiento urgente 
solicitado juntamente con el Relator Especial sobre el derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n el 30 de marzo 
de 2006. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el proyecto hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota consiste 
en la construcci&#243;n de una central generadora de energ&#237;a el&#233;ctrica, cuyo objetivo ser&#225; cubrir la 
demanda de energ&#237;a el&#233;ctrica en la zona de mayor consumo en el pa&#237;s prevista para 2014. 
La elaboraci&#243;n de este proyecto ha sido particularmente cuidadosa de respetar los derechos 
humanos de todos los afectados. La CFE ha pospuesto la construcci&#243;n y licitaci&#243;n del proyecto 
hasta que se obtenga la plena aceptaci&#243;n de los n&#250;cleos agrarios, se resuelvan los cuatro 
procedimientos administrativos iniciados en contra de la construcci&#243;n del proyecto por parte de 
los opositores y se negocien los pagos de indemnizaci&#243;n con las comunidades afectadas. 
Se afirma que en la regi&#243;n donde se construir&#225; el proyecto, la actividad principal es la agricultura 
rudimentaria donde la generaci&#243;n de alternativas de desarrollo sea limitada. Los pobladores 
padecen de pobreza extrema, marginaci&#243;n, altos &#237;ndices de analfabetismo y falta de empleos. Sin 
embargo, la construcci&#243;n del proyecto constituir&#237;a un potencial para el desarrollo de diversas 
nuevas actividades que en conjunto les permitir&#237;a mejorar sus actividades econ&#243;micas, 
garantizando su derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n y vivienda adecuada. Independientemente de la 
derrama econ&#243;mica, La Parota permitir&#237;a la generaci&#243;n de 5.000 empleos directos y una cantidad 
similar de empleos indirectos. Por otra parte, durante la elaboraci&#243;n del proyecto, una de las 
prioridades fue el cuidado al medio ambiente. La CFE ha desarrollado con la participaci&#243;n de 
diversas instituciones un conjunto de acciones que permitir&#225;n resarcir las afectaciones que 
provoque el proyecto, adem&#225;s de promover el desarrollo sostenido y sustentable de la regi&#243;n. 
Durante el proceso, tambi&#233;n se puede destacar la implementaci&#243;n del Plan de Desarrollo Integral 
que permitir&#225; establecer, en el marco de un proceso participativo con las poblaciones, las 
alternativas econ&#243;micas, sociales y ambientales en los nuevos centros de poblaci&#243;n definidos 
conjuntamente que aseguren una mejor calidad de vida a los habitantes. A efecto de mantener 
informada a la poblaci&#243;n de la naturaleza del proyecto, sus impactos y beneficios, los alcances 
sociales econ&#243;micos y ambientales derivados de su construcci&#243;n y el posible desarrollo de la 
regi&#243;n, se han realizado m&#225;s de un centenar de reuniones informativas. De diciembre de 2004 a 
diciembre de 2005, se realizaron 19 asambleas en las comunidades y ejidos que ser&#237;an afectados, 
obteni&#233;ndose en ellas la anuencia de los pobladores. No obstante cuatro de ellas fueron 
impugnadas por los opositores y se est&#225; en espera de que se resuelvan los procedimientos. 
Finalmente, la CFE ha difundido entre diversos actores de varios niveles, tanto civiles, 
gubernamentales, no gubernamentales, como ciudadan&#237;a nacional e internacional, informaci&#243;n 
al respecto de las acciones del proyecto y los beneficios que traer&#225; en la regi&#243;n, pero sobre todo 
ha procurado dejar claro que en todo momento ha mostrado respeto absoluto a los derechos 
humanos de los afectados.

<p>42. On 9 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning recent allegedly 
forced evictions and demolitions in Abuja and other locations, in the Federal Capital Territory. 
According to information received, evictions and demolitions in Abuja communities and other 
settlements, including the municipality of Gwagwalada, have taken place since 2003-2004, by 
the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) allegedly resulting in an estimated 800,000 
displaced and homeless persons, in nine communities of both informal and formal settlements. 
Reportedly, these have often been conducted with disproportionate use of force, with little or no 
prior notice to the inhabitants, without proper consultation, and that no adequate alternative 
accommodation or compensation has been provided to the affected people. It is further indicated 
that courts have issued injunctions against some of the Abuja demolitions, but that these were 
disregarded by the FCDA. Reports claim that these evictions are justified by the FCDA as being 
part of the belated implementation of the 1979 Abuja Master Plan, which includes planned 
measures for the &#8220;beautification&#8221; of the Federal Capital City. For this purpose, the Government 
has allegedly nullified allocation documents and title deeds issued by the former authorities. It is 
further alleged that the main actual causes of these actions are real estate investment interests and 
privatization, and that private real estate developers have assumed the key role in rebuilding on 
the demolished sites. Evictions allegedly began taking place on a mass scale when the present 
Federal Capital Territory Minister took office in 2003. A total of 49 settlement areas are 
reportedly earmarked for demolition. Particular concern was expressed about the reports 
received in the light of information received in the past on alleged forced evictions, including in 
the Makoko community of Lagos in late April 2005.<b>

<p>44. On 17 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of 
the Lyari Expressway Project, allegedly due to render over 250,000 people homeless when 
completed. The Special Rapporteur drew attention to the previous communications raising 
concern over forced evictions and homelessness as a result of the implementation of this project, 
expressing concern about recent reports indicating that demolition of houses and related forced 
evictions have lately resumed with increased intensity. According to information received, in 
January 2007, the city government completed the demolition of Allah Wala colony, Jamshed 
town of Karachi, where more than 400 houses reportedly were demolished. Reportedly, between 
14 February 2006 and 10 March, 1,000 informal dwellings and 650 houses were demolished 
allegedly without prior notice or compensation by the local administrations in Korangi Town, 
New Karachi, and on the opposite side of the main gate of the Karachi University. It is further 
reported that on 13 March, in Gulshan-e-Iqbal town of Karachi, 1,250 houses were demolished, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/18/Add.1 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>the eviction taking place without prior notice, many families losing their basic household goods, 
and the police using excessive force, including the use of tear gas. According to the reports, the 
Government had declared the 30-year-old settlement illegal and justified the eviction by the fact 
that the settlement was located on one of the main water supply pipelines. However, allegedly 
there are also many other high-rise buildings illegally constructed on the same pipeline which 
were left untouched. The city government announced that it will continue to demolish this 
village at any cost. It is further reported that a new wave of forced evictions was initiated on 
5 May when more than 250 houses were demolished in Sikander Goth, while 750 more are 
expected within the near future. No prior notice has been given to the affected households, and 
no compensation or rehabilitation plans have been proposed. Allegedly, the Karachi district 
governments used police forces to disperse a demonstration against the eviction, resulting in 
2 deaths, 51 people injured, and several arrests. Moreover, this allegedly contravenes the laws of 
the Pakistan Constitution, and particularly the decisions of the Sindh High Court of June and 
October 2003, according to which the National Highway Authority, the Government of the Sindh 
Province and the District Government of Karachi should review the design of this project so as 
to ensure that the number of affected was kept to a minimum. It is further reported that the Sindh 
Assembly has criticized the demolition of communities, that the Chief Minister of the province 
announced in the Sindh assembly on 28 April that there should be no further demolitions, and 
that the City Government Council condemned the demolitions. Concern was particularly 
expressed about reports according to which the Karachi City Government is planning to, in the 
near future, demolish and evict inhabitants of another 6,000 housing units in 20 different 
informal settlements throughout the city.

<p>45. On 13 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, concerning 12 Ahmadiya families from Jhando Sahi 
village in Daska Tehsil. According to the information received, on 24 June 2006, a group of 
unidentified individuals attacked an area inhabited by a dozen Ahmadiya families in this village, 
forcing the families to leave. The group acting on as yet unsubstantiated claims that Ahmadiya 
youths had burned copies of the Koran, injured two people, burned down the community&#8217;s place 
of worship, two shops and a number of houses. The District Police have charged four Ahmadiya 
youths with desecrating the Koran, however, no charges have been brought in connection with 
the attack. The families have been informed by the police that they are not allowed to visit their 
village and to go back to their houses without prior permission.

<p>46. By letter dated 12 October 2006, the Government replied to the joint urgent appeal 
sent with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, on 11 May 2006. The 
Government reported that on 24 June 2006, some Qadiyanis allegedly set on fire some pages of 
the Holy Koran which was witnessed by some Muslim villagers in the area. Consequently, the 
villagers gathered and took out the protest procession and caused damage to the property of 
Qadiyanis. A case was registered and the two nominated accused were arrested while two others 
are yet to be. For their own safety, the district police shifted the Qadiyani families to a safer 
place. Cases have been registered by the local police against 25 nominated and 33 unknown 
persons for the damage caused to the properties of the Qadiyani families. In a meeting with 
the DCO Sialkot, the representatives and residents of the area ensured that they would cooperate </p>

alleged impact on the communities, to meet with all parties concerned by this project, and 
through concerted negotiations, try to bring, if necessary, practical solutions.

<p>48. On 13 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter concerning forced evictions, house 
demolitions and relocations in connection with the development of the North-South rail project. 
According to information received, in the first quarter of 2005, large scale demolitions related 
to the North rail line affected 8,500 families living along the tracks, located in Malabon, 
Caloocan and Valenzuela, in the Metro Manila area. Reportedly, from April to December 2005, 
22,104 families living in informal settlements along the Philippines National Railways (PNR) 
track in various municipalities in the province of Bulacan have been forcibly evicted. 
Reportedly, additional forced evictions took place from January to April 2006, affecting 
3,000 families of urban poor communities in Makati. It is alleged that further evictions of 
communities living in informal settlements along the PNR track are planned and will affect up 
to 16,000 families. According to the information reported, only one relocation site that can only 
accommodate 4,000 families has been identified for the affected communities of the South rail 
line implementation, leaving 15,000 other families without an identified or developed relocation 
site. In accordance with the Urban Development Housing (UDH) Act, reportedly, no eviction of 
urban poor communities can take place unless a proper relocation site is provided, defined as 
providing among others, access to safe drinking water and sanitation, proximity to the workplace 
and other sources of livelihood. Allegedly, the Government has pursued in relation to this project 
a &#8220;voluntary relocation&#8221; programme, under which a Government proposal is given without 
alternative, and if it is not accepted the affected families lose the housing slots in the relocation 
sites with no other compensation. It is further reported that no consultations have been or are 
being conducted with the affected. Allegedly, around 25 to 30 per cent of the affected families 
are not included in the Government relocation programme because they were not present during 
the census and the data has not been updated. It is further reported that those who had not been 
taken into account were asked to submit documents proving their eligibility to the programme, 
but due to difficulties related to the processing of documents and to bureaucratic obstacles, most 
people did not finish the registration process. Moreover, it is alleged that the names of persons 
who are not railway occupants have been inserted while structure owners have been excluded. It 
is also reported that nine relocation sites have been identified and developed for those affected 
by the North rail line, and that 18,054 families have been relocated, yet it is alleged that the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/18/Add.1 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>conditions do not meet the UDH Act. These allegedly lack basic services and facilities, are more 
exposed to illness, face more difficulties to find a source of income since they are situated very 
far from the original site, lack security of tenure in the relocation sites, and the amount given to 
construct the houses on the sites is insufficient. Reportedly, they are forced to live in tents, and 
use the money given for food subsistence to continue the construction, leaving some families 
with lack of resources for food. In some cases families are forced to give up allocated lots and go 
back to another informal settlement in the city. The Special Rapporteur restated his readiness to 
carry out a mission to the country this year (2006). 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received

<p>49. By letter dated 19 July 2006, the Government replied to the letter sent on 13 July 2006 by 
the Special Rapporteur acknowledging receipt of the communication and stated that it would be 
duly forwarded to the authorities to be carefully studied. By letter dated 24 July 2006, the 
Government sent a second letter informing that concerned authorities are in need of more time to 
conduct appropriate consultations before an invitation to the Special Rapporteur could be issued. 
</p>
<p>50. By letter dated 29 November 2006, the Government sent a response to the letter sent 
on 13 July 2006 by the Special Rapporteur. According to their report, socio-economic realities of 
informal settlers along the rail tracks were closely woven into policies to pursue a more just 
definition of relocation, which is realistic and attuned to the needs as well as to the aspirations of 
communities in relation to a better and liveable life. According to declared policy of the 
National Housing Authority (NHA), they aim: to achieve the humane, peaceful and orderly 
relocation of informal settlers currently living along the railway tracks, using a flexible policy; to 
limit the burden of relocation of the affected by providing subsidy where possible and practical; 
to ensure minimum dislocation in terms of economics and community relations by adopting the 
in-city/in-town approach where possible and practical; to protect the rights of the affected 
families, by adhering to a beneficiary led site selection, to be discussed by the Local Inter-agency 
Committee (LIAC), a multiple organization body, while remaining consistent with human rights 
protection; to provide support to the affected in terms of community facilities, electricity and 
water; and to manage the actual relocation, in a humane, orderly and peaceful manner supported 
by technical services and providing guidance from the NHA. Reportedly, the relocation strategy 
and process consists of a social preparation phase, a relocation and resettlement phase, and a 
post-resettlement and integration phase. The first consists of preparatory activities such as 
reconnaissance survey, information dissemination, community consultation, census and tagging, 
and the creation of LIAC. During the second, the affected households are presented with a 
&#8220;menu of options&#8221;, including serviced lots in NHA resettlement areas, or &#8220;Balik Probinsiya&#8221;, 
resettlement to other areas, and equity for land purchase elsewhere or livelihood assistance. 
Relocation Action Centres were established at the point of origin and resettlement sites. At the 
point of origin RAC, applications are processed and the Entry Pass and other documents are 
secured for those to be resettled, the initial Home Material Loan (HML), Php 10,000, and the 
food assistance, Php 1,000, are released, and for those availing the &#8220;Balik Probinsiya&#8221; options, 
assistance is issued there. At the resettlement site RAC, the second component of HML, 
Php 40,000, is released, and NHA relocators inform and direct the households to their designated 
lot assignments. During the final phase, community facilities and social services are set up, 
livelihood assistance is provided by the implementation of programmes towards augmenting 
family income of settlers, and also an office for community relations information orients and 
listens to the affected families&#8217; problems. It is further reported that the voluntary movement is </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/18/Add.1 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>evidenced by the free execution of the beneficiaries of waivers in understandable language, the 
Loan Agreement and the Home Material Loan Agreement, and the possibility of taking &#8220;Balik 
Probinsiya&#8221;. Reportedly, the site for the affected communities of the South Rail line contains 
8,003 lots and is fully occupied, while other properties are being considered as resettlement sites 
in various places, including 1,900 more lots for the above-mentioned plot. All matters 
concerning beneficiary award are decided at the Local Inter-agency Committee (LIAC) 
composed of representatives of various government, non-governmental and people&#8217;s 
organizations. The Government states that the &#8220;accredited people&#8217;s organizations are therefore 
responsible to ensure that the interest and issues of their members would be addressed in the 
said Committee&#8221;. On the question of the security of tenure, the Government states that the 
lease-purchase agreement was specifically designed to address the current economic condition of 
the beneficiaries. Concerning the relocation sites, it is stated that for the Bulacan and the 
Valenzuela segment, relocation sites are at no more than five kilometres from the original 
colony. As for the Caloocan segment, prices in that region did not permit an immediate 
relocation, thus the relocation site is in Towerville in Bulacan. The Malabon segment 
beneficiaries might have been relocated in Valenzuela which is near their original colony; 
however with the dissent of the Mayor of Valenzuela, Towerville had to be resorted to as an 
alternative.

<p>52. On 7 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint letter with the Independent Expert on 
Minority Issues, regarding the situation of the Roma minority community in Northwest Federal 
District, in particular the towns of Kaliningrad and Arkhangel&#8217;sk, where they are facing serious 
and targeted discrimination and forced evictions. According to information received, it is 
reported that Roma face many registration problems, even refusal to be registered by the 
authorities, and without this they are denied access to medical care, education, employment, 
social security, social services and housing. Reportedly, the Kaliningrad administration created 
Doroznhy village especially for Roma following a 1956 decree in order to force them to settle, 
get registered and start working on Kolkhoz-type collective farms. This village allegedly has 
never had basic living facilities (roads, waste disposal, schools, etc.). In the years 2000 and 2001, 
the inhabitants brought cases to the court in order to get their houses recognized as private 
property, allegedly receiving offers from the court and the administration of the Guryevsky 
district, to develop a general reconstruction plan for the village, which would include basic 
services. It is further reported that the General Prosecutor of the Kaliningrad province intervened 
and requested that the registration of the houses in Dorokhny be stopped, arguing that the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/18/Add.1 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>situation over there was criminogenic. As a result, all social development was allegedly stopped 
and the majority of Roma could not receive any property certificate for their privately owned 
houses. According to information received, at the end of 2005, following the declaration of war 
on drug criminality by the Governor of Kaliningrad province, Georgi Boos, and the local State 
drug enforcement agency as well as the appearance of dozens of publications in the media 
describing the village as a notorious place for drug dealing, it was proposed to destroy a certain 
number of houses in the village. Reportedly, on 28 April 2006, 29 houses were destroyed with 
bulldozers in the village leaving Roma families including women, small children and babies 
homeless. It is also reported that some court decisions were taken regarding the illegality of the 
houses, thus authorizing their demolition, in the absence of the defendants, even though 
allegedly, some people charged had not received any summons or been informed about the 
demolition plans. With respect to the situation in Arkhangel&#8217;sk, according to information 
received, a group of Kelderash Roma families, representing over 100 people, arrived from 
Volgograd in 2004, following the obtainment of legal permission to rent the parcels of land 
located in the Noviposyolok region. The permit was reportedly signed by the city&#8217;s mayor at the 
time together with local authorities. Allegedly, a dispute on the Roma settlement was triggered 
following statements by the Mayor&#8217;s political opponent, who subsequently was elected Mayor, 
accusing him of corruption for permitting the Roma to settle there, as well as accusing the Roma 
of illegally building houses. Following his election the new Mayor continued his attacks. 
Reportedly, in November 2004, the Roma&#8217;s attorney won a court case by claiming that the 
construction of illegal houses is not sufficient reason to evict the people given that they had been 
legally granted the right to inhabit the properties. However, following another legal proceeding 
initiated by the new Mayor, the continued media campaign against them, and the bad living 
conditions, the families decided to leave the place. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>53. By letter dated 29 September 2006, the Government replied to the joint letter sent with the 
Independent Expert on Minority Issues, on 7 June 2006. The Government pointed out the 
Constitution of the Russian Federation, which establishes equal rights and opportunities for all 
citizens irrespective of ethnic affiliation, as well as the Housing Code, which states that central 
and local authorities must provide conditions for the realization by citizens of the right to 
housing, ensure the security and inviolability of housing, and prohibit arbitrary deprivation of 
housing (art. 1, para. 1), and that housing rights may be restricted by federal law only to the 
extent that this is necessary for the purpose of protecting the foundations of the constitutional 
order, public morals and health, and the rights and lawful interests of others, and ensuring 
national defence and State security (art. 1, para. 3). According to their report, the Department for 
Inter-Ethnic Relations in the Ministry of Regional Development held talks with the province&#8217;s 
Ministry of Culture, with a view to stabilizing the situation in Dorozhny. The Department 
analysed and took into account the assessments made of the situation and solutions proposed to it 
at the round table on &#8220;Enhancing the contribution of national voluntary associations to efforts to 
combat illicit drug trafficking&#8221; held by the Federal Autonomous Ethnic Cultural Organization of 
Russian Roma on 29 June 2006. Furthermore, the Ministry of Regional Development requested 
the Governor of Kaliningrad province to review the situation with respect to the Roma in the 
province and to take measures to improve it. The provincial government replied setting forth a 
number of reasons for the discord between the inhabitants of Dorozhny and the provincial 
administration, in particular that this community was characterized by the law enforcement 
agencies as a place in which narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances were sold, drug addicts </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/18/Add.1 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>congregated, and the majority of the population were engaged in illegal activities, including 
trading in stolen property and drug dealing. According to data from the Federal Drug Trafficking 
Control Service&#8217;s office for the Kaliningrad province, 158 cases of criminal activity involving 
illicit drug trafficking were uncovered in 2005, with criminal proceedings being brought in 125 
of these, and 61 persons being prosecuted. With regard to the demolition of buildings in the 
village, according to the information provided by the Minister for Housing, Public Utilities and 
Construction of the province, of the 46 structures concerned only 1 had been built legally and 
was categorized as a dwelling, while the remainder had been erected without official permits on 
plots of land not designated for construction. Since November 2005, the Gurevsky District Court 
has considered actions brought by the district administration in respect to 68 illegally erected 
structures, ruling in every case (until June 2006) for the demolition of the structure. No appeals 
were lodged, therefore the decisions entered into force. The relevant articles of the Civil Code 
and of the Federal Act on State Registration of Real Estate Rights and Transactions were 
presented. It was reported that citizens may not be registered by current address or place of 
residence at dwelling houses not approved for use, and that a person who builds an unauthorized 
structure does not acquire ownership rights to that structure. It was also noted that the provincial 
government earmarked more than 5.7 million roubles for the construction of dedicated housing 
in five municipalities in the province. However, the former inhabitants ignored all offers of 
housing in the municipalities in question. Moreover, concerning the situation in Arkhangel&#8217;sk, 
by order of the Mayor&#8217;s office in that city, in August 2004, a plot of land with an area of 
approximately 1.6 hectares was allocated in the Varavino-Faktoria area of the city for the 
construction of dwelling houses for 16 Roma families (135 persons) who had moved to the city 
from Volgograd province. Seventeen temporary structures were built there by Roma, and 
subsequently the Lomonosov District Court declared them to be unauthorized structures liable to 
demolition. On 29 September 2004, a land-use inspection revealed that a group of private houses 
had been built on this land without authorization. On account of the violations of the Land Code 
requirements (art. 32), the order of the First Deputy Mayor of 2 July 2004 was set aside by a 
subsequent order of 7 October 2004, and the August 2004 letter, concerning the assignment of a 
postal address to the structure in that area was rescinded. Reportedly, on 3 September 2004, the 
Internal Affairs Office for the Varavino-Faktoria area registered 48 ethnic Roma citizens for a 
period of one year, subsequently extended for a further year. These persons were also registered 
by place of residence in the cities of Kurgan and Volgograd. After the property at the address in 
question was declared unauthorized by the Civil Division of the Arkhangel&#8217;sk Provincial Court 
of 14 March 2005, the citizen&#8217;s registration at that address was terminated, without any violation 
of the procedure established for the registration of these citizens. A motion introduced at the 
District Court to have the 7 October 2004 order declared invalid was rejected on 8 August 2005. 
In accordance with various decisions of the district court, which have entered into force, the 
unauthorized structures were to be demolished. An application by an ethnic Roma for the 
assignment of a plot of land for individual construction failed to reach the Mayor&#8217;s Office. None 
of the Roma applied to be placed on the register of persons in need of housing, having decided to 
leave the city. With assistance form the Mayor&#8217;s Office, a bus was made available to convey 
them to the railway station, tickets were purchased for the train journey and nine motor vehicles 
were provided to transport their luggage. They were also given food for the journey and funds in 
the amount of 250,000 roubles to assist with their installation in their new place of residence. In 
addition, when the unauthorized structures were dismantled, the materials were sold and the 
money obtained was handed to the departing Roma. </p>

<p>54. While the Special Rapporteur appreciates the response from the Government to his 
communication, he is not entirely satisfied as not all concerns raised in his communication have 
been addressed. He hopes that continued dialogue will result in a resolution of the human rights 
situation being faced by the Roma communities affected. The Special Rapporteur continues to

<p>55. On 5 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint letter with the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
food, regarding an attack by security forces against a peaceful civilian gathering in Marawi 
on 22 April 2006, which reportedly resulted in the death of three civilians and serious injuries to 
numerous others. According to information received the incident happened following a gathering 
of villagers in Armi School held to discuss how the building of a dam in the area had affected 
their livelihood. While they were having breakfast in the schoolyard, at 11 a.m., security 
forces armed with machine guns and heavy artillery fired live ammunition into the crowd. The 
three men killed were Mr. Atta Al Sayed Al Khidir Al Mahi, aged 30, a farmer from Abu Haraze 
village, Mr. Yassin Mohamed Al Khair, aged 20, a farmer from Al Sor village, and Mr. Salah 
Al Faky Al Kheder, aged 27, a farmer from Alsweage village. Following the attack, three of the 
villagers were arrested, charged with waging war against the State, criminal mischief and assault. 
An inquiry was put forth with regard to the reasons that prompted the Government&#8217;s security 
forces to engage in such reported attack, and referral was made to the fundamental principles 
applicable to such an incident under international law. It is reported that the incident is related to 
the construction of a dam that has resulted in the displacement along the riverbanks of thousands 
of people, among which are the Amri people. These have allegedly been in negotiations with the 
Government over the past two years regarding resettlement sites. Reportedly, the project was 
carried out without prior consultation with the communities, and no provisions for compensation 
have been made for the loss of their houses and livelihoods. The Government is reportedly 
insisting that they be relocated in Baduya desert, an area they refuse to move to. 
</p>
<p>56. On 25 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint letter with the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the situation of Naser Eldien Ahmed 
Altayeb, a journalist working for the Arabic daily <i>Alayam</i>. According to the information 
received, on 16 August 2006, this journalist was arrested by the police, taken to a nearby 
vehicle and allegedly beaten by the police officers. As a result, he was hospitalized at the 
Khartoum Teaching Hospital. Naser Eldien was reporting on the forced relocation of residents in 
Dar al Salaam, Algazera province, mainly internally displaced persons from Southern Sudan and 
Darfur who have resided in the area for over two decades. Concerns have been expressed that the 
arrest and beating of this person occurred because of his activities in defence of human rights, in 
particular the right not to be forcibly evicted. </p>

<p>57. On 9 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint follow-up letter with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, regarding forced evictions 
of communities affected by the Merowe Dam project. According to information received the 
Merowe Dam is being developed by the Dam Implementation Unit with funding from various 
international private and Government donors with the help of various European companies. It is 
alleged that the Merowe Dam will displace more than 50,000 people, mainly from the Hamadab, 
Amri (in the Northern State) and Manasir peoples (in the Nile State). It is reported that, last 
April, a violent clash erupted between the Amri residents and the Dam Authorities when the 
Dam Authorities attempted to forcibly undertake a socio-economic survey, the results of which 
would set compensation levels for resettled communities. Information indicates that the residents 
were dissatisfied with the results and the negotiations between representatives of the 
communities and the Government, since it is alleged that on the basis of the survey completed on 
29 June two thirds of the affected people will be ineligible for any compensation. The residents 
of the Amri area are reportedly waiting for the question of compensation and the shortage of 
houses on the relocation site to be addressed prior to agreeing to resettle. In the relocation site, 
only half of the needed houses have been reportedly built and there is insufficient land to meet 
the legal resettlement entitlements of the affected communities. It is further alleged that 
Sudanese law requires that the loss of land that has been farmed for 10 years or more be 
compensated. Yet, the Dam Authorities have allegedly refused to compensate where land has 
been farmed for less than 20 years. Moreover, no or minimal compensation will be paid for the 
loss of livelihood such as fruit-bearing trees or for fodder crops. According to further 
information received, on 6 August, an adviser to the President and head of the Ministerial 
Committee responsible for negotiating with the Amri Community notified the representatives of 
the affected community that they had until 12 August to begin moving to the relocation site 
allocated by the Dam Authorities. Reportedly, on 7 August, a rise in the level of the Nile resulted 
in a flooding forcing 150 residents of an area, which allegedly has historically never been 
flooded, to flee to other villages and to higher plains in the area. Concerns have been expressed 
that the rise of the Nile was due to the intentional blockage of the eastern part of the Dam in 
order to force residents to evacuate the region, and it is reported that no warning of the flooding 
was given by the Merowe&#8217;s Dam Implementation Unit. While it has been stated that the rise in 
the Nile was a result of heavy rainfall in Ethiopia, it is reported that 1,500 homes in the Amri 
area were flooded before the increased water flows due to the heavy rains reached the area. 
Reportedly, the flooding continued on 12 August. Reportedly, up to 2,723 households have been 
forced to flee since the flooding of the Amri area began, with around 700 houses having been 
completely destroyed in the villages of Shikora, Al Bana, Um Haza, El Batareen, Um Kouk, 
El Khezian, Gerf El Doud, Al Aragoub, Al Ghananiem, Um Daras, Um Sarif and Al Galieha. 
Moreover, a further 380 houses have been damaged in the same villages on higher ground and 
are now in danger of collapse due to the floodwater. The flooding has allegedly left the affected 
villagers homeless, without shelter, water and food, and as a result of the flooding, fields were 
submerged, crops and fodder were destroyed and 12,000 heads of livestock have already died. It 
is alleged that the Government has not responded to the humanitarian needs of the displaced 
households. Reports state that many incidences of diarrhoea and an unknown type of fever have 
been reported as a result of mortal remains that are surfacing on the water in the flooded areas. 
Reports also indicate that access was denied to journalists and other persons to the region, 
impeding an independent assessment of the situation. It is reported that on 17 August, journalists 
were detained and interrogated in Nuri for their attempt to enter and report on the situation. </p>

<p>58. On 9 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint letter with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, regarding the forced evictions of the Dar Essalam 
communities in Khartoum from the informal settlements in El Jazeera State. According to 
recent information received, during the month of August of this year, the authorities have carried 
out forced evictions and demolitions affecting 3,200 families (around 12,000 persons) at the 
Dar Essalam camp, which has been in existence for over 20 years, offering shelter to internally 
displaced persons (IDPs), many from the Darfur region. These acts are reportedly in violation of 
a Memorandum of Understanding between the affected persons and the Al Kamleen Locality 
regarding a proposed resettlement plan. According to information received, the residents had 
agreed to be relocated, pending an agreement on an adequate alternative site. However, at around 
4 a.m. on 16 August 2006, armed police and special forces with tanks and vehicles with mounted 
machine guns forcibly evicted the residents using tear gas, and randomly demolished houses 
using bulldozers. Reportedly, as a result four people were killed including three children, many 
others were seriously injured, and members of the Dar Essalam Popular Committee were 
arrested. It is further reported that on 17 August, international observers were prevented from 
speaking to the residents and that the entire area was reduced to rubble. Allegedly, large trucks 
brought in by Government authorities, transported the affected and their belongings to the 
relocation site located five kilometres south-west of Dar Essalam, which had been reportedly 
objected to by the residents. No appropriate consultation had been carried out with the affected 
and no compensation has been foreseen. It is reported that the site lacks basic infrastructures, 
such as medical facilities for assistance and schools, and is surrounded by several factories 
raising concern about the presence of toxic waste and their impact on health. Concerns have been 
raised that the people have been left in open air with no access to adequate food, water and 
sanitation. Reportedly, no food or plastic sheets have been provided, which is particularly 
essential during the rainy season, and two cases of cholera and numerous cases of diarrhoea and 
malaria have been raised since the relocation. On 26 August, a United Nations joint assessment 
mission was prevented from entering the demolished site. It is also reported that the only 
documentation the affected were provided with for their designated plot was a scrap paper with 
the name of the plot holder, the date and the plot number, and that approximately 700 families 
were not allocated plots as the distribution by the authorities was stopped on 24 August, 
following unauthorized claims made by families from neighbouring villages. Concerns were 
expressed on the unfairness of the land distribution process and that land had been allocated to 
members of the police force. It is further reported that on 21 August, 13 members of the 
Dar Essalam Popular Committee were released on bail, after six days of detention, following 
intervention by a lawyer. According to one of the members, during the eviction he and other 
members were shot at, handcuffed and beaten with plastic hoses, then transferred to Kamleen 
locality where their personal belongings were confiscated. Reportedly, the police also lifted the 
immunity of one of the victims, who is a member of the Legislative Council in Al Jazeera State, 
subsequently charging him of obstructing public servants from performing duties of his office. It 
is further reported, for example, that in December 2004, authorities destroyed houses and 
buildings in Shikan settlement, relocating approximately 12,000 people to an area around 
55 kilometres north of Khartoum, know as El Fateh III. Information indicates that this is a 
desolate area that lacks basic services or the necessary infrastructure to cater for human needs. 
The harsh living conditions there forced many people to return to IDP camps and squatter 
settlements near Khartoum. On 16 and 17 August 2005, authorities again forcibly evicted 
700 families from Shikan relocating them in El Fateh III, where conditions are still grossly 
inadequate for human habitation. </p>

<p>60. On 31 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint letter with the Independent Expert on 
Minority Issues, regarding the situation of the Romani community of the Sulukule mahalles 
(Neslisah and Hatice Sultan) in the municipality of Faith, Istanbul, which has lived there since 
their arrival in the area in the eleventh century. According to the information received, this 
3,500 person Romani community is seriously concerned regarding the potentially highly 
negative effect on this historic community resulting from the municipality&#8217;s urban rehabilitation 
project, which will result in the demolition of the historic Romani neighbourhood. According to 
reports, in October 2005 the local authority considered measures to redevelop the area, and from 
a range of choices adopted, allegedly without consulting the community, or the community 
representatives, the decision to demolish the existing housing. The decision allegedly does not 
reflect the result of any feasibility study carried out by the municipal authorities. Since it was 
taken, there have reportedly been a number of meetings between members of the community and 
the municipality, however there has not been any resolution of concerns raised by the Romani, 
and the planned programme of demolition remains in place with work expected to begin in 
September 2006. Taking into account the long history of the community in the area, the 
community is asking for the decision to demolish the neighbourhood to be rescinded and for a 
programme of regeneration and urban renewal be considered instead. Information provided 
states that the community has been offered the opportunity to receive compensation for their loss 
of home and shelter, but that the cost of buying new property, even for those who own their 
current abode is prohibitive in the new apartment blocks that the developers will erect. Also 
there are problems raised by the title deeds and legal claims to these properties, as many of the 
families reportedly lack official documents. The families of the community are reportedly in 
need of urgent measures to alleviate social and health problems and the poverty that is a reality 
for the majority of the residents. Racial prejudice against them, along with the recent closure of 
the entertainment establishments that were the traditional sources of jobs, given that traditional 
music and dance remain part of the Romani culture and are still a vibrant and essential 
expression of Romani identity in this area, have led to a crisis level of unemployment. Less than 
1 in 10 of the adult population has any kind of work on a regular basis, and none have 
employment to provide security for their families. The lack of sufficient documentation results in 
most residents not being able to secure the so-called &#8220;green card&#8221; that would entitle them to 
basic State support and health care. Furthermore, the levels of basic education are minimal and 
the community lacks access to further education. The community has suggested that with careful 
consultation and planning, possibilities exist to see the social and economic improvement of the 
area, including its potential for growth as a heritage centre for Romani and others alike, offering 
traditional Romani music and dance, and new opportunities for employment and training. They 
suggest further consultation on such ideas and discussion about the community and its future that 
would provide a more harmonious resolution to the current situation. </p>

<p>62. Subsequent to his previous communications on mass evictions being carried out 
under Operation Murambatsvina in Zimbabwe (3 June 2005 and 19 August 2005, 
E/CN.4/2006/41/Add.1), on 21 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal 
with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders, regarding the situation of Mrs. Felistus Chinyuku, a 65-year-old human 
rights defender and former chairwoman of Porta Farm residents&#8217; committee, who spoke out 
against forced evictions that took place in 2004 and 2005. According to the information received, 
Mrs. Chinyuku has been receiving persistent threats from the ruling party youth and government 
officials at Hopley Farm, the internally displaced persons&#8217; (IDPs) camp where she used to reside 
after having been evicted from Porta Farm. In particular, it is reported that on 17 October 2005, 
she was called to a meeting attended by the Minister of Local Government, Public Works and 
Urban Development and other government officials. During this meeting it is reported that she 
was told she had &#8220;sold out&#8221; by giving information to human rights organizations, was threatened 
not to be allowed to stay at Hopley Farm should she continue to interact with human rights 
groups, and received death threats. Subsequently a residential stand which had been allocated to 
her was reportedly withdrawn, allegedly on the instructions of an official from the Ministry of 
Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare, which runs Hopley Farm IDP camp. As a result of 
the continuing harassment, and fearing for her safety, she left Hopley Farm. Fears have been 
expressed with regards to her safety. Additionally, serious concerns are expressed that the 
current harassment, to which she has allegedly been subjected to, may represent a form of 
retaliation for her outspoken stance against the eviction, as well as an attempt to restrain her 
freedom of speech and access to international human rights organizations.

<p>64. On 27 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the Special 
Rapporteur on the adverse effects of illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous 
products and wastes, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to 
an adequate standard of living, the Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights of 
internally displaced persons (IDPs), and the Independent Expert on Minority Issues, concerning 
the situation of the internally displaced persons belonging to the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian 
minority groups affected by severe lead contamination in the Zhitkovc, Cesmin Lug and Kablare 
camps located near Mitrovica, northern Kosovo. Attention was drawn to a previous 
correspondence sent to UNMIK on 13 October 2005 (UA G/SO 214 (42-3) KSV 2/2005), 
regarding the relocation of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian internally displaced persons affected by 
severe lead contamination in camps located in Mitrovica, northern Kosovo. According to 
information received, a lack of trust by affected persons in the United Nations Interim Mission in 
Kosovo (UNMIK) had led to reluctance to voluntarily relocate to Camp Osterode. Due to its 
proximity to the contaminated areas, this camp had been designated as only a temporary measure 
to resolve the health crisis. It was understood that affected persons doubted whether the new 
facilities would be substantially safer, and whether they would in fact constitute a temporary 
measure pending provision of a longer-term durable solution. Concern was expressed about 
reported threats against persons belonging to the minorities in question and further information 
was requested regarding the efforts that UNMIK had taken to resolve this long-term problem and 
ensure a permanent return of IDPs to their homes.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>65. By letter dated 11 April 2006, UNMIK replied to the communication sent 
on 27 March 2006. UNMIK informed the Special Rapporteur that, in concert with other 
agencies, a comprehensive plan had been developed to assist the affected families living in the 
IDP camps. UNMIK noted that over 50 per cent of the camps&#8217; total population had been 
voluntarily relocated to Camp Osterode, and further stated that treatment for children suffering 
from high blood lead levels would begin within the week. UNMIK also committed to complete 
the construction of a permanent resettlement camp for the Roma people within 18 months.

at the new site, the Special Rapporteur strongly feels that UNMIK needs to take additional 
positive actions. The Special Rapporteur continues to monitor the situation.
