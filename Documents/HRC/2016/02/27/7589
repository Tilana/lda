<p><i>Summary 
</i>This report summarizes the findings from a 2013 questionnaire for corporations on 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The objectives of the questionnaire 
were threefold: (1) to understand progress on the dissemination of the Guiding Principles 
among the business community; (2) to highlight implementation motivations and 
challenges among business enterprises; and (3) to understand the support that businesses 
enterprises need to implement their corporate responsibility to respect human rights. 
</p>
<p>The questionnaire revealed the following key findings: 
</p>
<p> (a) The majority of the sampled businesses are aware of the Guiding Principles; 
 (b) Priorities are focused on in-house awareness and integration, improving 
</p>
<p>complaints/grievance mechanisms, building accountability in the business, and (for large 
companies in particular) mapping risks; 
</p>
<p> (c) Half of the sampled businesses have a public statement of human rights, yet 
more transparency is required;

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report summarizes the findings from a 2013 questionnaire for corporations on 
the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The questionnaire was carried out 
for the Working Group by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the International 
Organisation of Employers (IOE), the Global Business Initiative on Business and Human 
Rights (GBI) and the University of Denver.  
</p><p>2. The objectives of the questionnaire were threefold: (1) to understand progress on the 
dissemination of the Guiding Principles among the business community; (2) to highlight 
implementation motivations and challenges among business enterprises; and (3) to 
understand the support that businesses enterprises need to implement their corporate 
responsibility to respect human rights.  
</p>
<p>3. The aim of this report, which follows on from a pilot survey in 2012,1 is to gather 
solid data to support the United Nations and other organizations as they work to 
disseminate and implement the Guiding Principles. This questionnaire is not an in-depth 
inquiry or assessment of how companies are progressing with detailed implementation of 
the Guiding Principles. Instead, it aims to understand how business enterprises are 
approaching the Guiding Principles and shed light on the motivations, challenges, gaps and 
opportunities for businesses in implementing the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p>4. One hundred and fifty-three business representatives from 39 countries responded to 
the questionnaire. This is an increase of 23.5 per cent from the 117 businesses that 
responded to the 2012 pilot survey. Europe was the region with the highest percentage of 
overall respondents, at 45.7 per cent. It also provided the most diverse regional sample with 
perspectives shared from 18 company representatives.  
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group is using the results and findings from the questionnaire in its 
wider efforts to map the dissemination and implementation of the Guiding Principles. The 
questionnaire helps the Working Group to track business awareness of and progress in 
implementing the Guiding Principles. It also helps it to identify the common obstacles to 
the fulfilment of &#8220;the corporate responsibility to respect human rights&#8221; (the second pillar of 
the Guiding Principles).  
</p><p>6. This questionnaire complements a parallel questionnaire focused on government 
action regarding &#8220;the State duty to protect human rights&#8221; (the first pillar of the Guiding 
Principles).  
7. The Working Group welcomes feedback to help it advance the business and human 
rights agenda within the framework of the Guiding Principles. Please send any feedback to: 
wg-business@ohchr.org. 
</p>
<p><b> II. A note on supporting evidence 
</b></p>
<p>8. While the questionnaire did not require supporting or verifiable evidence or data, 
respondents were given the opportunity to upload or provide links to any internal or 
external company documents on human rights from their organizations. Information was 
uploaded by 32 of the 153 companies that participated in the questionnaire. The types of 
information provided included examples of codes of conduct; supplier codes of conduct;

<p><b> III. Brief overview of the Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Human Rights Council endorsed the Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights in June 2011. The Guiding Principles elaborate on the three pillars of the 
United Nations &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework, which the former Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General proposed to the Human Rights Council in 2008. 
The three pillars of the Framework are: 
</p>
<p>(a) The State duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, 
including business enterprises, through appropriate policies, regulation, and adjudication; 
</p>
<p>(b) The corporate responsibility to respect human rights, that is, to act with due 
diligence to avoid infringing the rights of others and address adverse impacts with which 
they are involved; and 
</p>
<p>(c) The need for greater access for victims to effective remedy, both judicial and 
non-judicial.2 
</p><p>10. The endorsement of the Guiding Principles established a common global platform 
for action. The Guiding Principles apply to all States and to all business enterprises, both 
transnational and others, regardless of their size, sector, location, ownership and structure. 
While they are universally applicable, the Guiding Principles recognize that there is no one-
size-fits-all approach to how business enterprises meet their corporate responsibility to 
respect human rights. Specifically the Guiding Principles set out that businesses should 
have in place: 
</p>
<p>(a) A policy commitment to meet their responsibility to respect human rights; 
(b) A human rights due-diligence process to identify, prevent, mitigate and 
</p>
<p>account for how they address their impacts on human rights; and 
</p>
<p>(c) Processes to enable the remediation of any adverse human rights impacts 
they cause or to which they contribute. 
</p>
<p>11. The Guiding Principles stipulate that, in order to conduct effective due diligence, 
businesses should conduct meaningful engagement with affected stakeholders, implement 
the results of their impact assessments and take appropriate action, including assigning 
responsibility for addressing any impacts to the appropriate level and function within the 
business enterprise. Furthermore, businesses should track the effectiveness of their human 
rights response using qualitative and quantitative indicators and feedback from 
stakeholders, and report publicly on how they address their human rights impacts.

</p>
<p><b> IV. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>12. This report summarizes the findings from the second corporate questionnaire on the 
Guiding Principles, which was carried out in 2013, following a pilot survey in 2012. The 
Working Group aims to undertake a corporate questionnaire every year. 
</p>
<p>13. The project team analyzed the questions and results from the 2012 questionnaire 
with a view to improving the design of the 2013 questionnaire, which consequently has 
different questions and amended answer choices and formats. Year-on-year comparative 
data cannot therefore be included in the present report, except for the respondent rate. A 
total of 165 organizations completed the questionnaire. However, 12 of these were deemed 
ineligible for inclusion as they were business associations and/or NGOs and were therefore 
not included in the analysis.3 In total 153 companies responded to the survey, the baseline 
figure for the analysis.  
</p>
<p>14. The involvement of GBI, ICC and IOE, three prominent business associations and 
membership bodies, enabled access to their extensive corporate networks. However, their 
involvement is not without limitations. Some answers to the questionnaire may be affected 
by the fact that they are a part of these convening organizations. Where this may be the 
case, it has been indicated in the text. Furthermore, there is no third-party validation of the 
information given by respondents to establish the accuracy of fact-based answers to some 
of the questions.  
</p>
<p>15. The questionnaire was administered from 29 October 2013 to 31 January 2014 using 
a custom online tool and the team employed a snowball sampling methodological approach. 
Snowball sampling relies on the networks that exist between members of a target 
population. The process starts with an initial &#8220;seeding&#8221; of the survey, which then gathers 
size and pace at it disperses through networks. As a sampling methodology, it differs 
considerably from approaches which involve taking a random sample from a known 
population, as often used in public opinion surveys.  
</p>
<p>16. The chief disadvantage of snowball sampling is that it is not as representative of the 
wider population (in this case global businesses) as a random sampling strategy. It also 
limits the extent to which the results can be generalized. Furthermore, there is sampling 
bias due to the reliance on e-mails being forwarded on through networks. For example, 
people may be more likely to forward the e-mail to contacts they know well, who may 
share similar traits and characteristics with them, which means the end sample may only 
represent a subgroup of the wider population.  
</p>
<p>17. The drawbacks of this method could be minimized by using a range of different 
&#8220;seeds&#8221; to start the snowballing process in order to reach a more diverse group of 
individuals. For the questionnaire, GBI, ICC and IOE leveraged their multiple networks to 
disperse the survey and, in turn, these networks further circulated the information and the 
survey link via e-mail to their own networks.  
</p>
<p>18. In interpreting the results of the study, it is important to note that this is not a 
representative study offering a snapshot of global business. However, the 153 respondents 
who participated do constitute a valid sample, obtained in an appropriate manner, and they 
are able to offer a useful perspective on business and human rights issues. Even so, it is 
anticipated that respondents were previously familiar with or interested in the business and 
human rights agenda since they self-selected to complete the survey. In this context 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 Interest in the questionnaire was shown by non-business constituents. In the future, it may be useful to 
</p>
<p>signpost them from the corporate questionnaire to the parallel surveys being undertaken for other 
stakeholders by the Working Group.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>generalizations are not possible, yet there are a sufficient number of respondents to provide 
useful insights about a subset of businesses that are familiar with, or interested in, business 
and human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Potential future methodologies 
</b></p>
<p>19. Looking ahead to future questionnaires, it is worth considering alternative 
methodologies. It may be possible to achieve a more representative sample by limiting the 
population of businesses surveyed. For example, partner organizations may have priority 
countries, defined by both the size of the national economy and the extent to which human 
rights are seen as an issue in the country. They may also have priority audiences in terms of 
company size and sector.  
</p>
<p>20. More research could be carried out to define a range of company roles/job titles 
whose incumbents are likely to possess the necessary knowledge to answer on the topics in 
the survey. The partner organizations (GBI, ICC and IEO) would aim to identify &#8220;priority 
audiences&#8221; as opposed to the business world in general. Regarding the methods available to 
represent the priority audience: 
</p>
<p>(a) If large businesses are particularly important for an organization, it is a fairly 
simple exercise to obtain company contact details from the Financial Times Stock 
Exchange (FTSE) 250, Fortune 500, etc., contact these companies to explain the nature of 
the research, and ask to be directed to a suitable individual; 
</p>
<p>(b) In several countries, it is possible to purchase a pre-constructed list of 
business individuals fitting the target profile (for example, with a suitable job title), with 
information on sector, business size, etc. also included. From these lists, a sample frame can 
be constructed that matches the profile of the target audience, and individuals can be 
selected at random to be approached to take part in the survey. 
</p>
<p>21. Both approaches are more resource-intensive than snowball sampling, in that they 
would rely on more than just an initial &#8220;seeding&#8221; for the survey to reach the target 
respondents. Selected companies may need to be contacted by telephone as well as e-mail, 
and respondents given the opportunity to complete the survey in this manner.  
</p>
<p>22. The effort to represent a more clearly defined target population may also require 
setting certain quotas (e.g. X per cent of respondents from companies in Y sector) against 
which progress needs to be monitored. For this reason, specialist third-party research firms 
may need to be engaged to design and implement such a survey.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Survey structure 
</b>23. The 2013 questionnaire included a variety of question types such as multiple choice, 
yes/no answers, rating of a list of options, and open text boxes requiring more detailed 
explanations. Participating company representatives were also able to upload or provide 
links to any internal or external company documents on human rights to share with the 
Working Group.  
</p>
<p>24. The questions were grouped into three main sections as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Section 1: Gathering information on the demographics of respondents, including 
country location of their company headquarters, location of operations of the 
respondent, industry sector and size and how the respondent had heard about the 
questionnaire. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Section 2: Questions such as whether participants had previously heard of the 
Guiding Principles (to establish their level of awareness), when they had first heard 
about the Guiding Principles, and in what contexts they had most frequently heard 
about the corporate responsibility to respect human rights. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Section 3: Participants were asked to select their human rights priorities over the 
following 12 months, to state whether they had a public human rights policy in 
place, and to identify the department(s) leading the implementation of their human 
rights policy. Also requested were examples of engagement in activities related to 
respect for human rights; primary motivators for addressing human rights within 
their company; challenges in implementing respect for human rights in practice; and 
productive ecosystem support for taking forward the corporate responsibility to 
respect human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Survey sample 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. By region and headquarters 
</b></p>
<p>25. There were 153 respondents from businesses to the 2013 questionnaire, representing 
an increase of 23.5 per cent from the 117 who responded to the 2012 questionnaire. At a 
global level, there were respondents from 39 countries, with Europe the region with the 
highest percentage of overall respondents (at 45.7 per cent) and the most diverse regional 
sample, with perspectives shared from 18 company representatives. 
</p>
<p><b>  </b>Figure 1 
<b>Respondent companies (percentage by region) 
</b> 
</p>
<p>26. Respondents from companies headquartered in the United States of America (9.8 per 
cent), followed closely by Germany (8.4 per cent), accounted for the highest percentage of 
respondents by headquarters country of the total of 153 (see Figure 1). Respondents from 
companies headquartered in Colombia and Kenya (6.5 per cent) were the next largest 
group, leading the response from the emerging markets. Other countries with notable 
response rates were companies headquartered in France (5.8 per cent) and Switzerland (4.5 
per cent) from developed countries, and Brazil (3.9 per cent) and Indonesia (3.9 per cent) 
from developing countries. Almost half of the respondent companies (49 per cent) operate 
in up to 10 different countries. Just under three quarters of the respondent companies (73.85 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>per cent) operate in 50 countries or fewer. Approximately 4.5 per cent of the 153 companies 
operate in 150 or more countries. 
</p>
<p><b>  </b>Figure 2 
<b>Questionnaire respondents (by company headquarters country) 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>27. The largest number of individual respondents were based in Colombia (9.8 per cent), 
followed by Germany and the United States (7.19 per cent), although their companies were 
not based in these countries. While generalizations are not possible, these patterns of 
participation in the survey may indicate a relatively higher level of discourse on business 
and human rights in these countries for a variety of factors, such as a proactive civil society 
or business association engagement on the issues. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. By sector 
</b></p>
<p>28. All listed sectors were represented in the 153 company sample, with the largest 
percentage of respondents drawn from the manufacturing (22.2 per cent), extractive 
industries (11.76 per cent) and infrastructure and utilities (11.11 per cent) sectors (see 
Figure 3). This may reflect the fact that these sectors are closely involved with the business 
and human rights agenda owing to greater awareness in these industries of their potential or 
actual negative human rights impacts in comparison with other industries. </p>

<b>Sample (by company&#8217;s industry sector)

<p><b> 3. By company size 
</b></p>
<p>29. All company sizes were represented in the survey, evenly split between respondents 
from companies with fewer than 5,000 employees and with more than 5,000. Specifically, 
20.9 per cent of respondents were from companies with over 100,000 employees, while at 
the lower end 13.7 per cent of respondents were from companies that had fewer than 50 
employees. The definition of small, medium and large company size was defined prior to 
the survey as: small = fewer than 1,000; medium = 1,000&#8722;30,000; and large = larger than 
30,000.

<p><b> 4. By source 
</b></p>
<p>30. Nearly two in five (37.25 per cent) of respondents had heard about the survey 
directly from sources other than the collaborating partners (ICC, IOE, GBI and the 
University of Denver). This suggests that the networks of the collaborating partners played 
an active role in disseminating the call for participation. </p>

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b> VIII. Key findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The majority of the sampled businesses are aware  
of the Guiding Principles 
</b></p>
<p>31. Awareness of the Guiding Principles and the corporate responsibility to respect 
human rights is high among this sample group, with three quarters of the 153 respondents 
having heard of the Guiding Principles. There is clearly a need for further awareness-
raising, with approximately a quarter of respondents stating that they had previously been 
unaware of the Guiding Principles. However, given the limitations of this study, these 
findings cannot be extrapolated to indicate that they are representative of the entire global 
business community.  
</p>
<p>32. Of the 75 per cent of the respondents who had heard of the Guiding Principles, more 
than half reported that they had heard of them at the time when they were being developed 
in 2010 or earlier. Notably, just over 20 per cent had heard of the Guiding Principles for the 
first time in 2012 or 2013, indicating that continued awareness-building activities on the 
Guiding Principles may be yielding incremental results.  
</p>
<p>33. When asked about the main mechanisms through which they had heard about the 
Guiding Principles, the majority of respondents selected: associations or networks; 
interaction with civil society and participation in events (See Figure 5). In addition to the 
collaborating partners, those commonly cited by respondents were: United Nations Global 
Compact, the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), IPIECA (the global oil 
and gas industry association for environmental and social issues), the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI), the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) and the National Business 
Association of Colombia (ANDI). However it should be noted that, in an example of the 
limitations of the survey, the databases of an organization such as GBI will be skewed in 
favour of those companies that have attended GBI-organized events. It is perhaps therefore 
unsurprising that these mechanisms have scored highly. Nevertheless, it raises the question 
as to how the Working Group can seek to leverage on and stimulate membership bodies and 
business associations to further engage their networks on the theme of business and human 
rights in the future. Additionally, the findings indicate that there is a continued need for 
engagement with business associations and networks, as well as civil society, to build 
awareness on business and human rights, through events and other mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>34. The results point to further scope for cross referencing the Guiding Principles in 
other relevant standards. For example, 39.87 per cent of respondents noted that they had 
heard about the Guiding Principles when reviewing other standards, such as the GRI 
Guidelines, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines 
and ISO 26000 of the International Organization for Standardization.  
</p>
<p>35. It is valuable to note that some respondents stated that they were aware of the 
Guiding Principles because of being asked for information related to them in &#8220;requests for 
proposals&#8221;, and in the process of tendering for work, as well as from socially responsible 
investors. </p>

<b>Context where respondents most frequently hear about the corporate responsibility to

</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Priorities are focused on in-house awareness-raising and integration, 
improving complaints/grievance mechanisms, building accountability 
in the business, and (for large companies in particular) mapping risks  
</b>36. Survey respondents&#8217; top priorities were to build in-house awareness on human rights 
and improve complaints/grievance mechanisms. Mapping the company&#8217;s high-risk 
operations was also identified as a priority. However, the focus on this differed according to 
company size with, perhaps unsurprisingly, larger companies identifying this as a priority 
(see Figure 6).

</p>
<p><b> 3. Half of the sampled businesses have a public statement of human rights, 
yet more transparency is required  
</b></p>
<p>37. While nearly three in five companies (57.52 per cent) have a public policy statement 
on human rights, just over two in five respondent companies have yet to create one. This 
indicates that there is progress still to be made in encouraging companies to establish a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>policy commitment. Moreover, of those that do not have a public policy statement, 15 per 
cent of surveyed companies have an internal policy statement that is not public. Guiding 
Principle 16 states that: &#8220;As the basis for embedding their responsibility to respect human 
rights, business enterprises should express their commitment to meet this responsibility 
through a statement of policy that: (a) is approved at the most senior level of the business 
enterprise; (b) is informed by relevant internal and/or external expertise; (c) stipulates the 
enterprise&#8217;s human rights expectations of personnel, business partners and other parties 
directly linked to its operations, products or services; (d) is publicly available and 
communicated internally and externally to all personnel, business partners and other 
relevant parties; (e) is reflected in operational policies and procedures necessary to embed it 
throughout the business enterprise.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Corporate responsibility/sustainability departments tend  
to be leading on human rights

<p>38. When asked which department (or departments) leads on the implementation of their 
company&#8217;s human rights policy (with the option to select &#8220;all that apply&#8221;), approximately 
three quarters of the 88 respondents replied &#8220;the corporate responsibility/sustainability 
department&#8221;. However, many of the respondents also indicated that multiple departments 
lead on implementation and half of those who answered indicated that Human Resources 
are involved. This may be due to the connection between the respect for human rights and 
labour rights, suggesting a growing awareness of human rights as a cross-cutting issue.  
</p>
<p>39. Notably, &#8220;investor relations&#8221; was the department least recognized by respondents as 
leading the implementation of the company&#8217;s human rights policy. This suggests a lack of 
involvement and engagement on the part of investors with regard to human rights, which is 
contrary to much thinking among the business and human rights/sustainability community. 
However, this could be explained by ambiguity in the question. For example, even if 
investors do not lead on the agenda, it does not mean that they do not take relevant action 
on a regular basis. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Half of the sampled businesses stated that they are actively engaged 
in the human rights agenda, including by working  
on their own policies and practices  
</b></p>
<p>40. More than half of the 153 respondents reported that their company has engaged in 
activities related to respect for human rights. Examples cited by respondents include: 
supporting human rights advocacy campaigns; endorsing principles such as the United 
Nations Global Compact; speaking at third-party events and writing in third-party 
publications on business and human rights; creating in-house guides on human rights for 
employees; installing human rights whistleblower systems; undertaking human rights 
impact assessments, employee capacity building/training on the Guiding Principles, human 
rights compliance assessments and verification on labour rights; and conducting 
stakeholder dialogues. However a quarter of respondents said that they have not engaged in 
a human rights activity and one seventh said that they did not know of any such 
engagement.  </p>

<p><b> 6. Moving from policy to practice on human rights and addressing human 
rights in business relationships are the main challenges  
for half of the sampled businesses 
</b></p>
<p>41. Respondents were asked to note their companies&#8217; three primary motivations for 
addressing human rights. At an aggregate level, these were: &#8220;a commitment to human rights 
in our code of conduct&#8221;; &#8220;human rights are part of effective risk management&#8221;; and &#8220;it is 
the right thing to do&#8221;. Overall, these results are consistent with the generally recognized 
business case for respecting human rights. As a caveat, it is nevertheless worth noting that a 
limitation of any questionnaire is that people will select what they perceive is the 
anticipated &#8220;right&#8221; answer (see Figure 7).  
</p><p>42. In general, these results were the same regardless of the company&#8217;s size, with the 
exception of smaller businesses, which placed a lower emphasis on human rights risk 
management as a motivation and on motivation stemming from a commitment to human 
rights in their codes of conduct.

<p>43. It is interesting to note that few respondents chose the following three options: &#8220;a 
negative human rights issue at one or more of our competitors&#8221;; &#8220;a negative human rights 
issue in the company&#8217;s past&#8221;; or &#8220;investors prompted us to act&#8221;. The last of these perhaps 
indicates a lack of engagement by many investors on the theme of human rights. It could 
also be a result of allowing respondents to choose only their top three answers to this 
question. Moreover, the response may depend on who is responding to the survey. Since 
respondents are unlikely to be board level executives, their perception of the company&#8217;s 
motivations may differ from that of the chief executive officer (CEO), who may be more 
motivated by investor opinion.  
</p>
<p>44. Nearly half of the 153 respondents said that moving from a policy commitment on 
human rights to putting this policy into practice was the biggest challenge, closely followed 
by managing challenges in business relationships (see Figure 8). Nevertheless, for a third of 
the sampled businesses, there remain challenges in understanding human rights impacts and 
galvanizing internal commitment and undertaking capacity-building. In addition, a quarter 
of those sampled cite a lack of resources. With this in mind, it can be inferred that capacity-
building support is required to guide companies in the process of understanding their 
human rights impacts, provide them with training, and shape the internal messaging to get 
resources allocated to address human rights risks. It should be noted that multiple </p>

<p>respondents stated that they had experienced challenges when considering human rights 
impacts over which they had limited control but were able to exert influence.

<p><b> 7. When asked about &#8220;eco-system support&#8221;, the most common responses 
were the need for training and educational opportunities, effective 
government enforcement of local law and multi-stakeholder initiatives. 
Other responses, although less common, included public benchmarking 
and legal requirements to conduct human rights due diligence 
</b></p>
<p>45. Companies were asked to select the top three areas of support that would be the most 
productive over the coming years in enabling companies to take forward the corporate 
responsibility to respect human rights. More than one in two of the respondents identified 
training and educational opportunities as a top priority for support (see Figure 8). Effective 
government enforcement of local law received the second highest number of respondents 
(45.75 per cent), followed by multi-stakeholder initiatives (39.22 per cent). This indicates 
the critical role of the rule of law in enforcing corporate respect for human rights, as well as 
the recognition that civil society and other multi-stakeholder initiatives play a role in 
ensuring that corporations understand and implement their human rights responsibilities. 
These findings were consistent among different sized companies. </p>

<p>46. A third of the 153 respondents identified the need for greater availability of country-
specific information on human rights risks to enable companies to carry out their corporate 
responsibility to respect human rights. Approximately a quarter of respondents recognized 
the value of public benchmarking on human rights performance. Just over a fifth 
acknowledged that legal requirements to conduct human rights due diligence may ensure 
that companies take forward the corporate responsibility to respect human rights.  
</p>
<p>47. Notably, a small number of respondents identified mandatory reporting requirements 
for companies in high-risk countries. This is an interesting finding given discussions about 
mandatory corporate human rights reporting, notably since the US State Department set 
requirements for some types of United States company operating in Myanmar after the 
lifting of economic sanctions.  
</p>
<p>48. In addition, respondents indicated very low support for &#8220;an international treaty on 
the responsibilities of companies in conflict areas&#8221;, with only 4 of the 153 companies 
selecting this option.

<p><b> IX. Conclusions  
</b>49. <b>This 2013 questionnaire has provided useful insights for the Working Group. 
In particular, the diversity of participants &#8211; in terms of geography, industry sector 
and size of businesses &#8211; indicates the global nature of engagement on human rights by 
business.  </b></p>

<p>50. <b>To summarize, for the majority of the 153 sampled businesses, both internal 
and external factors act as motivators to address human rights, which confirms 
existing assumptions. There is clear recognition by businesses of their responsibility to 
respect human rights from a risk management perspective but also because it is the 
right thing to do. One in two respondents questioned were aware of the Guiding 
Principles, have a public statement of human rights, and have actively engaged in 
human rights activity. Yet, while some companies have moved from policy to practice 
on human rights,  doing so remains a major challenge.  
</b>51. <b>Despite these useful insights, the small scale of the questionnaire and the fact 
that it was not randomized has limited the extent to which the results can be 
extrapolated and generalizations can be made at a global level. The results have 
therefore underscored the potential value of conducting a larger scale, randomized 
survey in the future in order to gather a solid baseline of credible and complete data 
to support the United Nations and other organizations as they continue their work to 
disseminate and implement the Guiding Principles.  
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>Looking ahead, future questionnaires/surveys could take a two-tier approach to 
gather answers not only from company representatives with an interest in human 
rights at the management level, but also from CEOs and board level respondents, 
whose perceptions may differ and add additional value. This could be complemented 
by an institutional investor survey, given the critical role that this can play in driving 
corporate behaviour. While the questionnaire featured feedback from respondents 
from 39 countries, there was a skewed response in favour of European headquartered 
businesses. Consequently, a regional approach to the survey and/or its dissemination 
may be of value in achieving a more geographically balanced response in the future. 
In addition, a more detailed focus on the challenges facing businesses in the 
implementation of their responsibility to respect human rights may help lead to 
solutions.  
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>The results from this questionnaire will help the Working Group and other 
business and human rights players to disseminate the Guiding Principles and ensure 
that corporations meet their responsibility to respect human rights. There is indicative 
demand for supporting businesses in the provision of business and human rights 
training and education, in particular for small businesses. Support is also required in 
the process of building in-house awareness of the business case for human rights, the 
need to communicate company progress transparently and develop grievance 
mechanisms. In addition, there may be demand to create learning materials to 
document good practice on internal and external communications and human rights 
reporting. Specific training and support could be tailored to the unique needs of 
smaller businesses, with an emphasis on the creation of human rights codes of 
conduct. Moreover, further emphasis could be placed on tools to disseminate the 
Guiding Principles in order to support companies in mapping their human rights 
risks at a geographical and sector level and in better understanding their indirect 
human rights impacts.  
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The questionnaire demonstrates the clear business interest and the ability of 
business associations and networks to stimulate interest in the topic of business and 
human rights. Approaches that leverage business associations and networks to raise 
support and continue awareness-raising activities to help ensure that corporations 
meet their responsibility to respect human rights are of integral strategic value to the 
Working Group.  </b></p>
