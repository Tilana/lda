PRELIMINARY SHORT FORM PROSPECTUS
NEW ISSUE
August 22, 2016
$100,037,250
7,785,000 Common Shares
Price:  $12.85 per Common Share
This  short  form  prospectus  qualifies  the  distribution  of  7,785,000  common  shares  (the  "Common  Shares")  of 
Enerflex Ltd. ("Enerflex" or the "Company") at a price of $12.85 per Common Share (the "Offering").  The price 
for the Common Shares offered hereunder was determined by negotiation between Enerflex and Scotia Capital Inc. 
("Scotia")  and  TD  Securities  Inc.  ("TD  Securities"  and  together  with  Scotia,  the  "Co-Lead  Underwriters"), on 
their  own  behalf  and  on  behalf  of  National  Bank  Financial  Inc.,  CIBC  World  Markets  Inc.,  HSBC  Securities 
(Canada) Inc., AltaCorp Capital Inc., BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc., Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., Wells Fargo Securities 
Canada, Ltd., Peters & Co. Limited, Raymond James Ltd. and RBC Dominion Securities Inc. (together with the Co-
Lead Underwriters, the "Underwriters").
The outstanding Common Shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the "TSX") under the symbol "EFX".  
On August 15, 2016, the last completed trading day on which the Common Shares traded prior to the date of the 
public announcement of the Offering, the closing price of the Common Shares on the TSX was $13.20.  On August 
19, 2016, the last trading day before the date of this short form prospectus, the closing price of the Common Shares 
on  the  TSX  was  $13.27.   Enerflex  has  applied to list the  Common Shares offered hereunder on the TSX.   Such 
listing will be subject to Enerflex fulfilling all of the listing requirements of the TSX.

The fee payable to the Underwriters represents 4.0% of the offering price of the Common Shares offered hereunder. 
Before  deducting  expenses  of  the  Offering,  estimated  to  be  an  aggregate  of  $350,000,  which  will  be  paid  from  the 
general corporate funds of Enerflex. 
Enerflex has granted to the Underwriters an over-allotment option (the "Over-Allotment Option") to purchase up to 
1,167,750 additional Common Shares at a price of $12.85 per Common Share to cover over-allotments, if any, and for 
market stabilization purposes.  The Over-Allotment Option is exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time until 30 days 
following  the  closing  date  of  the  Offering  (the  "Closing  Date").    If  the  Underwriters  exercise  the  Over-Allotment 
Option in full, the total Price to Public, Underwriters' Fee and Net Proceeds to Enerflex before deducting expenses will 
be  $115,042,837.50,  $4,601,713.50  and  $110,441,124,  respectively.  This  short  form  prospectus  qualifies  the 
distribution of any Common Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option.  A purchaser who 
acquires Common Shares  forming part of the Underwriters' over-allocation position acquires those Common Shares 
under  this  short  form  prospectus,  regardless  of  whether  the  over-allocation  position  is  ultimately  filled  through  the 
exercise of the Over-Allotment Option or through secondary market purchases.  See "Plan of Distribution".  Where 
applicable references to the "Offering" include the Over-Allotment Option and the Common Shares issuable pursuant 
to the Over-Allotment Option.

The Underwriters, as principals, conditionally offer the Common Shares offered hereunder, subject to prior sale, if, 
as and when issued by the Company and accepted by the Underwriters in accordance with the conditions contained 
in the Underwriting Agreement referred to herein under "Plan of Distribution" and subject to the approval of certain 
legal matters on behalf of the Company by Burnet, Duckworth & Palmer LLP and on behalf of the Underwriters by 
Stikeman Elliott LLP.
The Company has been advised by the Underwriters that, in connection with the Offering, the Underwriters may 
effect transactions that stabilize or maintain the market price of the Common Shares at levels other than those that 
might otherwise prevail in the open market.  Such transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.  
See "Plan of Distribution".
The  Underwriters  propose  to  offer  the  Common  Shares  offered  hereunder  initially  at  the  offering  price 
specified  above.    After  a  reasonable  effort  has  been  made  to  sell  all  of  such  Common  Shares  at  the  price 
specified,  the  Underwriters  may  subsequently  reduce  the  selling  price  to  purchasers  from  time  to  time  in 
order to sell any of such Common Shares remaining unsold.  Any such reduction will not affect the proceeds 
received by the Company.  See "Plan of Distribution".
Scotia,  TD  Securities,  CIBC  World  Markets  Inc.  ("CIBC"),  HSBC  Securities  (Canada)  Inc.  ("HSBC"), 
National Bank Financial Inc. ("NBF"), BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. ("BMO"), Wells Fargo Securities Canada 
Ltd.  ("Wells  Fargo")  and  Merrill  Lynch  Canada  Inc.  ("Merrill")  are  direct  or  indirect  subsidiaries  of 
Canadian chartered banks or other financial institutions which are lenders to the Company under the Bank 
Facility (as defined herein), and to which the Company is currently indebted.  In addition, ATB Financial is a 
minority  shareholder  of  AltaCorp  Capital  Inc.  ("AltaCorp"),  ATB  Financial  is  an  affiliate  of  Alberta 
Treasury Branches which is a provincially regulated financial institution and a lender to the Company under 
the  Bank  Facility  and  to  which  the  Company  is  currently  indebted.  Consequently,  the  Company  may  be 
considered  to  be  a  "connected  issuer"  of  these  Underwriters  for  the  purposes  of  securities  regulations  in 
certain provinces.  All of the net proceeds of the Offering will initially be used by the Company to fund the 
balance of its 2016 and 2017 capital expenditure program, potential acquisitions that may be identified from 
time to time and for general working capital and corporate purposes. Until deployed for these purposes, the 
proceeds  of  the  Offering  will  temporarily  be  used  to  reduce  the  outstanding  indebtedness  under  the  Bank 
Facility.  See "Use of Proceeds" and "Relationship Between the Company and Certain Underwriters".
An investment in the Common Shares offered hereunder is speculative and involves a high degree of risk.  It 
is important for an investor to consider the particular risk factors that may affect the industry in which it is 
investing.  See the risk factors under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Information" in the 
AIF  (as  defined  herein)  and  the  headings  "Risk  Factors"  and  "Cautionary  Statement  Regarding  Forward-
Looking Information" in this short form prospectus.  These sections also describe the Company's assessment 
of those risk factors, as well as some of the potential consequences to an investor if a risk should occur.
Subscriptions for Common Shares offered hereunder will be received subject to rejection or allotment in whole or in 
part and the right is reserved to close the subscription books at any time without notice.  Closing of the Offering is 
expected  to  occur  on  September  7,  2016,  or  such  other  date  as  the  Co-Lead  Underwriters,  on  behalf  of  the 
Underwriters,  and  the  Company  may  agree  in  writing  and,  for  greater  certainty,  the  Common  Shares  offered 
hereunder are to be taken up by the Underwriters, if at all, on or before a date not later than 42 days after the date of 
the receipt for the (final) short form prospectus.
Except in certain limited circumstances: (i) the Common Shares issued pursuant to the Offering will be issued and 
deposited in electronic form as non-certificated inventory with CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. ("CDS") 
or its nominee pursuant to the book-based system administered by CDS; (ii) certificates evidencing the Common 
Shares  will  not  be  issued  to  purchasers;  and  (iii)  purchasers  will  receive  only  a  customer  confirmation  from  the 
Underwriter or other registered dealer who is a CDS participant and from or through whom a beneficial interest in 
the  Common  Shares  are  purchased.    Purchasers  who  are  not  issued  a  certificate  evidencing  the  Common  Shares 
which  are  subscribed  for  by  them  at  closing  are  entitled,  under  the  Canada  Business  Corporations  Act  (the 
"CBCA"), to request that a certificate be issued in their name.  Such a request will need to be made through the CDS 
participant through whom the beneficial interest in the securities are held at the time of the request.  See "Plan of 
Distribution".

forward-looking
looking  statements  or
Certain  statements  contained  in  this  short  form  prospectus  and  the  documents  incorporated  by  reference  herein 
(collectively,  "forward-looking 
constitute 
statements").  These forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance.  All statements other 
than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are often, but not 
always,  identified  by  the  use  of  words  such  as  "seek",  "anticipate",  "budget",  "plan",  "continue",  "estimate", 
"expect",  "forecast",  "may",  "will",  "project",  "predict",  "potential",  "targeting",  "intend",  "could",  "might", 
"should", "believe" and similar expressions.  These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in 
such forward looking statements.  Enerflex believes that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements 
are  reasonable  but  no  assurance  can  be  given  that  these  expectations  will  prove  to  be  correct  and  such  forward 
looking  statements  included  in,  or  incorporated  by  reference  in,  this  short  form  prospectus  should  not  be  unduly 
relied upon.  These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this short form prospectus.
Forward-looking statements are based on a number of factors and assumptions  which have been used to develop 
such  forward-looking  statements  but  which  may  prove  to  be  incorrect.    Although  Enerflex  believes  that  the 
expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on 
forward-looking  statements  because  the  Company  can  give  no  assurance  that  such  expectations  will  prove  to  be 
correct.    In  addition  to  other  factors  and  assumptions  which  may  be  identified  in  this  short  form  prospectus, 
assumptions  have  been  made  regarding,  among  other  things:  the  satisfaction  of  all  conditions  to  closing  of  the 
Offering; the timely receipt of any required regulatory approvals; future oil and natural gas prices and the impact of 
lower prices on activity levels and use of the Company's services; the impact of increasing competition; the general
3
stability of the economic and political environment in which the Company operates; the ability of Enerflex to obtain 
qualified staff, equipment and services in a timely and cost efficient manner; the ability of the Company to obtain 
financing  on  acceptable  terms;  the  ability  to  replace  and  expand  the  Company's  operations  through  acquisitions; 
currency, exchange and interest rates; the regulatory framework regarding the oil and gas industry as a whole, taxes 
and environmental matters in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates; and the ability of the Company to 
successfully market its services.
In  particular,  this  short  form  prospectus  and  certain  of  the  documents  incorporated  by  reference  herein  contain 
forward-looking statements pertaining to the following:
• 
• 
• 
• 
•

expectations regarding Enerflex's ability to raise capital and to carry out expansion and growth plans; 
treatment under governmental regulatory regimes, including environmental regulations; 
Enerflex's future opportunities, including backlogged projects; 
Enerflex's business outlook, including by operating and geographical segments; 
operating risks and related insurance coverage; and 
competitive conditions.
The  forward-looking  statements  contained  in  this  short  form  prospectus  are  based  on  certain  key  assumptions 
regarding, among other things, the timing of obtaining regulatory approvals, the Closing Date, and the use of the net 
proceeds of the Offering and other matters described in the documents incorporated by reference herein.  The reader 
is  cautioned  that  such  assumptions,  although  considered  reasonable  by  Enerflex  at  the  time  of  preparation,  may 
prove to be incorrect.  Actual results achieved during the forecast period will vary from the information provided in 
this  short  form  prospectus  and  certain  other  of  the  documents  incorporated  by  reference  herein  as  a  result  of 
numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors.

At  June  30,  2016,  the  Company  and  one  of  its  Australian  subsidiaries  had  revolving  credit  facilities  (the  "Bank 
Facility")  with  a  syndicate  of  financial  institutions.    The  amount  of  the  Bank  Facility  totals  $775  million  with  an 
accordion feature that allows for the expansion of the Bank Facility by up to $100 million, subject to approval by the
6
lenders.  Borrowings under the Bank Facility are available in Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars by way of Prime Rate 
loans, U.S. Base Rate loans, London Interbank Offered Rate loans, and Bankers’ Acceptance notes.  The Company 
may also draw on the Bank Facility through bank overdrafts in either Canadian or U.S. dollars and request the issuance 
of letters of credit in various currencies under the Bank Facility. A portion of the Bank Facility is also available to a 
subsidiary of the Company in Australian dollars by way of Bank Bill Swap Bid Rate loans and overdraft loans. The 
Bank Facility is unsecured and ranks pari passu with the Company's Senior Notes (see note 4 hereof). As at June 30, 
2016, Enerflex had approximately $209.1 million of available capacity under the Bank Facility after considering the 
approximately  $61.8  million  in  letters  of  credit  drawn  on  the  Bank  Facility.    Under  the  Bank  Facility,  Enerflex  is 
restricted from paying dividends if the Company is or, as a result of the payment of any such dividends, would be in 
breach of the terms of the Bank Facility.  As at June 30, 2016 and the date hereof, the Company and its Australian 
subsidiary were and are in compliance with all covenants under the Bank Facility. 
Approximately $506.2 million was outstanding under the Bank Facility as at August 19, 2016 which is comprised of 
both Canadian and U.S. dollar borrowings against the Bank Facility.  The U.S. borrowings are revalued to Canadian 
dollars  at  the  end  of  each  period  using  the  period  end  foreign  exchange  rate.    As  at  August  19,  2016  the  Bank  of 
Canada noon rate was Cdn$0.7765:U.S.$1.00.  After giving effect to the Offering and the estimated expenses of the 
Offering,  but  before  giving  effect  to  the  Over-Allotment  Option,  approximately  $410.5  million  would  have  been 
outstanding under the Bank Facility as at August 19, 2016.  If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, after 
giving effect to the Offering, approximately $396.1 million would have been outstanding under the Bank Facility as at 
August 19, 2016. 
The  Company  does  not  have  any  finance  lease  obligations.  The  majority  of  the  Company's  lease  commitments  are 
operating leases for equipment, automobiles and premises with lease terms between one and ten years. The Company 
does  have  purchase  obligations,  the  majority  of  which  relate  to  the  major  components  for  the  Engineered  Systems 
product line and to long-term information technology and communications contracts entered into in order to reduce the 
overall cost of services rendered. 
The Company has an aggregate of $40.0 million principal amount of senior notes due on June 22, 2021 with an interest 
rate of 6.0% (the "Senior Notes").  The Notes are unsecured and rank pari passu with the Bank Facility. As at June 30, 
2016  and  the  date  hereof,  the  Company  was  and  is  in  compliance  with  all  covenants  under  the  Senior  Notes.  The 
agreements  governing  the  Senior  Notes  provide  that  distributions  to  shareholders  are  not  permitted  if  an  event  of 
default has occurred and is continuing under such agreements or if the making of such distributions would cause an 
event of default.  
As at June 30, 2016, Enerflex had outstanding to officers, directors and employees Options to purchase an aggregate of 
2,576,032 Common Shares at an average exercise price of $13.48 per Common Share.  As at the date hereof, Enerflex 
had outstanding to officers, directors and employees Options to purchase an aggregate of 3,174,460 Common Shares at 
an average exercise price of $13.44  per Common Share. 
Based  on  the  issuance  of  7,785,000  Common  Shares  pursuant  to  the  Offering  for  aggregate  gross  proceeds  of 
$100,037,250 less the Underwriters' fee of $4,001,490 and expenses of the Offering estimated to be an aggregate of 
$350,000.  The aggregate net proceeds from the Offering, assuming completion thereof, less expenses of the Offering 
are estimated to be $95,685,760. See "Plan of Distribution". 
If the Underwriters exercise the Over-Allotment Option in full, the aggregate gross proceeds, Underwriters' fee and net 
proceeds  to  Enerflex  after  deducting  expenses  of  the  Offering  estimated  to  be  an  aggregate  of  $350,000  will  be 
$115,042,837.50, $4,601,713.50, $110,091,124, respectively.  See "Plan of Distribution".

The dividends noted in the table above which have been declared or paid were designated by Enerflex as "eligible 
dividends"  for  Canadian  income  tax  purposes.  Unless  otherwise  indicated,  all  dividends  paid  or  to  be  paid  by 
Enerflex are designated as "eligible dividends".
Closing of this Offering is expected to occur on September 7, 2016.  Subscribers who purchase Common Shares 
pursuant to the Offering will not be eligible to receive the dividend that is expected to be paid on October 6, 2016 to 
shareholders  of  record  at  the  close  of  business  on  August  17,  2016,  however,  subscribers  who  continue  to  hold 
Common Shares after closing of the Offering will be eligible to receive dividends declared payable after such date.
The  Company  has  established  a  history  of  paying  quarterly  dividends  to  shareholders.   The  amount  of  cash 
dividends to be paid on the Common Shares, if any, will be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and 
may vary depending on a variety of factors, including the prevailing economic and competitive environment, results 
of  operations,  fluctuations  in  working  capital,  the  taxability  of  Enerflex,  Enerflex's  ability  to  raise  capital,  the 
amount  of  capital  expenditures  and  other  conditions  existing  from  time  to  time.  There  can  be  no  guarantee  that 
Enerflex will maintain its dividend policy. The agreements governing the Bank Facility and Senior Notes provide 
that distributions to shareholders are not permitted if an event of default has occurred and is continuing under such 
agreements or if the making of such distributions would cause an event of default. See Note 1 to the table under the 
heading "Consolidated Capitalization".
For additional information respecting cash dividend payments to the shareholders, including the factors influencing 
the amount available for distribution to the shareholders, see "Dividends" in the AIF.
USE OF PROCEEDS
The  net  proceeds  to  the  Company  from  the  Offering  are  estimated  to  be  $95,685,760  after  deducting  the 
Underwriters'  fee  of  $4,001,490  and  the  estimated  expenses  of  the  Offering  of  $350,000.    If  the  Over-Allotment 
Option is exercised in full, the net proceeds from the Offering are estimated to be $110,091,124 after deducting the 
Underwriters'  fee  of  $4,601,713.50  and  the  estimated  expenses  of  the  Offering  of  $350,000.    See  "Plan  of 
Distribution".  The net proceeds of the Offering (including the net proceeds from the exercise of the Over-Allotment 
Option, if any) will be used by the Company to fund the balance of its 2016 and 2017 capital expenditure program, 
potential  acquisitions  that  may  be  identified  from  time  to  time  and  for  general  working  capital  and  corporate 
purposes.
For  the  balance  of  2016  and  2017,  the  Company  expects  to  incur  approximately  $79  to  $93  million  of  capital 
expenditures, the details of which are set forth below.

In  addition,  the  Company  is  continually  in  the  process  of  evaluating  potential  acquisition  opportunities  and  may 
pursue such opportunities if the terms are viewed as favourable to Enerflex, however, the Company cannot predict 
whether any of such opportunities will result in the Company successfully completing any acquisition.

Until deployed for these purposes, the proceeds of the Offering will temporarily be used to reduce the outstanding 
indebtedness under the Bank Facility. The borrowing capacity that is freed up by repaying the indebtedness under 
the  Bank  Facility  may  be  redrawn,  from  time  to  time,  to  fund  capital  expenditures,  acquisitions  and  for  general 
working capital and corporate purposes.  Approximately $506.2 million was outstanding under the Bank Facility as 
at August 19, 2016.
The indebtedness to be repaid under the Bank Facility with the net proceeds of the Offering was original incurred to 
fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and the repayment of other indebtedness of the Company primarily relating 
to:  (i)  the  2014,  2015  and  2016  buildout  of  the  compression  rental  fleet;  (ii)  funding  the  acquisition  of  the 
international contract compression and processing, as well as the after-market services, businesses of Axip Energy 
Services  LP;  (iii)  funding  the  repayment  of  the  Company's  senior  notes  that  were  due  June  22,  2016;  and  (iv) 
funding working capital requirements.
For  further  details  on  the  nature  of  such  expenditures,  see  the  Annual  MD&A  and  Interim  MD&A  which  are 
incorporated herein by reference. See also "Relationship Among the Company and Certain Underwriters".
The use of the net proceeds of the Offering by the Company is consistent with Enerflex's stated business objectives 
of providing a compelling and vertically integrated offering of products and services positioned along  the global 
natural gas value chain. There is no particular significant event or milestone that must occur for Enerflex's business 
objectives  to  be  accomplished.  While  the  Company  believes  that  it  has  the  skills  and  resources  necessary  to 
accomplish  its  stated  business  objectives,  the  industry  in  which  the  Company  operates  has  a  number  of  inherent 
risks. See "Risk Factors" in this short form prospectus and in the AIF.
While  the  Company  intends  to  use  the  net  proceeds  of  the  Offering  in  the  manner  stated  above,  there  may  be 
circumstances that are not known at this time where a reallocation of the net proceeds may be advisable for business 
reasons  that  management  believes  are  in  the  Company's  best  interests.  The  extent  and  timing  of  anticipated 
expenditures  in  relation  to  the  Company's  2016  and  2017  capital  expenditure  program  as  set  forth  above  is 
dependent upon, among other things, market demand for the Company's products and services. The Company's 2016 
and 2017 capital expenditure program will be dependent upon closing of the Offering as well as on industry activity 
and, accordingly, the anticipated expenditures set forth above are subject to change, and changes could be material.
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
Pursuant  to  an  agreement  dated  as  of  August  16,  2016  between  the  Company  and  the  Underwriters 
(the "Underwriting Agreement"), the Company has agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 7,785,000 Common 
Shares to the Underwriters and the Underwriters have severally, and not jointly and severally, agreed to purchase 
such Common Shares, subject to the terms and conditions stated therein, at a price of $12.85 per Common Share.  In 
consideration for their services in connection with the Offering, the Underwriters will be paid a fee of $0.514 per 
Common  Share.    The  terms  of  the  Offering,  including  the  offering  price  of  $12.85  per  Common  Share,  were 
determined by negotiation between the Company and the Co-Lead Underwriters, on their own behalf and on behalf 
of the other Underwriters.
The Company has granted to the Underwriters the Over-Allotment Option to purchase up to an additional 1,167,750 
Common Shares on the same terms and conditions as the Offering, exercisable in whole or in part at any time until 
30 days following closing of the Offering to cover over allotments, if any, and for market stabilization purposes.  If 
the  Over-Allotment  Option  is  exercised  in  full,  the  total  Offering,  Underwriters'  fee  and  net  proceeds  to  the 
Company (before expenses of the Offering) will be $115,042,837.50, $4,601,713.50 and $110,441,124, respectively.  
This short form prospectus also qualifies the distribution of the Common Shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of 
the  Over-Allotment  Option.    A  purchaser  who  acquires  Common  Shares  forming  part  of  the  Underwriters'  over 
allocation position acquires those Common Shares under this short form prospectus, regardless of whether the over 
allocation  position  is  ultimately  filled  through  the  exercise  of  the  Over-Allotment  Option  or  secondary  market 
purchases.
The  obligations  of  the  Underwriters  under  the  Underwriting  Agreement  are  several,  and  not  joint  nor  joint  and 
several, and any Underwriter  may terminate its obligations at its discretion  upon the occurrence of certain stated 
events.  Such events include, but are not limited to: (a) the occurrence of a material adverse change, as determined
10
by the Underwriters or any one of them in their sole discretion, acting reasonably, in the business, operations, capital 
or  condition  (financial  or  otherwise)  of  the  Company  or  its  subsidiaries  (taken  as  a  whole)  or  the  respective 
properties,  assets,  liabilities  or  obligations  (absolute,  accrued,  contingent  or  otherwise)  of  the  Company  or  its 
subsidiaries (taken as a whole) which in the Underwriter’s opinion, acting reasonably, could reasonably be expected 
to have a significant adverse effect on the market price or value of the Common Shares offered hereunder; (b) the 
development, occurrence or coming into effect or existence, or announcement, of any event, action, state, condition 
or  occurrence  of  national  or  international  consequence,  including  any  military  conflict,  civil  insurrection,  act  or 
terrorism,  war  or  like  event,  or  a  government  action,  law,  regulation,  inquiry  or  any  occurrence  of  any  nature 
whatsoever,  which,  in  the  sole  opinion  of  the  Underwriters,  or  any  one  of  them,  acting  reasonably,  seriously 
adversely affects or involves, or  will seriously adversely affect or involve,  the  financial  markets  generally or the 
business, operations or affairs of the Company or its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; or (c) the Underwriters (or 
any  one  of  them)  shall  become  aware  of  any  material  information  with  respect  to  the  Company  or  any  of  its 
subsidiaries (taken as a whole) which had not been publicly disclosed or disclosed in writing to the Underwriters at 
or prior to the date of the Underwriting Agreement and which in the sole opinion of the Underwriters or any one of 
them, acting reasonably, could be expected to have a  material adverse effect on the  market price or value of the 
Common Shares offered hereunder.  The Underwriting Agreement also provides that the Company will indemnify 
the  Underwriters  and  their  affiliates,  directors,  officers,  employees,  securityholders,  partners,  advisors  and  agents 
against certain liabilities and expenses.
If one or more of the Underwriters who have an obligation to purchase in the aggregate less than 7% of the Common 
Shares  offered  hereunder  fail  to  purchase  their  allotment  of  Common  Shares,  the  remaining  Underwriter  or 
Underwriters  are  obligated  to  purchase  the  Common  Shares  not  purchased  by  the  Underwriter  or  Underwriters 
which fail to purchase.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event one or more of the Underwriters who have an 
obligation to purchase in the aggregate 7% or more of the Common Shares offered hereunder fail to purchase their 
allotment of Common Shares, the remaining Underwriter or Underwriters have the right but not the obligation to 
purchase  the  Common  Shares  not  purchased  by  the  Underwriter  or  Underwriters  which  fail  to  purchase  or  the 
remaining  Underwriter  or  Underwriters  have  the  right  to  terminate  their  obligations  under  the  Underwriting 
Agreement.    The  Underwriters  are  obligated  to  take  up  and  pay  for  all  the  Common  Shares  hereunder  if  any 
Common Shares are acquired under the Underwriting Agreement.
The Company has applied to list the Common Shares offered hereunder on the TSX.  Listing will be subject to the 
Company fulfilling all of the listing requirements of the TSX.
The Company has been advised by the Underwriters that, in connection with the Offering, the Underwriters may 
effect transactions that stabilize or maintain the market price of the Common Shares at levels other than those that 
might otherwise prevail in the open market.  Such transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.
Enerflex has agreed that it will not, directly or indirectly, sell, agree or offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of, 
or otherwise dispose of any Common Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares or enter 
into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences 
of  the  ownership  of  Common  Shares,  without  the  prior  consent  of  the  Co-Lead  Underwriters  on  behalf  of  the 
Underwriters, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, for a period of 90 days following the closing date of the 
Offering, other than upon the exercise of convertible securities or Options currently outstanding or pursuant to the 
Company’s shareholder rights plan or any security option plan, employee purchase plan or other compensation plan 
of the Company currently in existence.
Closing  of  the  Offering  is  expected  to  occur  on  or  about September  7,  2016, or  such  other  date  as  the  Co-Lead 
Underwriters, on behalf of the Underwriters, and the Company may agree in writing, and, for greater certainty, the 
Common Shares offered hereunder are to be taken up by the Underwriters, if at all, on or before a date not later than 
42 days after the date of the receipt for the (final) short form prospectus.
Except in certain limited circumstances: (i) the Common Shares will be issued and deposited in electronic form with 
CDS  or  its  nominee  pursuant  to  the  book-based  system  administered  by  CDS;  (ii)  certificates  evidencing  the 
Common Shares will not be issued to subscribers; and (iii) subscribers will receive only a customer confirmation 
from the Underwriter or other registered dealer who is a CDS participant and from or through whom a beneficial 
interest in the Common Shares are purchased. Subscribers who are not issued a certificate evidencing the Common
11
Shares which are subscribed for by them at closing are entitled under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) to 
request that a certificate be issued in their name. Such a request will need to be made through the CDS participant 
through whom the beneficial interest in the securities are held at the time of the request.
The  Underwriters  propose  to  offer  the  Common  Shares  offered  hereunder  initially  at  the  offering  price 
specified  herein.    After  a  reasonable  effort  has  been  made  to  sell  all  of  such  Common  Shares  at  the  price 
specified,  the  Underwriters  may  subsequently  reduce  the  selling  price  to  purchasers  from  time  to  time  in 
order to sell any of such Common Shares remaining unsold.  Any such reduction will not affect the proceeds 
received by the Company or the fees payable by the Company to the Underwriters in connection with the 
Offering.    In  the  event  the  offering  price  of  the  Common  Shares  offered  hereunder  is  reduced,  the 
compensation realized by the Underwriters will be decreased by the amount of the aggregate price paid by 
the  purchasers  for  such  Common  Shares  is  less  than  the  gross  proceeds  paid  by  the  Underwriters  to  the 
Company for such Common Shares.
The  Common  Shares  offered  hereby  have  not  been  and  will  not  be  registered  under  the  1933  Act  or  any  state 
securities laws and, accordingly, may not be offered or sold within the United States except in transactions exempt 
from  the  registration  requirements  of  the  1933  Act  and  applicable  state  securities  laws.  The  Underwriting 
Agreement permits the Underwriters to offer and resell the Common Shares that they have acquired pursuant to the 
Underwriting Agreement to certain "qualified institutional buyers", as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 
1933 Act, in the United States, provided such offers and sales are made in accordance with Rule 144A under the 
1933  Act  and  similar  exemptions  under  applicable  state  securities  laws.  Moreover,  the  Underwriting  Agreement 
provides that the Underwriters will offer and sell the Common Shares outside the United States only in accordance 
with Rule 903 of Regulation S under the 1933 Act. This short form prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or 
a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the Common Shares in the United States.
In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, an offer or sale of Common Shares within the 
United States by any dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements 
of the 1933 Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with an exemption from the registration 
requirements of the 1933 Act.
ELIGIBILITY FOR INVESTMENT
In the opinion of Burnet, Duckworth & Palmer LLP, counsel to the Company, and Stikeman Elliott LLP, counsel to 
the  Underwriters,  the  Common  Shares,  if  issued  on  the  date  of  this  short  form  prospectus,  would  be  "qualified 
investments"  under  the  Income  Tax  Act  (Canada)  (the  "Tax  Act")  as  of  the  date  hereof  for  trusts  governed  by 
registered  retirement  savings  plans  ("RRSPs"),  registered  retirement  income  funds  ("RRIFs"),  deferred  profit 
sharing plans, registered education savings plans, registered disability savings plans and tax-free savings accounts 
("TFSAs" and collectively, "Deferred Plans"), provided that the Common Shares are listed on a "designated stock 
exchange", as defined in the Tax Act (which currently includes the TSX).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of a TFSA or an annuitant under a RRSP or RRIF, as the case may be, 
that holds Common Shares will be subject to a penalty tax if such Common Shares are a "prohibited investment" 
for the purposes of the Tax Act.  The Common Shares will generally not be a "prohibited investment" if the holder 
or the annuitant, as the case may be, deals at arm's length with the Company for the purposes of the Tax Act and the 
holder or the annuitant, as the case may be, does not have a "significant interest" (within meaning of the Tax Act) 
in  the  Company.  In  addition,  the  Offered  Shares  will  not  be  a  "prohibited  investment"  if  such  securities  are 
"excluded property" as defined in the Tax Act for trusts governed by Deferred Plans.
Prospective investors who intend to hold the Common Shares in Deferred Plans should consult their own tax 
advisors  regarding  their  particular  circumstances  and  requirements  and  rules  regarding  holding  and 
transferring securities therein.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN UNDERWRITERS
Scotia,  TD  Securities,  CIBC,  HSBC,  NBF,  BMO,  Wells  Fargo  and  Merrill  are  direct  or  indirect  subsidiaries  of 
Canadian  chartered  banks  or  other  financial  institutions  which  are  lenders  to  the  Company,  and  to  which  the 
Company is currently indebted.  In addition, ATB Financial is a minority shareholder of AltaCorp. ATB Financial is 
an affiliate of Alberta Treasury Branches which is a provincially regulated financial institution and a lender to the 
Company under the Bank Facility and to which the Company is currently indebted.  Consequently, the Company 
may  be  considered  to  be  a "connected  issuer"  of  these  Underwriters  for  the  purposes  of  securities  regulations  in 
certain provinces.  The Company is in compliance with its obligations under the Bank Facility.  Since the execution 
of  the  Bank  Facility,  no  breach  thereunder  has  been  waived  by  the  lenders  thereunder.  The  Bank  Facility  is 
unsecured  and  ranks  pari  passu  with  the  Company's  senior  notes.    The  Company's  financial  position  has  not 
materially  changed,  in  an  adverse  manner,  since  the  indebtedness  under  the  Bank  Facility  was  incurred.    As  at 
August 19, 2016, the Company had approximately $506.2 million outstanding under the Bank Facility.
It is anticipated that the net proceeds of the Offering will be used by the Company to fund the balance of the 2016 
and  2017  capital  expenditure  program,  potential  acquisitions  that  may  be  identified  from  time  to  time  and  for 
general working capital and corporate purposes. Until deployed for these purposes, the net proceeds of the Offering 
will temporarily be used to reduce the outstanding indebtedness under the Bank Facility. See "Use of Proceeds" and 
"Consolidated  Capitalization".    The  decision  to  distribute  the  Common  Shares  offered  hereunder  and  the 
determination of the terms of distribution were made through negotiation between the Company and the Co-Lead 
Underwriters, on their own behalf and on behalf of the other Underwriters.  The banks did not have any involvement 
in such decision or determination; however, the banks have been advised of the issuance and the terms thereof.  As a 
consequence of this issuance, each of Scotia, TD Securities, AltaCorp, CIBC, HSBC, NBF, BMO, Wells Fargo and 
Merrill will receive their respective share of the Underwriters' fee, and the banks affiliated with such Underwriters 
will receive a proportionate amount from the proceeds of the Offering from the Company as a temporary repayment 
of outstanding indebtedness as compared to the amounts outstanding to the other lenders under the Bank Facility.
RISK FACTORS
An investment in the Common Shares is subject to certain risks.  Investors should carefully consider the risks 
described under "Risk Factors" in the AIF and the risk factors set forth below prior to making an investment 
in the Common Shares.
Use of Proceeds
As set out under "Use of Proceeds" in this short form prospectus, the Company intends to use the proceeds of the 
Offering tofund the balance of its 2016 and 2017 capital expenditure program, potential acquisitions that may be 
identified  from  time  to  time  and  for  general  working  capital  and  corporate  purposes.  Until  deployed  for  these 
purposes, the proceeds of the Offering will temporarily be used to reduce the outstanding indebtedness under the 
Company's Bank Facility.  However, although these allocations are based on the current expectation of management 
of the Company, management will have discretion in the actual application of the net proceeds and there may be 
circumstances  that  are  not  known  at  this  time  where  a  reallocation  of  the  net  proceeds  of  the  Offering  may  be 
advisable for business reasons that management believes are in the Company's best interests. Failure by management 
to apply these funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company.
Market Price Volatility
The market price of the Common Shares may be volatile. The volatility may affect the ability of holders to sell the 
Common  Shares  at  an  advantageous  price.  Market  price  fluctuations  in  the  Common  Shares  may  be  due  to  the 
Company’s  operating  results  failing  to  meet  the  expectations  of  securities  analysts  or  investors  in  any  quarter, 
downward revision in securities analysts' estimates, governmental regulatory action, adverse change in general market 
conditions or economic trends, acquisitions, dispositions or other material public announcements by the Company or its 
competitors, along with a variety of additional factors, including, without limitation, those set  forth under the heading 
"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements". In addition, the  market  prices  for securities in the 
stock  markets,  including  the  TSX,  are  subject  to  significant  price  and  trading  fluctuations.  These  fluctuations  have
13
resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in 
operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Common Shares.
Forward-Looking Information may Prove Inaccurate
Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information. By its nature, forward-looking 
information  involves  numerous  assumptions,  known  and  unknown  risks  and  uncertainties,  of  both  a  general  and 
specific  nature,  that  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  suggested  by  the  forward-looking 
information  or  contribute  to  the  possibility  that  predictions,  forecasts  or  projections  will  prove  to  be  materially 
inaccurate.
Additional information on the risks, assumptions and uncertainties are found in this short form prospectus under the 
heading "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements".
Impact of Future Financings
In order to fund future operations, acquisitions and growth objectives, Enerflex may raise funds through the issuance 
of additional  Common Shares or the issuance of debt instruments or securities convertible into Common  Shares. 
Enerflex cannot predict the size of future issuances of Common Shares or the issuance of debt instruments or other 
securities convertible into Common Shares or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of the Company’s 
securities will have on the market price of the Common Shares.
ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS AGAINST FOREIGN PERSONS OR COMPANIES
Robert S. Boswell, W. Byron Dunn and Michael A. Weill, directors of Enerflex, reside outside of Canada. Each of 
Messrs. Boswell, Dunn and Weill has appointed Burnet, Duckworth & Palmer LLP, Suite 2400, 525 – 8th Avenue 
S.W., Calgary, Alberta, Canada, T2P 1G1, as their agent for service of process. Purchasers are advised that it may 
not  be  possible  for  investors  to  enforce  judgments  obtained  in  Canada  against  a  person  that  resides  outside  of 
Canada, even if the party has appointed an agent for service of process.
TRANSFER AGENT AND REGISTRAR
The transfer agent and registrar for the Common Shares is CST Trust Company at its principal offices in Calgary, 
Alberta and Toronto, Ontario.
INTERESTS OF EXPERTS

group, and the partners and associates of Stikeman Elliott LLP, as a group, own less than 1% of the outstanding 
Common Shares.
In addition, none of the aforementioned persons or companies, nor any director, officer or employee of any of the 
aforementioned persons or companies, is or is expected to be elected, appointed or employed as a director, officer or 
employee of the Company or of any associate or affiliate of the Company.
The independent auditors of the Company are Ernst & Young LLP, Chartered Professional Accountants, Calgary,

STATUTORY RIGHTS OF WITHDRAWAL AND RESCISSION
Securities legislation in several of the provinces of Canada provides purchasers with the right to withdraw from an 
agreement  to purchase  securities.  This right  may be exercised  within two business days after receipt or deemed
14
receipt of a prospectus and any amendment.  In  several of the provinces, securities legislation  further provides a 
purchaser with remedies for rescission or, in some jurisdictions, revisions of the price or damages if the prospectus 
and  any  amendment  thereto  contains  a  misrepresentation  or  is  not  delivered  to  the  purchaser,  provided  that  the 
remedies  for  rescission,  revision  of  the  price  or  damages  are  exercised  by  the  purchaser  within  the  time  limit 
prescribed by the securities legislation of such purchaser's province.  The purchaser should refer to any applicable 
provisions of the securities legislation of such purchaser's province for the particulars of these rights or consult with 
a legal advisor.
