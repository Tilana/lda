<p>promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, 
</p>
<p>religious and linguistic minorities, ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for 
</p>
<p>all, as well as full and effective participation in matters affecting them, contribute to the 
</p>
<p>prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving 
</p>
<p>minorities, 
</p>
