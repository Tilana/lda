</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 7/24 entitled &#8220;Elimination of violence 
against women&#8221;, mandated the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, its causes 
and consequences (hereinafter &#8220;the Special Rapporteur&#8221;) to respond effectively to reliable 
information on alleged human rights violations pertaining to violence against women, its 
causes and consequences. The resolution also requested all Governments to cooperate with 
and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of her mandated tasks and duties, to 
supply all information requested, including with regard to implementation of her 
recommendations, and to give serious consideration to her requests for visits and 
communications.  
</p>
<p>2. This addendum to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s annual report contains, on a country by 
country basis, summaries of communications (allegations letters and urgent appeals) sent to 
Governments on individual cases and general situations of concern to her mandate. This 
report includes summaries of the communications sent from 1 March 2009 to 20 March 
2010 (with respect to allegation letters), and from 3 April 2009 to 15 April 2010 (with 
respect to urgent appeals). The report also contains summaries of government replies 
received until 17 May 2010.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur recalls that in issuing urgent appeals and transmitting 
allegations, she does not make any judgment concerning the merits of the respective cases, 
nor does she necessarily support the opinions and activities of the persons on behalf of 
whom she intervenes. For reasons of confidentiality, privacy and protection, the names of 
victims appear only in initials in this report. The Special Rapporteur has also used initials 
for certain other persons concerned, other than the alleged victims, in order to minimise the 
risk of possible further victimization. Moreover, with a view to preserve the presumption of 
innocence, only initials are used for the names of alleged perpetrators. In the original 
communications, the full names of victims were provided to the Governments concerned.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Overview of communications 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>4. During the reporting cycle, the Special Rapporteur sent 38 communications to the 
following 28 Member States: Afghanistan, Angola, Central African Republic, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Iran, 
Kuwait, Malaysia, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Philippines, Republic of Moldova, 
Russian Federation, Somalia, Sudan, Turkey, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, United States 
of America, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.  
</p>
<p>5. A total of 15 communications were letters pertaining to allegations of human rights 
violations that had already occurred or reflected longstanding concerns. The other 23 cases 
were urgent appeals arising from an ongoing or imminent human rights violation where 
there was a need to inform the government authorities about the allegations received 
without delay. 
</p>
<p>6. 34 of the 38 communications were sent jointly with other mandate holders of the 
Human Rights Council, these include the following: 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders (19) </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
or punishment (15) 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of
opinion and expression (13) 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions (6) 
</p>
<p>The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (5) 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers (5) 
</p>
<p>The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (3) 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants (2) 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest
attainable standard of physical and mental health (3) 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief (2) 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially in women and children
(1) 
</p>
<p>The Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Somalia (1) 
</p>
<p>The Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights 
and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination (1) 
</p>
<p>The independent expert on minority issues (1). 
</p>
<p>7. The largest number of joint communications was sent together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. The 
Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate her underlying belief that joint communications 
reflect a deeper understanding of the convergence of the diverse forms of human rights 
violations experienced by women with more conventional forms of violations.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Cooperation and replies of Governments to the Special Rapporteur  
</b></p>
<p>8. In each communication, the Special Rapporteur requested Governments to respond 
to a detailed set of questions in order to clarify the allegations submitted. The Special 
Rapporteur remains concerned that only 14 Governments out of the 28 concerned replied to 
communications sent to them. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank Governments who 
responded to her communications during the period under review and also expresses her 
appreciation to those Governments who provided responses to communications sent in 
previous reporting periods.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur is still awaiting the responses from the following Member 
States who are yet to respond to all or some of the communications sent during the period 
under review: Afghanistan, Angola, Central African Republic, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Ecuador, 
Guatemala, Guinea, Iran, Republic of Moldova, Namibia, Nigeria, Philippines, Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Somalia, Uganda, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p><b> III. Trends and observations 
</b></p>
<p>10. The communications sent concerned a wide array of issues which reflect a pattern of 
inequality and discrimination related to violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, as defined in General Recommendation 19 of the United Nations Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the United Nations Declaration on 
the Elimination of Violence against Women1. These included: arbitrary detention, torture or 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, summary and extrajudicial 
executions; sexual violence, including rape, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation; and other 
forms of violence grounded in discrimination against women.  
</p>
<p>11. In a substantial number of cases, violations were allegedly committed by State 
agents, in particular, police officers and military personnel. The Special Rapporteur notes, 
in this respect, article 4 (b) of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against 
Women, which stipulates that States should, without delay, pursue all appropriate means 
and policies of eliminating violence against women and, to this end, should refrain from 
engaging in violence against women. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Failure to prevent and respond to violence against women with due 
diligence 
</b></p>
<p>12. According to the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women and 
other human rights instruments, States have a duty to take positive action and exercise due 
diligence to prevent and protect women from violence, to prosecute and appropriately 
sanction perpetrators of violence and to ensure that victims of violence receive 
compensation, regardless of whether the relevant acts were committed by State or non State 
actors. A failure to comply with any aspect of the due diligence obligation constitutes a 
human rights violation. 
</p>
<p>13. 23 out of 38 communications sent concerned allegations of a State failing to meet its 
obligations of due diligence in combating violence against women. In the period under 
review, the Special Rapporteur acted on cases in which authorities reportedly allowed 
investigations or prosecutions of acts of violence against women to lag, or where authorities 
failed to administer appropriate punishments and penalties to acts of violence against 
women. 
</p>
<p>14. Several of the communications sent underline that general problems of impunity and 
corruption in the public sector which are known to have exacerbated gender-based violence 
by depriving women of the option to invoke the rule of law to counter social power 
structures that systematically discriminate against women.  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall her report on the Due Diligence 
Standard as a Tool for the Elimination of Violence against Women2 and reiterate that States 
cannot delegate their human rights obligations to prevent and respond to violence against 
</p>
<p>  
 1 General Recommendation 19 defines gender-based violence &#8220;as violence directed against a woman 
</p>
<p>because she is a woman or which affects a woman disproportionately. It includes physical, mental or 
sexual harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion and other deprivations of liberty&#8221;. The 
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women defines violence against women as &#8220;any 
act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or physiological 
harm of suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of 
liberty, whether occurring in public or private life&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 2 E/CN.4/2006/61. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>women with due diligence. They must therefore make appropriate, decisive and timely 
interventions whenever public or private actors, State or traditional justice mechanisms 
engage in and condone violence against women, or otherwise fail to address it adequately. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Sexual violence and other forms of violence amounting to torture or ill-
treatment 
</b></p>
<p>16. Six out of 38 communications concern allegations of rape, sexual abuse and 
exploitation, allegedly committed, in a large majority of these cases, by State agents. 15 
other communications concern cases in which authorities were alleged to have tortured 
women or subjected them to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment 
(including sentencing to death and corporal punishment).  
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur wishes to recall that sexual violence, a pervasive 
manifestation of gender-based violence, is not restricted to specific regions, countries or 
contexts, but is a universal problem that exists in every country and region of the world, be 
it in contexts of peace, conflict, post-conflict and transitional justice. Sexual violence is 
rooted in a global culture of discrimination which results in unequal power relations 
between men and women and legitimizes the appropriation and control of women&#8217;s bodies. 
Women&#8217;s vulnerability to sexual violence is heightened by the existence of social and 
cultural norms that foster inequality, as well as by sexist policies and practices that often 
deny women effective recourse and force them to remain in violent situations. While sexual 
violence is often looked at in isolation, it often intertwines with other forms of 
discrimination, including on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual identity, social 
status or disabilities. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur notes that, in recent years, there has been an increased and 
explicit recognition of some forms of violence against women in international and national 
courts as amounting to torture and ill-treatment, the best known examples being rape by 
private or public actors in conflict or in custodial settings. Other forms of violence against 
women, such as physical or sexual violence in an intimate relationship, if committed with 
the acquiescence of the State, may qualify as torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment as well. 
</p>
<p>19. Under international human rights law, notably the Declaration on the Elimination of 
Violence against Women and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, States have the obligation to criminalize acts of torture 
and violence against women, to prosecute perpetrators and provide reparation to victims. 
Accordingly, States must do their utmost to prevent the perpetration of sexual violence, 
address any act of sexual violence and offer judicial remedies to the victims. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Violence against human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur observes an ongoing trend to subject women&#8217;s rights 
defenders to violence, including arbitrary detention and threats of violence. 19 out of 38 
communications concerned cases of this nature. 
</p>
<p>21. The great majority of the cases concerning women&#8217;s rights defenders were allegedly 
perpetrated by persons identified as State agents. The Special Rapporteur would like to 
remind Member States that by ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women they have committed to take all appropriate measures to 
eliminate discrimination against women in the political and public life of their respective 
country and, in particular, to ensure to women, on equal terms with men, the right to 
participate in non governmental organizations and associations concerned with the public </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>and political life of the country (article 7 of the Convention). Further, the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to reiterate the principle reiterated in Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 2005/38 in which the Commission calls on States to facilitate the full, equal and 
effective participation and free communication of women at all levels of decision making in 
their societies. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Violence against women facing multiple and intersecting layers of 
discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>22. 7 out of 38 of all communications sent concerned women facing multiple and 
intersecting forms of discrimination. Women belonging to national, ethnic or religious 
minorities and migrant women are represented among such reported victims.  
</p>
<p>23. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to Human Rights Council 
Resolution 7/24 and recall that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and multiple or aggravated forms of 
discrimination and disadvantage can lead to the particular targeting or vulnerability to 
violence against girls and some groups of women, such as women belonging to minority 
groups, indigenous women, refugee and internally displaced women, migrant women, 
women living in rural or remote communities, destitute women, women in institutions or in 
detention, women with disabilities, elderly women, widows and women in situations of 
armed conflict, women who are otherwise discriminated against, including on the basis of 
HIV/AIDS status and victims of commercial sexual exploitation. She also wishes to recall 
the widespread discrimination and violence suffered by some groups of women owing to 
their sexual orientation and gender identity.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Laws that discriminate against women 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur also acted upon laws, regulations, drafts and specific legal 
provisions which allegedly discriminate against women and may condone or cause violence 
against women. Several letters were sent in this respect reflecting the importance the 
Special Rapporteur attaches to addressing the full spectrum of her mandate, including the 
causes and consequences of violence against women. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
wishes to refer to relevant articles of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women which establish that States Parties, by agreeing to pursue by 
all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating discrimination against 
women, undertake: (a) To embody the principle of the equality of men and women in their 
national constitutions or other appropriate legislation if not yet incorporated therein and to 
ensure, through law and other appropriate means, the practical realization of this principle; 
(b) To adopt appropriate legislative and other measures, including sanctions where 
appropriate, prohibiting all discrimination against women; (c) To establish legal protection 
of the rights of women on an equal basis with men and to ensure through competent 
national tribunals and other public institutions the effective protection of women against any 
act of discrimination; (d) To refrain from engaging in any act or practice of discrimination 
against women and to ensure that public authorities and institutions shall act in conformity 
with this obligation; (e) To take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against 
women by any person, organization or enterprise; (f) To take all appropriate measures, 
including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices 
which constitute discrimination against women; (g) To repeal all national penal provisions 
which constitute discrimination against women.  </p>

<p>25. Communications sent and Government replies are presented in the language 
received- be it in English, French or Spanish. Replies received in other UN official 
languages have been translated into English. The Special Rapporteur provides observations 
on which additional information is required to respond effectively to the information 
received or draws the attention of Governments concerned to relevant findings and 
recommendations contained in her country or thematic reports, reports by relevant special 
procedures mandate holders and treaty bodies, and international human rights instruments.

</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>27. On <b>31 August 2009</b> the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, and 
the Independent Expert on minority issues sent an allegation letter to the Government 
regarding the <b>Shi&#8217;a Personal Status Law</b> passed and published in the official Gazette on 27 
July 2009 (Gazette 988). 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur noted that there were serious reasons for concern that the 
Shi&#8217;a Personal Status Law violated the human rights of minority Shi&#8217;a women and girls and 
was in breach of Afghanistan&#8217;s national and international obligations. The Special 
Rapporteur noted that this new law contained changes compared to an earlier version of 
March 2009 and that several contentious provisions of the law had not been adequately 
amended to ensure their compliance with Afghanistan&#8217;s international human rights 
obligations or with Afghanistan&#8217;s constitutional guarantees. 
</p>
<p>29. The following listing illustrates a number of serious human rights concerns 
contained in the provisions of the new law as published in the official Gazette on 27 July 
2009:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The law makes it impossible for Shi&#8217;a wives to inherit houses and land from their 
husbands &#8211; even though husbands may inherit them from their wives;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Only men are allowed guardianship rights;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A female virgin &#8212; whatever age she may be &#8212; is treated as a legal minor and 
requires the consent of her &#8220;guardian&#8221; to enter into marriage;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The law effectively condones the denial of maintenance by a husband to his wife if 
she refuses his sexual demands or what he perceives to be his &#8220;conjugal rights&#8221;;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A woman&#8217;s mobility, including the right to leave her house, continues to be 
potentially restricted to varying degrees, depending on the interpretations given to 
the qualifications in the provision which refer to &#8220;legitimate purposes&#8221; and &#8220;to the 
extent that local custom allows&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Under-age Shi&#8217;a girls and boys can be married against their will before the legal age 
of marriage if a guardian can demonstrate in a court that the child has the &#8220;ability 
and interest&#8221; to marry and they have reached puberty. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> (1) Are the allegations about the legal provisions of the Shi&#8217;a Personal Status 
Law accurate?  
</p>
<p> (2) Please provide details of legal and other domestic measures or mechanisms 
that can be used to challenge and review the constitutionality of the Shi&#8217;a Personal Status 
Law. In this connection, thank you for providing information on mechanisms that can be 
used to ensure that the law does not enter into force until such a judgment or conclusion on 
its legality/validity is reached. Also, please provide information on whether any such 
measures or legal actions have been taken to date.  
</p>
<p> (3) Please provide detailed information or any analysis that may have been 
conducted (and its conclusions) prior to the passing of the Shi&#8217;a Personal Status Law with 
regard to its conformity with Afghanistan&#8217;s international human rights commitments as </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>well as Afghanistan&#8217;s Constitution and other domestic legislation, including the law on the 
Elimination of Violence against Women. If such an analysis was not conducted, please 
explain why not.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the moment of finalizing the report, she had 
not received an official reply and urges the Government of Afghanistan to provide at the 
earliest possible date a detailed substantive answer to the above communication. 
</p>
<p>32. While recognising the efforts made on the part of the Government to address 
violence against women in Afghanistan, including through the adoption in 2009 of a law on 
the Elimination of Violence against Women, the Special Rapporteur regrets that the new 
Shi&#8217;a Personal Status Law does not support the positive momentum to uphold the rights of 
women and girls and protect them from the type of discrimination that so often encourages 
or leads to violence against them. She also wishes to refer to the observations made by the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief (A/HRC/13/40/ Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>  Angola 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>33. On <b>18 December 2009</b> the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment sent an allegation letter to the Government regarding <b>the alleged 
collective detention, deportation and expulsions of a large number of Congolese 
nationals to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC)</b>, since January 2009. 
</p>
<p>34. According to the information received, it was alleged that approximately 18,800 
DRC nationals had been expelled from Angola, including 16,000 of them since late August 
</p><p>2009. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur drew the Government&#8217;s attention to two instances - in May 
2009, in the Ngazi settlement in Lunda Norte province and since early October 2009 in 
Lunda Sul, Soyo and Cabinda provinces - that illustrated the human rights violations that 
often took place during these expulsions. Reportedly, refugees, asylum-seekers and irregular 
migrant workers were subjected to ill-treatment, including gender-based violence, and were 
deprived of their belongings. These acts were mostly perpetrated by Angolan security forces 
and intended to force them to return to the DRC. 
</p>
<p>36. These Congolese citizens were allegedly detained, kept in very poor conditions prior 
their expulsion, without independent monitoring for asylum seekers. The expulsion took 
place without prior authorization from a judicial body or access to legal counsel which was 
often denied to the detainees. In the context of the expulsions, many of them were subject to 
sexual violence, body searches without minimum hygienic standards increasing the risk of 
HIV transmission and theft. It was also reported that Congolese refugees were threatened by 
the local population. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur welcomed an October 2009 initiative to create a 
Commission to negotiate with the DRC on these concerns and the issuance on 13 October 
2009 of a joint communiqu&#233; from both Governments announcing the concerted cessation of 
the expulsions and the political will to find sustainable solutions to this issue. She noted 
that, according International Office for Migration-Angola, expulsions continued to occur at 
a lesser scale (150 persons expelled per day compared to 500 earlier on). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Have complaints been lodged about the alleged violations including sexual 
and gender violence?  
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide information on the existing legal framework and 
implementation procedures applied to migrants in detention and those deported and how 
theses measures are compatible with international standards. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide information on steps that have been taken with a view to 
stopping the occurrence of this and similar situations, and in particular to fulfill the 
commitments undertaken in the joint communiqu&#233; issued on 13 October 2009. 
</p>
<p> 5. Please provide information on the proposed establishment of a Commission 
to discuss the issue of collective deportations and expulsions of nationals of the DRC, 
including when it is likely to be established in practice and what functions it will perform. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the moment of finalizing the report, she had 
not received an official reply concerning the above mentioned allegations. She also wishes 
to recall that the situation of nationals of the DRC reportedly facing ill-treatment by 
Angolan security forces since at least 2005 was already the subject of an urgent appeal sent 
on 13 December 2007 (see A/HRC/7/6/Add.1) which also remained unanswered.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur reiterates her interest in receiving responses from the 
Government in regard to the allegations of serious human rights violations committed by the 
Angolan security forces during expulsion operations, including systematic use of physical 
and sexual violence towards migrants from the DRC. She would be particularly interested to 
know whether these cases have resulted in any prosecutions of alleged perpetrators, and 
whether victims of sexual violence, including rape, have been granted reparation 
</p>
<p><b>  Canada 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Response received to a communication sent earlier 
</b></p>
<p>41. In a letter dated <b>16 February 2010</b>, the Government provided complementary 
information, further to the request of the previous Special Rapporteur in a follow-up letter 
sent on 17 November 2008 concerning acts of ritual abuse against <b>Ms. A.C </b>(see 
A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 for a summary of the allegation letter and the follow-up letter by the 
Special Rapporteur).  
</p>
<p>42. In its letter, the Government informed that it succeeded, with the complainant&#8217;s 
consent, to obtain from the police of Alberta a substantial number of police, medical and 
child welfare records concerning the complainant. These records indicated that the 
complainant had been in frequent contact with child welfare authorities since at least 1998 
(when she was 14 years old) and received regular counseling to help her deal with her 
suicidal tendencies, depression and past sexual abuse. 
</p>
<p>43. In 1999, she alleged that her father was sexually abusing her; she was removed from 
the family home and placed in foster care for three months. She later recanted the allegation 
and authorities determined that she had made the allegation in order to avoid returning to 
her parents&#8217; care. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>44. The records indicated that at other various times child welfare authorities were 
informed of different aspects of her past sexual abuse. Her parents stated that she had told 
them she has been sexually assaulted by a babysitter and the babysitter&#8217;s father; and that she 
had been sexually abused by her father, as well as by others, from around the time she was 3 
or 5 until the age of 14 or 15. 
</p>
<p>45. In 2002, her parents stated that they were no longer able to keep her at home because 
of what they said was her uncontrollable behavior and the emotional problems it was 
causing for her family. She was placed in care until her 18th birthday later that year. Upon 
leaving the child welfare system, it appeared that she continued to have frequent contact 
with the adult mental health system. 
</p>
<p>46. An incomplete list of health services made available to A.C. indicated that between 
July 2001 and December 2005 the province provided over 300 medical services to the 
complainant. The police records indicate that between August 2002 and February 2008, the 
complainant was in contact with the Calgary police twenty-four times. On eighteen of those 
occasions, she was transported to the hospital out of concern for her mental health, on a 
number of occasions having threatened or attempted suicide. On ten occasions, she 
complained of having been the victim of sexual assault. 
</p>
<p>47. The Government summarized some police records of the incidents involving the 
following sexual assault allegations: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 12 September 2002, the complainant was found by the police lying in a fetal 
position by a pay phone, from which she had called the Distress Center. She told 
police she had been kidnapped and gang raped when she was seven years old and 
she repeatedly stated that it was not her fault that she had broken the camera. The 
police transported her to a hospital under a mental health warrant. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 12 November 2002, the complainant called the police from a pay phone, 
complaining of a sexual assault by her father. When the police arrived, she refused 
to provide any information. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 31 January 2003, the complainant went to a hospital, complaining of a sexual 
assault by her father. She initially agreed to the collection of physical sexual assault 
evidence, but when a doctor attempted to examine her, she refused to be examined. 
A detective from Calgary Sex Crimes Unit twice attempted to meet with the 
complainant, and on both times she refused to meet with police. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 1 January 2004, the complainant told a worker at a local women&#8217;s shelter that 
her father had sexually abused her for nineteen years. She stated that her father was 
a member of a Mormon cult, and she stated that they had sacrificed at least two 
babies. When the women&#8217;s shelter worker called the police, two detectives from the 
Calgary Sex Crimes Unit went to meet Ms. A.C. She told the police that she would 
not provide any more information or cooperate with a police investigation; she also 
stated that she would contact the police when she would feel ready. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 18 March 2004, a worker at another women&#8217;s shelter called the police, advising 
them that the complainant has been calling the shelter periodically, complaining that 
she had been sexually assaulted by her father, who belonged to a cult which 
sacrifices babies. When the police visited the complainant, she was verbally abusive 
and refused to provide any details of the allegations, although she agreed to be 
transported to the hospital. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 12 June 2004, the complainant called the police and said that she had been 
sexually assaulted earlier in the day by her father. She stated that after the assault, 
her father poured bleach from toilet bowl cleaner into her vagina to destroy the 
evidence. She was transported to the hospital and several care workers attempted to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>speak to her, however she refused to provide any details regarding the sexual assault. 
A police officer sat with Ms. A.C. for three hours, during which time she stated that 
her father was the leader of a Mormon cult and that they torture anyone who speaks 
to outsiders. She described four methods of torture: electrocution, beating bottoms 
of feet with sticks, hanging upside down for long periods of time, and placing 
needles between fingers, toes and the groin area. She continued to refuse to provide 
details of the sexual assault, and refused treatment and a physical examination by a 
physician. She insisted that the police not visit her residence in search of any 
evidence. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 13 June 2004, Ms. A.C. called the police and said that her father had sexually 
assaulted her earlier in the day in her apartment. When the police arrived, she 
refused to provide any details and did not want to cooperate with an investigation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 13 July 2004, the complainant attended the Calgary Police station and spoke to 
two detectives with the Sex Crimes Unit. She stated that she had been sexually 
assaulted hundreds of times by her father since she was 3 years of age. She had also 
reported having been sexually assaulted by other men, who were members of the 
same Mormon cult as her father. These were the same people who sacrificed babies 
at special ceremonies. The complainant agreed to provide more details at a later 
date. Several meeting were set, but each time, the complainant cancelled and 
eventually said that she did not want to provide any details. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 24 September 2004, the complainant called the Distress Center, saying she was 
going to kill herself. The police found her hanging from a cord in her closet. She 
was taken down and treated by emergency medical workers. She stated that she had 
been sexually assaulted by her father over the past five days. She was admitted to 
hospital. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 7 January 2006, the complainant called police and stated that she was sexually 
assaulted by her father the day before. The police attended her residence, and she 
provided a vague and inconsistent statement. She agreed to comply with a physical 
sexual assault examination, and exhibits were collected. Initially, she agreed to 
provide a statement, but after several attempts by a detective to meet with her, she 
stated that she did not want to continue with her complaint. 
</p>
<p>48. In its response, the Government drew to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention that the 
documentary record appeared to corroborate the complainant&#8217;s allegation that she made 
numerous disclosures of the sexual abuse by her father and others to social workers, medical 
specialists and the police. The records do not confirm that her complaints were not taken 
seriously; the police records in particular strongly suggested that the reason for not having 
brought any criminal charges against her father or others was that she failed or was unable 
to provide sufficient detail of the incidents to conduct investigations, or simply did not want 
to pursue with her complaints. 
</p>
<p>49. The Government added that Canada took seriously the complainant&#8217;s allegations, 
but informed that without the victim&#8217;s cooperation it was maybe not going to be possible to 
bring the alleged abusers to justice. Her cooperation with investigators was deemed crucial 
with regard to any potential charges or subsequent criminal prosecution. 
</p>
<p>50. Moreover, the Government attached five Appendixes to its response. Appendix A 
included the most relevant standards to the complainant&#8217;s allegations, asked by Department 
of Justice (DOJ) on the policies and/or guidelines that the Government of Alberta and its 
police services are required to follow with regard to sexual assault investigations, child 
abuse allegations and victims of crime. It was explained that the Government of Alberta is 
responsible for ensuring the adequate and effective policing is maintained throughout the 
Province. In addition, it was noted that the Solicitor General and Minister of Public Security </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>is responsible for policing standards pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Alberta Police Act and 
that, concerning the investigations, the police has as its core function the ability to 
investigate crimes. The standards identify elements that are common to every investigation. 
Furthermore, the police service may enter into a mutual aid or shared service agreement 
with another police service to ensure the availability of resources required to meet a 
particular standards. Domestic violence was defined &#8220;when there is any use of physical or 
sexual force, actual or threatened, in an intimate relationship.It may include a dingle act or a 
pattern of abuse that may include: physical, emotional, psychological, or sexual abuse. It 
can also include stalking and threats to children, other family members, pets and property&#8221;. 
Concerning assistance to victims or witnesses, the Government stated that the &#8220;police 
services shall take reasonable steps to protect the personal rights and safety of victims and 
witnesses&#8221; and &#8220;be particularly sensitive to the special needs of victims and their families in 
crimes such as domestic violence, child abuse, sexual assault, abuse of elderly, and hate 
crimes&#8221;. &#8220;The standards [&#8230;] are designed to ensure that victims and other witnesses are 
handled in a way that acknowledges their important investigative and prosecutorial role&#8221;. 
Finally, Appendix A explained the management of evidence and property in police control 
which have to be seen through a reliable system for maintaining the integrity of all 
evidence. 
</p>
<p>51. Appendix B concerned the Domestic Violence Protocol which states that &#8220;it is the 
responsibility of the service to respond and investigate all reported incidents of domestic 
conflict&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>52. Appendix C informed about the services available to victims in Alberta as stated by 
the Alberta Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) of 1997.  
</p>
<p>53. Appendix D contained the articles 151, 152, 153, 155 and 170-172 of the amended 
Criminal Code, concerning sexual offences against children and youth, as well as other 
relevant articles. 
</p>
<p>54. Appendix E contained the Section 269.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada, with 
regard to torture. 
</p>
<p>55. According to the Government, on the basis of the facts available, the police 
investigations into the complainant&#8217;s allegations were fully consistent with the requirements 
of the Protocol. The complainant applied for compensation and received financial 
compensation under the Financial Benefit Program for sexual assault victims. The 
complainant received $4,000 in 2002 for a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in 2001 in 
Medicine Hat, Alberta. The accused was not the father and the charges against the accused 
were withdrawn by the Crown prosecutor who concluded, on further investigation, that 
there were serious questions as to whether the incident had ever occurred. 
</p>
<p>56. The Government considered that the criminal justice system&#8217;s response to the 
complainant&#8217;s allegations was appropriate, thorough and sensitive to her personal 
circumstances. The records indicated that extensive police, medical, psychological and 
victim support services were provided to the complainant over the course of a number of 
years, and that she had received a financial award for at least one alleged incident. 
</p>
<p>57. The Government encouraged the complainant to contact Calgary Police Services if 
she would want to pursue criminal charges and be willing to fully cooperate with the 
investigation. 
</p>
<p>58. The Government also included legislative or regulatory measures in place in Canada 
to address the problem of &#8220;ritual abuse-torture&#8221; committed by private individuals or 
organizations or by public actors. The Government noted that the term &#8220;torture&#8221; was not 
appropriate in the case of Ms. A.C. and drew to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention the 
definition of the Article 1 of the Convention against Torture. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>59. Finally the Government explained that there had been a follow-up to the 1993 report 
by the Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women. In 1993, the Canadian Panel on 
Violence Against Women, in its report <i>Changing the Landscape: Ending Violence and 
Achieving Equality</i>, noted that violence against women is multi-dimensional and has 
physical, sexual, psychological, financial and spiritual aspect. The Panel recognized an 
under-acknowledged form of violence against women which it termed &#8220;ritual abuse&#8221;. Ritual 
abuse was defined by the Panel as &#8220;a combination of severe physical, sexual, psychological 
and spiritual abuse used systematically and in combination with symbols, ceremonies and/or 
group activities that have a religious, magical or supernatural connotation. Victims are 
terrorized into silence by repetitive abuse over time and indoctrinated into the beliefs and 
practices of the cult group&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>60. The Panel proposed a two-pronged plan to address the problem of violence against 
women. The first prong was an Equality Action Plan to deal with the inequality that makes 
women particularly vulnerable to violence. Lack of equality rights, unequal access to the 
legal system, lack of political and public service participation, the tax system and other 
economic issues &#8211; and aimed for the maintenance or creation of specific mechanisms to 
foster women&#8217;s equality. 
</p>
<p>61. The second prong was a Zero Tolerance Policy, which was based on the position 
that &#8220;no level of violence is acceptable, and women&#8217;s safety and equality are priorities&#8221;. The 
Panel recommended that all organizations and institutions review their programs, practices 
and products in light of the Zero Tolerance Policy, which they should use as a tool for 
creating a violence-free environment and for monitoring that environment. The policy 
should also be applied in key sectors of society, such as health and social services, legal 
institutions, workplaces, the military, educational settings, the federal government and 
religious institutions. 
</p>
<p>62. Canada&#8217;s response to the report began with a comprehensive plan outlined in <i>Setting 
the Stage for the Next Century: The Federal Plan for Gender Equality</i> (1995), and has 
continued with a multi-faceted, ongoing effort to achieve gender equality and to reduce 
violence against women. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Canada for its 
detailed reply to her predecessor&#8217;s follow-up letter, and wishes to congratulate the 
Government for the legislative and regulatory measures put in place, as well as for the 
research conducted, on the problem of &#8220;ritual abuse-torture&#8221; committed by private 
individuals or organizations and by public actors. She is also grateful for the information 
provided in respect of the Government&#8217;s efforts to eliminate violence against women and to 
achieve gender equality.

</p>
<p>65. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, A.N., alors mineure, aurait &#233;t&#233; enferm&#233;e avec des 
adultes dans la prison pr&#233;fectorale de Mobaye et aurait &#233;t&#233; maintenue en prison sans 
condamnation, en raison de l&#8217;absence d&#8217;un juge pour mineurs &#224; Mobaye. 
</p>
<p>66. En d&#233;cembre 2008, un gar&#231;on de 12 ans s&#8217;est noy&#233; dans le fleuve Oubangui &#224; 
Mobaye. Selon la croyance, cette noyade aurait &#233;t&#233; provoqu&#233;e par des personnes 
transform&#233;es en serpents. A.N aurait &#233;t&#233; frapp&#233;e, afin qu&#8217;elle soit oblig&#233;e de d&#233;noncer ces 
personnes. Les deux personnes cit&#233;es par A.N. auraient &#233;t&#233; imm&#233;diatement emprisonn&#233;es. 
</p>

&#171; talimbi &#187; (m&#233;tamorphose en sango). 
</p>
<p>68. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 29 juin 2009, A.N aurait &#233;t&#233; accus&#233;e responsable de 
la maladie et de la mort de la femme du responsable de prison. Ce dernier aurait donn&#233; 
l&#8217;ordre &#224; deux prisonniers d&#8217;approcher du feu les bras d&#8217;A.N. couverts de p&#233;trole. Celle-ci 
serait rest&#233;e une journ&#233;e et une nuit dans sa cellule sans aucun soin, avant d&#8217;&#234;tre transf&#233;r&#233;e &#224;

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the moment of finalizing the report, she had 
not received a reply from the Government of Central African Republic concerning the 
above mentioned allegations. She wishes to recall that violence done to women based on 
accusations of witchcraft is closely linked to the low status of women in society and unequal 
gender relations, and used as a tool of domination and control over women. In this regard, 
she wishes to remind the Government of Central African Republic that addressing impunity 
for acts of violence occurring in the private sphere &#8211; without invoking any custom, tradition 
or religious consideration- is also part of the due diligence obligation of the State. She also 
wishes to encourage the authorities in Central African Republic to adopt all appropriate </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>measures, especially in the field of education, to modify the social and cultural patterns of 
conduct of men and women and to eliminate prejudices, customary practices and all other 
practices based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes and on 
stereotyped roles for men and women. She also wishes to refer to the section of report 
A/HRC/11/2 of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
devoted to the persecution and killing of individuals, particularly women, on accusations of 
witchcraft.  
</p>
<p><b>  China 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Responses to communications sent earlier  
</b></p>
<p>72. In a letter dated <b>2 September 2008</b>, the Government replied to a communication 
dated 17 July 2008 concerning the case of <b>Ms. M. H., </b>a reproductive and housing rights 
activist who had petitioned against family planning policies and forced evictions since 1989 
(see summary of the communication in the previous report on communications to and from 
Governments, A/HRC/11/6/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>73. In its response, the Government informed that Ms. M.H, female, was a native of 
Shanghai, born in 1961. On 16 April 2007, she was sentenced by the Yangpu District 
People&#8217;s Court to a term of imprisonment of two years and six months (from 30 May 2006 
to 29 November 2008) for the crime of wilful destruction of property. It was noted that she 
was currently serving her sentence in the Shanghai Women&#8217;s Prison. 
</p>
<p>74. The Government further noted that a medical examination of Ms. M. H. upon her 
admission to the prison indicated that she suffered from hypertension but that otherwise her 
health was normal. She was ordered to follow the medical treatment prescribed by the 
doctor and given an appointment for a subsequent exam. On 3 June she entered the 
infirmary with stomachache, diarrhea and an elevated white blood cell count. She was 
treated with fluids, and when a follow-up exam on 11 June revealed no symptoms of any 
kind, the treatment was stopped. 
</p>
<p>75. It was also indicated that, in prison Ms. M. H. shared housing with two other 
persons. The prison cell had four windows, each with a surface area of 2.8 square metres. 
The cell itself had a surface area of 36.7 square metres and was open from north to south, so 
that there was excellent light and ventilation; the cell also had a separate washroom. With 
regard to the covering up of the windows, it has been determined that in late 2007 the prison 
was in the process of rebuilding the dormitory roof; in order to provide temporary 
protection against the dust, newspapers were pasted over all the windows in the building. 
The intent was not simply to block off Ms. M. H&#8217;s windows. 
</p>
<p>76. The Government further indicated that, to date Ms. H. H. had not drafted any 
complaint, nor had she applied to meet with a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>77. It was finally noted that the prison police dealt with criminals in a civilized manner 
and in accordance with the law, and that Ms. M. H. enjoyed the same rights as the other 
offenders, namely the right to health and the right to lodge a complaint, and all rights of 
which prisoners have not been deprived are protected by law. The Government concluded 
that the allegations raised in the communication were inconsistent with the facts. 
</p>
<p>78. In a letter dated <b>7 August 2008</b> the Government replied to a communication sent on 
7 May 2008 concerning the case of <b>Ms. J.K, </b>a well-known Tibetan writer and musician 
who published articles on women's issues in Tibet (see summary of the communication in 
the previous report on communications to and from Governments, A/HRC/11/6/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>79. The Government informed that J.K. was an editor at the Qinghai provincial 
television station. On 1 April 2008, pursuant to article 9 of the Police Law, she was taken by </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b>  
</p>
<p>Xining police officers, who first showed their badges, to the public security bureau for 
questioning in accordance with the law in response to accusations that she was suspected of 
having committed a criminal offence. The Government informed that questioning revealed 
that she was in fact a criminal suspect. In order to help determine the facts of the case, the 
public security authorities questioned J. K further and also conducted a search of her home, 
in accordance with the law, seizing certain items, including her computer. On 3 April, the 
public security authorities, acting in accordance with the law, placed J.K. in criminal 
detention and held her in the Xining municipal detention facility. In accordance with the 
relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, the 
Xining police opened a case for investigation and prosecution in respect of J.K., who was 
charged with advocating splitting of the State. On 20 April, the Xining police, taking into 
consideration the serious illness of her father and the young age of her child, modified the 
coercive measures taken in respect of her and released her on bail on humanitarian grounds. 
</p>
<p>80. The Government indicated that J. K. was not arrested but was placed in criminal 
detention pursuant to article 61 of the Criminal Procedure Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of 
China. Her personal property was not confiscated but was lawfully seized pursuant to article 
114 of the Criminal Procedure Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. It was further noted 
that the public security authorities handled the case in strict accordance with the relevant 
Chinese legislation, and J.K. was neither subjected to or at risk of ill-treatment.

contre les femmes, y compris ses causes et ses cons&#233;quences, a envoy&#233; une lettre 
d&#8217;all&#233;gation concernant <b>le nombre croissant d&#8217;incidents de violence contre les femmes et

violence ont &#233;t&#233; fournies &#224; l&#8217;attention de la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale. 
</p>
<p>82. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 21 mai 2009, un Gu&#233;r&#233;, ancien membre d&#8217;une 
milice, aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; par la police de Duekou&#233;. Il aurait &#233;t&#233; impliqu&#233; dans le viol de 
plusieurs b&#233;b&#233;s et fillettes entre 3 et 10 ans en mars et avril 2009. Celui-ci les aurait 
enlev&#233;es pendant la nuit dans leurs chambres &#224; coucher.  
</p>
<p>83. En mai 2009, une jeune &#233;tudiante de 13 ans aurait &#233;t&#233; viol&#233;e par deux instituteurs. 
Huit autres cas de tentatives de viols par des individus arm&#233;s auraient &#233;t&#233; rapport&#233;s. 
</p>
<p>84. Dans une zone d&#233;sign&#233;e autrefois comme la &#171; Zone de Confiance &#187;, ainsi que dans 
les r&#233;gions &#224; l&#8217;ouest du pays, des cas de viols collectifs auraient &#233;t&#233; perp&#233;tr&#233;s par des 
groupes de 2 &#224; 12 bandits arm&#233;s et masqu&#233;s, en particulier sur les passag&#232;res utilisant les 
transports publics. 
</p>
<p>85. D&#8217;apr&#232;s d&#8217;autres rapports transmis &#224; la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale, les cas de trafic de 
femmes, incluant des mineures, aux fins d&#8217;exploitation sexuelle, seraient &#224; la hausse. Ces 
rapports indiquent que l&#8217;on promettrait des emplois &#224; ces femmes mais qu&#8217;elles seraient 
viol&#233;es et forc&#233;es &#224; la prostitution &#224; leur arriv&#233;e en C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. Dans l&#8217;un des cas 
rapport&#233;s, deux Nig&#233;riennes &#226;g&#233;es de 15 et 19 ans auraient &#233;t&#233; dup&#233;es de la sorte pour 
ensuite &#234;tre viol&#233;es par des clients. 
</p>
<p>86. Des craintes ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es par rapport &#224; une augmentation apparente de la 
violence &#224; l&#8217;&#233;gard des femmes et fillettes, incluant de violence de nature sexuelle. Cette 
augmentation est d&#8217;autant plus pr&#233;occupante puisque ce genre de crimes semble &#234;tre 
caract&#233;ris&#233; par un haut degr&#233; d&#8217;impunit&#233;. Les femmes et les fillettes seraient soumises &#224; des 
formes particuli&#232;res de violence sexuelle, y compris le viol, la mutilation g&#233;nitale f&#233;minine, </p>

</p>
<p>87. M&#234;me si ces violations seraient &#233;galement perp&#233;tr&#233;es par des civils, plusieurs des 
rapports re&#231;us font &#233;tat de violence contre les femmes dans les r&#233;gions ouest et nordiques du 
pays o&#249; l&#8217;on retrouve une forte concentration de membres de milices et groupes arm&#233;s ainsi 
que d&#8217;anciens combattants. Tandis que dans le nord du pays les cas de violations des droits 
humains avec impunit&#233; seraient instigu&#233;s par l&#8217;absence de l&#8217;&#233;tat de droit et d&#8217;autorit&#233; 
&#233;tatique, la violence contre les femmes semblerait &#234;tre perp&#233;tu&#233;e dans plusieurs autres 
parties du pays par : des pratiques traditionnelles ; des croyances persistantes, incluant 
reli&#233;es aux viols d&#8217;enfants ; la faible connaissance du public en g&#233;n&#233;ral des droits de la 
femme ; l&#8217;impunit&#233; due &#224; la corruption et l&#8217;incapacit&#233; du syst&#232;me judiciaire &#224; saisir ces cas 
de mani&#232;re ad&#233;quate (e. g. le faible taux de poursuites des pr&#233;sum&#233;s coupables) ; la crainte 
de stigmatisation et de possibles repr&#233;sailles dirig&#233;es vers la victime elle-m&#234;me et sa 
famille. Ceci aurait pour r&#233;sultat un nombre tr&#232;s bas de cas rapport&#233;s dans les faits, 
l&#8217;abandon des proc&#233;dures initi&#233;es ainsi que la f&#233;minisation de la pauvret&#233;.

a &#233;t&#233; not&#233;e suite &#224; la signature de l&#8217;Accord Politique de Ouagadougou le 4 mars 2007. 
D&#8217;autres mesures positives prises par le Gouvernement signalaient aussi un certain progr&#232;s, 
telles que l&#8217;adoption d&#8217;un nombre de lois punissant la violence contre les femmes, la 
ratification d&#8217;instruments r&#233;gionaux et internationaux prot&#233;geant les femmes et les fillettes, 
et son engagement dans une proc&#233;dure de r&#233;forme li&#233;e &#224; la s&#233;curit&#233; ainsi que l&#8217;&#233;laboration 
d&#8217;un plan strat&#233;gique national visant &#224; combattre la violence contre les femmes.  
</p>
<p>89. Toutefois, la question de la violence contre les femmes et fillettes demeure 
pr&#233;occupante. Par exemple, certaines des lois relatives &#224; la violence contre les femmes 
contiendraient des articles per&#231;us comme discriminatoires et laisseraient une trop grande 
discr&#233;tion aux d&#233;cideurs. En particulier, l&#8217;article 354 du Code P&#233;nal n&#8217;incorporait pas les 
&#233;l&#233;ments devant &#234;tre pr&#233;sents pour constituer le crime de viol, ce qui m&#232;nerait &#224; des 
d&#233;cisions incompatibles avec les normes internationales. Il arriverait &#233;galement que des 
accusations pour viol soient class&#233;es comme &#8216;attentat &#224; la pudeur&#8217;, un d&#233;lit moins grave.  
</p>
<p>90. Les efforts visant la promotion des droits de la femme apparaissaient insuffisants, 
tels que le d&#233;montraient le faible niveau de participation des femmes au sein des 
m&#233;canismes d&#233;cisionnels et &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;rieur du processus de paix, ainsi que la discrimination 
pr&#233;dominante contre les femmes et la disparit&#233; des genres &#224; tous les niveaux, incluant 
l&#8217;acc&#232;s aux droits socio-&#233;conomiques de base. 
</p>
<p>91. En outre, la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale a demand&#233; des clarifications de la part du 
Gouvernement sur les points suivants : 
</p>
<p> 1. Les faits tels que relat&#233;s dans le r&#233;sum&#233; des cas ainsi que la description

<p>92. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the moment of finalizing the report, she had 
not received an official reply and urges the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to provide at the

of post-conflict reconstruction are critical to stability and inclusive governance, and 
encourages the Government to further promote reforms in its policies, laws and institutions 
to that effect. She also wishes to recall the obligation by States under international human 
rights law to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with national 
legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the 
State or by private persons.

not received a reply from the Government concerning the communications sent on 13 and 
30 October 2009 and 16 March 2010. She wishes to refer to the second joint report of seven 
United Nations experts on the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo 
(A/HRC/13/63), in which she noted that limited progress has been made in implementing 
the recommendations of the previous joint report with regard to the protection of women&#8217;s 
human rights and the promotion of gender equality, and that violence against women 
remains rampant throughout the country, particularly in the East. The report highlights a 
worrisome trend of certain officials trying to delegitimize and harass human rights 
defenders, which fuels an increase in violence, intimidation and threats against defenders. 
Women human rights defenders, particularly women working in rural communities on cases 
of sexual violence and as peace mediators, often fall victim to reprisal attacks &#8211; including 
sexual assaults &#8211; against them and their families, and are forced to move to safer locations.

horas, dos hombres y dos mujeres conocidos de la Sra. R.E.M.C. habr&#237;an venido a su casa 
ubicada en el Barrio 13 de Abril del centro parroquial de Molleturo y la habr&#237;an atacado 
verbal y f&#237;sicamente.  
</p>
<p>112. Las cuatro personas habr&#237;an entrado por la fuerza a la casa de la Sra. R.E.M.C. y 
habr&#237;an dicho: &#8220;vaga, por vaga andas haciendo problema&#8230; no ves que las mineras van a 
traer trabajo&#8230; vaga, porque no tienes que hacer andas fastidiando&#8221;. La Sra. R.E.M.C. 
habr&#237;a sido agredida f&#237;sicamente, junto con su hijo, en presencia de sus dos nietos de 2 y 5 
a&#241;os. La Sra. R.E.M.C. habr&#237;a recibido patadas y golpes y habr&#237;a sido arrastrada del cabello 
hasta la calle. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, la agresi&#243;n termin&#243; con la intervenci&#243;n de 
personas en la calle. Como resultado del ataque, la Sra. R.E.M.C. habr&#237;a sufrido contusiones 
por todo el cuerpo, as&#237; como hinchazones en la cabeza y heridas como consecuencia del 
pelo que le fue arrancado. 
</p>
<p>113. El d&#237;a 23 de abril la Sra. R.E.M.C. habr&#237;a puesto una denuncia ante la Fiscal&#237;a de 
Cuenca. Se aleg&#243; que los agresores estaban a la espera de recibir trabajo en la miner&#237;a, 
concretamente en la empresa EcuadorGold.  
</p>

integrante del Frente de Mujeres Defensoras de la Pachamama, tambi&#233;n habr&#237;a sido atacada 
en la parroquia Victoria del Portete. Sus agresores no habr&#237;an sido procesados o 
condenados. 
</p>
<p>115. En visto de lo aqu&#237; resumido se expres&#243; temor que estos ataques podr&#237;an estar 
directamente relacionados con el trabajo leg&#237;timo que realizan las Sras. R.E.M.C. y G.L.J.B. 
en defensa de los derechos humanos, en particular en relaci&#243;n con los problemas que 
enfrentan las mujeres como resultado de los proyectos mineros. Se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n

sido agredida f&#237;sicamente dentro del ayuntamiento de Nebaj. El 3 de julio de 2009 un

de julio de 2009, la Sra. J.B.V. habr&#237;a recibido una llamada de un hombre no identificado 
quien le habr&#237;a dicho que el ayuntamiento lo hab&#237;a contratado para asesinarla. 
</p>
<p>120. A pesar de que habr&#237;a beneficiado de medidas de protecci&#243;n provisionales por parte 
de la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos, la Sra. J.B.V. habr&#237;a sido objeto 
repetidamente de amenazas e intimidaciones, siendo incluso seguida por veh&#237;culos 
sospechosos. Adem&#225;s, habr&#237;an intentado intimidar a miembros de su familia. Otros 
miembros de la Red de Mujeres Ixhiles tambi&#233;n habr&#237;an recibido amenazas y habr&#237;an sido 
objetos de difamaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>121. La Relatora especial expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n a que las amenazas y asalto f&#237;sico contra

<p>123. El <b>1 de octubre de 2009</b> la Relatora especial sobre la violencia contra la mujer, con 
inclusi&#243;n de sus causas y consecuencias junto con la Relatora especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de 
los defensores de los derechos humanos envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente al Gobierno de 
Guatemala en relaci&#243;n con la <b>Sra. N.C.</b>, Directora de la Fundaci&#243;n Sobrevivientes, una

</p>
<p>124. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 19 de septiembre de 2009, un hombre no 
identificado habr&#237;a dejado un mensaje de amenaza en contra de sus hijos en el tel&#233;fono 
celular de la Sra. N.C., pidiendo que dejara el caso de [nombre de la persona]. El mismo d&#237;a, 
un hombre no identificado habr&#237;a llamado a las oficinas de la Fundaci&#243;n diciendo lo mismo 
a un miembro de dicha Fundaci&#243;n. El caso en cuesti&#243;n se refer&#237;a a la presunta violaci&#243;n de 
una joven a la que la Sra. N.C. estuvo ofreciendo asistencia jur&#237;dica. Algunos familiares de 
la joven que le habr&#237;an apoyado despu&#233;s del ataque habr&#237;an sido asesinados. 
</p>
<p>125. El 14 de agosto de 2009, el yerno de la Sra. N.C. habr&#237;a sido seguido por un 
veh&#237;culo oscuro con cristales polarizados. Al llegar a su casa, al mismo tiempo que la

toda velocidad al percatar la presencia de la polic&#237;a. 
</p>
<p>126. Al parecer, desde final de julio, algunos hombres no identificados habr&#237;an estado 
vigilando las oficinas de la Fundaci&#243;n. El 14 de mayo de 2009, un hombre no identificado 
habr&#237;a dejado dos mensajes en el contestador autom&#225;tico de la Sra. N.C., amenazando con 
matarla a ella y a los otros integrantes de la Fundaci&#243;n Sobrevivientes.

</p>
<p>143. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 28 septembre 2009, pr&#232;s de 50 000 personnes 
manifestant contre une &#233;ventuelle candidature du Capitaine Moussa Dadis Camara aux 
&#233;lections pr&#233;sidentielles de janvier 2010 auraient d&#233;fil&#233; dans les rues et se seraient 
regroup&#233;es dans un stade de Conakry. Les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; seraient intervenues afin 
d&#8217;&#233;vacuer le stade en utilisant des gaz lacrymog&#232;nes et leurs armes &#224; feu. Celles-ci auraient 
tir&#233; en l&#8217;air, mais auraient &#233;galement ouvert le feu en direction de la foule.

auraient &#233;t&#233; tu&#233;es et plus d&#8217;un millier bless&#233;es. De nombreuses femmes participant &#224; la 
manifestation, ou se trouvant dans la zone, auraient &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;es par les forces de s&#233;curit&#233;, 
d&#233;shabill&#233;es et soumises &#224; des violences sexuelles, notamment des attouchements, des viols, 
y compris collectifs, aussi bien dans le stade que plus tard dans des lieux de d&#233;tention.

personnes risquaient d&#8217;&#234;tre tortur&#233;es ou de dispara&#238;tre. Le 6 octobre 2009, certaines familles 
n&#8217;avaient toujours aucune nouvelle de leurs proches qui auraient particip&#233; &#224; la 
manifestation. Plusieurs dizaines de manifestants auraient &#233;t&#233; d&#233;tenus et aucun d&#8217;entre eux 
n&#8217;aurait &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233; &#224; un juge.

adolescents. Des membres des forces de s&#233;curit&#233; auraient proc&#233;d&#233; &#224; l&#8217;enl&#232;vement de 
cadavres des lieux de la manifestation ainsi que des h&#244;pitaux et les auraient emmen&#233;s dans 
des lieux inconnus. A l&#8217;h&#244;pital Ignace Deen de Conakry, plusieurs dizaines de corps

<p><b>  Observations

<p>148. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the moment of finalizing the report, she had 
not received a reply from the Government of Guinea concerning the above mentioned 
allegations and urges the Government to adopt all the necessary measures for protecting the 
rights and freedoms of those individuals mentioned in these cases, as well as to investigate, 
prosecute and impose adequate sanctions to all the responsible individuals of the alleged 
violations. She also wishes to refer to the findings of the report of the International 
Commission of Inquiry mandated to establish the facts and circumstances of the events of 
28 September 2009 in Guinea (A/2009/693), which confirmed, amongst other human rights 
violations, that at least 109 women were subjected to rape and other forms of sexual 
violence, including sexual mutilation and sexual slavery, and that several women died of 
their wounds following particularly cruel sexual attacks.   
</p>
<p><b>  India 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>149. On <b>29 July 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders sent an allegation letter to the Government regarding <b>Dr. H.K.</b>, a 
citizen of India and resident of Patiala, Punjab, representing Mbororo Social and Cultural 
Development Association (MBOSCUDA). 
</p>
<p>150. At the 11th session of the Human Rights Council in June 2009, Dr. H.K. delivered a 
public statement, as part as the general debate, under agenda item N&#176;3. His written and oral 
statement pertained to violence against women, particularly on human rights violations 
against women in India in the form of female feticide, female infanticide, dowry practices 
and rape. In this statement Dr. H.K. expressed general concern about these human rights 
violations and provided some supporting statistics. 
</p>
<p>151. According to information received, following this statement, on 8 June 2009, Dr. 
H.K. was reportedly approached by a person who identified herself as a &#8220;very senior 
Government official of India&#8221; in the Palais des Nations building in Geneva and was verbally 
threatened by this individual who told her that high-ranking officials in India and the Punjab 
region had been contacted about her statements, inquiring about her family&#8217;s whereabouts, 
and told her that she could harm her once she was back in India. Subsequently, an employee 
described as being from the Central Government (CBI), visited Dr. H.K.&#8217;s house in the 
Punjab region, to also enquire about her statement at the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>152. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged accurate?  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>36</b>  
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide details of any measures taken to promote the rights of women 
to participate in the public and political life of the country, including in relation to the 
human rights situation of women in India, and to protect them from acts of retaliation by 
state and non state actors. In particular, are there programmes in place to raise awareness of 
the rights of women, including women&#8217;s human rights defenders among government staff, 
and to receive complaints of threats or other human rights violations committed by 
government employees? 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide information on any follow up action or measure taken with 
regard to this case, and whether the victim was provided and/or assured of protection 
against any eventual form of retaliation or threat of such.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>153. In a letter dated <b>29 December 2009</b>, the Government responded to the 
communication sent on 29 July 2009 indicating that it had examined the communication and 
found the allegations to be inaccurate. The Government indicated that no Government of 
India official contacted the subject in Geneva on 8 June 2009. As regards the allegation of a 
visit by an official of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to her house in Punjab, the 
allegation had been investigated by the local office of the CBI that had found it to be untrue. 
Subsequent to the allegation, the CBI had contacted the subject and provided her with 
contact details to help her in case any person approached the subject at the behest of the CBI

<p><b>  Response received to a communication sent earlier 
</b></p>
<p>154. In a letter dated <b>23 June 2009</b>, the Government responded to a previous 
communication sent on 5 March 2008 (available in the 2008 communications report of the 
Special Rapporteur A.HRC.11.6.Add.1). The Government indicated that it had examined 
the complaint and found the facts of the specific complaint only to be partly accurate. 
</p>
<p>155. The Government indicated that the victim, Ms. J.S. was summoned by some 
villagers of Chinthakunta village on 4 October 2002. Following the incident, a police case 
was duly registered at the behest of the victim&#8217;s son. The matter was investigated 
thoroughly and 13 accused persons were arrested and remanded to judicial custody on 7 
October 2002, subsequent to which, prosecution proceedings were launched. The arrested 
persons included four of the five people mentioned in the communication, namely A.K, 
A.N., N. and P. The case against the fifth accused in the communication, M.R., could not be 
established beyond doubt. The victim was provided adequate medical aid, first at the 
Community Health Centre, Vikarabad and later at Kamineni Hospital, L B Nagar. Apart 
from medical aid and expenditure for treatment, the government provided Indian Rupees 
75.000/- to the victim. 
</p>
<p>156. In a letter dated <b>6 April 2009</b>, the Government responded to a previous 
communication sent on 20 October 2008 regarding the alleged gang rape of 11 women by 
Greyhound policemen during the anti-Naxalite operations at Vakapalli village in 
Visakhapatnam district of Adhra Pradesh (see summary of the communication in previous 
communications report of the Special Rapporteur, A.HRC.11.6.Add.1).  
</p>
<p>157. The Government indicated that the allegation was investigated and that, while a 
complaint was registered on the same day (i.e. 20 August 2007), the investigation conducted 
into the alleged complaint by a senior police officer at the directive of the High Court of 
Andhra Pradesh revealed that the complaint was false. The investigation&#8217;s conclusion was 
based on medical reports which did not support any evidence of rape / sexual intercourse 
and considerable variations between the earliest versions of the complaint and the 
subsequent versions by the alleged victims.  </p>

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>159. On <b>2 October 2009</b> the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief sent an 
urgent appeal to the Government regarding the <b>adoption of the new Islamic Criminal 
Code (Qanun Jinayah) in Aceh</b>. 
</p>
<p>160. According to the information received, on 14 September 2009, the Aceh Legislative 
Council adopted a new Islamic Criminal Code which imposed severe sentences for 
consensual extra-marital sexual relations, rape, homosexuality, alcohol consumption and 
gambling. Among other sanctions, the Code imposed the punishment of stoning to death for 
adultery; 100 cane lashes for sexual intercourse outside marriage; between 100 and 300 
cane lashes or imprisonment for rape; and 100 lashes for homosexuality. 
</p>
<p>161. In addition, the new Code legalized marital rape and provided that a woman alleging 
that she was a victim of rape would be found guilty of sex outside marriage unless she could 
provide four male witnesses testifying to the lack of consent on her part; impunity will be 
given to those who commit rape at the command of superiors. 
</p>
<p>162. The National Commission against Violence on Women called for a judicial review 
of Law No. 11/2006 of the Government of Aceh concerning the sources the Aceh 
Legislative Council had used to adopt the Aceh Islamic Criminal Code. Moreover, this 
Code applied both to Muslims and non Muslims.  
</p>
<p>163. It was furthermore alleged that although the Code was applicable to the population 
as a whole, in practice, women were far more likely to become victims of stoning due to 
patriarchal and discriminatory practices and policies, as well as biological differences such 
as pregnancy. 
</p>
<p>164. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Is the Government taking any action to request the Supreme Court to review 
the Code? 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>165. In its response dated <b>23 December 2009</b>, the Government indicated that the 
Province of Aceh is given a special status under law no. 18 of 2001, which incorporated a 
special system of autonomy. In the preamble of this law, special status is granted to Aceh 
for its distinct contribution to the formation of the Indonesian nation, as much as for Aceh&#8217;s 
unique historical and cultural background, as well as its religious, moral and social values 
which had been preserved from generation to generation. The special status of Aceh as an 
autonomous region was expressed through four specific areas over which it had sole 
decisional power: religious issues, customs, education and the role of the <i>Ulema </i>in the local 
policy-making process. This special status was further reinforced through law no. 11 of 
2006 on the Governing of Aceh. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>38</b>  
</p>
<p>166. The Government explained that, in accordance with the above national laws, the 
promulgation of local laws and regulations was meant to endow the <i>Muamalat </i>(Islamic civil 
code) and the <i>Jinayah </i>(Islamic criminal code) within the applicable norms in Aceh. The 
task of promulgating local laws and regulations was carried out by the Aceh House of 
Representatives. The legislation produced by this body is known as the <i>Qanun </i>(Islamic 
bylaw). So far, the <i>Qanun </i>related to <i>Jinayah </i>issues generally deals with regulations related 
to gambling, drinking and adultery. Within this framework the Islamic Religious Courts in 
Aceh which previously had jurisdiction over issues of marriage and divorce had been 
transformed into <i>Mahkamah Syariah </i>(religious court at the local level) and had been 
granted additional jurisdiction over the issues of the <i>Muamalat </i>and certain aspects of the 
<i>Jinayah</i>. This was completed by the issuance of a Decree of the Supreme Court of 2004, 
which transferred some of the jurisdictional power of the civil courts of Aceh to the 
<i>Mahkamah Syariah</i>. 
</p>
<p>167. The Government indicated that one of the types of punishment that have been used 
so far was public flogging. However, it noted that there were also alternative punishments in 
the <i>Qanun</i>, namely imprisonment and fines. Thus, the judges had a number of options in 
carrying out justice. The Government argued that many people who had been sentenced to 
flogging were done so by their own choice as they considered it a form of religious penance. 
</p>
<p>168. On 14 September 2009, two weeks before leaving office, the outgoing legislature of 
Aceh passed five <i>Qanun </i>draft bills, including the <i>Qanun Jinayah </i>(Islamic Criminal Law) 
and the <i>Qanun on Jinayah Procedural Law</i>, which have sparked a fierce debate at national 
level, especially with regard to law enforcement on stoning for offenders. However, 
international reporting on this issue focused mostly on the aspect of the legislation which 
provides for &#8211; or even requires &#8211; the &#8220;stoning to death&#8221; of adulterers and the torture of 
women. Consequently, the international image of Indonesia generally, and Aceh in 
particular, has suffered as a result of this reductive interpretation. The real issue, according 
to the Government, concerned the extent to which democratic principles were finding a 
home in Aceh and in Indonesia. 
</p>
<p>169. The adoption of the <i>Qanun Jinayah </i>had sparked controversy and public debate in 
the local media and at the national level. The substance of the <i>Qanun </i>has also provoked 
protests and concern from various groups in the country, including members of the House of 
Representatives, the National Human Rights Commission, academics, religious leaders and 
NGOs. Aside from the controversial aspects of its substance, the adoption of the <i>Qanun </i>has 
also raised controversy on account of the fact that it was adopted just before the end of the 
term of office of the members of the provincial parliament for the 2004-2009 period, 
thereby insinuating a sense of politicization and haste in the adoption of these <i>Qanuns</i>. 
</p>
<p>170. About a month after receiving the draft bills by the provincial parliament, the local 
government in Aceh sent a letter to the local parliament refusing to endorse the draft bills 
and suggesting a revision of the proposed <i>Qanuns</i>, particularly the stoning provisions. The 
Governor of Aceh has so far not signed the <i>Qanun Jinayah</i>, the <i>Qanun on Jinayah 
Procedural Law </i>and the <i>Qanun on Nanggroe Guardian</i>. Legally speaking, all three <i>Qanuns 
</i>are not yet effective in view of article 23 (1.a.) and article 232 (1) of law no. 11/2006 on the 
Governing of Aceh, since the promulgation of the <i>Qanun </i>requires a joint agreement of both 
the local legislative and local executive. Thus, based on the two aforementioned articles, the 
approval from the Governor of Aceh is mandatory before a provincial law can be formally 
enacted. Moreover, according to article 235 (5) of law no. 11/2006, once the <i>Qanun Bill </i>has 
been ratified by the provincial parliament and accepted by the Governor of the region, it 
nevertheless remains subject to the final endorsement of the Minister of Home Affairs &#8211; as 
an advisor on regional legislation in Indonesia &#8211; as a prerequisite to the entry into force and 
implementation of these <i>Qanuns</i>. In addition, article 235 (3) and article 235 (4) of law no. 
11/2006 provide for the review and annulment of a <i>Qanun </i>through a material review by the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>39 
</b></p>
<p>Supreme Court. However, this process can only be conducted if the <i>Qanun </i>has been 
adopted by both the local parliament of Aceh and the Governor of Aceh. A material review 
of the <i>Qanun </i>can be proposed by the representatives of government agencies and equally by 
members of civil society. The Government emphasized that thus a natural system of checks 
and balances, as evident in a robust democratic country, concerning the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms exists and operates in Indonesia 
through public initiatives, the legislative or the executive, to guarantee respect for, and 
protection of, human rights. 
</p>
<p>171. The Government indicated that the public discourse on human rights issues was not 
a taboo issue, but belonged to the dynamics of any healthy society and was common to all 
democratic countries, including Indonesia. The Government underlined that the checks and 
balances system was effective because it was supported by freedom of expression and a free 
but responsible media, which was expected to further strengthen and guarantee the 
promotion and protection of human rights in Indonesia. According to the Government, the 
Ministry of Home Affairs had conducted an evaluation of numerous regional regulations 
and since 2002 it proceeded to cancel 1,123 regulations found not to be in conformity with 
national laws and regulations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>172. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of Indonesia for its reply to 
the urgent appeal of 2 October 2009 and wishes to recall the importance of addressing 
situations of violence and discrimination that affect many women as well as other 
individuals on the grounds or in the name of religion or belief or in accordance with cultural 
and traditional practices. In this regard, it is essential that States take all appropriate 
measures, including in legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs 
and practices which constitute discrimination against women.  
</p>
<p>173. In connection with this case, she, wishes to refer to the observations made by the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief (A/HRC/13/40/ Add.1) and to the 
mission report to Indonesia by the Special Rapporteur on torture (A/HRC/7/3/Add.7).

<p>174. On <b>21 July 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal to the Government, regarding <b>Ms. S.S.</b>, a 
lawyer and human rights activist. 
</p>
<p>175. According to the information received, in the morning of 17 July 2009, Ms. S.S. was 
arrested in Tehran by unidentified plain clothed men on her way to Friday prayers. Ms. S.S. 
was accompanied by other activists for women&#8217;s rights when the men pulled her into a car 
in a busy area of Tehran. She managed to briefly abscond, however, was swiftly 
reprehended and beaten with batons by the men before taken away in the car to an unknown 
location. 
</p>
<p>176. It was alleged that Ms. S.S.&#8217;s arrest formed part of a pattern of arrests of high profile 
Iranian civil society representatives in the wake of the presidential election. </p>

</p>
<p>177. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Has a complaint been lodged by or on behalf of Ms. S.S.?  
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any

how these measures are compatible with applicable international human rights norms and 
standards as stipulated, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>178. On <b>28 December 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders 
sent an allegation letter to the Government regarding <b>Ms. S.R.</b>, who was working on 
women&#8217;s rights and was notably supporting the One Million Signatures Campaign, whose 
purpose was to collect signatures in support of amendments of laws that discriminate 
against women. 
</p>
<p>179. According to the information received, on 14 December 2009, security officials 
went to Ms. S.R&#8217;s house with a search warrant. After having searched the house, they seized 
her belongings. It was alleged that they refused to identify themselves. Five days later, S.R. 
was summoned to the Revolutionary Courts where she was allegedly interrogated for two 
hours. She was then charged, detained and transferred to Evin prison. 
</p>
<p>180. It was alleged that several other members of the One Million Signatures Campaign 
were also previously arrested and detained in April 2009. Furthermore, on 5 November 
2009, more than eleven other members were allegedly summoned to the Revolutionary 
Courts for questioning. 
</p>
<p>181. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. S.R. could be directly 
related to her work in defence of human rights. More generally, further concern was also 
expressed about the summons and detentions of others members of the One Million 
Signatures Campaign. 
</p>
<p>182. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Has a complaint been lodged by any member of the One Million Signatures 
Campaign?

to the information received, <b>Ms. N.E.</b>, the sister of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin 
Ebadi, was detained on 28 December 2009 and held at an unknown location. 
</p>
<p>185. In addition, Mr. M.S., Mr. E.B., Mr. M.K. and Ms. N.E. were arrested in their homes 
by plain clothes officers. In the case of M.S, reportedly, the men did not present an arrest 
warrant, but only a document with the heading of the Revolutionary Court, which however 
did contain neither his name nor any reasons for his arrest. In the other case, E.B. reportedly 
suffered from heart and nerve conditions which were further aggravated by his pervious 
detentions. 
</p>
<p>186. According to the information received, <b>Mr. M.S.J.</b>, a columnist for the now closed 
daily Etemad-e Melli, was arrested on 30 December 2009 after having been summoned by

also been confiscated following a search of his home. Moreover, <b>Ms. P.K.</b>, a journalist and 
blogger was arrested on 2 January 2010 after being summoned by the Ministry of 
Intelligence. 
</p>
<p>187. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern that the arrest and detention at unknown 
location and without charges of the above-mentioned journalists, lawyers, bloggers and 
human rights defenders could be related to their activities in defence of human rights and 
the promotion of democracy in Iran. In light of their alleged incommunicado detention, 
further serious concern was expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of

<p>189. On <b>27 January 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning <b>Ms. S.E. and Mr. B.A.J.</b> 
who had been sentenced to dead by stoning for adultery. 
</p>
<p>190. According to the information received, a criminal court in Oroomiyeh, West 
Azerbaijan Province, sentenced S.E. and B.A.J. to death on charges of adultery. The death 
sentence followed a trial in which they were allegedly denied the right to select their own 
defence attorneys. On 6 January 2010 (or 8 January, according to other reports received), 
Branch 12 of the West Azerbaijan Court of Appeals upheld the death sentence. Both 
defendants were held in Oroomiyeh central prison. 
</p>
<p>191. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summaries accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide statistics as to the number of persons sentenced to death and 
the number executed in the past three years for the offence of adultery. In particular, 
indicate how many men and how many women were sentenced to death and executed for 
the offence of adultery. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>192. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the moment of finalizing the report, she had 
not received a reply from the Government of Iran concerning the communications sent on 
21 July 2009, 28 December 2009, 7 January 2010 and 27 January 2010. She recalls that 
communications are an important part of the cooperation of Governments with her mandate 
and urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised.  
</p>
<p>193. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to recall that an urgent appeal concerning Ms. 
S.S. was sent on 7 March 2007, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders. On 14 March 2007, the 
Special Rapporteur sent another urgent appeal concerning Ms. S.S. The Special Rapporteur 
regrets that no reply was received from the Government to these communications.  
</p>
<p>194. With regard to the urgent appeal sent on 27 January 2010, the Special Rapporteur 
wishes to recall that stoning is a method of capital punishment primarily used for crimes of 
adultery and other related offences, of which women are disproportionately found guilty, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>43 
</b></p>
<p>which is inconsistent with the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex enshrined in 
all major human rights instruments, including the Convention on Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women. She would also like to highlight that the Human Rights 
Committee, the Committee against Torture, the Commission on Human Rights and the 
Special Rapporteur on Torture have reiterated that any form of corporal punishment is 
contrary to the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. 
</p>
<p>195. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iran did not reply to her 
previous communications sent on 9 September 2008, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding members of the 
One Million Signatures Campaign. In this regard, she wishes to underline the challenges 
faced by women human rights defenders and requests that they be permitted to exercise 
their rights to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. She considers that the arrest 
and detention of the members of the One Million Signatures Campaign may constitute a 
systematic attempt to curb these rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Responses received to communications sent earlier 
</b></p>
<p>196. By a letter dated <b>12 August 2009</b>, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 5 April 2007, concerning <b>Ms. N.K.</b> and <b>Ms.</b> <b>M.H.</b>, two women arrested on 3 April 
2007, while they were collecting signatures for the One Million Signatures Campaign, and 
had remained in detention in Evin Prison with charges against them being unknown.  
</p>
<p>197. The Government reported that Second of April is celebrated in Iran as the Nature&#8217;s 
Day and it is also an official holiday. On this day, large numbers of people go to parks and 
recreational areas for leisure and clean air. Unfortunately, a number of women including 
Ms. N.K.and Ms. M.H. spread out in Laleh Park in the central Tehran and begin harassing 
people. They were adamant in their insistence in getting the people in the park to sign their 
petition and acted in ways that were contrary to the general spirit of the day that has a 
history of thousands of years. Even a woman by the name of S.A. began shouting and 
yelling to gather people around them. They were cautioned by the park security guards that 
they were disturbing the normal situation of the park. Consequently, police arrested them. 
Later on, all the arrested individuals were released on bail. The Government further 
indicated that, since Ms. S.A., Ms. N.K. and Ms. M.H. had a past record of disturbing public 
order and compliance with the court order, they were called to appear in the court and a trial 
date was set for them. There is no record of a ruling against them. 
</p>
<p>198. In a letter dated <b>15 July 2009</b>, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 19 December 2007, concerning Ms. <b>M.H.</b>, Ms.<b> J.J.</b>, Ms. <b>H.A.</b>, Ms. <b>R.S.</b> and Ms. <b>D.A.</b>, 
members of the <i>One Million Signatures Campaign. </i>The Government that Ms. D.A. was 
found guilty of disturbing public order and was sentenced to four months imprisonment and 
payment of 50,000 Tomans fine, by Branch 21 of Tehran Appellate Court. She was 
acquitted of the charge of working against the security of the State. 
</p>
<p>199. The case was referred to the Head of Justice Department of Tehran and at the time 
when the Government sent the letter, she was free on bail and the case had gone to the Court 
Rulings Implementation Section. The delay in sending the case to the Court Rulings 
Implementation Section was meant for the purpose of allowing time for a pardon.  
</p>
<p>200. The Government informed that in the judicial system of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
review of the cases of the individuals charged with different offences is done on the basis of 
applicable laws regardless of the defendant&#8217;s social titles and status. According to the 
Government, Ms. M.H., married and residing in Tehran, was arrested on 19 December 2007 
on the charge of propagating lies and misinformation and acting against the security of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>44</b>  
</p>
<p>State. She was not able to deposit the required bail at the time of her arrest, but was released 
on bail on 2 January 2008. She had access to a lawyer in accordance with article 128 of the 
Criminal Procedures Code. Ms. Shirin Ebadi was introduced as her defense lawyer and 
assumed the responsibility to represent her before the court. Her case was being investigated 
by the Investigation Branch.  
</p>
<p>201. Ms. J.J. was summoned to the Investigation Office on charges of collaboration and 
assembly with the aim of disturbing public order, propagating misinformation against the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and ignoring the summon of the police. She was released on bail 
on the same day. An indictment was prepared and the case was sent to the Criminal Court. 
Ms. M.J. was introduced as her defense lawyer and the trial date was set for 21 November 
</p><p>2009. 
</p>
<p>202. In a letter dated <b>10 July 2009</b>, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 7 March 2008, concerning Ms. <b>S.N.</b>, Ms. <b>T.H.</b>, Ms. <b>S.</b> and Ms. <b>A.M.</b>, who were 
reportedly sentenced to death. The Government reported that Ms. N.&#8217;s records showed that 
the only case in connection with intentional murder registered under the name &#8220;N.&#8221; related 
to a person by the name of Ms. A.A.N., daughter of J., born in 1956. She was charged with 
murder of her father. As a result of the consent acquired from the victim&#8217;s next of skin, 
execution of Qesas (retribution in kind) was cancelled. However, in accordance with article 
612 of the Penal Code, she was liable to sentence of three to twelve years of imprisonment. 
Her case was dealt with in accordance with the rule of law and any allegation otherwise is 
unfounded. Presently, Ms. N. is out of prison on bail. 
</p>
<p>203. According to Government, Ms. T.H. buried alive the seven-year-old daughter of her 
husband, E.K., in March 2003 in the forests of Lavizan, near the city of Tehran. The 
Government indicated that the communication mistakenly referred to the case as murder of 
her husband. After initial investigation, she was charged with intentional murder and was 
found guilty by judgment No. 18 dated 20 June 2007 issued by Branch 74 of the Criminal 
Court of the Province of Tehran, in presence of five judges and her two defense lawyers, 
Mr. M.T. and Ms. F.H.M.A.. The court ruled that she deserved Qesas (retribution in kind). 
She and her lawyers appealed the ruling and the case was referred to the Branch 37 of the 
Supreme Court. The ruling of lower court was reinstated by verdict No. 497 dated 21 
January 2008. The verdict of Qesas was carried out on 27 November 2009 in the absence of 
the defendant&#8217;s failure to acquire the consent of the victim&#8217;s next of skin.  
</p>
<p>204. According to the existing information, there is no reference to Ms. A.M.&#8217;s 
compulsory or forced marriage. Besides, if a woman claims that her marriage was forced, 
she can request the pertinent family court for annulment of the marriage. Forced marriage 
may not establish the ground for committing murder. Moreover, the difference in the age of 
the husband and the wife may not be interpreted as an absolute reason for the marriage to be 
compulsory. According to Iranian penal code, commission of intentional murder is the 
cause for Qesas verdict. However, guardians of the victim have the power of pardon the 
offender or demand blood money or Qesas (retribution in kind). Therefore, any of the three 
rest with the victim&#8217;s guardians and the ability of the offender to acquire their consent. 
Being a woman or a man does not establish a cause for discrimination between offenders. A 
substantial period of time has been provided to the offenders to acquire the consent of the 
victim&#8217;s next of skin. 
</p>
<p>205. In a letter dated <b>9 July 2009,</b> the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 11 March 2008, concerning <b>Ms. P.A.</b>, a women's rights defender and one of the founding 
members of the <i>One Million Signatures Campaign</i> and Ms <b>E.S.</b>, an active member of the 
movement. The Government reported the following: &#8220;The case of Ms. P.A. was investigated 
and raised in Branch 13 of the Criminal Court and by judgment N&#176; 4029 of 17 November 
2007; she was sentenced to two years suspended imprisonment. Subsequently, the case was 
reviewed in Branch 21 of the court of appeal and the sentence was commuted to one year. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>45 
</b></p>
<p>Although the ruling of the court is now final, the Government indicated that ultimate 
tolerance and compassion have been shown to her and that she is presently free. 
</p>
<p>206. By a letter dated <b>4 May 2009</b>, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 22 February 2008, by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders concerning <b>Ms. R.A.</b> and <b>Ms. N.K.</b>, two 
members of the One Million Signatures Petition Campaign. The Government indicated that 
the existing laws and regulations in connection with women, in the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
which are guaranteed and safeguarded by anticipated legal instruments, are: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Equality before the Law, which in accordance with Article 3, para. 14 of the 
Constitution, the Government is bound to do its utmost towards, securing the 
multifarious rights of all citizens and providing legal protection and ensuring the 
equality of all before the law. Furthermore, Article 20 of the Constitution states that 
all citizens of Iran enjoy the protection of the law and enjoy all human, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights, in conformity with Islamic criteria. Moreover, 
Article 21 of the Constitution is devoted exclusively to guarantees for the protection 
of act aspects of women&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Right to Work, which gives to women and men equal social, political and other 
rights. According to Article 6 of the Labor Code, all the individuals are entitled to 
the same protection of the law and every person has the right to choose an 
occupation, which is not inconsistent with the Islamic principles, the public interest 
or does not violate other peoples&#8217; rights. Some responsibilities and obligations are 
envisaged for men from whom women are exempted, including the prohibition to 
women to have a dangerous work, while continuing to enjoy relevant rights and 
benefits, such as 90 days of maternity leave. Furthermore, the employer shall set up 
childcare centers according to the number of children, with due regard to their age. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; An Equal Pay, stated in Article 38 of the labor Code (1989), referring to equality and 
non discrimination in regard to wages, and the prohibition of discrimination on the 
basis of age, gender, race, ethnic origin and political or religious convictions, which 
will be punished on the basis of Article 174 of the Labour Code.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Political, Social and Cultural Participation. Women are active in social and political 
life in Iran and have high profiles in the official governmental positions. Recently 
the Ministry of Higher Education of the Islamic Republic of Iran announced that 
there are no gender restrictions choosing various disciplines in the universities. In 
fact, women in Iran are among the leading university students in engineering a 
medicine. The majority of teachers are women who are extreme active in education. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Rights and Special Privileges of Women in Marriage. Women constitute a willing 
partner marriages and their consent is required both for the initiation as for the 
termination of this institution. Furthermore, a number of provisions in Iranian legal 
system are geared to guarantee economic well-being and independence married 
women, including property, dowry or alimony. The same is true in the case of a 
divorced wife during the period of &#8220;Eddeh&#8221; or when she is pregnant by her husband 
until her child is born, according to Article 111 of the Civil Code. In addition, 
Article 105 of the Islamic Punishment Law states that &#8220;Any financially capable 
person, who refuses to pay his wife&#8217;s maintenance, while the latter fulfills her 
matrimonial duties, will be sentenced by the court&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Right to Divorce and Community Property Rights. According to legislation the 
divorce does not take place simply on the basis of a request by the husband; rather it 
should be based on a decision by a competent court and through a legal procedure. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>46</b>  
</p>
<p>The consent of the wife is required in divorce cases. Furthermore, the wife has the 
right to seek divorce through the same procedure. If the court finds that the husband 
is asking for a divorce without legitimate cause, he is required to pay for all his 
wife&#8217;s work at home as determined by the court. In addition, in such a case, the court 
could rule for equal division of property, registered in husband&#8217;s name. 
</p>
<p>207. The Government also provided detailed information concerning new developments 
in the realm of Iranian women affairs. 
</p>
<p>208. The Government informed that Iran&#8217;s national human rights policy is based on the 
Constitution which is in full compliance with its commitments arising from international 
instruments and duly respects the internationally accepted human rights values and 
standards. The principles prevailing in the human rights policy, enshrined in the National 
Development Programs, clearly represent a vigorous attempt aimed at human rights, 
mainstreaming and at stipulating full respect for the status and the inherent dignity of 
human beings from the Islamic perspectives as well as full respect for the citizens&#8217; rights. 
These programs have been designed in a manner to adequately address all economic, social, 
cultural and civil and political rights of citizens including the rights to development and 
provide to the full extent possible the effective enjoyment of the said rights and their 
promotion and protection. To this end, the Islamic Republic of Iran, while reviewing, 
amending and updating the existing regulations, has taken measures for legislation of new 
and additional new regulations. Simultaneously, creation of national human rights 
institutions and bodies has effectively been pursued. 
</p>
<p>209. To accomplish the goals of National Development Programs, development of 
different approaches for national capacity building, strengthening of national institutions, 
human rights education and further attention to the economic, social and cultural rights 
particularly right to development, have been foreseen. To this end, strengthening of civil 
society, fostering an environment conducive for enhancement of national human rights 
mechanism such as standing human rights committee in judiciary, Article 90 commission 
within the Parliament, organization of National Ombudsman, Bar Association. Department 
of Administrative Justice and Islamic Human Rights Commission as well as drafting and 
implementation of Citizen&#8217;s Rights bill have been accomplished. 
</p>
<p>210. The Government informed that Iran is also faced with certain shortcomings and 
difficulties, the roots of which are generally developmental questions and imposition of 
economic sanctions and application of unilateral policies by certain countries during the 
past quarter of century. In spite of the aforementioned obstacles, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran within the context of its National Development Programs is committed to take the 
necessary measures to uphold the highest standards and promotion and protection of the 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of all citizens, realization of which is not only 
dependent on the national endeavors, it is also interlinked with the international support and 
cooperation particularly with regard to realization of the right to development, as stipulated 
in the &#8220;Declaration on the Right to development&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>211. The importance of role and contribution of civil society in different fields 
particularly issues pertaining to human rights policy through provision of their consultative 
views has precisely and completely been foreseen, and reiterated in National Development 
Programs. Furthermore the necessity of continuation of empowerment policy of NGOs has 
also been underlined in the said program. The vigorous pursuance of enabling policy has led 
to establishment or enhancing of scope of activities of some 2000 NGOs throughout the 
country as well as facilitating the acquiring of international consultative status for 16 Iranian 
NGOs. Furthermore, convening of different seminars and workshops relating to different 
aspects of NGOs&#8217; activities in collaboration with foreign counterparts at local, national and 
regional levels are yet another tangible result of above-mentioned policies. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>47 
</b></p>
<p>212. In spite of all the above-mentioned plans and activities, which have already opened 
new horizons, the Government further indicated that there are efforts made by some women 
to belittle the achievements. They have been gathering signatures from women for 
fiur~her/equa~ rights for women. Those individuals, instead of bringing their efforts, talents 
and energy together in the context of the already existing NGOs or a new legally-
established NGO, have unfortunately resorted to malicious moves such as claiming to be 
human rights defenders who are opposed by the Iranian Government and so on. The 
Government and pertinent organizations have repeatedly announced that they would 
welcome and support any individual or organization who/which genuinely desires to work 
towards empowerment of women in the Iranian society. The Government noted in this 
respect that it does not believe that bossing or bullying around would bring about any 
assistance or solution to problems. At the same time, neither the Government nor the people 
of Iran may tolerate and watch silently and indifferently those who might dream to hinder or 
hurt advancement of the society, particularly advancement and empowerment of women, 
who have been genuinely and whole-heatedly sacrificing themselves for their sublime 
Godly causes, under the disguise of empty slogans and abuse of internationally recognized 
and respected human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>213. To conclude, the Government informed that Ms. R.A. and Ms. N.K. were arrested 
and charged with disturbing public order. The investigating court dropped the charge 
against them on 19 August 2008, stating that they had not premeditated a disturbance and 
that their activity was originally peaceful. The two individuals were treated on the basis of 
the rule of law and they enjoyed all their rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>  Kuwait 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>214. On <b>4 February 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants sent 
an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the death sentence imposed on <b>Ms. J.P.</b>, a 
Filipina domestic migrant worker and regarding the widespread exploitation of migrant 
domestic workers in the country. 
</p>
<p>215. According to the information received, Ms. J.P. was sentenced to death on 13 April 
2008 by a court of First Instance for the crime of murder of her employer&#8217;s daughter. The 
death sentence was upheld by an appeal court on 16 June 2009. Reports suggested that J.P. 
had exhausted the appeal process and the death sentence was confirmed during the week of 
25 January 2010. 
</p>
<p>216. Ms. J.P. maintained throughout the court proceedings that she was innocent; stating 
that one of the victim&#8217;s family members could have committed the murder because the 
victim was having an affair with a neighbour. Her lawyer also argued that there was no 
evidence proving that Ms. J.P. committed the crime. 
</p>
<p>217. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide details of the judicial proceedings which determined and 
upheld Ms. J.P.&#8217;s sentence. Please also indicate measures taken to ensure the due process 
rights of Ms. J.P. have been fully respected.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>218. By a letter dated <b>17 March 2010</b>, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 4 February 2010 indicating that the facts referred to were set forth in criminal case 
No. 675/2007, Annual Register 40/2007 Mubarak al-Kabir. The Government informed that 
Ms. J.P. was employed as a domestic worker by the family of the victim, D.B.A.H.N. Ms. 
J.P. intended to take revenge against the victim on account of their many quarrels and her 
unwillingness to accept the scolding she received from the victim. She decided to kill her 
and prepared a large knife for the purpose as well as a pair of nylon gloves to remove the 
traces left by her hand on the knife. Having waited until the victim was in bed alone, she 
went to her bedroom at dawn and attacked her while she was asleep, stabbing her repeatedly 
until she was dead. According to the report of the forensic physician, the victim&#8217;s death was 
attributable to stab wounds to the chest area that led to ruptures of the lungs, the heart and 
the throat, and hence to a hemorrhage and stroke. 
</p>
<p>219. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office issued a decision on 19 August 2007 to refer the 
accused to the Criminal Court on the charge of intentional and premeditated homicide of the 
victim. 
</p>
<p>220. On 13 April 2008 the Criminal Court decided to sentence the accused to death, 
relying on the factual testimony of witnesses, supported by the conclusions of the forensic 
physician&#8217;s report on the victim, the findings of the criminal evidence report, the results of 
the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office examination of the scene of the crime and the conclusions of 
the Medical Committee&#8217;s report. The decision was endorsed by the Appeal Court&#8217;s 
judgment of 15 June 2009 and the judgment of the Court of Cassation of 19 January 2010. 
</p>
<p>221. On 11 February 2010 the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office sent the above-mentioned 
criminal file to the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for legal affairs, the Minister of 
Justice and the Minister of Religious Endowments and Islamic Affairs, requesting them to 
transmit it to His Highness the Amir of the State of Kuwait so that he could consider 
whether to ratify the judgment imposing the death penalty on the above-mentioned accused. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>222. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of Kuwait for its response. 
She is hopeful that the increased vulnerability to violence and discrimination suffered by 
migrant domestic workers- who often live in an abusive environment characterized by 
multiple oppressions of gender, class, nationality and ethnicity - will be taken into 
consideration in the revision of the judgment. She wishes to refer in this regard to General 
Recommendation 26 by the CEDAW Committee which aims at elaborating the 
circumstances that contribute to the specific vulnerability of many women migrant workers 
and their experiences of sex- and gender-based discrimination as a cause and consequence 
of the violations of their human rights.

<p><b>  Response received to a communication sent earlier 
</b></p>
<p>223. In a letter dated <b>4 December 2009</b>, the Government responded to the 
communication sent on 7 October 2008 concerning Ms. <b>N.T.K.</b>, aged 18, resident in Talas 
who was allegedly subjected to torture and ill treatment by members of the police (see 
A/HRC/11/6/Add.1). At the time this report was finalized, an official translation of the 
response was not yet available. The Special Rapporteur will therefore provide further 
observations in her 2011 communications report. </p>

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>224. On <b>3 August 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding 
<b>Mrs. K.S.D.S.,</b> a Malaysian citizen and a permanent resident of Singapore. 
</p>
<p>225. According to the information received, Mrs. K.S.D.S. has been sentenced by the 
Pahang Syariah Court in Malaysia to six strokes of the rotan and fined RM 5000 for 
drinking beer in a hotel nightclub two years ago. The sentence was expected to be carried 
out on 3 August 2009 or 14 days from 20 July 2009. The punishment of caning, stipulated 
in Section 125 and 126 of the Phang Syariah Criminal Procedure Enactment of 2002, had 
not been applied against a Malaysian woman before. 
</p>
<p>226. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Has any appeal been submitted on behalf of Mrs. K.S.D.S. which seeks for an 
alternative punishment?  
</p>
<p> 3. Has the punishment of caning applied against Mrs. K.S.D.S. taken place 
already? If yes please provide details of its application. If not, please provide details on the 
subsequent decisions on this matter. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide details of any measures taken to promote the rights of women 
in Malaysia, including in relation to the application of physical punishments based on 
prejudices, customary practices and all other practices which lie on the idea of the 
inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes and on stereotyped roles for men and women. 
</p>
<p> 5. Please provide information on any follow up action or measure taken with 
regard to this case, and whether Mrs. K.S.D.S. has had access to an effective remedy, 
including the right to challenge the punishment of canning, if at all, whether she has been 
provided or assured protection against any eventual form of retaliation or threat for 
opposing such punishment. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>227. By letter dated <b>1 September 2009</b>, the Government indicated that the punishment of 
six strokes of caning (&#8220;whipping&#8221;) and a fine of RM 5,000.00 decreed by the Pahang 
Syariah High Court was based on the provisions of the laws enforceable in Malaysia. Ms. 
K.S.D.S. had pleaded guilty to the offence of consuming beer. 
</p>
<p>228. The Government indicated that the sentence given to Ms. K.S.D.S. does not 
constitute any form of discrimination against women, as it is based on the laws enforceable 
in Malaysia and has been executed in a number of cases involving men. It is enforced 
against all persons who profess the religion of Islam, regardless of gender. 
</p>
<p>229. The Government additionally indicated that, when executing the punishment of 
whipping, the person shall use the rod with average force, without lifting his hand over his 
head so that the offender&#8217;s skin is not cut. After inflicting a stroke, he shall lift the rod 
upward and not pull it. Whipping may be inflicted on all parts of the body except the face, 
head, stomach, chest or private parts. The whipping rod shall be of the same type and make 
either from rattan or small branch of a tree without segment or joint and its length not more 
than 1.22 meters and its thickness not more than 1.25 centimeters. Furthermore, the offender </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>50</b>  
</p>
<p>shall wear clothes when the whipping is inflicted and for women, the whipping shall be 
inflicted in a sitting position. 
</p>
<p>230. According to the Government, the main purpose of punishment under Syariah laws 
is to educate the offender. It was noted that Ms. K.S.D.S. had not made any appeals in 
relation to the sentence imposed on her by the courts, despite having been advised by her 
lawyer to do so on several occasions. The Government noted that she actually refused to file 
an appeal because, as a Muslim, she felt repentance towards the wrongdoings that she had 
committed. 
</p>
<p>231. The Government was of the view that Mrs. K.S.D.S. had been provided access to 
effective remedies under the provisions of the relevant Malaysian laws. She was represented 
by her lawyer during the trial. She also had the right to appeal the sentence, although she 
made the decision to accept it without challenging it. At the time the Government response 
was received, the whipping had not yet taken place. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>232. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of Malaysia for its reply to the 
urgent appeal. She wishes to recall the importance of addressing situations of violence and 
discrimination that affect many women as well as other individuals on the grounds or in the 
name of religion or belief or in accordance with cultural and traditional practices. In this 
regard, it is essential that States take all appropriate measures, including in legislation, to 
modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices which constitute 
discrimination against women.  
</p>
<p>233. She also wishes to note that Human Rights Committee, the Committee against 
Torture, the Commission on Human Rights and the Special Rapporteur on Torture have 
reiterated that any form of corporal punishment is contrary to the prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</p>
<p><b>  Response received to a communication sent earlier 
</b></p>
<p>234. By a letter dated <b>24 November 2009</b>, the Government replied to a communication 
sent on 17 November 2008 concerning sexual abuses against <b>girls from the Penan 
Community</b> in the Baram area, Sarawak (see A/HRC/11/6/Add.1 for a summary of the 
communication) 
</p>
<p>235. The Government informed that since 1995, there has been one police report 
involving a Penan girl and three police reports involving Penan women, as following: 
</p>
<p> 1. The Marudi District Police Report 279/1995 informed that a fourteen years 
old Penan girl claimed that she was raped. Upon investigation, the police had insufficient 
evidence to prosecute on the grounds on the medical doctor&#8217;s report which stated that the 
victim&#8217;s hymen was intact. In addition, the victim could not identify the suspects and the 
witnesses/landlord denied knowing or even allowing the victim to stay at his house. As a 
result, the investigation showed insufficient evidence to support any prosecution for rape. 
</p>
<p> 2. The Marudi District Report 645/2008: a police report was lodged by the 
victim. The victim&#8217;s ordeal was reported in the local newspaper, &#8220;The Star&#8221;, on 6 October 
2008 entitled &#8220;Against Their Will&#8221;. According to the article, C. was abused and raped by 
loggers when she hitched a ride on the logging company&#8217;s vehicle to go to school. As a 
result, the victim had given birth to a baby girl in July 2008. The investigation papers were 
submitted to the Senior Federal Counsel (SFC) of Sarawak on 17 December 2008. The SFC 
had instructed the police to conduct further investigation. 
</p>
<p> 3. The Marudi District Report 646/2008: a police report was lodged by DSP 
Roselina from the Police Contingent Headquarters based on the article in &#8220;The Star&#8221;, dated </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>51 
</b></p>
<p>6 October, entitled &#8220;Against Their Will&#8221;. The victim, known as R. &#8211; it is not her real name 
&#8211; did not make any police report but the report was necessary to allow the police to initiate 
investigations. Upon investigation and based on the article, it was alleged that a logger 
came to R.&#8217;s house in a drunken state and she was raped. As a result, R. gave birth in May 
</p><p>2005. The investigation papers were submitted to the SFC in Sarawak on 17 December 
2008. The SFC has instructed the police to conduct further investigation. 
</p>
<p>236. The Government of Malaysia further indicated that it had established the National-
Level Task Force to investigate the accusations of sexual abuse towards the Penan girls in 
Sarawak on 8 October 2008. The task force is helmed by the Ministry of Women, Family 
and Community Development, and was chaired by the then Minister of Women, Family and 
Community Development. The establishment of the Task Force is aimed at investigating the 
accusations of sexual exploitation of Penan women and school girls in Sarawak by the 
logging company of workers. 
</p>
<p>237. Members of the Task Force participated in a visit to the Baram area of Sarawak from 
10 to 15 November 2008. After the visit, the Task Force proposed several improvements 
that felt under the jurisdiction of several Ministries/Government Agencies. 
</p>
<p>238. In the report &#8212; available at http://www.kpwkm.gov.my &#8212; the Task Force 
concluded among others that the sexual abuse of the Penan women and school girls by 
outsiders dealing with the Penan tribe, including workers of logging companies and traders 
did occur and they occurred due to the victim&#8217;s dependency of transportation owned by the 
logging company and the presence of outsiders dealing with the village people to purchase 
of forest products. The reports further explained that the Penan community is exposed to 
sexual abuse and exploitation due to the poverty, isolated places of residence, the high 
dependency on logging companies not only for transport for health services and schooling, 
but also for basic necessities such as water, electric generators, etc, the lack of trust towards 
higher authorities and the negative societal perception, prejudice and negative stereotypes 
with labels such as lazy, liars and alcoholics directed at the Penan. In addition the lack of 
infrastructure, such as roads, and the lack of public transportation leads to difficulties faced 
by the Penan villagers in dealing with outsiders, including Government agencies. To ensure 
a more balanced development, there should be increased involvement of the Penan tribe in 
the decision-making processes relevant to them. 
</p>
<p>239. The Government added that the findings of the Task Force did not determine the 
criminal liability of any person or groups of persons. Moreover, the investigations with 
regard to cases involving police reports n&#176; 645, 646 and 647 of 2008 are still on-going. If 
someone is charged for the offence of rape under section 375 of the Malaysian Penal Code, 
those found guilty would be punished for a term of not less than five years and not more 
than thirty years and shall also be liable to whipping. 
</p>
<p>240. The Government informed that the Federal Government has been working in 
collaboration with the Sarawak State Government to initiate several development 
programmes to ensure that Penan children have safe access to schools, through the Service 
Centre Development in the Penan area. The Service Centres in this area are equipped with 
facilities such as school, clinics and agricultural stations. In addition, the State Government 
of Sarawak has provided financial support for transport of Penan children that are staying 
too far from schools. The implementation of the transport service was managed by the 
Resident&#8217;s and District Office as well as the schools involved. 
</p>
<p>241. In order to respect the international norms, the Government informed that it had 
enacted or amended laws to punish acts of violence against women who are subjected to 
violence. For example, in the Penal Code, the punishment for rape has been amended from 
twenty years of imprisonment to a minimum of five years and a maximum of thirty years. In 
addition, women who are subjected to violence have been provided with unhindered access </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>52</b>  
</p>
<p>to justice and health services. The Government also indicated that it had set up programs for 
sexually abused women and provided legal assistance for those who cannot afford their own 
legal counsel. 
</p>
<p>242. Concerning indigenous peoples, the Government has established programmes and 
mechanisms to consult with. The Government stated that Malaysia&#8217;s actions are fully in 
compliance with the requirements of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
The Government complies with Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and Article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(ICESCR), even though Malaysia is not party to the ICESCR. 
</p>
<p>243. Finally, the Government gave its assurance and pledge that the investigation on the 
sexual abuses against Penan women and girls will be conducted in accordance with the 
prevailing domestic laws of Malaysia which are fully consonant with the norms and 
standards of international law. The Government reiterated its commitment to take necessary 
steps and measures to continuously guarantee to promote, protect and implement all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms as well as to guarantee the individual and collective rights 
of indigenous peoples, including the rights to culture, identity, language, employment, 
health, education and others 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>244. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Malaysia for its detailed response 
and for the commitment to adopt necessary measures to guarantee the rights of indigenous 
peoples. In particular, she would like to encourage the Government to address the specific 
circumstances facing indigenous women and girls, in relation to gender-based violence, 
especially sexual violence, arising from multiple, intersecting and aggravated forms of 
discrimination, and paying particular attention to the structural causes of violence. In light 
of its de facto compliance with Article 13 of the ICESCR, she wishes to encourage the 
Malaysian authorities to sign and ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural rights.

<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>245. On <b>21 October 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent 
an allegation letter to the Government <b>regarding 40 from a sample of 230 women living 
with HIV who participated in related research and were subjected to coerced 
sterilization</b>. 
</p>
<p>246. According to the information received, 13 of the 40 cases were documented in detail 
and all suggested that informed consent to the procedure was compromised. Allegedly, 
coercion was used, in some cases, in obtaining the consent for the sterilization procedure, 
while in other cases, women were apparently unaware that the sterilization procedure was 
being conducted, and were only informed after completion of the surgery. 
</p>
<p>247. It was alleged that six of the women subjected to coerced or forced sterilization had 
filed cases before the High Court alleging violations of their right to life, human dignity and 
equality, and the right to be free from cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. Court dates 
were set for October and November 2009. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>53 
</b></p>
<p>248. It was also reported that when on 15 July 2008, documentation of the 13 cases was 
submitted to the Deputy Minister of Health and Social Services, Ms P.H., she indicated that 
the Ministry would issue circulars to the health facilities stating that if forced and coerced 
sterilizations were occurring at hospitals they should be halted, but according to the 
information received, the circulars were not distributed to health care facilities and the 
Minister of Health denied that involuntary sterilizations of HIV-positive women have taken 
place in hospitals.  
</p>
<p>249. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate? 
</p>
<p> 1. What specific measures are being taken to prevent further forced sterilization, 
particularly of women living with HIV, in government-run hospitals?  
</p>
<p> 2. What specific measures are being taken to sanction medical staff allegedly 
carrying out forced sterilizations? Please provide the details, and where available the 
results, of any investigation and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to such 
cases. If no inquiries have been made, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain 
why. 
</p>
<p> 3. What specific measures are being taken to ensure that reparation, including 
compensation and rehabilitation, is provided to those women living with HIV who may 
have been forcibly sterilized? 
</p>
<p> 4. What specific measures are being taken to address stigmatizing and 
discriminating attitudes and practices against people living with HIV among health care 
providers? 
</p>
<p> 5. What specific measures are being undertaken to ensure that informed consent 
requirements for all interventions are implemented in all health care settings? 
</p>
<p>What specific measures are being undertaken to ensure that the right of women living with 
HIV to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is realized?  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>250. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of finalizing the report, she had not 
received a reply from the Government of Namibia concerning the above mentioned 
allegations. She wishes to recall that compulsory sterilization or abortion adversely affects 
women&#8217;s physical and mental health and infringes the right of women to decide on the 
number and spacing of their children. In this regard, she calls on the Namibian authorities to 
place a gender perspective at the centre of all policies and programmes affecting women's 
health and require all health services to be consistent with the human rights of women, 
including the rights to autonomy, privacy, confidentiality, informed consent and choice.

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>251. On <b>30 April 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding <b>Ms. 
K.D.S.</b>, <b>Ms. T.M.</b>, <b>Ms. S.K.</b>, <b>Ms. B.C.</b>, <b>Ms. S.S.</b>, <b>Ms L.C. and other women human 
rights defenders </b>of Chimdi Village Development Committee (VDC) in Sunsari district in 
Nepal, as well as <b>Mr. R.N.</b>, <b>Mr. K.B.</b> <b>and Mr. G.K.</b>, all of them journalists, <b>Mr. S.C.</b>, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>54</b>  
</p>
<p>representative for the Informal Sector Service Centre (INSEC) and <b>Mr. B.C.</b>, a member of 
the Women&#8217;s Rehabilitation Centre (WOREC), an organization helping victims of domestic 
and sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>252. According to the information received, on 9 April 2009, Ms. K.D.S., after calling for 
respect of the fundamental right of any person to marry and to choose freely her/his spouse, 
was beaten up by the relatives of Ms. L.G., a young woman who planned to have an inter-
caste wedding with a young man belonging to the Dalit community. The two young people 
were also beaten up by L.G.&#8217;s relatives for speaking to each other in public. Immediately 
after the assault, Ms. K.D.S. approached the Illaka police station of Chimdi to file a 
complaint, but the Sub-Inspector refused to receive it. 
</p>
<p>253. On 11 April 2009, the Women Human Rights Defender Network, Sunsari, and more 
than 500 women from eight Village Development Committees (VDC) staged a 
demonstration in front of the police station in Chimdi VDC, in order to call for sanctions 
against the police for refusing to register Ms. K.D.S. complaint and to denounce the denial 
of access to justice. While doing so, they evoked the statement made by the Prime Minister 
on 25 January 2009, in which he committed himself to establish a complaints centre for 
women in order to end all forms of violence against women and criminalize caste-based 
discrimination against Dalits. They also called for a police apology since, on 10 April, while 
the Chimdi VDC were walking towards the police station in Chimdi, police officers 
publicly insulted them.  
</p>
<p>254. The women human rights defenders were subsequently assaulted with batons and the 
butt of their guns by around ten police officers and four other unknown persons. The police 
beat the women on the head, the chest, the thighs and the legs and some tried to sexually 
harass some of them. At least 14 women were injured, including Ms. T.M., Ms. S.K., Ms. 
B.C., Ms. S.S. and Ms. L.C., who were seriously injured and were brought to the Koshi 
Zonal hospital for medial treatment. 
</p>
<p>255. The journalists R.N., K.B. and G.K. as well as Mr. S.C., who went to the police 
station to investigate the incident, were also allegedly manhandled and their vehicle 
vandalized by the police. Likewise, Mr. B.C. was also threatened. 
</p>
<p>256. The Special Rapporteur was concerned that the alleged police violence against Ms. 
K.D.S., Ms. T.M., Ms. S.K., Ms. B.C., Ms. S.S., Ms L.C. and other women human rights 
defenders of VDC and the intimidation and threats made against Mr. R.N., Mr. K.B. and 
Mr. G.K., Mr. S.C. and Mr. B.C. were related to their legitimate work in defence of human 
rights in Nepal, particularly the rights of women and the Dalit community. Further concern 
was expressed for their physical and mental integrity. 
</p>
<p>257. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Has a complaint been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victim?  
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case. If no 
inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why.

<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>258. By a letter dated <b>8 February 2010</b>, the Government responded to the 
communication sent on 30 April 2009. The Government responded that on 9 April 2009, 
approximately 8 to 10 women including Ms. K.D.S. visited the Area Police Office in 
Chimdi, Sunsari district, and verbally reported the battery of Ms. K.D.S. The Sub-Inspector 
requested them for a written complaint of the incident, but the group of women left the Area 
Police Office in anger, without presenting any written complaint. 
</p>
<p>259. On 10 April 2009, in the afternoon, approximately 100 to 150 women from WOREC 
Federation Nepal approached the Area Police Office chanting various slogans and 
subsequently locked the Office of the Sub-Inspector. They behaved disorderly and rudely 
which caused displeasure. They also raided the properties of the office. The police remained 
calm and asked for orderly demonstration and to present their demand or complaint in 
writing so that it could take its course. 
</p>
<p>260. On 11 April 2009, at about 14:00 hrs, approximately 400-500 women chanting 
slogans attempted to forcibly enter the police station <i>en mass</i>. The mood of the 
demonstrators appeared disorderly and violent. Around 16:00 hrs, the protesters set a power 
trailer on fire and vandalized a private van in which journalists and human rights activists 
were travelling. The police was forced to disperse the crowd using light baton charge. As a 
result, in their attempt to run in the midst of the crowd, Ms. T.M., Ms. S.S. and Ms. L.C. 
received minor injuries and were immediately taken to the hospital for treatment and later 
discharged after minor primary treatment. Except the light use of force by the police to 
disperse the crowd in order to prevent further destruction to the public and private 
properties and harm to the general people, the women were neither beaten by the police, nor 
were they subjected to ill treatment. Demonstrators were treated with respect and honor and 
were not subject to any kind of misbehaviour. 
</p>
<p>261. In order to respond to a complaint from a group of journalists and human right 
activists against the officer-in-charge of the police station, the Sub-Inspector, the District 
Police Office in Sunsari formed an inquiry committee on 12 April 2009 to probe into the 
incident as demanded by the complainants. The inquiry committee found out in its report 
that the group of journalists and human rights activists were beaten and ill-treated by the 
agitating mob of the women staging the demonstration in front of the Chamdi Police Station 
and their vehicle was vandalized. No evidence was found to support the complaints against 
the Sub-Inspector R.C. and other police personnel. 
</p>
<p>262. Besides the findings of the inquiry, a large number of ordinary people witnessed the 
incident at the Area Police Office and its vicinity. The Home Minister and Polices Offices 
submitted a mass appeal in which 108 people, including local leaders, office bearers of 
NGOs and INGOs, as well as local civil society representatives, signed and explained the 
scene of the incident. 
</p>
<p>263. In the submission, they explained that the police had to use slight batons for self-
defense and for the protection of the Area Police Station as well as for the protection of the 
property set ablaze by the violently agitating protestors. They also outlined how the 
protesters, including those claiming to be members of WOREC and INSEC of Sunsari 
District and other women participating in the agitation, intentionally and wantonly started to 
violently destroy the Area Police Office and the property in the area. The signatories 
demanded to punish those involved in the violent demonstration. The signed submission 
was sent to all relevant Government offices, police offices and national and international 
human rights organizations based in Nepal. 
</p>
<p>264. Finally, the Government stated that the facts alleged in the communication were 
conveniently fabricated and remained utterly misled.  </p>

</p>
<p>267. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 30 de octubre de 2009, agentes de la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional detuvieron el taxi en el que viajaban P.O., L.N. y A.E.O. quienes acababan de 
asistir a una reuni&#243;n con representantes de otras organizaciones de derechos de las mujeres. 
Los polic&#237;as pidieron los documentos de identificaci&#243;n del conductor y no dieron ning&#250;n 
motivo por haber detenido el taxi. Tras algunos minutos, las autorizaron a seguir adelante. 
</p>
<p>268. Posteriormente, otros agentes de la polic&#237;a detuvieron el taxi nuevamente, alegando 
que hab&#237;an escapado del primer control policial. Los agentes revisaron nuevamente los 
documentos de identificaci&#243;n del conductor y ordenaron a las mujeres que bajaran del taxi 
para poder revisar sus maletas. La Sra. P.O. opuso resistencia y exigi&#243; una explicaci&#243;n. Se 
aleg&#243; que agentes de la polic&#237;a esposaron violentamente P.O. y la subieron a la fuerza a una 
camioneta de polic&#237;a. Luego, las tres mujeres fueron llevadas a una comisar&#237;a en la ciudad 
de Le&#243;n y fueron puestas en libertad m&#225;s tarde. 
</p>
<p>269. De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, P.O., L.N. y A.E.O. quisieron presentar 
una denuncia en relaci&#243;n con el incidente en la oficina de la Comisar&#237;a de la Mujer, pero la 
jefa policial se neg&#243; a aceptar la denuncia, arguyendo que cuya Comisar&#237;a s&#243;lo se ocupaba 
de casos de violencia en el hogar. Adem&#225;s, la Sra. P.O. hubiese solicitado atenci&#243;n m&#233;dica 
para revisar las lesiones que habr&#237;a sufrido durante el incidente, pero dicha asistencia nunca 
lleg&#243;. 
</p>
<p>270. Se aleg&#243; que dicho incidente sucedi&#243; pocas horas despu&#233;s de que la Primera 
Comisionada de la Polic&#237;a, la Sra. A.E.G.S., asegurara a organizaciones de derechos 
humanos en Managua que no se reproducir&#237;an agresiones en contra de mujeres por parte de

<p><b>  Respuesta del Gobierno 
</b></p>
<p>273. En una carta con fecha del <b>4 de febrero de 2010</b>, el Gobierno respondi&#243; a la 
comunicaci&#243;n enviada el 26 de noviembre de 2009 e inform&#243; que el 30 de octubre del 2009, 
como parte de las medidas operativas generales para contrarrestar las actividades il&#237;citas y el 
crimen organizado, la Polic&#237;a Nacional dispuso un ret&#233;n ubicado en la salida del balneario 
de Poneloya, ubicado en el departamento de Le&#243;n. Dicho ret&#233;n Policial, detuvo un vehiculo 
taxi, con el objeto de requisarlo e identificar a los ocupantes. El conductor del veh&#237;culo, sin 
ning&#250;n problema, entreg&#243; los documentos respectivos y se identific&#243; como L.J.A.V. Se 
procedi&#243; a continuaci&#243;n a inspeccionar el veh&#237;culo y se localizaron en el valijero del mismo 
tres maletas. 
</p>
<p>274. Cuando los polic&#237;as se dispon&#237;an a realizar la requisa rutinaria en las maletas 
localizadas, se bajaron del veh&#237;culo las tres mujeres, quienes sin identificarse, comenzaron a 
vociferar e impedir la actuaci&#243;n policial aduciendo que era ilegal, que no hab&#237;an cometido 
delito alguno, que eran abogadas y conoc&#237;an la ley, cerrando de forma violenta el valijero 
del veh&#237;culo y ordenando al conductor que se retirara del lugar. 
</p>
<p>275. Los miembros del ret&#233;n policial dieron parte telef&#243;nico al Centro de Emergencia 
Policial de L&#233;on, desde donde se orient&#243; ubicar otro ret&#233;n policial motorizado en la entrada 
a la ciudad de Le&#243;n para interceptar al veh&#237;culo taxi referido. Viendo que el veh&#237;culo se 
acercaba, la Autoridad Policial procedi&#243; a realizarle el alto respectivo. Sin embargo, el 
conductor del veh&#237;culo hizo caso omiso a la se&#241;al de detenci&#243;n por lo que procedi&#243; a su 
persecuci&#243;n policial. 
</p>
<p>276. La patrulla motorizada alcanz&#243; al veh&#237;culo. Al abordar por segunda vez el 
conductor, se bajaron las tres mujeres viajando en el veh&#237;culo, agredieron verbalmente a los 
polic&#237;as y negaron a identificarse. Al intentar trasladarlas a la Delegaci&#243;n Policial para 
aclarar la situaci&#243;n, agredieron f&#237;sicamente a los polic&#237;as. Seguidamente, los oficiales 
requirieron al Centro de Emergencia el apoyo de otra patrulla. 
</p>
<p>277. A ese lugar, lleg&#243; otra patrulla motorizada al mando del suboficial J.C.D., quien 
intent&#243; persuadir a las tres mujeres a que se identificaran y se trasladaran a la Delegaci&#243;n 
Policial para aclarar la situaci&#243;n. Ellas respondieron con agresividad, improperios y bajo un 
estado de alteraci&#243;n excesiva. Por este motivo se envi&#243; al lugar del incidente una nueva 
patrulla, al mando del teniente H.F., quien luego de agotar la persuasi&#243;n ante la agresividad 
de las mujeres y la negaci&#243;n a identificarse o permitir la requisa de las maletas, decidi&#243; 
conducirlas a la Delegaci&#243;n Policial. </p>

</p>
<p>278. Al momento de intentar montarlas a la patrulla, las mujeres opusieron resistencia, 
forcejearon con los polic&#237;as. Una de ellas tom&#243; violentamente de la camisa al teniente H. F. 
desprendi&#233;ndole dos botones y rompiendo parte de la solapa. Ella le ocasion&#243; mordiscos y 
ara&#241;azos, hasta que se lograra reducir a una de ellas, coloc&#225;ndole las esposas. Ella fue 
trasladada a la Delegaci&#243;n Policial. Las otras dos acompa&#241;antes se quedaron en el lugar, 
debido a la presencia de personas antisociales que se sumaron a la alteraci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>279. En la Delegaci&#243;n, la mujer mantuvo siempre una actitud hostil, violenta y altamente 
agresiva negando identificarse e insisti&#243; en el que se le permitiera llamar telef&#243;nicamente. 
Posteriormente, llegaron las dos otras mujeres a bordo del taxi en el que se movilizaban, 
teniendo a la conducta violenta que hab&#237;an mantenido. 
</p>
<p>280. Una de las mujeres le pregunt&#243; al sub-comisionado C. donde se encontraban las 
oficinas de la Comisar&#237;a de la Mujer y la Ni&#241;ez. Despu&#233;s que el se la haya mostrado, ellas 
se dirigieron hasta ah&#237;. Preguntaron por la jefa. La subcomisionada M.M. se identific&#243;, 
pregunt&#225;ndoles si ten&#237;an algunas denuncias que hacer, a lo que ellas contestaron que iban a 
denunciar a la polic&#237;a. Finalmente, decidieron interponer la denuncia ante los medios de 
comunicaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>281. La Polic&#237;a supo que las personas conducidas eran P.O., A.E.O. y L.N., despu&#233;s de 
las llamadas telef&#243;nicas que las tres se&#241;oras realizaron, por lo que se procedi&#243; a informar a 
las autoridades superiores de la Polic&#237;a Nacional y se permiti&#243; que se marcharan por 
decisi&#243;n de la Jefatura Nacional. En ning&#250;n momento este incidente se deriv&#243; o estuvo 
vinculado al hecho de que las tres se&#241;oras relacionadas pertenecen a Organismos No 
Gubernamentales de Mujeres. Tampoco fue producto de alguna situaci&#243;n de persecuci&#243;n 
como se hab&#237;a pretendido dar la impresi&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>282. Por iniciativa del Jefe de la Delegaci&#243;n Policial Departamental de Le&#243;n, se inici&#243; 
una investigaci&#243;n disciplinaria para determinar la legalidad de la actuaci&#243;n y 
responsabilidad de los oficiales de polic&#237;a en sus actuaciones. El Inspector General de la 
Polic&#237;a Nacional, Comisionado General J. A. B. G. , atendi&#243; personalmente a las tres 
se&#241;oras y posteriormente, orden&#243; una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva sobre los hechos planteados. 
</p>
<p>283. Seg&#250;n la Ley 228, la Instituci&#243;n Policial actu&#243; de manera leg&#237;tima y apegada a las 
atribuciones y funciones que le confiere la dicha ley, la Ley de la Polic&#237;a Nacional, el 
C&#243;digo Procesal Penal (CPP) y el C&#243;digo Penal. La Polic&#237;a Nacional se encontraba 
realizando una actuaci&#243;n legal y leg&#237;tima en el marco de las atribuciones y funciones que le 
confiere la ley. En virtud del Art&#237;culo 239 del CPP, ella tiene la facultad de registrar 
veh&#237;culos, naves y aeronaves cuando exista la probabilidad fundada de la comisi&#243;n de un 
delito. 
</p>
<p>284. En el caso concreto, lo que justifica la acci&#243;n policial es el hecho de que se trate de 
una zona altamente afectada por la actividad del tr&#225;fico de estupefacientes, armas, 
contrabando y otras modalidades de tr&#225;fico il&#237;cito. Previamente a las 2:45 de la tarde del 30 
de octubre de 2009, se registr&#243; un robo con intimidaci&#243;n en la zona, cerca de donde se 
produjo el incidente. El veh&#237;culo en el que se movilizaban las tres mujeres era un taxi con 
placas de Managua, lo que no es com&#250;n en el sector de Le&#243;n. Estos tipos de veh&#237;culos han 
sido utilizados en otras ocasiones para cometer robos con intimidaci&#243;n. Adem&#225;s, los 
polic&#237;as que actuaron en el ret&#233;n ignoraban las calidades de las personas que viajaban en el 
veh&#237;culo, a&#241;adiendo que estas personas tampoco quisieron identificarse. 
</p>
<p>285. Las personas tienen la obligaci&#243;n de identificarse y brindar sus datos de filiaci&#243;n al 
momento de ser requerida por una autoridad policial que act&#250;a en el cumplimiento de sus 
funciones bajo pena de incurrir en la Falta Penal de &#8220;Negativa de Identificarse&#8221; establecida 
en el Art&#237;culo 533, del C&#243;digo Penal. Quien se oponga o impida a la Polic&#237;a Nacional el 
cumplimiento de una funci&#243;n o actividad leg&#237;tima incurre en el delito de &#8220;Obstrucci&#243;n de 
Funciones&#8221; que establece el Articulo 460 del C&#243;digo Penal. </p>

<p>286. La Jefatura Nacional de la Polic&#237;a abri&#243; un proceso de investigaci&#243;n administrativa 
en contra de los oficiales de Policiales involucrados, a trav&#233;s de la Divisi&#243;n de Asuntos 
Internos. Como parte del Proceso de Investigaci&#243;n, se recibi&#243; la denuncia de P.O. y L.N. Se 
entrevistaron a los ofendidos, testigos y polic&#237;as. Adem&#225;s, se requirieron Dict&#225;menes 
m&#233;dicos legales de los oficiales H.J.F.N., R.J.H. y C.R.B. Como resultado del examen f&#237;sico 
practicado a los oficiales, se encontr&#243; equimosis y excoriaciones traum&#225;ticas. El Oficio de la 
Polic&#237;a le solicit&#243; al Instituto de Medicina Legal una valoraci&#243;n medico legal de la Sra. 
P.O., en el que se concluy&#243; equimosis compatible por colocaci&#243;n de las esposas y 
excoriaci&#243;n superficial. Adem&#225;s, el 18 de noviembre de 2009, se le solicit&#243; al Instituto de 
Medicina Legal una valoraci&#243;n medico legal de A.E.O. y L.N. Al requerir el dictamen 
m&#233;dico legal, se inform&#243; que mediante sus registros no se encontraron resultados. Se 
presume que las oficiadas no acudieron. 
</p>
<p>287. Ateniendo los resultados de cada una de las diligencias de investigaci&#243;n practicadas, 
se encontr&#243; que los oficiales investigados actuaron en correspondencia a las normas y 
procedimientos que rigen la actuaci&#243;n policial. Se determin&#243; que no existe responsabilidad 
administrativa en contra de ellos y que al contrario, fueron victimas de violencia, lo que 
procedi&#243; a darle cierre a la investigaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>288. El Gobierno inform&#243; que no exist&#237;a ninguna causa judicial abierta en este caso, pero 
denuncias radicadas en el Ministerio P&#250;blico con fecha del 7 y del 30 de octubre del 2007. 
Al momento en el que contest&#243; el Gobierno, las denuncias referidas estaban en proceso de 
an&#225;lisis jur&#237;dico, ya que no exist&#237;a causa judicial en contra de la Sra. L.N., ni de ning&#250;n otro 
por los hechos denunciados. Al no existir ninguna acusaci&#243;n ni causa penal en contra de los 
denunciados, los mismos gozan de la plenamente de sus derechos fundamentales 
establecidos en la Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica de Nicaragua, sin ninguna limitaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>289. En su respuesta, el Gobierno inform&#243; igualmente que la Comisar&#237;a de la Mujer y la 
Ni&#241;ez fue creada mediante el art&#237;culo 21 de la Ley 228, Ley de la Polic&#237;a Nacional, con la

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>290. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of Nicaragua for its detailed 
reply.  
</p>
<p><b>  Nigeria 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>291. On <b>8 February 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences sent an allegation letter to the Government of Nigeria, regarding the case 
of <b>Ms. G.U.</b>, a member of the National Youth Service Corps, from Obudu in Cross River. 
</p>
<p>292. It was alleged that Ms. G.U. was serving in Maiduguri, Borno State, when she was 
raped by some men who reportedly took offense to the fact that she was wearing Khaki 
trousers, a part of the official uniform of the youth corps. She subsequently died in October 
2009, as a result of this incident. There had been no arrests in relation to this crime at the 
time this allegation letter was sent. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>60</b>  
</p>
<p>293. This crime took place in the context of the introduction and public hearings on a bill, 
introduced in the Senate in 2008, relating to &#8220;indecent dressing&#8221;. This bill included a 
number of prohibitions relating to the dress code for females above 14 years of age, such as 
any exposure of the belly and waist, and the wearing of transparent fabric. It proposed 
important powers of arrest and possible invasion of a woman&#8217;s body by police officers, and 
was considered to encourage vigilante action by ordinary citizens perceiving any woman 
&#8220;indecently dressed&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>294. Concern was expressed that the adoption of this bill would encourage and license 
violence against women and girls in Nigeria, resulting in a climate of impunity for crimes 
such as the rape and murder of G.U. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications 
from the Government on the following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide details of any measures taken to investigate the rape and 
murder of Ms. G.U., and any results that may have been obtained from such investigation.  
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide details on whether your government has conducted a gender 
analysis of impact of the proposed bill on &#8216;indecent dressing&#8217;, and its conformity to 
international human rights standards, and the results of such analysis. If no such analysis 
had been conducted please explain why not, and provide details on the current status of this 
proposed bill. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide information or available statistics on other reported cases of 
violence against women in the last two years which may have been motivated by objections 
to women or girls' dress.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>295. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the moment of finalizing the report, she had 
not received a reply from the Government of Nigeria concerning the above mentioned 
allegations. The Special Rapporteur notes that Ms. G.U.&#8217;s crime highlights what some 
perceive as a pattern of increasing vigilante action enforcing vague notions of feminine 
decency and appropriate dress codes, which encourage various forms and manifestations of 
discrimination and violence against women, and foster a climate of impunity. She therefore 
urges the Government of Nigeria to take all necessary measures, including prosecution and 
public engagement and education, in its efforts to reduce this pattern.  
</p>
<p><b>  Norway 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Response received to a communication sent earlier 
</b></p>
<p>296. In a letter dated of <b>23 December 2009,</b> the Government replied to the 
communication sent on 6 March 2009, concerning <b>Ms. E.H.A.</b> (see summary of the 
communication in the previous report on communications to and from Governments, 
A/HRC/11/6/Add.1). In its response, the Government informed that the facts described by 
the hospital Stavanger Universitetssykehus were completely different from those described 
by Ms. E.H.A. 
</p>
<p>297. The Government informed that Norwegian regulations of compulsory mental health 
care comply with international human rights norms and standards. It enclosed an unofficial 
translation of the Mental Health Care Act and stated that according to the hospital, none of 
these regulations have been violated. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>61 
</b></p>
<p>298. In addition, the Government informed that at the time when the response was sent, 
the case had been taken up by the Norwegian Board of Health supervision, but that no other 
details could be given on it due to Norwegian confidentiality regulations. 
</p>
<p>299. On 8 January 2010, the Government sent additional information regarding the case 
of Ms. E.H.A. 
</p>
<p>300. The Government indicated that, according to the Norwegian National Registry, one 
single person, Ms. E.H.A is registered as residing in Norway, in Stavanger. She was born on 
20 February 1989. According to this information, the Government believed that she must be 
the person concerned. The Government pointed out the importance of including the date of 
birth of parties concerned when the Government is asked to respond to complaints. 
</p>
<p>301. Referring to the alleged facts regarding legal aid, Norway claimed that the statement 
&#8220;<i>due to a lack of sufficient legal advice, the parents of Ms. E.H.A were not aware of the 
possibility to challenge the decision of the Control Commission of 26 September 2008, 
before a court of law, pursuant to chapter 7 of the Norwegian Mental Health Care Act and 
chapter 36 of the Civil Procedure Act</i>&#8221;, did not provide a complete or an accurate view of 
the case. According to the Government, the statement gave the impression that Ms. E.H.A 
never received any form of free legal aid, which was not the case. Ms. E.H.A was granted 
free legal aid by the Control Commission, where she was represented by her attorney, Mr. 
Hugo Dybwad. He was compensated for a total of 6,5 hours of work on this case, in 
accordance with his claim. Prior to this, Ms. E.H.A had already been granted 7 hours of free 
legal aid by the Control Commission for work performed by her former attorney. However, 
Ms. E.H.A&#8217;s mother did not show up for the Control Commission&#8217;s meeting which was 
subsequently postponed. 
</p>
<p>302. Secondly, Ms. E.H.A&#8217;s parents were personally informed of the outcome of the 
Control Commission case number 105/08 by two letters dated 26 September 2008, sent to 
both parents independently, in which they were informed of the possibility of challenging 
the decision before a court of law. Hence, no legal assistance would be necessary in order to 
become aware of this possibility. 
</p>
<p>303. The Government further noted that it is part of the duties of any attorney acting on 
behalf of a client who is granted legal aid to review the outcome of the case and 
communicate it to the client, and further to inform the client of any further action that can 
be taken in challenging the decision. This work is considered as an integral part of the case, 
and covered by the original grant of legal aid. Consequently, Ms. E.H.A&#8217;s parents should 
have been made aware of the possibility to challenge the decision of the Control 
Commission before the courts by their attorney. If Ms. E.H.A&#8217;s parents were, in fact, 
unaware of the possibility of challenging the decision of the Control Commission before a 
court of law, this lack of knowledge was not a consequence of a lack of free aid, as Ms. 
E.H.A was indeed granted free legal aid that should have covered such legal advice. 
</p>
<p>304. The Government informed that all complaints made to the police in Norway are 
filled in a central registry for criminal cases (STRASAK) and that searches made in this 
registry did not produce any information on cases with Ms. E.H.A registered as a victim of 
any form of sexual crime. It also indicated that her parents did not fill any such complaint 
on her behalf. Moreover, searches made in the local police registry for Stavanger revealed 
information on an incident on 23 June 2005, when Ms. E.H.A was found barefoot and rather 
exhausted in the middle of a road. The police took her to an emergency ward and her father 
was notified. As the information indicated that no reports on sexual crimes against Ms. 
E.H.A have been made to the police, the Government could not provide further information 
concerning this section of the case. 
</p>
<p>305. The Government explained that the objective of the Legal Aid Act is not to provide 
citizens with unlimited legal assistance, but rather to ensure a provision of a minimum of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>62</b>  
</p>
<p>legal assistance in cases where such assistance is deemed necessary. Furthermore, free legal 
aid is secondary to other schemes that could cover the applicant&#8217;s needs, such as the duty of 
public administrative bodies to provide citizens with the information and guidance. In cases 
where such alternatives schemes exist, additional assistance may not be regarded as a 
necessity. Concerning the case, the application for legal aid filed on 6 November 2008 did 
not specify the exact nature of the legal advice sought, but it was apparent that the objective 
was to further pursue cases relating to the treatment of Ms. E.H.A before various public 
administrative bodies including the regional branch of the Norwegian Board of Health 
Supervision, the Patient Ombudsman and the Control Commission. The County Governor 
of Rogaland rejected the application on 11 December 2008, with reference to the duty of 
public administrative bodies to provide information and guidance to the public. On 25 
December 2008, the decision to reject the application for legal aid was appealed to the 
Norwegian Civil Affairs Authority, which affirmed the County Governor&#8217;s decision to 
reject the application on 5 March 2009, but stated a different reason for the rejection. In the 
opinion of the Norwegian Civil Affairs Authority, the fundamental needs of Ms. E.H.A had 
been sufficiently covered by having several cases tried before administrative public bodies 
and exhausting the rights to administrative appeals through the free legal aid which was 
already granted by the Control Commission. Further, it ruled that that the decision of the 
Control Commission could be challenged before the courts, in which case free legal aid 
would be granted by the court itself. 
</p>
<p>306. As the Control Commission has the power to try any decision to compulsory admit a 
patient, and free legal aid will be granted unconditionally in such situations, the Norwegian 
Civil Affairs Authority found that any additional free legal aid to further pursue other cases 
than those already presented before the Control Commission would not be of great 
significance to Ms. E.H.A or her parents, and that free legal aid provided by the public 
treasury would not be reasonable in these cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>307. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of Norway for its detailed 
response.  
</p>
<p><b>  Pakistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Response received to a communication sent earlier 
</b></p>
<p>308. In a letter dated of <b>14 October 2009</b>, the Government replied to the communication 
sent on 3 July 2008, concerning the alleged stoning death of <b>Ms. S</b> <b>(</b>see summary of the 
communication in the previous report on communications to and from Governments, 
A/HRC/11/6/Add.1).  
</p>
<p>309. In its response, the Government informed that the alleged killing of Ms. S. and her 
husband by stoning was referred to concerned law enforcement and administrative 
authorities in Pakistan. The Government informed that the case has been thoroughly 
examined by the relevant authorities at provincial and local levels, and confirmed that Ms. 
S. and Mr. D.K.M. were not sentenced to death by stoning. 
</p>
<p>310. The Government informed that Ms. S. was a resident of Deen Bahar Colony of 
Peshawar and not from Mahmand Agency in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, as 
referred to in the communication. In addition, the two were killed on 31 March 2009 and 
not on 2 April 2009, as stated in the communication. Both were buried by their respective 
family members and no complaint was ever lodged with the local administration. 
Furthermore, the allegations of stoning to death were based on media reports; no proof of 
the event was found by the authorities and independent sources, even after thorough </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>63 
</b></p>
<p>investigations. Moreover, the dead body of Mr. A. was brought to hospital for examination. 
The postmortem report given by Medical Superintendent of Agency Headquarter Hospital 
Ghallanai also certified that Mr. A&#8217;s death was caused by fire-arm and not by stoning. 
</p>
<p>311. It is believed that both were killed by extremists who challenged the writ of the 
Government and had <i>de facto</i> control over the area at the time of this incidence. These 
extremists managed to manipulate media by reflecting this story negatively. 
</p>
<p>312. The Government stated that to ensure promotion and protection of all human rights 
of its citizens, the Government launched a full-fledged law enforcement operation in that 
area. The successful operation resulted in the cleansing the area of extremist elements and 
establishing the writ of the Government. This action enjoyed the full support of local 
population. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>313. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of Pakistan for its response 
and welcomes the efforts of the Government to ensure enhanced protection of human rights 
in this area. She wishes to reiterate earlier comments urging Governments to promulgate 
and strengthen state institutions and structures with a view ensuring an enhanced protection 
of women from violence.   
</p>
<p><b>  Philippines 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>314. On <b>23 April 2009</b> the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment 
of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health sent an allegation letter to 
the Government regarding the <b>implementation of Executive Order N&#176;003 (EO), issued in 
2000 and its consequences on the rights of the Philippine population, and especially 
women and children in Manila city</b>. 
</p>
<p>315. According to the information received, the EO has resulted in a ban on modern 
contraceptives from all Manila public health facilities and denial of any information or 
referral services for family planning. Reportedly, the EO has resulted in unwanted 
pregnancies, unsafe abortion, maternal mortality and morbidity amongst women, especially 
in rural areas. 
</p>
<p>316. Allegedly, even though the EO was issued on 29 February 2000, with a view to 
&#8220;promote responsible parenthood and uphold natural family planning (NFP)&#8221;, after its 
issuance, the Manila City Government withdrew all supplies of modern contraceptives from 
city public health facilities and has denied women from receiving any referral or 
information on family planning services. It was reported that since the issuance of the EO, 
city public health facilities have promoted NFP as the only acceptable contraceptive 
method. 
</p>
<p>317. The Office of the Mayor and the City Health Department denied residents of Manila 
City access to modern contraceptives, including those listed on the World Health 
Organization Model list of essential medicines. Testimonies allegedly also reveal that health 
workers have refused to provide information, counseling, or referrals on modern 
contraceptives, and have misinformed some women as to the safety of contraceptives. The 
withdrawal of modern contraceptives from clinics funded by the local government in 
Manila City has left many women without access to their main source of family planning </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>64</b>  
</p>
<p>services. According to a 2007 study,3the impact of the EO on the lives and health of Filipino 
women is pervasive, with particularly dire economic, social, physical and psychological 
consequences for often uneducated women of low economic status in Manila city. Some of 
the pervasive effects of the EO include unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, maternal 
mortality and morbidity, lack of education and employment, hunger and poverty. 
</p>
<p>318. Regrettably, a reproductive health Bill which would require government hospitals to 
include contraceptives amongst the supplies they purchase and would make reproductive 
health education mandatory in schools, has reportedly also been pending for more than four 
years. 
</p>
<p>319. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged pertaining to the 2000 EO, and the manner of its 
implementation accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide full details of any actions taken to ensure the full enjoyment 
of the right to health, including sexual and reproductive health rights.  
</p>
<p> 3.  Please provide details on the conclusions and follow up actions to any 
professional and independent impact assessments of the implementation of the EO, 
conducted or commissioned by your Government on the following: the right to life, health, 
self-determination and bodily integrity; violence against women; and the standard of living 
of the affected population, and in particular women and children. If no such assessment has 
been conducted, please explain why not, and provide information on any alternative non-
governmental reports and assessments that the Government may be reviewing or actively 
following up on.

<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>320. On <b>23 December 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences sent an allegation letter to the Government with regard to follow 
up reports received concerning the <b>case of the killing of 57 persons, including 21 women</b>, 
who were part of a convoy on its way to register the candidacy of Mr. Esmael 
Mangundadatu for 2010&#8217;s gubernatorial elections in Maguindanao province. 
</p>
<p>321. According to the information received, on 23 November 2009, a convoy of 
supporters of Mr. Esmael Mangundadatu was travelling on the road to Shariff Aguak, en 
route to an electoral office to register Mr. Esmael Mangundadatu as a candidate in the 
elections for governor of Maguindanao province in 2010. The convoy, which did not 
include the candidate himself, was led by his wife and formed of local politicians, lawyers 
and journalists. 
</p>
<p>322. In a rural area near the villages of Salman and Malating, the convoy was abducted 
by a group of more than 100 gunmen, suspected to be members of a militia at the services of 
the family of the Governor of Maguindanao province. Some reports indicated that among 
the abductors there were members of the police and of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. 
The gunmen took the entire convoy to a location around ten kilometres from the main road, 
where they killed at least 57 persons, including 21 women.

them were tested positive for traces of semen, indicative of sexual abuse. In addition, &#8220;some 
of the victims were shot in the genital area and in the face rendering them unrecognizable&#8221;. 
(Page 6) 
</p>
<p>324. The body of Ms. M., in particular revealed evidence of very brutal sexual mutilation. 
Two of the women killed were pregnant, and some of the victims were hogtied. Some of the 
bodies were left on the ground and in the vehicles, but the majority were found in 3 
different mass graves in Maguindanao province. The female victims included Mr. Esmael 
Mangundadatu&#8217;s wife, several of his sisters, as well as other female relatives, journalists, 
government employees and two lawyers.  
</p>
<p>325. On 26 November 2009, Mr. A.A. Jr., mayor of the town Datu Unsay and son of the 
Governor of Maguindanao Province, was arrested as a suspect. Reports indicated that his 
father, A.A. Sr., who was serving his third term as Governor, had been grooming A.A. Jr. to 
succeed him in office as a result of the 2010 elections. 
</p>
<p>326. The National Police Director suspended or relieved several of the commanding 
officers of the police in Maguindanao province from their positions, while other members of 
Maguindanao police were arrested. The Armed Forces of the Philippines announced that the 
Ampatuan family&#8217;s private militia would be disbanded, and through Proclamation No. 1959, 
the Government instated Martial Law in the province of Maguindanao (except for certain 
areas). Martial Law was subsequently lifted by President Arroyo on 13 December 2009. 
</p>
<p>327. The Acting Secretary of Justice in the Government announced that prosecutors were 
processing the admission to the witness protection program of 20 or more witnesses to the 
killings. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any criminal 
investigation or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to the killings 
on 23 November 2009, and, in due course, the results of any prosecutions undertaken, 
including for the further crimes of a sexual nature perpetrated against the women victims. 
Insofar as compatible with the needs of their protection, please describe the measures taken 
to ensure that witnesses and family members of the victims are not subject to any 
intimidation or retaliation. 
</p>
<p> 3. With respect to Maguindanao Province, please provide available statistics or 
other reports of the level of violence against women in that province, by both state and non 
state actors in the last 5 years. Please also provide information on the specific measures to 
69be taken in order to protect women and girls in that province from the culture of 
impunity and the violence perpetrated by state and non state actors in the future.  
</p>
<p> 4. Please describe the measures adopted by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
prevent any potential abuse of power or harm to civilian populations in the aftermath of this 
incident, and in order to prevent further killings in the course of the 2010 local and national 
election campaigns. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>328. In a letter dated <b>5 November 2009</b>, the Government responded to the 
communication dated 23 April 2009, informing that EO N&#176; 003 did not ban the use of 
artificial methods of contraception and there was nothing that restricted access to family 
health services. Additionally, the Government noted that the City of Manila takes an 
affirmative stand on pro-life issues and responsible parenthood, and allows couples the 
discretion to use their own methods of family planning relevant to their own moral/ethical </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>66</b>  
</p>
<p>perception and religion conviction. Furthermore, it highlighted that both nationally-run 
and/or locally governed public health facilities offer family planning methods which are 
part of the health education services provided in all health facilities. 
</p>
<p>329. The Government stated that there was no truth in the allegation that the City of 
Manila denied residents access to modern contraceptives. Although it was noted that health 
services in city hospitals and public health facilities in Manila were free of charge, the 
Government indicated that artificial family planning methods could not be provided due to 
financial constraints. However, Manila did not prevent private hospitals, clinics and NGOs 
from distributing free family planning commodities neither did it impose a ban on the sale 
such items in drugstores. 
</p>
<p>330. The Government further noted that EO 003 is a policy declaration which merely lays 
down the direction of the city as it puts high value on the right of women to health, 
including reproductive and health rights. 
</p>
<p>331. The Government informed that further information on the matter had been requested 
from concerned authorities and that the Special Rapporteur was going to be informed of 
new developments once they became available. 
</p>
<p>332. Moreover, the Government provided a copy of Republic Act N&#176; 9710 , also known 
as &#8220;An Act Providing for the Magna Carta of Women&#8221;, a legislation that aims to eliminate 
discrimination against women, which President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed into law 
on 14 August 2009.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>333. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of the Philippines for its 
response to the communication sent on 23 April 2009. She would like to receive additional 
information on any further developments concerning the implementation of the Executive 
Order N&#176; 003 in Manila City. She would also be grateful to receive information about 
access to sexual and reproductive rights for women and girls at the country level.  
</p>
<p>334. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the moment of finalizing the report, she had 
not received an official reply concerning the communication sent on 23 December 2009 and 
urges the Government to provide at the earliest possible date a detailed substantive answer 
to the above communication with information of any ongoing investigations and judicial 
proceedings against alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>335. The Special Rapporteur wishes to take this opportunity to urge the Government of 
the Philippines to take all steps to ensure enhance protection of human rights activists, 
including women human rights defenders, from intimidation, threats and violence. 
</p>
<p><b>  Responses received to communications sent earlier 
</b></p>
<p>336. In a letter dated <b>16 July 2009</b>, the Government responded to the communication 
dated 5 October 2007 regarding the kidnapping and detention of <b>Ms. K.E., Ms. S.C. and 
Mr. M. M</b>., allegedly because of their activities in defense of human rights (see 
A/HRC/11/6/Add.1).  
</p>
<p>337. The Government noted that the parents of Ms. K.E., Ms. S.C. and Mr. M. M had 
filed before the Court of Appeals a Petition for <i>Habeas Corpus</i> on 17 July 2006, praying 
that a Writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> be issued directing several respondents of the Armed Forces 
of the Philippines (AFP) to bring the bodies of the victims to the Court. The petition was 
later dismissed for lack of evidence that the victims were indeed in respondents&#8217; custody. 
</p>
<p>338. However, on 24 October 2007, a Writ of Amparo was subsequently filed in the 
Supreme Court where the Court resolved to issue the Writ and ordered the Court of Appeals </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>67 
</b></p>
<p>to hear the petition. Hearings were conducted with Mr. R.M. as the principal witness since 
the latter testified that he saw S.C. in the same military camp where he was brought after he 
was kidnapped by paramilitaries soldiers.  
</p>
<p>339. The Court of Appeals, on the basis of R.M.&#8217;s testimony, directed the AFP to 
immediately release of S.C., K.E. and M.M. In addition, the Philippine National Police 
(PNP) was ordered to resume its unfinished investigation so that the truth will be fully 
ascertained and appropriate charges filed against those truly responsible. However, 
witnesses refused to cooperate with the investigators despite several attempts to 
communicate and/or coordinate with them. The Government informed that the PNP is 
continuing its efforts to ensure that the witnesses or anyone who can give any information 
would eventually cooperate. 
</p>
<p><b>  Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>340. On <b>23 April 2009</b> the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment 
of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, sent an allegation letter to 
the Government concerning <b>Ms. L.S.</b>, a young woman, who was charged with intentional 
and premeditated murder after having performed an abortion at home.  
</p>
<p>241. According to the information received L.S. became pregnant in autumn 2005 as a 
result of a rape. In May 2006, L.S. performed an abortion at her home when she was in her 
27th week of pregnancy. Suffering from severe blood loss, she was rushed to the local 
hospital, where the diagnosis report upon her release was &#8220;late term abortion outside the 
hospital with hemorrhagic shock&#8221;<i>.</i> The doctors reported her to the police, who subsequently 
detained her. 
</p>
<p>242. After her arrest, L.S. was taken to the Remand Center Glodeni, where she was 
reportedly subjected to degrading treatment, including body searches by 2 male guards, 
insults and threats, and denied post-abortion care while in pre-trial detention. Poor 
conditions in the detention centre, including lack of adequate access to basic sanitary 
facilities, water, sanitary pads and heating aggravated her condition. 
</p>
<p>243. Although Moldovan legislation does not criminalize abortions except in certain 
situations &#8211; none of which were pertinent in the present case &#8211;, Ms. L.S. was sentenced on 
29 December 2006, with 20 years of imprisonment for intentional and premeditated murder 
with aggravating circumstances. 
</p>
<p>244. On 17 January 2007, she appealed the court&#8217;s decision and complained about several 
irregularities during the criminal proceedings. On the same day, the Court rejected her 
appeal without taking into consideration any of her statements, including her declaration 
that she was raped and unwillingly terminated her pregnancy with the help of the rapist. On 
2 July 2007, Ms. L.S. filed a second appeal with the Supreme Court of Justice of the 
Republic of Moldova, which was declared inadmissible on 12 December 2007.  
</p>
<p>245. Information received described alleged violations with respect to Ms. L.S.&#8217;s right to 
due process, including the lack of appropriate consideration of evidence, the existence of 
gender bias and sex discrimination, and lack of effective legal assistance. Reportedly key 
evidence from her medical files confirmed that she was treated for a self induced abortion 
(rather than complications from a live birth) was not professionally examined and existing 
Moldovan law on the concepts of &#8216;birth&#8217;, the &#8216;new born&#8217;, the &#8216;person&#8217;, and &#8216;foetus&#8217; was 
disregarded. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>68</b>  
</p>
<p>246. The lack of effective legal counsel was also reportedly manifest throughout the court 
proceedings, and authorities did not intervene to remedy the situation. For example, 
reportedly the court asked the defendant to provide her own statement and continued the 
hearing despite the fact that neither her appointed lawyer nor the prosecution appeared in 
the final hearing, where she was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment. In her appeal, the 
irregularities in the previous stage of the criminal process, and her declaration that she was 
raped were reportedly also not taken into consideration. Gender biased and discriminatory 
statement made during the criminal proceedings reportedly included the written closing 
statements by the prosecution, and a &#8220;character&#8221; witness form by the town mayor. At the 
time the communication was sent, no measure had been taken by law enforcement 
authorities with respect to the reported rape. 
</p>
<p>247. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. What are the legal grounds for charging and sentencing Ms. L.S. to 20 years 
of imprisonment for intentional and premeditated murder? 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide details regarding consideration by the courts or actions by 
other authorities with respect to: Ms L.S.&#8217;s medical records; her allegations of judicial 
irregularities; lack of proper legal counsel; discrimination; and rape.  
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide details on any medical assistance provided to Ms. L.S. while 
in detention, and if none was provided, the reasons why not.  
</p>
<p> 5. Please provide details on what legal remedies, including extraordinary legal 
remedies, (e.g<i>. recurs in anulare</i>, available before the Supreme Court of Justice under 
article 452 of the Moldovan Code of Criminal Procedure) are available, and whether this 
are being undertaken. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>248. On <b>5 June 2009</b>, the Government replied to the communication sent on 23 April 
2009. It stated that Ms. L.S. was recognized guilty for having committed on 12 May 2006, 
criminal actions, according to Art. 145 para. 3) a), b), h) of the Criminal Code, in Fundurii 
Vechi, Glodeni District. 
</p>
<p>249. She was in a state of advanced pregnancy &#8211; which she hid &#8211;and gave birth alone to 
two viable male babies. With the aim to kill the babies, she hit both babies in the head with 
the help of a spade causing them serious injuries. Ms. L.S. buried the newborn babies in 
order to hide the crime, and kept their birth a secret until their bodies were found. 
According to the examined corpses and laboratory investigations data, both babies died as 
the result of cerebral traumas with multiple brain bone fractures.  
</p>
<p>250. Ms. L.S. was convicted to 20 years imprisonment by the Glodeni sector court. The 
sentence was appealed by Ms. L.S. on 17 January 2007 and was rejected by Criminal 
Chamber of Court of Appeal in Balti on 20 June 2007.  
</p>
<p>251. Ms. L.S. and her lawyer, Mr. O.D. appealed the sentence at the Supreme Court. The 
appeal was rejected by Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court on 12 July 2007, declaring 
the appeal inadmissible and invoking the unfounded nature of it. 
</p>
<p>252. The Government explained that Ms. L.S. and her lawyers, Mr. I.R. and Mr. O.D. had 
chosen by themselves to exhaust all ordinary remedies and that it is not justified that Ms. 
L.S. has been deprived of the right to appeal the judicial decision at the Supreme Court. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>69 
</b></p>
<p>253. With regard to the qualifications of actions sentenced on the base of art. 145, para 3 
a), b), d), i) of the Criminal Code, Ms. L.S. committed a crime. According to forensic 
reports n&#176; 45 and 46 from 26 June 2006, the babies were born alive but died prematurely at 
the age of seven months. The length of their extra uterine life was less than 40 minutes. 
</p>
<p>254. The judicial psychiatric expertise of Ms. L.S. &#8212; report of psychiatric expertise 
161A-2006 from 20 June 2006 &#8212; showed that during the committal of the crime, she did 
not suffer from any psychic disease, or a temporary psychotic disorder, and that she did not 
manifest any physiological affect. The Court of Appeal disposed of the psychiatric expertise 
on the basis of the request of the defending lawyer of the accused. Judicial experts and 
psychiatrics had the same conclusion. 
</p>
<p>255. The Government informed that during the whole duration of the criminal case, Ms. 
L.S. benefited from the services of defending lawyers, chosen by herself or by her relatives. 
The Court examined the case objectively and under all the aspects, giving the possibility to 
the defense to present evidence in equal conditions with the prosecution. 
</p>
<p>256. After examining the request of Ms. L.S., the Office of the General Prosecutor did 
not determine the presence of any legal basis to appeal in cassation against the judicial 
decision delivered in this regard. Furthermore, the Criminal Procedural Law offers the 
possibility to appeal in cassation in case they consider that legal errors had been committed 
during the trial.  
</p>
<p>257. Furthermore, the Government stated that rape allegations were being examined by 
the Office of the General Prosecutor. The Government added that these statements, 
including that Ms. L.S. was raped, were done by her after the case had been examined by 
the Court. During the whole process of criminal investigation and trial, Ms. L.S. gave 
controversial statements regarding the crime. 
</p>
<p>258. The Government informed that when the Law on amendment of the Criminal Code 
n&#176;277-XVI from 18 December 2008 would enter into force on 24 May 2009, the General 
Prosecutor will examine the possibility of notifying the Supreme Court of Justice with an 
appeal for an eventual reduction of Ms. L.S.&#8217;s conviction. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>259. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of Moldova for its response. 
The Special Rapporteur would like to be informed on the results of the investigations 
conducted into the allegations of rape with regard to this case.

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>360. On <b>20 July 2009</b> the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the killing of <b>Ms. N.E.</b>, a 
prominent human rights defender and researcher working with the Russian NGO Memorial. 
</p>
<p>361. According to the information received, on 15 July 2009, Ms. N.E. was kidnapped in 
front of her house in Grozny. According to eyewitness reports, Ms. N.E. was dragged into a 
white vehicle and driven away by unknown individuals. Her body was later found in the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>70</b>  
</p>
<p>woods near the city of Nazran, in Ingushetia. She had sustained two gunshots to her head 
and chest. 
</p>
<p>362. Concern was expressed that the kidnapping and subsequent murder of Ms. N.E. may 
be directly related to her activities in the defense of human rights, in particular her fact-
finding carried out into human rights abuses, such as summary executions, enforced 
disappearances and torture committed in the Chechen Republic. Further serious concern 
was expressed that the killing of Ms. N.E. formed part of a pattern of similar cases, 
including the murder of Ms. A.P., Mr. S.M. and Ms. A.B., which, coupled with the 
prevailing cycle of impunity, had the potential of gravely stifling independent human rights 
work and freedom of expression in the country.  
</p>
<p>363. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to 
this case. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain 
why. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been 
undertaken. Have penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions been imposed on the 
alleged perpetrators? 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide the details of any measures taken by your Government to 
prevent the recurrence of such executions, in accordance with the Principles on the 
Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>364. In a letter dated <b>27 August 2009</b>, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 20 July 2009, indicating that the preliminary investigation on the case established 
that on 15 July 2009, Ms. N.E., a member of the Memorial human rights centre, Grozny 
branch, left her apartment at about 7.35 a.m. and was making her way to public transport to 
go to work at the Memorial office, located at 84 Mayakovsky Street in Grozny. At Building 
No. 10, 133 Khmelnitsky Street, unidentified persons dragged her into a white VAZ 2107 
vehicle and drove away to an unknown destination. 
</p>
<p>365. The Leninsky inter-district investigative team for Grozny instituted criminal 
proceedings under article 126, paragraph 2 (a) and (c), of the Russian Criminal Code on 15 
July 2009. 
</p>
<p>366. It was on that day that, at 4.30 p.m., Ms. N.E.&#8217;s body was found with two gunshot 
wounds to her head and two to the torso in a wooded area some 200 metres from the 
Kavkaz federal highway near the village of Gazi-Yurt in the Nazran district, Republic of 
Ingushetia. Her passport and her purse containing personal items, including two switched-
off mobile phones, were found lying beside her. 
</p>
<p>367. On the same day, 15 July 2009, the Nazranovsky inter-district investigative team for 
Nazran, a unit of the investigative department for the Republic of Ingushetia working under 
the Investigation Committee of the Procurator&#8217;s Office of the Russian Federation, opened a 
criminal case under article 105, paragraph 1, and article 222, paragraph 1, of the Russian 
Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>368. On 16 July 2009, the criminal cases were transferred to the Central Investigative 
Department for the Southern Federal District under the Investigative Committee attached to 
the Procurator&#8217;s Office of the Russian Federation and combined into one case.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>369. Searches were carried out on the grounds of Building No. 10, 133 Khmelnitsky 
Street, Grozny; at the site where the body was discovered; in the office of the Grozny 
branch of Memorial; and at Ms. N.E.&#8217;s place of residence, where material evidence that is 
now undergoing the necessary forensic analysis was gathered. 
</p>
<p>370. The investigation has involved: 
</p>
<p> 1. Carrying out three re-enactments of the crime to establish how long it might 
take a light vehicle to go from the spot where Ms. N.E. was abducted to the site where her 
body was found 
</p>
<p> 2. Obtaining and analyzing video surveillance footage to find the white VAZ 
2107 and a green VAZ 2112 resembling the one that accompanied the vehicle used in the 
crime against Ms. N.E. 
</p>
<p> 3. Identifying vehicles that may be relevant to the investigation and authorizing 
bodies of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs to trace their owners and check for 
involvement in the crime 
</p>
<p> 4. Showing witnesses photographs of makes of the vehicles that drove away 
from the spot where Ms. N.E. was abducted on the morning of 15 July 2009 
</p>
<p> 5. Re-enacting what might have been seen from the apartment from which a 
person had witnessed vehicles coming and going 
</p>
<p> 6. Obtaining vehicle registration records 
</p>
<p> 7. Confiscating and incorporating in the case materials DVDs of video 
surveillance footage from several checkpoints; the information on the DVDs is currently 
being reviewed and analysed 
</p>
<p> 8. Arranging for 16 different forensic analyses, the initial results of which are 
being reviewed and compared with other evidence obtained in the case 
</p>
<p> 9. Gathering and analysing information on Ms. N.E.&#8217;s mobile phone contacts. 
</p>
<p>371. Moreover, the Government informed that 263 witnesses had been questioned and 
that a range of investigative and operational activities to identify the perpetrators of the 
crime was under way. It further noted that the Investigative Committee of the Procurator&#8217;s 
Office of the Russian Federation was overseeing the progress and outcome of the 
investigation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>372. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of the Russian Federation for 
its response. The Special Rapporteur observes, with concern, that several high-profile 
female human rights defenders have been subjected to violence in the course of their work. 
She wishes to remind States of their international obligation to eliminate discrimination 
against women in the political and public life of their respective country and, in particular, 
to ensure to women, on equal terms with men, the right to participate in non governmental 
organizations and associations concerned with the public and political life of the country. 
She wishes to be kept informed of any ongoing investigations and judicial proceedings.  
</p>

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>373. On <b>5 June 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Independent Expert appointed by the Human Rights Council </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>72</b>  
</p>
<p>on the situation of human rights in Somalia, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the death sentence issued in 
two cases, respectively against <b>Ms. I.A.A.</b>, who was reportedly pregnant and incarcerated in 
Bossaso central prison, and against <b>Mr. A.M.M. </b>and<b> Mr. B.M.I.</b> 
</p>
<p>374. According to the information received, the Court of First Instance in the City of 
Bossaso sentenced Ms. I.A.A. to death on 27 April 2009, for the murder of Ms. S.M.A., 
another of her husband&#8217;s wives. The victim was the daughter of the President of that same 
court. However, he did not sit on the bench during the trial. Ms. I.A.A. was reported to be 
73four or five months pregnant. She was sentenced to death within 24 hours after the 
alleged killing and did not have the necessary time to consult with a lawyer and prepare her 
defence. In this regard, it was unclear whether Ms. I.A.A. had access to adequate legal 
representation. Ms. I.A.A.&#8217;s relatives reported that she may have acted in self-defence. 
</p>
<p>375. Mr. A.M.M. and Mr. B.M.I. were sentenced to death on 29 April 2009 by a 
temporary Islamic Shari&#8217;a Court appointed, by virtue of decree No: MW/DPS/27/09 dated 
28/04/09 of the President of Puntland, State of Somalia, to hear and reach a verdict on the 
case that caused the death of the Governor of Karkar Y.S.H. and the injury of Mr. M.A.M. 
that took place in Dudhub village in Karkar Region on 26/04/09. As such, the Islamic 
Shari&#8217;a Court was not part of the ordinary judicial structure of Somalia. In addition, two of 
the persons appointed were not judges, but religious scholars. Mr. A.M.M. and Mr. B.M.I. 
were only appointed a lawyer during the hearing and did not allegedly have enough time to 
consult with him. 
</p>
<p>376. In its sentence, the court only referred to the possibility that &#8220;The President has the 
right to alleviate the death sentence to imprisonment and thereafter the heirs have the right

</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details of any investigation into Ms. I.A.A.&#8217;s alleged

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>378. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of finalizing the report, she had not 
received an official reply and urges the Government of Somalia to provide at the earliest 
possible date a detailed substantive answer to the above communication. </p>

<p>379. The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress that only full respect for stringent due 
process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as permitted under international law 
from a summary execution, which violates human rights standards. She would also like to 
refer to the express prohibition, in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
to carry out death sentences on pregnant women.

<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>380. On <b>14 August 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights defenders sent an allegation letter to the Government regarding the judicial 
prosecution of <b>Ms. A.H.</b>, a women&#8217;s rights defender and journalist. 
</p>
<p>381. According to the information received, Ms. A.H. was facing judicial prosecution 
following the publication of an article on 12 July 2009 in Ajrass Al Horreya in which she 
criticized restrictions on women&#8217;s rights in Sudan. In the article, she expressed her support 
for fellow journalist Ms. L.A.H. who was arrested for wearing trousers in public and faced a 
possible sentence of 40 lashes. The Public Order Police filed a complaint against Ms. A.H. 
for defamation, in accordance with Article 159 of the Sudanese Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>382. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern that the judicial prosecution of Ms. A.H. 
may be related to her peaceful and legitimate activities in defense of women&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>383. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide information on how the judicial prosecution of Ms. A.H. is 
compatible with international human rights norms and standards, in particular those related 
to freedom of opinion and expression, as contained inter alia in the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders and the 
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>384. In a letter dated <b>24 September 2009</b>, the Government responded to the 
communication sent on 14 August 2009, concerning <b>Ms. A.H.</b> 
</p>
<p>385. The Government emphasized that the judicial proceedings against Ms. A.H. had no 
relation to the constitutional rights enjoyed by her as a citizen or to the right of freedom of 
opinion and expression, as the newspaper had been writing critical articles of the 
Government for many years without anyone interfering with its freedom of opinion. 
</p>
<p>386. On 11 July 2009, Ms. A.H. published an article in the opposition newspaper Ajras 
al-Hurriya, in which she announced her solidarity with another journalist but also referred to 
the forces of law and order in offensive and unseemly terms, degrading the reputation of the 
police in the minds of ordinary citizens. 
</p>
<p>387. The forces of law and order instituted criminal proceedings against her through the 
Office of the Press and Publications Prosecutor, invoking defamation. According to these 
authorities, a complaint was filed against the newspaper Ajras al-Hurriya and the author of 
the article, Ms. A.H., in July 2009. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>74</b>  
</p>
<p>388. Pursuant to the article 28 of the Press and Publications Act, the Union of Journalists 
was informed of the charges filed against the author of the article. The journalist and the 
editor of the newspaper, Mr. M.G. was not arrested but was summoned by telephone to 
assist with the investigation. Their statements could be recorded, in accordance with the 
normal procedure of the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. They were released immediately after 
questioning on personal recognizance. 
</p>
<p>389. After assessing the case, the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office issued a decision on 28 July 2009 
to file charges for defamation, under article 159 of the Criminal Code in conjunction with 
articles 27 and 29 of the 2004 Press and Publications Act. They were informed of the 
decision of the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to file charges and of their right to lodge an appeal 
against the decision with the representative of the Higher Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office by 2 
August 2009. 
</p>
<p>390. The defendants did not lodge an appeal within the legal time limit. Then, the 
criminal case was referred to the competent court on 14 August 2009. At the time of 
receiving the response from the Government, the case was pending before the competent 
court. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>391. On <b>26 August 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on torture sent an urgent appeal to 
the Government concerning the case of <b>Ms. L.A.H.</b>, a Sudanese national. 
</p>
<p>392. According to the information received, Ms. L.A.H. was charged with the offence of 
&#8216;inappropriate dress and conduct&#8217; for which she faced being flogged 40 times, should she be 
found guilty. Her trial, which was previously postponed, was scheduled to take place on 7 
September 2009. 
</p>
<p>393. On 3 July 2009, police forces stormed into a restaurant in Khartoum where Ms. 
L.A.H. and twelve other women were having dinner, and arrested them for wearing 
trousers. The women were charged under article 152 (Indecent and Immoral Acts) of the 
1991 Penal Code. It was reported that ten of the women (two were under the age of 16) 
pleaded guilty and received punishments of ten lashes each. Charges were brought against 
three others, including Ms. L.A.H.  
</p>
<p>394. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> (1) Are the facts alleged accurate?  
</p>
<p> (2) Please provide information and an analysis on the conformity or lack thereof 
of article 152 (Indecent and Immoral Acts) of the 1991 Penal Code, and Sudan&#8217;s 
international human rights obligations as well as Sudan&#8217;s Constitution. 
</p>
<p> (3)  Please provide detailed information on what mechanisms exist to bring 
Sudanese legislation in line with its Constitution and international human rights obligations, 
and whether any such legal or other actions have been taken, and if not, why not. 
</p>
<p> (4) Please provide information on measures taken by your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to safeguard the human rights of Ms. L.A.H., including her right to physical 
integrity and freedom from torture and degrading treatment.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>395. In a letter dated <b>2 October 2009</b>, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 26 August 2009 concerning <b>Ms. L.A.H.</b>. At the time this report was finalized; a 
translation of the response was not yet available. </p>

<p>396. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its responses to the 
communications above mentioned. She will provide further observations, once the 
translation becomes available, in her 2011 communications report.  
</p>
<p><b>  Turkey 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>397. On <b>22 May 2009</b> the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning <b>Ms. R.H.</b>, a citizen of 
Iran. 
</p>
<p>398. According to the preliminary information received, Ms. R.H. has been residing in 
Turkey as a refugee since 3 June 2004. She was living in a shelter, namely, the Eskisehir 
Tepabasi Municipality Women&#8217;s Shelter, in Eskisehir. Ms. R.H. had undergone many 
developments in her refugee and residency status in Turkey since 2004, as well as a divorce 
from an abusive husband, a rape resulting in a pregnancy, several other instances of sexual 
harassment, a previous acceptance of resettlement by Canada which she was unable to avail 
herself of due to administrative blockages in Turkey, and attempts to deport her to Iran by 
the Turkish authorities.  
</p>
<p>399. Ms. R.H. was accepted for resettlement by Sweden and had a visa, passport and 
flight tickets to depart for Sweden on 27 May 2009. She was reportedly not being granted 
legal permission by the Foreign Agency office of Eskisehir to leave Eskisehir and go to 
Ankara in order to deal with the administrative aspects of her imminent resettlement to 
Sweden. A similar situation occurred in February 2009, when she was accepted to go to 
Canada but was unable to do so, due to the fact that the Foreign Agency Office of Kirklareli 
/ and police department did not give her legal permission to go to Ankara for her required 
medical and other interviews.  
</p>
<p>400. Ms. R.H. informed that there was an ongoing court case regarding her situation since 
the day of her deportation to Iran was withheld / stayed, by the temporary decision of the 
Administrative Court. Her lawyer informed her that this may be what was blocking her from 
leaving Turkey. He suggested that a solution could be that Ms. R.H. dropped her court case 
in relation to her stay of deportation, and requested the Turkish Government that they deport 
her to Sweden instead or allow her to leave voluntarily to Sweden.  
</p>
<p>401. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the preliminary facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate? 
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide information about the measures that have been requested and 
taken in view of the urgency of the situation, to review the case of Ms. R.H., including to 
review the denial of permission to travel to Ankara (in order to prepare her departure to 
Sweden), and with regard to resolving the pending court case on her stay of deportation to 
Iran. 
</p>
<p> 3. I would like to be informed about any future administrative or judicial 
decisions taken with regard to the case of Ms. R.H. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>402. In a letter dated <b>27 May 2009</b>, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 22 May 2009 concerning <b>Ms. R.H.</b> The Government explained that Ms. R.H. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>76</b>  
</p>
<p>entered in Turkey on 28 May 2005 from Esendere-Hakkari border and requested to be 
resettled to a third country due to family reasons.  
</p>
<p>403. Since she did not carry the necessary conditions to be considered a refugee 
according to the 1951 Geneva Convention, the Turkish Ministry of Interior decided to close 
her file on 16 June 2006. While the necessary procedures were underway, an interim 
measure was taken by the European Court of Human Rights and accordingly she was sent to 
the Kirklareli Reception and Accomodation Center for Asylum Seekers and Refugees. 
</p>
<p>404. The Government informed that Ms. R.H. refused to be settled to a satellite city for 
foreigners and filed a suit against the Turkish Ministry of Interior on the 13th 
Administrative Court of Ankara. The Court decided for a stay of execution of the above-
mentioned decision and further ruled for her settlement in Eskisehir. 
</p>
<p>405. The Government finally informed that the judicial process would need to be 
completed before a final decision to be taken concerning Ms. R.H. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>406. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government of Turkey for its response to 
the communication mentioned above and reiterates that she would like to be kept informed 
on any administrative or judicial decisions which may have been or may be taken with 
regard to Ms. R.H.  
</p>
<p><b>  Uganda 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>407. On <b>13 May 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the death threats 
received between 10 April and 8 May 2009 by <b>Ms. E.M.V.</b>, the Executive Director of 
WODIDEF, and <b>Mr. A.K.B.</b>,<b> </b>the<b> </b>Chairperson and Chief of Research for WODIDEF, and 
originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WODIDEF mission is to improve 
refugee women and girls&#8217; lives through international human rights standards and advocacy 
on their behalf. 
</p>
<p>408. Since October 2008, WODIDEF has undertaken activities and research on sexual 
and gender-based violence against refugee women in Uganda. WODIDEF submitted a 
report to the African Commission for Human and Peoples Rights, which called on the 
Government to address the issues raised in the presentation of its third periodic report. 
</p>
<p>409. According to the information received, on 10 April 2009 Mr. A.K.B. was reportedly 
denied access to the confidential email of WODIDEF, despite only him and Ms. E.M.V. 
having access. Later that day, he received a call from an unidentified man who asked about 
his whereabouts. He received two further calls and, fearing for his safety, did not answer, 
and decided to change his telephone number. When WODIDEF staff members called the 
number from which Mr. A.K.B. received the anonymous calls, a male voice allegedly 
announced that that number belonged to the Security Unit located in Bukoto. 
</p>
<p>410. On 14 April, Ms. E.M.V. allegedly received an anonymous call threatening her for 
passing false information to the international community that criticized the Government of 
Uganda and its criminal justice system. She was told she was under security watch, and that 
she would not escape.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>77 
</b></p>
<p>411. On 15 April, Ms. E.M.V. reportedly sensed being followed while returning to her 
home from the premises of the Refugee Law Project where she works. She noticed three 
men that she had seen earlier that day outside the Refugee Law Project at Makerere 
University. She took evasive action but eventually returned to the office of the Refugee Law 
Project as the men continued to follow her. Fearing that she would be followed home once 
more, she spent the night in hiding in another home. 
</p>
<p>412. On 20 April, members of WODIDEF allegedly discovered that their office had been 
broken into, and two computers had been stolen. These computers were said to have 
contained confidential information concerning the situation of refugee women in Uganda, 
information used in WODIDEF reports to the international community. 
</p>
<p>413. On 3 May, Mr. A.K.B. received an anonymous call on his new phone number. A 
male voice reportedly told him to return to his country and warned him that for his security 
he should stop carrying out human rights activities in Uganda. The male voice then issued a 
death threat. On 8 May, Mr. A.K.B. received another anonymous phone call, reiterating the 
threats expressed earlier. Ms. E.M.V. and Mr. A.K.B. were reported to be in hiding out of 
fear for their safety.  
</p>
<p>414. Concern was expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. 
E.M.V. and Mr. A.K.B.. Further concern was expressed that the acts of harassment and 
intimidation against the aforementioned persons may be related to their activities defending 
human rights, in particular their publication of information concerning the rights of refugees 
in Uganda. 
</p>
<p>415. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Has a complaint been lodged by or on behalf of Ms. EM.V. and Mr. A.K.B.?  
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case. If no 
inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been 
undertaken. Have penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions been imposed on the 
alleged perpetrators? 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>416. On <b>3 June 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders sent another urgent appeal to the Government regarding the 
enforced disappearance of <b>Mr. A.K.B.</b>, the Chairperson and Chief of Research for The 
Women for Dignity and Development Foundation (WODIDEF). 
</p>
<p>417. According to the information received, between 10 April 2009 and 8 May 2009, Mr. 
A.K.B. received a number of threatening phone calls. On two occasions an unidentified 
male voice issued death threats, warning him to return to his country and cease his human 
rights activities.  
</p>
<p>418. On 31 May 2009, three unidentified men wearing civilian clothing and carrying guns 
entered in the house where Mr. A.K.B.was staying with his two brothers. The men 
reportedly pointed their guns at Mr. A.K.B.&#8217;s head and ordered him to leave his home, 
threatening to shoot him if he made any noise. The three men allegedly said nothing that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>78</b>  
</p>
<p>would indicate their motive for abducting Mr. A.K.B. The men took Mr. A.K.B. On 1 June 
2009, Mr A.K.B.&#8217;s abduction was reported to the local police who were reported to be 
investigating this case.  
</p>
<p>419. Concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. A.K.B. 
Further concern was expressed that the abduction of Mr. A.K.B.may be linked to the 
previous threats received by Mr. A.K.B.and that these acts of intimidation may be related to 
his activities defending human rights, in particular their publication of information 
concerning the rights of refugees in Uganda. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>420. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the moment of finalizing the report, she had 
not received a reply from the Government concerning the above mentioned allegations. She 
considers response to her communications an important part of the cooperation of 
Governments with her mandate. She urges the Government to respond to the concerns 
raised and provide detailed information regarding investigations undertaken to prosecute the 
perpetrators as well as protective measures taken to ensure the physical and mental integrity 
of defenders and their families. She also wishes to refer to the observations made by the 
Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders in A/HRC/13/22/Add.1. 
</p>
<p><b>  United Arab Emirates 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>421. On <b>12 March 2010</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders and the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children sent an allegation letter to the Government concerning the situation of <b>Ms. S.M.</b>, a 
dual United States-United Arab Emirates citizen, the founder of an NGO aimed at 
protecting women subjected to violence in the UAE and children victims of trafficking for 
the purpose of camel jockeying (&#8220;the Organization&#8221;).  
</p>
<p>422. According to the letter sent by the Government on 23 April 2007, S.M. was found 
innocent on the ground of unfounded evidence. However, additional information on this 
case was received, which raised some concerns about the rights of S.M. 
</p>
<p>423. According to the information received, 35 women and 10 children resident of the 
Organization were allegedly transferred by the authorities to a new government-run shelter 
the Dubai Women and Children&#8217;s Foundation. It was alleged that the transfer was an 
attempt by the authorities to close the Organization by merging it with the new government-
run shelter.  
</p>
<p>424. On 24 November 2007, Ms. S.M. wrote a letter to the Vice-President of the UAE 
and then the Minister of Labour denouncing the attempt to merge the two shelters as a way 
to forcibly close down the Organization. On 9 March 2008, the newspaper Gulf News 
reportedly published an article suggesting that Ms. S.M. was selling the stories of women 
living in the Organization to newspapers against their will. In late March 2008, the 
Organization was allegedly closed and the women from the shelters were transferred to the 
Dubai Women and Children's Foundation. 
</p>
<p>425. On 21 May 2008, Gulf News stated that Ms. S.M. was involved in the sale of 
children. Following these publications, the Consulate of the United States advised Ms. S.M. 
to leave the UAE for her own safety. Her family remained in the UAE. It was alleged that 
her family members had been harassed and threatened since she had left the country. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>79 
</b></p>
<p>426. On 11 January 2010, the newspaper Emirat Alyoum, published an article referring to 
Ms M. on a BBC show on 14th December 2009 stating that Ms. M. had psychological 
problems, that she was involved in trafficking and sale of children and that she had been 
involved in the misappropriation of funds. 
</p>
<p>427. On 26 January 2010, Al Bayan website published an article about domestic violence. 
The article quoted Mr. A.A.B., the director of the Dubai Women and Children&#8217;s 
Foundation, suggesting that Ms. S.M. had misappropriated 300 000 UAE dirhams. This 
publication coincided with the consideration of the UAE&#8217;s report by the United Nations 
Committee on Discrimination against Women where experts asked the UAE&#8217;s delegation to 
comment on the widely reported closure of the Dubai Organization Shelter. The head of 
delegation responded that the shelter had begun operating without authorization and that the 
building of such centres should had been in compliance with State laws. 
</p>
<p>428. Concern was expressed that the closure of the Organization, the campaign of 
defamation against Ms. S.M. as well as the acts of intimidation against her family could be 
directly related to her legitimate work in defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p>429. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Has a complaint been lodged by Ms. S.M., her family or on their behalf?  
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide information concerning the legal grounds for the closure of 
the Organization and how these measures are compatible with international norms and 
standards as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant 
international instruments. 
</p>
<p> 4. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case. If no 
inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain why. 
</p>
<p> 5. Please provide information on any shelters provided by your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government and/or by civil society organizations in the country, including specialized 
shelters for victims of domestic violence. Please also provide information on partnerships 
and cooperation with civil society organizations that your Excellency&#8217;s Government may 
have in ensuring the adequate provision of protection and assistance to victims of 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>430. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United Arab Emirates 
had not replied to the communication sent on 12 March 2010, She considers responses to 
her communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with her 
mandate and calls therefore upon the Government to provide information on the questions 
raised in the communication as soon as possible.  
</p>
<p><b>  United States of America 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>431. On <b>23 July 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment sent an allegation letter to the Government regarding the 
<b>use of shackles and other restraints on pregnant women </b>incarcerated or detained in 
U.S.A. prisons or jails. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>80</b>  
</p>
<p>432. According to the allegations received, in many U.S. prisons and jails pregnant 
women were restrained by their ankles or wrists when transported for prenatal medical 
appointments or when they went to the hospital for delivery. Pregnant women reportedly 
also remained shackled during labour, delivery and the post-delivery recovery period &#8211;for 
hours or days- despite the presence of armed guards.  
</p>
<p>433. While acknowledging that significant progress was made at the level of federal 
policy over the last ten years, this did not appear to be reflected at the state level. Since the 
majority of women in prison in the United States appeared to be in state rather than federal 
prisons, only 4 States have passed legislation restricting the use of shackles during labour 
and delivery. Moreover, while the policies of the Department of Corrections in some States 
also prohibited this practice, the lack of a statutory prohibition meant that these policies 
could be relatively easily changed.  
</p>
<p>434. Human rights reports, as well as a number of court cases attested to the fact that 
shackling women during birthing continued to be practiced in States with and without 
statutory prohibitions, including on women detained because of their immigration status.  
</p>
<p>435. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> (1) Are the facts alleged pertaining to the legislation and practice of shackling of

</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>436. In a letter dated <b>17 December 2009</b>, the Government responded to the 
communication sent on 23 July 2009.  
</p>
<p>437. The Government explained that as the United States has a federal system of 
government, in addition to federal detention policies, each state has its own policies and 
procedures. The Government informed that there have been significant developments in 
both federal and state policies regarding the restraint of pregnant inmates and detainees 
since the report produced on the issue in 1998. 
</p>
<p>438. With regard to federal policies addressing the restraint of incarcerated or detained 
pregnant women, the United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons 
(&#8220;BOP&#8221;) and the United States Department of Homeland Security (&#8220;DHS&#8221;), Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement (&#8220;ICE&#8221;) have adopted policies substantially limiting the use of 
restraints on pregnant women. 
</p>
<p>439. BOP policies were adopted on 6 October 2008 and stated that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;An inmate who is in labor, delivering her baby, or is in post-delivery recuperation, 
or who is being transported or housed in an outside medical facility for the purpose 
of treating labor symptoms, delivering her baby, or post-delivery recuperation, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>81 
</b></p>
<p>should not be placed in restraints unless there are reasonable grounds to believe the 
inmate presents an immediate, serious threat of hurting herself, staff or others, or 
there are reasonable grounds to believe the inmate presents an immediate and 
credible risk of escape that cannot be reasonably contained through other methods. If 
an inmate who is in labor or is delivering her baby is restrained, the restrains used 
must be the least restrictive restraints necessary to still ensure safety and security&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>440. With regard to the use of restraints on pregnant detainees in ICE custody, the 
Government informed that current ICE policy requires that the use of restraints on detainees 
within the United States care and custody be conducted in a manner that is safe, secure, 
humane and professional. 
</p>
<p>441. The Government further noted that, where use of restraints is necessary, DRO 
detention standards require that ICE officers consult with medical staff who will describe 
the precautions including the manner in which the pregnant detainee will be restrained, the 
advisability of a medical professional&#8217;s presence when restraints are applied, and whether 
there is a medical necessity for restraining the detainee in the facility hospital or a local 
medical facility. In addition, ICE policy requires that the level and type of restraints used 
shall be reasonable under the circumstances. Officers shall also avoid exposing restrained 
detainees to unnecessary public display. 
</p>
<p>442. The Government also noted that the federal nature of the United States Government 
made it impossible for the Government to conduct a truly comprehensive survey of 
individual state policies and practices. The Government determined that the allegations 
reproduced in the communication sent by the Special Rapporteur were incomplete. At the 
time the Government sent its response, there were at least five states that had adopted such 
legislation, although many states appear not to have passed legislation restricting the use of 
restraints on pregnant women who are incarcerated or detained. These five States include 
the four listed in the communication such as California, Illinois, Vermont and New Mexico, 
as well as New York. Moreover, several other states have considered similar legislation. 
</p>
<p>443. The Government considered these findings as a trend among states towards 
addressing the problems inherent in restraining pregnant inmates. 
</p>
<p>444. Furthermore, the Government informed that the United States&#8217; judicial system 
provides an array of remedial procedures to individuals who believe their rights have been 
violated. In addition, certain actions may be brought directly by the federal government. 
</p>
<p>445. The Government explained that the American Correctional Association (&#8220;ACA&#8221;) 
had approved a prohibition on the use of restraints on pregnant inmates that was to be 
reflected in its 2010 accreditation standards manual. The ACA&#8217;s guidance states that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;Written policy, procedure and practice, in general, prohibit the use of restraints on 
female offenders during active labor and the delivery of a child. Any deviation from 
the prohibition requires approval by, and guidance on, methodology from the 
Medical Authority and is based on documented serious security risks. The Medical 
Authority provides guidance on the use of restraints on pregnant offenders prior to 
active labor and delivery&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>446. Furthermore, a comment accompanies the standard which states that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;Restraints on pregnant offender during active labor and the delivery of a child 
should only be used in extreme instances and should not be applied for more time 
than is absolutely necessary. Restraints used on pregnant offenders prior to active 
labor and delivery should not put the pregnant offender or the fetus at risk&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>447. This standard may apply to both state and federal correctional facilities. At the time 
of receiving the response from the Government, the BOP was in the process of revising its </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>82</b>  
</p>
<p>policies to incorporate this standard and had updated its 2010 annual training lesson plans to 
incorporate this standard. 
</p>
<p>448. The Government stated that pregnant inmates and detainees may avail themselves of 
an array of remedial procedures in cases where they believe their rights have been violated. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>449. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its detailed response.  
</p>
<p><b>  Uzbekistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>450. On <b>28 April 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding <b>Ms. E.U.</b>, a 
member of the Human Rights Alliance of Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>451. According to the information received, on 15 April 2009, Ms. E.U. was assaulted 
and threatened by two unknown young men dressed in black and wearing sunglasses outside 
her home in Tashkent, as she was leaving her home with her son. The two men kicked her 
and punched her in the head and chest, and cut her leather jacket with knives. Her five-year 
old son witnessed the attack. Ms. E.U.was diagnosed with contusions on her head and chest, 
and high blood pressure. She filed a complaint with the police, but the investigation did not 
yield any results. 
</p>
<p>452. On 22 April 2009, M.M., the five-year old son of Ms. E.U.was assaulted near their 
apartment building by an unknown young man, who hit him with a baton on the head. He 
was later diagnosed with a concussion. However doctors at the N14 children&#8217;s hospital in 
Tashkent refused to note in his medical card that the concussion was a result of an attack. 
Ms. E.U.reported the incident at the local police station, but the police refused to initiate an 
investigation, arguing that a child&#8217;s testimony was not sufficient evidence. Ms. E.U.later 
received a phone call from an unknown man, threatening her with an &#8220;even worse attack&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>453. Concern was expressed that the attacks on, and threats against, Ms. E.U.and her son 
were solely connected to her legitimate activities in defence of human rights. Further 
concern was expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. E.U.and 
her family. 
</p>
<p>454. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?  
</p>
<p> 2. Please provide the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to 
this case. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, please explain 
why. 
</p>
<p> 3. Please provide the full details of any prosecutions which have been 
undertaken. Have penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions been imposed on the 
alleged perpetrators? </p>

<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>455. In a letter dated <b>5 June 2009</b>, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 28 April 2009, concerning Ms. E.U. The Government sent the following information: 
</p>
<p>456. On 17 April 2009, Ms. E.U. lodged information at the Mirzo Ulugbek District 
Internal Affairs Authority. She explained that about 9:00, on 15 April 2009, she was 
attacked near her house by two unknown persons, one of whom had a knife. They harassed 
her and demanded that she should leave Uzbekistan. Ms. E.U. requested that appropriate 
measures should be taken with regard to these persons. 
</p>
<p>457. Ms. E.U.&#8217;s statement was registered by the duty office of the Mirzo Ulugbek District 
Internal Affairs Authority. In an explanatory note, Ms. E.U. stated that Mr. A.S. and his 
wife F.S. had threatened her over the telephone. She also stated that these persons had 
earlier asked her to help with the release of their friend A.Y., who had been tried on a 
criminal charge. 
</p>
<p>458. The Inspector of the Crime Protection Unit of the Mirzo Ulugbek District Internal 
Affairs Authority, Mr. Y.R. carried out a pre investigative inquiry, in which it was 
established that the address in question was that of Mr. D.S., who, according to the 
representative of the house tenants&#8217; committee, Ms. M.G. Gulyamova, had been in the 
Russian Federation at the time. 
</p>
<p>459. The Tashkent Municipal Registry showed that A.S. and F.S. did not have a 
residence permit and that no information on them was held at all. It was also established 
that, from 2001 to present, Ms. E.U. had been registered at Tashkent Neuropsychological 
Clinic No. 2 with a diagnosis of chronic paranoid schizophrenia and, by a decision of the 
Mirabad Interdistrict Civil Court of 24 August 2006, she had been declared incapable. It 
was decided on 23 April 2009 that there would be no prosecution in this case. 
</p>
<p>460. The Decision and the evidence in the investigation were considered under the review 
procedure by the Procurator&#8217;s Office of the Mirzo Ulugbek District. On 16 May 2009, the 
Decision was rescinded as being premature. The case was returned to the District Internal 
Affairs Authority for further investigation. 
</p>
<p>461. Ms. E.U. went to the Mirzo Ulugbek Internal Affairs Authority on 22 April 2009, 
claiming that, at about 7:00. The same day, unknown persons had beaten her small son, Mr. 
M.N.M., with a stick and requested that appropriate measures should be taken against the 
perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>462. An officer of the Investigative Unit of the District Internal Affairs Authority, Mr. 
S.B.T., carried out a preliminary investigation into the matter, which established that, while 
walking past School No. 211 on 22 April 2009, Mr. M.N.M. insulted three boys, A.M.B., 
R.K.R., and A.A.B., after which the persons in question threw a stick in his direction and 
the stick hit Mr. M.N.M.on the head. 
</p>
<p>463. The uncle of Mr. M.N.M., Mr. V.A.M., wrote a counter-statement on the matter on 
24 April 2009, in which he stated that his nephew&#8217;s physical injuries had been the result of a 
game. The family made no complaint and did not wish a forensic medical examination to be 
carried out. It was formally decided on 30 April 2009 not to institute criminal proceedings. 
</p>
<p>464. This decision was considered under the review procedure and subsequently 
rescinded. On 18 May 2009, the evidence was turned over for further investigation to the 
Mirzo Ulugbek District Internal Affairs Authority. The person who originally lodged the 
information will be informed of the result of the additional investigation. </p>

</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>465. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response it provided to her 
communication. She also wishes to make reference to the observations provided by the 
Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders in A/HRC/13/22/Add.1. 
</p>
<p><b>  Yemen 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>466. On <b>29 April 2009</b>, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and 
the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the death sentence imposed 
against <b>Ms. F.H.A.B.</b> 
</p>
<p>467. According to the information received, F.H.A.B. and her brother A.H.A.B. were 
arrested in July 2000 for the murder of her husband, H.A.A.J., tried and sentenced to death 
on 17 February 2001. The appeals court upheld the death sentence. In September 2003, the 
Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence imposed on A.H.A.B. After confirmation of 
the sentence by the President of Yemen, he was executed on 2 May 2005. 
</p>
<p>468. With the regard to the case of F.H.A.B. the Special Rapporteur received information 
which was not available to her at the time of the letter of December 2005. These reports 
indicated that in September 2003 Section B of the Supreme Court found that F.H.A.B. was 
not guilty of murder, but only of participating in hiding the victim&#8217;s body. It therefore 
quashed the death sentence and imposed a four years&#8217; prison term. Because of the death 
sentence imposed in the same Supreme Court judgment against A.H.A.B., the case went to 
the President of Yemen for confirmation. The President ordered the Supreme Court to 
reconsider its findings and sentence regarding F.H.A.B. In August 2004, the Supreme Court 
sitting as General Assembly, i.e. with the participation of all judges, reportedly overturned 
the judgment of Section B of the Supreme Court and reinstated the death penalty against 
F.H.A.B. She has been on death row since then. Her death sentence has reportedly not been 
carried out as a special appeal to the President by her defence lawyer remained pending. 
</p>
<p>469. According to the information received, the President&#8217;s order to the Supreme Court to 
reconsider its decision not to sentence F.H.A.B. to death followed a letter of January 2004 
by the then Head of the Council of Representatives (Yemen&#8217;s Parliament) to the President 
urging him not to ratify the judgment. The letter allegedly referred to a report by the Justice 
and Endowment Committee of the Council of Representatives which had studied the case 
upon a request by relatives of the victim. The Justice and Endowment Committee noted 
that, if the death sentence against F.H.A.B. was lifted, she would be reinstated as her late 
husband&#8217;s heir and could as such pardon her brother. 
</p>
<p>470. The Special Rapporteur requested some clarifications from the Government on the 
following matters: 
</p>
<p> 1. Are the reports above regarding the proceedings before the Supreme Court in 
the case of F.H.A.B. accurate? Please explain the legal basis for the order by the President 
to the Supreme Court to review the sentence imposed against F.H.A.B. 
</p>
<p> 2. Are the allegations above regarding the threats against and torture of 
F.H.A.B., aimed at extorting confessions from her and A.H.A.B., accurate? If not so, please 
share the results of any investigation and all information and documents proving their 
inaccuracy. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/22/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>85 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>471. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Yemen had not replied to her 
communication. She considers response to her communications an important part of the 
cooperation of Governments with her mandate. She therefore calls upon the Government to 
provide information on the questions raised in the communications as soon as possible.
