<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In follow-up to the 2008 Expert seminar on the links between articles 19 and 20 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights with regard to freedom of 
expression and incitement to hatred, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) organized, in 2011 and 2012, a series of expert workshops on the 
prohibition of incitement to national, racial or religious hatred, in which legislative patterns, 
judicial practices and policies in this regard were explored.  
</p>
<p>2. Over the years, we have witnessed a number of incidents which have sounded alarm 
bells about the level of hatred and cynicism that has permeated societies. Unfortunately a 
number of these incidents have led to violent reactions and deaths. Virulent and hate-laden 
advocacy can trigger the worst of crimes. Suffice it to recall recent examples of post-
electoral violence spurred by hatred along ethnic lines; incidents involving extremist 
groups; abusive and malicious portrayal, online or in traditional media, of certain religions 
and their followers. It is clear that hatred has many faces and is present in all parts of the 
world. 
</p>
<p>3. As the High Commissioner for Human Rights, I have expressed alarm at the often 
extraordinarily negative portrayal in many countries of migrants, but also of minority 
groups by the media, politicians and other actors in the society. I have called for measures 
to curb growing xenophobic attitudes and underlined the need to swiftly denounce hate 
speech and prosecute those suspected of inciting racial violence and those who have 
perpetrated racist and violent actions.  
</p>
<p>4. I have publicly condemned displays of hatred or bigotry towards followers of certain 
religions and urged religious and political leaders to do their utmost to restore calm. I have 
condemned the violence, including murders, that has taken place in reaction to such 
incidents in various parts of the world. 
</p>
<p>5. While the concept of freedom of expression has been well-established for many 
centuries in the legal traditions of different cultures, its practical application and recognition 
are still far from universal. In many parts of the world, freedom of expression still faces 
formidable resistance from those who benefit from silencing dissent, stifling criticism or 
blocking discussion on challenging social issues. 
</p>
<p>6. With a view to enhancing our understanding of the relationship between freedom of 
expression and incitement to hatred, I took the initiative of organizing a series of expert 
workshops, in different regions of the world, to examine legislation, jurisprudence, and 
national policies with regard to the prohibition of national, racial or religious hatred as 
reflected in international human rights law. In October 2012, OHCHR convened a wrap-up 
expert meeting in Rabat, Morocco,1 in which the recommendations of the earlier expert 
workshops were discussed, resulting in the adoption of the Rabat Plan of Action. The 
principal aim of the whole exercise was to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the 
implementation of legislation, jurisprudence and policies regarding advocacy of national, 
racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence 
at the national and regional levels, while encouraging full respect for freedom of 
expression, as protected by international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>7. A total of five expert workshops were held in Vienna (9-10 February 2011), Nairobi 
(6-7 April 2011), Bangkok (6-7 July 2011), Santiago (12-13 October 2011) and Rabat (4-5 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/17/Add.4

<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>October 2012). We learned that many governments, in response to the challenges outlined 
above, have reinforced existing laws and introduced new punitive measures. The 
proceedings shone light on the problem of insufficient national legislation or of new, vague 
and unclear provisions that have been introduced and are open to misuse. Discussions also 
showed the uneven and ad hoc application of these laws, compounded often by the absence 
of dedicated and properly equipped institutions to implement or adjudicate them. 
Throughout the discussions, examples were provided of the negative impact of anti-
blasphemy laws; problems relating to curbing freedom of information and the use of the 
Internet; harassment of journalists and human rights defenders; or instances where members 
of minorities are persecuted, with a chilling effect on others, through the abuse of vague or 
counter-productive legislation, jurisprudence and policies.  
</p>
<p>8. International expert bodies have a crucial role to play in guiding States in their 
implementation of provisions of human rights law on incitement to hatred thereby 
contributing to the progressive development of international law and defusing political 
tensions. In September 2011, the Human Rights Committee adopted general comment No. 
34 on freedom of opinion and expression, and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination has commenced consideration of a general recommendation on racist hate 
speech. Furthermore, joint position papers on the prohibition of incitement to hatred were 
presented in 2009 and 2011 by the Special Rapporteurs on contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; freedom of religion or belief; and 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>9. Properly balancing freedom of expression and the prohibition of incitement to hatred 
is no simple task. Let me state clearly that any limitations to this fundamental freedom must 
remain within strictly defined parameters flowing from the international human rights 
instruments, in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Article 19, 
paragraph 3, of the Covenant lays down a clear test by which the legitimacy of such 
restrictions may be assessed. However, further guidance is needed in the real world when 
weighing freedom of expression against the prohibition of incitement to hatred.  
</p>
<p>10. First, one should realize that the question of distinguishing those forms of 
expression that should be defined as incitement to hatred and thus prohibited is contextual 
and the individual circumstances of each case, such as local conditions, history, cultural and 
political tensions, must be taken into account. An independent judiciary is therefore a vital 
component in the process of effectively adjudicating cases related to incitement to hatred.  
</p>
<p>11. Second, restrictions must be formulated in a way that makes clear that its sole 
purpose is to protect individuals and communities belonging to ethnic, national or religious 
groups, holding specific beliefs or opinions, whether of a religious or other nature, from 
hostility, discrimination or violence, rather than to protect belief systems, religions or 
institutions as such from criticism. The right to freedom of expression implies that it should 
be possible to scrutinize, openly debate and criticize belief systems, opinions and 
institutions, including religious ones, as long as this does not advocate hatred that incites 
violence, hostility or discrimination against an individual or group of individuals. 
</p>
<p>12. Third, with regard to domestic sanctions, it is essential to make a careful distinction 
between (a) forms of expression that should constitute a criminal offence; (b) forms of 
expression that are not criminally punishable, but may justify a civil suit; and (c) forms of 
expression that do not give rise to criminal or civil sanctions, but still raise concerns in 
terms of tolerance, civility and respect for the convictions of others. 
</p>
<p>13. The Human Rights Council, for its part, has also taken decisive action; in March 
2011, it adopted unanimous resolution 16/18 that provides a comprehensive road map for a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/17/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>coordinated national and international effort to ensure that certain rights and freedoms are 
not misused to undermine the freedom of religion or belief.  
</p>
<p>14. As the experts highlighted, the Rabat Plan of Action on the prohibition of advocacy 
of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility 
or violence aims to facilitate and reinforce the implementation and protection of human 
rights in this difficult context. It contains conclusions and recommendations aimed at better 
guiding all stakeholders, including the national legislator and judiciary, in implementing the 
international obligation of prohibition of incitement to hatred. It is the result of a bottom-
up, multi-stakeholder and consultative process conducted in four regions, and which 
enjoyed the participation of 45 experts from different cultural backgrounds and legal 
traditions.  
</p>
<p>15. It is my hope that this important initiative will indeed boost national efforts, 
facilitated by international cooperation, towards the full implementation of the relevant 
international human rights obligations; and that it will assist us all as we strive to counter 
the escalation of prejudice predicated on ethnic, national or religious divides and break the 
vicious cycle of hatred and retribution. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Expert workshops on the prohibition of incitement to 
national, racial or religious hatred 
</b></p>
<p>16. In 2011, OHCHR organized four regional workshops in Europe (Vienna, 9-10 
February 2011), Africa (Nairobi, 6-7 April 2011), the Asia Pacific region (Bangkok, 6-7 
July 2011) and the Americas (Santiago de Chile, 12-13 October 2011). Information 
regarding these events, including reports on the discussions held, can be found at 
http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Articles19-20/Pages/Index.aspx.  
</p>
<p>17. By grounding the debate on incitement to hatred in international human rights law, 
the objective of the series of expert workshops was threefold: to gain a better understanding 
of legislative patterns, judicial practices and policies regarding the concept of incitement to 
national, racial or religious hatred, while ensuring full respect for freedom of expression as 
outlined in articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; to 
arrive at a comprehensive assessment of the state of implementation of the prohibition of 
such incitement in conformity with international human rights law; and to identify possible 
actions at all levels. 
</p>
<p>18. In October 2012, OHCHR organized a wrap-up expert meeting in Rabat, which 
marked the culmination of this process, bringing together conclusions and 
recommendations from the expert workshops and resulting in the adoption of the Rabat 
Plan of Action by the experts (in appendix).

<p><b>  Conclusions and recommendations emanating from the four regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>expert workshops organized by OHCHR in 2011, and adopted by 
</b></p>
<p><b>experts at the meeting in Rabat, Morocco, on 5 October 2012 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Preface 
</b></p>
<p>1. In 2011, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) organized a series of expert workshops, in various regions, on incitement to 
national, racial or religious hatred as reflected in international human rights law. During the 
workshops, participants considered the situation in the respective regions and discussed 
strategic responses, both legal and non-legal, to incitement to hatred.  
</p>
<p>2. The workshops were held in Europe (Vienna, 9 and 10 February 2011), Africa 
(Nairobi, 6 and 7 April 2011), the Asia Pacific region (Bangkok, 6 and 7 July 2011) and the 
Americas (Santiago de Chile, 12 and 13 October 2011).2 In doing so, OHCHR aimed to 
conduct a comprehensive assessment of the implementation of legislation, jurisprudence 
and policies regarding advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence at the national and regional levels, while 
encouraging full respect for freedom of expression as protected by international human 
rights law. This activity focused on the relationship between freedom of expression and 
hate speech, especially in relation to religious issues &#8211; a matter that has unfortunately 
created friction and violence among and within diverse communities, and which has come 
increasingly under focus.  
</p>
<p>3. The expert workshops in 2011 generated a wealth of information as well as a large 
number of practical suggestions for better implementation of the relevant international 
human rights standards.3 To take stock of the rich results of the 2011 series of workshops, 
OHCHR convened a final expert workshop in Rabat, Morocco, on 4 and 5 October 2012, to 
conduct a comparative analysis of the findings of the four workshops; identify possible 
action at all levels and reflect on the best ways and means of sharing experiences.  
</p>
<p>4. The four moderators and the experts who participated in all four regional workshops, 
including the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, and the 
</p>
<p>  
 1  Article 20, paragraph 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that &#8220;any 
</p>
<p>advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility 
or violence shall be prohibited by law.&#8221; Throughout this document, such incitement will be referred to 
as &#8220;incitement to hatred&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 2 The four regional expert workshops and the Rabat meeting brought together some 45 experts from 
different backgrounds, and more than 200 observers participated in the debates.

<p><b>A/HRC/22/17/Add.4

<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance, a member of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination and a representative of the non-governmental organization, Article XIX, 
attended the Rabat workshop.  
</p>
<p>5. In line with the practice of the regional workshops, Member States were invited to 
participate as observers and were encouraged to include experts from their capitals in the 
delegations. Relevant United Nations departments, funds and programmes as well as 
relevant international and regional organizations, national human rights institutions and 
civil society organizations (including academia, journalists and faith-based organizations) 
could also participate as observers.  
</p>
<p>6. The following outcome document reflects the conclusions and recommendations 
agreed upon by the experts who participated in the Rabat workshop. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p>7. As the world is ever more inter-connected and as the fabric of societies has become 
more multicultural in nature, there has been a number of incidents in recent years, in 
different parts of the world, which have brought renewed attention to the issue of 
incitement to hatred. It should also be underlined that many of the conflicts worldwide in 
past decades have also &#8211; to varying degrees &#8211; contained a component of incitement to 
national, racial or religious hatred. 
</p>
<p>8. All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated. 
Nowhere is this interdependence more obvious than in the discussion of freedom of 
expression in relation to other human rights. The realization of the right to freedom of 
expression enables vibrant, multi-faceted public interest debate giving voice to different 
perspectives and viewpoints. Respect for freedom of expression has a crucial role to play in 
ensuring democracy and sustainable human development, as well as in promoting 
international peace and security. 
</p>
<p>9. Unfortunately, individuals and groups have suffered various forms of 
discrimination, hostility or violence by reason of their ethnicity or religion. One particular 
challenge in this regard is to contain the negative effects of the manipulation of race, ethnic 
origin and religion and to guard against the adverse use of concepts of national unity or 
national identity, which are often instrumentalized for, inter alia, political and electoral 
purposes.  
</p>
<p>10. It is often purported that freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief are 
in a tense relationship or even contradictory. In reality, they are mutually dependent and 
reinforcing. The freedom to exercise or not exercise one's religion or belief cannot exist if 
the freedom of expression is not respected, as free public discourse depends on respect for 
the diversity of convictions which people may have. Likewise, freedom of expression is 
essential to creating an environment in which constructive discussion about religious 
matters could be held. Indeed, free and critical thinking in open debate is the soundest way 
to probe whether religious interpretations adhere to or distort the original values that 
underpin religious belief. 
</p>
<p>11. It is of concern that perpetrators of incidents, which indeed reach the threshold of 
article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, are not prosecuted 
and punished. At the same time members of minorities are de facto persecuted, with a 
chilling effect on others, through the abuse of vague domestic legislation, jurisprudence and 
policies. This dichotomy of (1) non-prosecution of &#8220;real&#8221; incitement cases and (2) 
persecution of minorities under the guise of domestic incitement laws seems to be </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/17/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>pervasive. Anti-incitement laws in countries worldwide can be qualified as heterogeneous, 
at times excessively narrow or vague. Jurisprudence on incitement to hatred has been scarce 
and ad hoc, and while several States have adopted related policies, most of them are too 
general, not systematically followed up, lacking focus and deprived of proper impact 
assessments.  
</p>
<p>12. Holding the four workshops in different regions of the world and the wrap-up 
workshop in Rabat was a very timely and useful initiative. They enjoyed the full 
participation of relevant treaty body experts and special procedures mandate holders. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Implementing the prohibition of incitement to hatred 
</b></p>
<p>13. Against this background, the following conclusions and recommendations constitute 
the synthesis of this long, transparent and deep reflection by experts. The conclusions &#8211; in 
the area of legislation, judicial infrastructure, and policy &#8211; are intended to better guide all 
stakeholders in implementing the international prohibition of any advocacy of national, 
racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. 
</p>
<p><b> A.  Legislation 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>14. Under international human rights standards, which are intended to guide legislation 
at the national level, expression labelled as &#8220;hate speech&#8221; can be restricted under articles 18 
and 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on different grounds, 
including respect for the rights of others, public order or sometimes national security. States 
are also obliged to &#8220;prohibit&#8221; expression that amounts to &#8220;incitement&#8221; to discrimination, 
</p>
<p>hostility or violence (art. 20, para. 2, of the Covenant and, under some different conditions, 
art. 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination). 
</p>
<p>15. Discussions in the various workshops demonstrated the absence of a legal 
prohibition of incitement to hatred in many domestic legal frameworks worldwide, while 
legislation that prohibits incitement to hatred uses variable terminology and is often 
inconsistent with article 20 of the Covenant. The broader the definition of incitement to 
hatred is in domestic legislation, the more it opens the door for arbitrary application of the 
laws. The terminology relating to offences on incitement to national, racial or religious 
hatred varies from country to country and is increasingly vague, while new categories of 
restrictions or limitations to freedom of expression are being incorporated in national 
legislation. This contributes to the risk of misinterpretation of article 20 of the Covenant 
and additional limitations to freedom of expression that are not contained in article 19 of 
the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>16. Some countries consider incitement to racial and religious hatred as offences, while 
others consider incitement to hatred along racial/ethnic lines only as offences. Some 
countries also recognize prohibition of incitement to hatred on other grounds. National 
provisions vary between civil law and criminal law: in many countries, incitement to hatred 
is a criminal offence, while in some countries, it is an offence under both criminal and civil 
law or under civil law only.  
</p>
<p>17. At the international level, the prohibition of incitement to hatred is clearly 
established in article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/17/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Discrimination. In its general comment No. 34 (2011) on freedoms of opinion and 
expression, the Human Rights Committee stresses that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;[p]rohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system, 
</p>
<p>including blasphemy laws, are incompatible with the Covenant, except in the specific 
circumstances envisaged in article 20, paragraph 2, of the Covenant. Such 
prohibitions must also comply with the strict requirements of article 19, paragraph 3,<b> 
</b>as well as such articles as 2, 5, 17, 18 and 26 of the ICCPR. Thus, for instance, it 
would be impermissible for any such laws to discriminate in favour of or against one 
or certain religions or belief systems, or their adherents over another, or religious 
believers over non-believers. Nor would it be permissible for such prohibitions to be 
used to prevent or punish criticism of religious leaders or commentary on religious 
doctrine and tenets of faith&#8221; (para. 48). 
</p>
<p>18. Article 20 of the Covenant requires a high threshold because, as a matter of 
fundamental principle, limitation of speech must remain an exception. Such threshold must 
take into account the provisions of article 19 of the Covenant. Indeed the three-part test 
(legality, proportionality and necessity) for restrictions also applies to cases involving 
incitement to hatred, in that such restrictions must be provided by law, be narrowly defined 
to serve a legitimate interest, and be necessary in a democratic society to protect that 
interest. This implies, among other things, that restrictions are clearly and narrowly defined 
and respond to a pressing social need; are the least intrusive measure available; are not 
overly broad, so that they do not restrict speech in a wide or untargeted way; and are 
proportionate so that the benefit to the protected interest outweighs the harm to freedom of 
expression, including with respect to the sanctions they authorize.4 
</p>
<p>19. At the national level, blasphemy laws are counterproductive, since they may result 
in de facto censure of all inter-religious or belief and intra-religious or belief dialogue, 
debate and criticism, most of which could be constructive, healthy and needed. In addition, 
many blasphemy laws afford different levels of protection to different religions and have 
often proved to be applied in a discriminatory manner. There are numerous examples of 
persecution of religious minorities or dissenters, but also of atheists and non-theists, as a 
result of legislation on what constitutes religious offences or overzealous application of  
laws containing neutral language. Moreover, the right to freedom of religion or belief, as 
enshrined in relevant international legal standards, does not include the right to have a 
religion or a belief that is free from criticism or ridicule.  
</p>
<p><b>  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>20. In terms of general principles, a clear distinction should be made between three 
types of expression:<b> </b>expression that constitutes a criminal offence; expression that is not 
criminally punishable, but may justify a civil suit or administrative sanctions; expression 
that does not give rise to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, but still raises concern 
in terms of tolerance, civility and respect for the rights of others.  
</p>
<p>21. Bearing in mind the interrelationship between articles 19 and 20 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, States should ensure that their domestic legal 
framework on incitement to hatred is guided by express reference to article 20, paragraph 2, 
of the Covenant (&#8220;&#8230;advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence&#8230;&#8221;), and should consider including robust 
definitions of key terms such as hatred, discrimination, violence, hostility, among others. In 
</p>
<p>  
 4  See Article XIX, <i>Camden Principles on Freedom of Expression and Equality,</i> (London, April 2009), 
</p>
<p>principle 11. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/17/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>this regard, legislation can draw, inter alia, from the guidance and definitions5 provided in 
the Camden Principles.6 
</p>
<p>22. States should ensure that the three-part test &#8211; legality, proportionality and necessity &#8211; 
for restrictions to freedom of expression also applies to cases of incitement to hatred. 
</p>
<p>23. States should make use of the guidance provided by international human rights 
expert mechanisms, including the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on the 
Elimination on Racial Discrimination and their general comment No. 34 (2011) and general 
recommendation No. 15 (1993) respectively, as well as the respective special procedures 
mandate holders of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>24. States are encouraged to ratify and effectively implement the relevant international 
and regional human rights instruments, remove any reservations thereto and honour their 
reporting obligations thereunder.  
</p>
<p>25. States that have blasphemy laws should repeal them,<b> </b>as such laws have a stifling 
impact on the enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief, and healthy dialogue and debate 
about religion. 
</p>
<p>26. States should adopt comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation that includes 
preventive and punitive action to effectively combat incitement to hatred.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Jurisprudence 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>27. An independent judicial infrastructure that is regularly updated with regard to 
international standards and jurisprudence and with members acting in an impartial and 
objective manner, as well as respect for the rules of due process, are crucial for ensuring 
that the facts and legal qualifications of any individual case are assessed in a manner 
consistent with international human rights standards. This should be complemented by 
other checks and balances to protect human rights, such as independent national human 
rights institutions established in accordance with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p>28. There is often very low recourse to judicial and quasi-judicial mechanisms in alleged 
cases of incitement to hatred. In many instances, victims are from disadvantaged or 
vulnerable groups and case law on the prohibition of incitement to hatred is not readily 
available. This is due to the absence or inadequacy of legislation or lack of judicial 
assistance for minorities and other vulnerable groups who constitute the majority of victims 
of incitement to hatred. The weak jurisprudence can also be explained by the absence of 
accessible archives, but also lack of recourse to courts owing to limited awareness among 
the general public as well as lack of trust in the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>  
 5 Pursuant to principle 12, national legal systems should make it clear, either explicitly or through 
</p>
<p>authoritative interpretation, that the terms &#8222;hatred&#8223; and &#8222;hostility&#8223; refer to intense and irrational 
emotions of opprobrium, enmity and detestation towards the target group; the term &#8222;advocacy&#8223; is to be 
understood as requiring an intention to promote hatred publicly towards the target group; and the term 
&#8222;incitement&#8223; refers to statements about national, racial or religious groups which create an imminent 
risk of discrimination, hostility or violence against persons belonging to those groups.  
</p>
<p> 6 These Principles were prepared by ARTICLE 19 on the basis of multi-stakeholder discussions 
involving experts in international human rights law on freedom of expression and equality issues. The 
Principles represent a progressive interpretation of international law and standards, accepted State 
practice (as reflected, inter alia, in national laws and the judgments of national courts), and the 
general principles of law recognised by the community of nations. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/17/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11

<p>29. It was suggested that a high threshold be sought for defining restrictions on freedom 
of expression, incitement to hatred, and for the application of article 20 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In order to establish severity as the underlying 
consideration of the thresholds, incitement to hatred must refer to the most severe and 
deeply felt form of opprobrium. To assess the severity of the hatred, possible elements may 
include the cruelty or intent of the statement or harm advocated, the frequency, quantity and 
extent of the communication. In this regard, a six-part threshold test was proposed for 
expressions considered as criminal offences: 
</p>
<p>(a) <b>Context</b>: Context is of great importance when assessing whether particular 
statements are likely to incite discrimination, hostility or violence against the target group, 
and it may have a direct bearing on both intent and/or causation. Analysis of the context 
should place the speech act within the social and political context prevalent at the time the 
speech was made and disseminated; 
</p>
<p>(b) <b>Speaker</b>: The speaker&#8223;s position or status in the society should be 
considered, specifically the individual&#8223;s or organization&#8223;s standing in the context of the 
audience to whom the speech is directed; 
</p>
<p>(c) <b>Intent</b>: Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
anticipates intent. Negligence and recklessness are not sufficient for an act to be an offence 
under article 20 of the Covenant, as this article provides for &#8220;advocacy&#8221; and &#8220;incitement&#8221; 
rather than the mere distribution or circulation of material. In this regard, it requires the 
activation of a triangular relationship between the object and subject of the speech act as 
well as the audience.  
</p>
<p>(d) <b>Content and form</b>: The content of the speech constitutes one of the key foci 
of the court&#8223;s deliberations and is a critical element of incitement. Content analysis may 
</p>
<p>include the degree to which the speech was provocative and direct, as well as the form, 
style, nature of arguments deployed in the speech or the balance struck between arguments 
deployed; 
</p>
<p>(e) <b>Extent of the speech act</b>: Extent includes such elements as the reach of the 
speech act, its public nature, its magnitude and size of its audience. Other elements to 
consider include whether the speech is public, what means of dissemination are used, for 
example by a single leaflet or broadcast in the mainstream media or via the Internet, the 
frequency, the quantity and the extent of the communications, whether the audience had the 
means to act on the incitement, whether the statement (or work) is circulated in a restricted 
environment or widely accessible to the general public; 
</p>
<p>(f) <b>Likelihood, including imminence</b>: Incitement, by definition, is an inchoate 
crime. The action advocated through incitement speech does not have to be committed for 
said speech to amount to a crime. Nevertheless, some degree of risk of harm must be 
identified. It means that the courts will have to determine that there was a reasonable 
probability that the speech would succeed in inciting actual action against the target group, 
recognizing that such causation should be rather direct. 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>30. National and regional courts should be regularly updated about international 
standards and international, regional and comparative jurisprudence relating to incitement 
to hatred because when confronted with such cases, courts need to undertake a thorough 
analysis based on a well thought through threshold test.  
</p>
<p>31. States should ensure the right to a fair and public hearing by a competent, 
independent and impartial tribunal established by law. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/17/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>32. Due attention should be given to minorities and vulnerable groups by providing 
legal and other types of assistance for their members. 
</p>
<p>33. States should ensure that persons who have suffered actual harm as a result of 
incitement to hatred have a right to an effective remedy, including a civil or non-judicial 
remedy for damages. 
</p>
<p>34. Criminal sanctions related to unlawful forms of expression should be seen as last 
resort measures to be applied only in strictly justifiable situations. Civil sanctions and 
remedies should also be considered, including pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, along 
with the right of correction and the right of reply. Administrative sanctions and remedies 
should also be considered, including those identified and put in force by various 
professional and regulatory bodies. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Policies 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>35. While a legal response is important, legislation is only part of a larger toolbox to 
respond to the challenges of hate speech. Any related legislation should be complemented 
by initiatives from various sectors of society geared towards a plurality of policies, 
practices and measures nurturing social consciousness, tolerance and understanding change 
and public discussion. This is with a view to creating and strengthening a culture of peace, 
tolerance and mutual respect among individuals, public officials and members of the 
judiciary, as well as rendering media organizations and religious/community leaders more 
ethically aware and socially responsible. States, media and society have a collective 
responsibility to ensure that acts of incitement to hatred are spoken out against and acted 
upon with the appropriate measures, in accordance with international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>36.   Political and religious leaders should refrain from using messages of intolerance or 
expressions which may incite violence, hostility or discrimination; but they also have a 
crucial role to play in speaking out firmly and promptly against intolerance, discriminatory 
stereotyping and instances of hate speech. It should be made clear that violence can never 
be tolerated as a response to incitement to hatred. 
</p>
<p>37. To tackle the root causes of intolerance, a much broader set of policy measures is 
necessary, for example in the areas of intercultural dialogue &#8211; reciprocal knowledge and 
interaction &#8211;, education on pluralism and diversity, and policies empowering minorities and 
indigenous people to exercise their right to freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>38. States have the responsibility to ensure space for minorities to enjoy their 
fundamental rights and freedoms, for instance by facilitating registration and functioning of 
minority media organizations. States should strengthen the capacities of communities to 
access and express a range of views and information and embrace the healthy dialogue and 
debate that they can encompass. 
</p>
<p>39. Certain regions have a marked preference for a non-legislative approach to 
combating incitement to hatred through, in particular, the adoption of public policies and 
the establishment of various types of institutions and processes, including truth and 
reconciliation commissions. The important work of regional human rights mechanisms, 
specialized bodies, a vibrant civil society and independent monitoring institutions is 
fundamentally important in all regions of the world. In addition, positive traditional values, 
compatible with internationally recognized human rights norms and standards, can also 
contribute towards countering incitement to hatred. 
</p>
<p>40. The importance of the media and other means of public communication in enabling 
free expression and the realization of equality is fundamental. The traditional media </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/17/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>continue to play an important role globally, but they are undergoing significant 
transformation. New technologies &#8211; including digital broadcasting, mobile telephony, the 
Internet and social networks &#8211; vastly enhance the dissemination of information and open up 
new forms of communication, such as the blogosphere. 
</p>
<p>41. Steps taken by the Human Rights Council, in particular the adoption without a vote 
of resolution 16/18 on<b> </b>combating intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of, 
and discrimination, incitement to violence, and violence against persons based on religion 
or belief, which constitutes a promising platform for effective, integrated and inclusive 
action by the international community. This resolution requires implementation and 
constant follow-up at the national level by States, including through the Rabat Plan of 
Action which contributes to its fulfilment.  
</p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to States 
</b></p>
<p>42. States should enhance their engagement in broad efforts to combat negative 
stereotypes of and discrimination against individuals and communities on the basis of their 
nationality, ethnicity, religion or belief.  
</p>
<p>43. States should promote intercultural understanding, including on gender sensitivity. 
In this regard, all States have the responsibility to build a culture of peace and a duty to put 
an end to impunity. 
</p>
<p>44. States should promote and provide teacher training on human rights values and 
principles, and introduce or strengthen intercultural understanding as part of the school 
curriculum for pupils of all ages. 
</p>
<p>45. States should build the capacity to train and sensitize security forces, law-
enforcement agents and those involved in the administration of justice on issues concerning 
the prohibition of incitement to hatred. 
</p>
<p>46. States should consider creating equality bodies, or enhance this function within 
national human rights institutions (that have been established in accordance with the Paris 
Principles) with enlarged competencies in fostering social dialogue, but also in relation to 
accepting complaints about incidents of incitement to hatred. In order to render such 
functions efficient, new adapted guidelines, tests and good practices are needed so as to 
avoid arbitrary practices and improve international coherence. 
</p>
<p>47. States should ensure the necessary mechanisms and institutions in order to guarantee 
the systematic collection of data in relation to incitement to hatred offences. 
</p>
<p>48. States should have in place a public policy and a regulatory framework which 
promote pluralism and diversity of the media, including new media, and which promotes 
universal and non-discrimination in access to and use of means of communication.  
</p>
<p>49. States should strengthen the current international human rights mechanisms, 
particularly the human rights treaty bodies such as the Human Rights Committee and the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, as well as the special procedures 
mandate holders, as they provide advice and support to States with regard to national 
policies for implementing human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) should be 
properly resourced to adequately support the international expert mechanisms working to 
protect freedom of expression and freedom of religion, and prevent incitement to hatred and 
discrimination and on related topics. In this regard, States should support the efforts of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights with a view to strengthening the human rights treaty </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/17/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>bodies as well as ensuring the provision of adequate resources for the special procedures 
mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>51. OHCHR is invited to work together with States that wish to avail themselves of its 
services in order to enhance their domestic normative and policy framework regarding the 
prohibition of incitement to hatred. In this regard, OHCHR should consider &#8211; inspired by 
the four regional expert workshops &#8211; developing tools, including a compilation of best 
practices and elements of a model legislation on the prohibition of incitement to hatred as 
reflected in international human rights law. OHCHR should also consider organizing 
regular judicial colloquia in order to update national judicial authorities and stimulate the 
sharing of experiences relating to the prohibition of incitement to hatred which would 
enrich the progressive development of national legislation and case law on this evolving 
issue. 
</p>
<p>52. Relevant human rights treaty bodies and special procedures mandate holders should 
enhance their synergies and cooperation, including through joint action, as appropriate, to 
denounce instances of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. 
</p>
<p>53. Various entities of the United Nations system, including OHCHR, United Nations 
Alliance of Civilizations, and the Office of the Special Advisor on the Prevention of 
Genocide should enhance their cooperation in order to maximize synergies and stimulate 
joint action 
</p>
<p>54. Cooperation and information-sharing (a) between various regional and cross-
regional mechanisms, such as the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Co-
operation in Europe, the European Union, the Organization of American States, the African 
Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as well as the Organisation of Islamic 
Cooperation, and (b) between these organizations and the United Nations Organization 
should be further enhanced. 
</p>
<p>55. Consider implementing, at the national level and in cooperation with States, 
measures to realize the recommendations addressed to States. 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to other stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>56. Non-governmental organizations, national human rights institutions as well as other 
civil society groups should create and support mechanisms and dialogues to foster 
intercultural and interreligious understanding and learning. 
</p>
<p>57. Political parties should adopt and enforce ethical guidelines in relation to the 
conduct of their representatives, particularly with respect to public speech. 
</p>
<p>58. Self-regulation, where effective, remains the most appropriate way to address 
professional issues relating to the media. In line with principle 9 of the Camden Principles, 
all media should, as a moral and social responsibility and through self-regulation, play a 
role in combating discrimination and promoting intercultural understanding, including by 
considering the following: 
</p>
<p>(a) Taking care to report in context and in a factual and sensitive manner, while 
ensuring that acts of discrimination are brought to the attention of the public.  
</p>
<p>(b) Being alert to the danger of furthering discrimination or negative stereotypes 
of individuals and groups in the media.  
</p>
<p>(c) Avoiding unnecessary references to race, religion, gender and other group 
characteristics that may promote intolerance. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/17/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p> (d) Raising awareness of the harm caused by discrimination and negative 
stereotyping.  
</p>
<p> (e) Reporting on different groups or communities and giving their members the 
opportunity to speak and to be heard in a way that promotes a better understanding of them, 
while at the same time reflecting the perspectives of those groups or communities. 
</p>
<p>59. Furthermore, voluntary professional codes of conduct for the media and journalists 
should reflect the principle of equality, and effective steps should be taken to promulgate 
and implement such codes. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>60. While the concept of freedom of expression has received systematic attention in 
international human rights law and in many national legislations, its practical application 
and recognition is not fully respected by all countries worldwide. At the same time, 
international human rights standards on the prohibition of incitement to national, racial or 
religious hatred still need to be integrated into domestic legislation and policies in many 
parts of the world. This explains both the objective difficulty and political sensitivity of 
defining this concept in a manner that respects the freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>61. The preceding conclusions and recommendations are steps towards addressing these 
challenges. It is hoped that they will boost both national efforts and international 
cooperation in this area.
