<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 This is a report on the mission to Cameroon undertaken by the Special Rapporteur 
on the right to food from 16 to 23 July 2012. After providing a brief introduction on the 
mission, the report describes the food insecurity situation in the country, including the 
particularly worrying situation of the inhabitants of the northern regions and of 
marginalized and vulnerable groups; and the efforts undertaken to limit food insecurity 
(sect. II). The report then presents the legislative and institutional framework in which the 
right to food is ensured (sect. III) and analyses the three most important elements of the 
right to food, namely, improving the <i>availability</i> of food, <i>access</i> to food and <i>sustainability</i> 
(sect. IV). The report examines how Cameroon is applying the principle of using the 
maximum of available resources, including revenue from the harnessing of natural 
resources, to ensure the right to food (sect. V). The key elements of a national strategy on 
the right to food are described in section VI. Recommendations are addressed to the 
Government and to international organizations and development partners.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food undertook an official visit to Cameroon 
between 16 and 23 July 2012, at the invitation of the Government. During his mission, he 
met with several members of the Government, including the Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister for Justice, the Minister of the Economy, Planning and Regional Development, the 
Minister of Social Affairs, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Trade, the Minister of 
Health, the Minister for the Advancement of Women and Promotion of the Family, the 
Minister for Forestry and Wildlife, and the Minister for Livestock, Fishing and Animal 
Husbandry. He also had high-level meetings at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he 
met with the Minister of State, and at the Ministry of Property and Land Affairs, the 
Ministry of Scientific Research and Innovation, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural 
Development, where he met with the Minister of State for Rural Development. He had 
discussions with several members of the National Assembly, including the Speaker of the 
Assembly and the President of the Constitutional Law Commission. He held a working 
meeting with representatives of the Institute for Agricultural Research for Development and 
he also met with the President and members of the National Commission for Human Rights 
and Freedoms. 
</p>
<p>2. In order to obtain additional information, the Special Rapporteur conducted several 
field visits. He visited the main prisons and the central prison in Yaound&#233;. He travelled to 
Maroua and Kousseri in the Far North region and to several neighbouring towns, as well as 
the South region, where he visited Kribi and some neighbouring plantations. He held four 
round-table discussions with civil society organizations in the capital and in Maroua, during 
the course of which he met with representatives of close to 40 non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs). Lastly, he had a number of exchanges with representatives of United 
Nations organizations in the country. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to all those who facilitated his mission. The 
cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was very efficient and the collaboration 
with the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Central Africa was excellent. The 
Special Rapporteur is grateful to the director of operations of the World Food Programme 
(WFP) in Cameroon and the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Cameroon. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Food insecurity  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The general situation 
</b></p>
<p>4. Notwithstanding the fact that it has adopted a series of poverty reduction measures, 
Cameroon has made little progress in eradicating poverty and hunger over the past 10 years, 
and it will not be in a position to meet the targets set in the Millennium Development Goal 
relating to this subject area. The proportion of the population living below the poverty line 
has remained virtually stable (approximately 40 per cent) since 2001 and the prevalence of 
food insecurity has decreased only slightly.1 
</p>
<p>5. Within this overall picture, there are significant disparities. People living in rural 
areas are more vulnerable to food insecurity than those living in urban centres: 9.6 per cent 
of rural households, as compared to 6.7 per cent of urban households, do not have access to

</p>
<p>sufficient food because of poverty and their inability to produce enough food for their own 
consumption.2 
</p>
<p>6. The statistics on malnutrition paint a similar picture. Approximately 33 per cent of 
children suffer from chronic malnutrition, which seriously hinders their growth and 
development. The situation is particularly serious in rural areas: 20 per cent of children in 
rural areas are underweight, as compared to 7 per cent of children in urban areas.3 There are 
also wide regional disparities. Food insecurity rates range between 17.9 per cent and 15.4 
per cent in the Far North and North regions and 0.7 per cent and 2.0 per cent in the South-
West and North-West regions.4 
</p>
<p>7. The economic crisis that began in 1987, as the oil boom (1978&#8211;1986) ended and 
international prices for the country&#8217;s main exports were falling, did lasting damage to the 
initiatives taken by Cameroon to realize the right to food. In 1997, the ongoing crisis forced 
the country to embark on a series of structural adjustment programmes in which priority 
was given to achieving economic growth and re-establishing macroeconomic equilibrium. 
This limited the authorities&#8217; capacity to support agricultural and rural development and the 
social sector. As part of the adjustments process, large public companies in the agrifood 
sector were privatized. Furthermore, the entry into force, in 1995, of an agreement on 
agriculture, resulted in a substantial reduction in preferential access to Europe for export 
products. 
</p>
<p>8. Against this backdrop, the efforts undertaken in the framework of the Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Document (2003&#8211;2007) yielded few results, given what the 
Government itself referred to as the &#8220;almost total disengagement of the State from rural 
areas&#8221;.5 When prices rose at the beginning of 2000&#8211;2010, negatively affecting consumers, 
the revenue of agricultural producers shrank. This situation prompted the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to call for more robust redistribution 
policies to mitigate the impact of unequal growth.  
</p>
<p>9. A new phase is now under way. Clearly, the crisis and the structural adjustments 
process continue to have an impact, notably on debt repayments and the administrative 
capacity of the State. However, following the 2008 food crisis, Cameroon decided to 
redefine its agricultural and rural development policies. The renewed interest in natural 
resources &#8212; agricultural land, forests and mineral resources, particularly oil &#8212; is 
generating new revenue. The mission took place against this general background. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Situation in the northern regions 
</b></p>
<p>10. The high level of food insecurity in the northern regions (Adamaoua, North and Far 
North), which encompass the Sudano-Sahelian agriecological zone, can be attributed to 
climatic conditions and recurrent climatic challenges, including the floods of 2010 and the 
droughts of 2009 and 2011. In 2011, 81 per cent of rural households in the Far North, 
where 30 per cent of Cameroonians live, were food insecure. At the time of the Special

<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the Government had declared a state of emergency in the Far North 
region, and a call for international assistance had been issued. An early warning unit had 
been set up in the Government to coordinate the response to recurring food emergencies. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur welcomes these initiatives. However, during his meeting in 
Maroua with members of the humanitarian cluster that includes representatives of the 
Government and United Nations organizations (WFP, FAO, the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO)), and that was conducting a 
humanitarian operation to help households in areas affected by the drought,6 he was struck 
by the limited capacity of these structures and the lack of resources at their disposal to deal 
with the humanitarian crisis. It has been shown that taking action early on to strengthen 
local production capacity and prepare the population to deal with the impact of climatic 
shocks is both more effective and less costly than intervening aften a crisis has already 
started. The Special Rapporteur calls on the partners of Cameroon to bear this in mind 
when deciding how to respond to appeals to the international community.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Marginalized and vulnerable groups  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Prisoners&#8217; right to food  
</b></p>
<p>12. During his visits to the main prisons and central prison in Yaound&#233;, the Special 
Rapporteur was able to evaluate the situation of prisoners with regard to the right to food. 
Men are entitled to a single daily ration, generally made up of fufu, maize, millet or rice 
and sometimes including green vegetables, meat or fish. Women receive food at regular 
intervals, which they prepare themselves. Furthermore, both male and female prisoners who 
can afford to do so can order food from a messenger, who will buy it outside the prison. An 
estimated one third of prisoners in Yaound&#233; central prison receive additional food from 
family members during prison visits. 
</p>
<p>13. The current situation is not satisfactory. When a State decides to deprive persons of 
their liberty, it undertakes to treat them with humanity and to provide conditions of 
detention that are consistent with respect for human dignity and do not lead to inhuman or 
degrading treatment.7 This implies, in particular, that the State should provide prisoners 
with sufficient and adequate food so that they do not have to rely on food brought in by 
members of their families in order to be able to feed themselves properly. Account must 
also be taken of the particular needs of pregnant and breastfeeding women.  
</p>
<p>14. Article 20, paragraph 1 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of 
Prisoners provides that &#8220;Every prisoner shall be provided by the administration at the usual 
hours with food of nutritional value adequate for health and strength, of wholesome quality 
and well prepared and served.&#8221;8 The argument that there are insufficient budgetary 
resources is not acceptable. In fact, it was when adopting a decision on Cameroon that the 
Human Rights Committee recalled that article 20 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners should always be observed, &#8220;even if economic or budgetary 
considerations may make compliance with these obligations difficult&#8221;.9 This applies all the

</p>
<p>more so in the case of Cameroon, where levels of prison overcrowding are high,10 due, in 
particular, to excessive recourse to pretrial detention.  
</p>
<p><b>  Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>15. The indigenous communities of Cameroon comprise the indigenous forest people, or 
&#8220;Pygmies&#8221;, who live from hunting, fishing and gathering (the Bagyeli or Bakola, Baka and 
Bedzan); the nomadic Mbororo herders (the Wodaabe, Jafun, and Galegi); and the people 
of the Kirdi mountain communities. The total number of Pygmies is estimated at 40,000&#8211;
50,000, representing approximately 0.25 per cent of the total population. The Mbororo are a 
larger group, consisting of approximately 1.85 million persons (about 9 per cent of the total 
population), and include the Wodaabe (in the North), the Jafun (all regions) and the Galegi 
(the East, Adamaoua, West and North-West regions). The Kirdi, whose numbers are 
unknown, live in the Mandara mountains in the North.11 
</p>
<p>16. There are no reliable national statistics on the socioeconomic situation of indigenous 
peoples. However, several studies have shown that indigenous communities in Cameroon 
are particularly at risk when it comes to the enjoyment of the right to adequate food. The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes the various efforts undertaken to combat discrimination 
against indigenous peoples and to ensure that particular attention is afforded to them in 
public policymaking. He encourages the Government to build on its efforts by giving 
specific recognition to indigenous groups in accordance with international law. As has been 
noted by the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the terminology currently used to designate indigenous 
peoples is not in line with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples.12 This situation should be remedied in the bill on marginal groups that is currently 
being drafted. 
</p>
<p>17. According to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, indigenous 
peoples &#8220;shall not be forcibly removed from their lands or territories. No relocation shall 
take place without the free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned 
and after agreement on just and fair compensation and, where possible, with the option of 
return&#8221; (art. 10). Furthermore, States should take &#8220;effective measures to ensure that this 
right is protected and also to ensure that indigenous peoples can understand and be 
understood in political, legal and administrative proceedings, where necessary through the 
provision of interpretation or by other appropriate means&#8221; (art. 13).  
</p><p>18. Pygmies rely for their livelihood on hunting and gathering, as well as non-timber 
forest products (honey, wild yams, caterpillars, fruit, snails, etc.). They therefore rely 
directly on access to forests for their food, and forests are an integral part of their cultural 
identity. However, from his meetings with various groups of Pygmies, the Special 
Rapporteur has concluded that, to date, the views of these communities have not been taken 
into account in decisions concerning the concession of territory on which they rely for their 
subsistence. Furthermore, these groups do not generally benefit in any way from the 
exploitation of their land by the forest industry.

<p>

</p>

 At the time of the visit, there were 3,900 prisoners in Yaound&#233;&#8217;s central prison, which has a capacity

<p>19. If appropriate measures are not taken to protect their rights, development projects 
such as forest exploitation and large-scale plantations will further marginalize the Pygmies, 
instead of improving their situation. Therefore, particularly when it comes to regulating 
protection for users of the land, account must be taken of the fact that Pygmies have a 
nomadic existence and do not practise agriculture. Thus, they cannot prove that they rely on 
a given zone. As for the distribution of forest royalties, it must be borne in mind that the 
sedentary Bantu communities do not represent the interests of all the local communities that 
may be affected by exploitation activities. The interests of the Pygmies deserve and require 
specific representation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Refugees 
</b></p>
<p>20. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR), there are currently some 110,000 refugees in Cameroon, primarily from the 
Central African Republic (approximately 85,000). Levels of malnutrition and food 
insecurity are particularly high among this refugee population. According to a recent study, 
55 per cent of Central African households in Cameroon are food insecure.13 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>21. The preamble of the Constitution of Cameroon, which was adopted in 1996 and 
amended most recently in 2008, refers to the right to development and to a commitment to 
harnessing the country&#8217;s natural resources so as to ensure the well-being of all citizens 
without discrimination. The text affirms the right of all persons to an adequate standard of 
living, including adequate food, in terms similar to those used in article 11 of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 25). The Constitution 
also states that international treaties that have entered into force for Cameroon take 
precedence over domestic laws (art. 45). 
</p><p>22. In principle, these provisions should help the Cameroonian courts to safeguard the 
right to food, as they can draw, inter alia, on the interpretation of the Covenant by the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on the interpretation of the 
African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights by the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights. With the exception of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, however, the Cameroonian courts do not invoke the 
international human rights treaties ratified by the Republic of Cameroon. Progress could be 
made on this front, if better information were provided to members of the judiciary about 
these possibilities and about the continuing education programmes available to them at the 
National School of the Judiciary. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur recalls that if the right to food is to be realized, the rights 
which allow people to invoke it, such as freedom of expression and of peaceful assembly 
and the right of access to an independent and impartial justice system, must also be 
guaranteed. He is concerned by reports about a number of incidents in which attempts were 
allegedly made to dissuade defenders of the right to food from carrying out their work and 
from applying to the courts to order protection measures. This is a particular issue in cases 
where complainants file suits against decisions to cede land under conditions that threaten

<p>the livelihood of the local population, or report embezzlement or the misuse of Government 
revenue. The Special Rapporteur had separate meetings with the authorities about these 
matters. He recalls the obligations established under the Declaration on the Right and 
Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect 
Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, adopted by the United 
Nations General Assembly by its resolution 53/144 of 8 March 1999, as well as the 
importance of ensuring access to independent and impartial justice in the context of 
defending the right to food.  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur invites the countries of origin of foreigners that invest in the 
agro-industry, forestry and extractive industry sectors in Cameroon to provide local 
communities with all relevant information so that these communities can contribute to the 
implementation of the procedures established under domestic law to give effect to the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption. In this way, they can meet their obligation 
to actively involve civil society, non-governmental organizations and community-based 
organizations in anti-corruption activities by, for example, offering them the opportunity to 
report offences anonymously (art. 13). 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Elements of the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission in July 2012, at a time when prices of agrifood 
products on the international market look set to rise once again, provides an opportunity to 
review three important aspects of the realization of the right to food: improving the 
<i>availability</i> of food in the territory; improving <i>access</i> to food; and ensuring the 
environmental <i>sustainability</i> of choices made in regard to food security. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Availability 
</b></p>
<p>26. Sixty per cent of the Cameroonian population (12 million inhabitants) depend on 
small-scale agriculture, livestock farming and fishing for their livelihood. The majority are 
small farmers who produce food crops, but also some cash crops (mainly cocoa, coffee and 
cotton). A number of large-scale farmers and agribusinesses produce crops on an industrial 
scale, some of which are for export (bananas, sugar, rubber, tea, palm oil). Cameroon is 
able to produce a wide range of crops because of the diverse agro-climatic conditions in the 
country. It serves as a hub for trade with neighbouring countries.  
</p>
<p>27. In the 2009 Growth and Employment Strategy Document, the objective established 
for Cameroon is that of increasing agricultural output and the amount of land under 
cultivation by 30 per cent over 2005 levels. The strategy has two main elements. The first 
consists in promoting the development of large-scale farming, notably by attracting foreign 
investors. The second includes a large number of initiatives and programmes (64 in total, 
according to the information received) to modernize the family farming model by 
encouraging farmers to join cooperatives or community groups and by facilitating access to 
agricultural inputs. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government on the commitment it has made 
to providing better support to small producers, many of whom are food insecure for at least 
part of the year and thus rightly deserve to receive special attention. He wishes to make the 
observations set out below. 
</p>
<p>29. <i>Targeting</i>. The Government wishes both to encourage large-scale agricultural 
farming and to support the majority of small-scale farmers. In order to maintain a balanced 
allocation of available budgetary resources to these two groups, information should be 
provided in the Strategy Document to clarify the key criteria for allocating Government </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/50/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.12-18864 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>resources (particularly land and budgetary resources, including subsidies and subsidized 
loans) to different categories of producers (small producers, large businesses and agrifood 
companies).  
30. <i>Credit</i>. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to ensure that the lines 
of credit provided by the future agricultural bank are accessible to small farmers, livestock 
farmers and fishermen. He welcomes the plans to create special service areas for these 
groups, as has been done in other countries, notably Brazil. He welcomes measures to 
support citizens&#8217; initiatives to gain access to credit in rural areas, having seen a number of 
examples for himself in villages close to Maroua.14 
</p>
<p>31. <i>Access to inputs, mechanization, and agricultural development model</i>. Under the 
current strategy, priority is given to providing subsidized access to inputs (seeds, fertilizers 
and phytosanitary products) and effecting a rapid transition from manual to motorized 
agriculture. This process involves, in particular, the distribution, with the support of FAO, 
of improved seeds, the construction of a tractor factory and a project to construct a 
synthetic fertilizer factory. There is no doubt that the distribution of crop varieties that are 
suited to the needs of small producers is important and that increasing the amount of 
fertilizer used in Cameroon &#8212; which is currently very small &#8212; may increase yields from 
depleted soil. However, the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and 
Technology for Development, conducted by more than 400 experts between 2004 and 
2008, and the previous contributions of the Special Rapporteur (A/HRC/16/49) highlight 
the potential of agroecology in developing a system of productive, small-scale agriculture 
that creates employment and is less dependent on external inputs whose costs are set to rise 
over the coming years. 
</p>
<p>32. Agroecological techniques could provide an interesting alternative for the northern 
regions. For instance, fertilizer/fodder trees such as <i>acacia senegal</i> provide a structural 
solution to the problem of soil fertilization, supplement mineral fertilizers and have the 
added advantage of producing fodder and also gum arabic for a sector that creates jobs. The 
State could make an effective investment by installing anti-erosion strips and microdams, 
which modify the structure of production by maximizing fodder yields and helping to 
improve rainwater collection. 
</p>
<p>33. <i>Advice for producers</i>. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the recruitment of 2,000 
agricultural advisers over the last two years. He encourages the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Rural Development to create the conditions for the establishment of a genuine partnership 
between the decentralized bodies where these advisers are based, the organizations 
representing small farmers, and the researchers of the Institute of Agricultural Research for 
Development. It would also be desirable to appoint a number of women agricultural 
advisers, consistent with the number of farmers who are women, as this would help to 
improve access to knowledge for women and ensure that their specific constraints are taken 
into account.  
</p>
<p>34. <i>Marketing and rural development</i>. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the political 
commitment made to improving production processes and ending the isolation of regions 
where road and rail infrastructure is lacking or dilapidated. In his view, the village granaries 
of the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Network Fighting Hunger in Cameroon 
(RELUFA) deserve to be supported and developed on a larger scale. While their primary 
aim is to protect villages from the effects of a lean period, these structures can represent the

<p>first step in the creation of production chains which enable small producers to store and 
then sell on their surplus on more favourable terms. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Accessibility 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Physical and economic accessibility of food 
</b></p>
<p>35. Following the troubles of 2008 caused by the increase in the cost of living, 
particularly in the price of basic foods, Cameroon adopted a series of measures to facilitate 
access to affordable food. Public sector pay increases were introduced.15 Customs duties 
and other taxes on imports of rice, wheat, frozen fish and wheat flour were suspended,16 and 
price regulation agreements were concluded between the Government and members of the 
distribution chain, with the result that the price of these basic foods fell by between 6 and 
15 per cent.  
</p>
<p>36. Other measures were taken above and beyond those introduced to deal with the 
emergency. Firstly, mobile sales of discounted goods and the periodic holding of markets 
were encouraged to allow wholesalers or producers to sell directly to consumers and to 
obviate the risk of speculation by retailers catering to communities that are relatively far 
from the main distribution circuits. Special shops, known as &#8220;magasins-t&#233;moins&#8221;, were set 
up to sell rice and other basic foods at below market prices. The Consumer Product Supply 
Regulatory Authority (MIRAP) was set up to monitor prices and build up buffer stocks to 
counter price volatility. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of these measures, which improve 
access to affordable food. He attaches particular importance to initiatives to open up certain 
regions that currently lack road and rail infrastructure so as to improve both access to 
markets for producers and access to food for consumers.  
</p>
<p>38. However, additional progress could be made in a number of areas. Firstly, the 
poorest households would benefit if the &#8220;magasins-t&#233;moins&#8221; system were to be extended to 
include rural areas, and support would be provided to local producers if local products, such 
as cassava, millet and maize, were included among the foods offered at regulated prices by 
these outlets.  
</p>
<p>39. Secondly, in accordance with articles 9 and 11 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, extending social protection to the entire 
Cameroonian population should be made a Government priority. With the adoption of the 
Social Protection Floor Initiative in April 2009, the United Nations System Chief 
Executives Board for Coordination identified the need to tackle the food and economic 
crisis as a priority; this issue is also addressed in Recommendation 202 (2012) of the 
International Labour Conference. 
</p>
<p>40. Today, the vast majority of workers in Cameroon are employed in the informal 
economy and do not benefit from any form of social protection. Similarly, those who are 
not economically active or who are excluded from the labour market are not covered. The 
International Labour Organization has calculated that the establishment of a social 
protection floor in Cameroon (providing the entire population with access to an old-age 
pension, sickness and disability insurance, a family allowance to offset some of the costs of 
children&#8217;s education and health insurance, and providing unemployment insurance for the

<p>entire labour force) would cost less than 6 per cent of Gross Domestic Product.17 Such an 
investment in the realization of the right to social security would be affordable, if fiscal 
reforms were introduced (to improve the efficiency of tax collection and the progressive 
taxation system), together with measures to scale up gradually the proportion of 
Government funds allocated to social spending, particularly for the poorest households.  
</p>
<p>41. Thirdly, to improve access by the Cameroonian population to affordable food, 
measures must be taken to reduce the retail price of basic products, stimulate local 
production by improving market access for farmers, and boost the purchasing power of the 
entire population. This requires the adoption of a coordinated approach among all 
ministerial departments in the framework of a national strategy for the realization of the 
right to food.  
</p>
<p><b>  Access to productive resources 
</b></p>
<p>42. According to information made available to the Special Rapporteur, Cameroon has 
concluded agreements on transfers of almost 800,000 hectares of arable land, of which at 
least 349,400 hectares are intended for oil palm cultivation. Over the past decade, more 
than 300,000 additional hectares have been transferred in the form of concessions to foreign 
investors. Recent agreements include the signing of a 99-year lease between the State and 
SG Sustainable Oils Cameroon (SGSOC), a wholly owned subsidiary of an American 
company, Herakles Farms. The lease is on 73,086 hectares of land in the south-western 
region, of which 60,000 hectares will be used for the production of palm oil. According to 
some estimates, six companies are proposing to develop a further million hectares for palm 
oil production in the coming years.18 Like other countries on the continent, Cameroon has 
become a major target of the land acquisition strategies developed by international 
investors.  
</p>
<p>43. Given current rural poverty levels, the proportion of the population employed in 
agriculture, and the commercial pressure on land resulting from demand among foreign 
investors, the issue of protecting the right of access to land has assumed particular 
importance. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recalls that &#8220;the 
obligation to respect existing access to adequate food requires States parties not to take any 
measures that result in preventing such access&#8221;.19 Currently, the criteria for recognizing 
private ownership of land are set out in Order No. 74-1 of 6 July 1974, on the establishment 
of the landownership system, and in one of the implementing laws, namely, Decree No. 76-
165 of 27 April 1976, on the conditions for obtaining a land deed. However, this legal 
framework has a number of shortcomings.  
</p>
<p>44. Firstly, communities that depend for their living on shifting agriculture or hunting or 
gathering are not sufficiently protected. Article 14 of Order No. 74-1 provides that 
unregistered land that is neither State-owned public or private property nor the property of 
other public bodies is national State property. This land may be ceded by the State, notably 
in the form of a concession or a lease. However, while, in principle, protection is provided 
for land that is occupied under the customary tenure system and effectively developed,20 the

 Under the terms of article 15 of Order No. 74-1, this refers to &#8220;residential land, (...) cropland,

</p>
<p>same does not apply to land considered to be &#8220;free of any form of effective occupation&#8221;, 
including land used for hunting and gathering by certain groups. This explains why the 
groups concerned, namely, the Mbororo and the Pygmies, are faced with relentless 
encroachment on the land on which they depend for their livelihood, in violation of both the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the right to food.  
</p>
<p>45. Secondly, the Special Rapporteur has been informed that traditional chiefs 
sometimes cede land occupied by communities according to customary law without any 
compensation being given to individual members of the community or the community as a 
whole.  
</p>
<p>46. Thirdly, article 12 of Order No. 74-1 and Act No. 85-09 of 4 July 1985, on 
expropriations carried out in the public interest and compensation arrangements, should, in 
principle, provide a guarantee that expropriations will not be carried out unless they are &#8220;in 
the public interest&#8221; and unless compensation is provided to the occupants. The Special 
Rapporteur has received reports, however, that land not registered by those who occupy it is 
sometimes expropriated without compensation being provided. Moreover, according to 
Order No. 74-2 of 6 July 1974, on State land, the State can grant private investors long 
leases, of up to 99 years, on land that has been expropriated in the public interest (art. 10, 
para. 3). This can have the effect of nullifying the requirement that expropriation should 
only take place in the public interest. 
</p>
<p>47. Lastly, the conditions under which concessions are granted by different ministries 
will cause major difficulties in the future. Concessions are granted for agro-industrial 
plantations and mineral exploration, but there is no register to ensure against duplication of 
concessions. Thus investors are facing a situation of real legal uncertainty. Cameroon risks 
being presented, in the coming years, with claims from investors that come to the 
conclusion that they cannot make a profit from exploration activities because of competing 
claims to a given piece of land. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur recommends that a full review be conducted of the land 
tenure system with a view both to guaranteeing the rights of land users, including 
indigenous groups, and creating a legal framework to avert the possibility of multiple land 
disputes in the future. Such a review would ensure that the system is brought into line with 
the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and 
Forests in the Context of National Food Security, endorsed by the Committee on World 
Food Security on 11 May 2012, and that due account is taken of the principles put forward 
by the Special Rapporteur to make sure that large-scale investments in agriculture are made 
with due respect for all human rights, including the right to development 
(A/HRC/13/33/Add.2). It would also provide an opportunity to hold a transparent and 
participatory debate on the opportunity costs of granting land to investors that plan to 
develop agro-industrial plantations, when strengthening small local farmers&#8217; access to land, 
by means of adequate State support, could do more to improve local food security and 
reduce rural poverty. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur recalls that smaller plots are 
generally more productive per hectare and contribute to local food security and rural 
development, because they are used for a more labour-intensive form of agriculture that 
combines food and cash crops. He also recalls the possible benefits of combining the 
development of large-scale agro-industrial plantations with the use of contract farming on 
village plantations. These formulas afford small producers with land bordering on large 
plantations better access to markets and the opportunity to receive technical support from 
buyers (A/66/262). The Special Rapporteur points out that oil palm production is 
particularly suited to this model.

<p>GE.12-18864 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The situation of agricultural workers 
</b></p>
<p>49. The situation of workers employed on large-scale plantations deserves specific 
mention. In accordance with Decree No. 2005 085 of 29 March 2005 (art. 63), the Labour 
Inspection and Social Security Service is tasked, inter alia, with verifying compliance with 
labour legislation and regulations. However, apart from the fact that it is primarily 
dispatched to settle labour disputes, the Service has limited capacity to inspect large-scale 
plantations, owing to a number of factors. There are few inspectors (between four and nine 
per region) and those that are poorly trained to deal with the workplace health and safety 
issues specific to the agricultural sector. In practice, the Service carries out very few 
inspections of the country&#8217;s plantations. Moreover, even when inspections do take place, 
administrative penalties do not seem to be applied.  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur further points out that, according to the Ministry of Labour 
and Social Security manual of procedures for different Ministry departments, before a visit 
can be made to a company a letter specifying the day, date and time of the visit must be 
sent to the head of the company. Although, by definition, this instruction does not apply to 
surprise inspections, it can be viewed as undermining the authority given to labour 
inspectors under article 108.1 (a) of the Labour Code to enter freely and without previous 
notice at any hour of the day or night any workplace liable to inspection. 
</p>
<p>51. Cameroon has not ratified the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 
concerning Labour Inspection in Agriculture (No. 129), article 16 (a) of which provides that 
labour inspectors in agriculture shall be empowered &#8220;to enter freely and without previous 
notice at any hour of the day or night any workplace liable to inspection&#8221;. The Special 
Rapporteur urges Cameroon to ratify this instrument as soon as possible and to comply with 
its provisions in order to ensure that the reputation of agro-industrial companies operating 
in the country is better protected.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Sustainability 
</b></p>
<p>52. The forests are an important source of revenue and food, particularly for the poorest 
rural households that harness non-timber forest products such as medicinal plants, fruit and 
game. 
</p>
<p>53. However, degradation and commercial exploitation are putting increasing pressure 
on these resources. Deforestation has accelerated over the past 10 years: the gross 
deforestation rate was estimated at 0.17 per cent in 2000&#8211;2005, as compared with 0.10 per 
cent for 1990&#8211;2000; and, while the net deforestation rate is falling (0.03 per cent per year 
for 2000&#8211;2005), the net degradation rate is rising (0.07 per cent per year for 2000&#8211;2005).21 
</p><p>54. Cameroon has 22.5 million hectares of forest, making up 48 per cent of the national 
territory. A total of 27.5 per cent of forests are degraded, and arable land reserves are 
shrinking.22 Coastal regions and the Sahelian regions in the North are particularly hard hit 
by climate change. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to step up its 
efforts to address these challenges by, for example, implementing the National 
Desertification Control Plan and the measures envisaged in the Growth and Employment 
Strategy 2010&#8211;2020 to regenerate forests, protect soil fertility and protect grazing land.

<p><b> V. Using the &#8220;maximum available resources&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>55. According to article 2, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, every State should take steps towards the progressive realization 
of the right to food &#8220;to the maximum of its available resources&#8221;. Cameroon has abundant 
natural resources, including minerals (gold, diamonds, bauxite, copper, tin, and uranium), 
oil, fisheries, fertile agricultural land in accessible locations, and a large forested area rich 
in high-value species.  
</p>
<p>56. The following data illustrate the importance for Cameroon of exploiting its natural 
resources. In 2008, oil exploitation accounted for 38 per cent of the national budget.23 In 
2011, the national oil and gas company, Soci&#233;t&#233; nationale des hydrocarbures (SNH), paid 
572 billion CFA francs (CFAF) to the Treasury (872 million euros (&#8364;)).24 In 2008, the 
annual forest tax on 6 million hectares of land (forest management units and timber sales) 
brought in CFAF 12.8 billion (&#8364;19.5 million)25 for the State, accounting for 36 per cent of 
taxes from forestry activities (estimated at CFAF 35.5 billion or &#8364;541 million). Lastly, it is 
estimated that the Chad-Cameroon pipeline generated 118 million United States dollars 
(US$) in transit rights (US$ 0.41 per barrel)26 between 2003 and 2008. Figures on revenue 
from mining earned by the Programme to Secure Mining, Water and Energy Revenues 
(PSRMEE) have not been published, and some estimates &#8212; CFAF 675,076,301 (&#8364;1 
million) in 2010 &#8212; are not necessarily reliable. The revenue from fishing licence fees and 
agricultural concessions is also difficult to verify.  
</p>
<p>57. Among other things, Cameroon has set up the first official system for the 
distribution of forestry revenue to local communities. In 1998, following the adoption of 
Act No. 94-01 of 20 January 1994, on forests, wildlife and fishing, an order was issued 
providing for the payment of 50 per cent of royalties to the Treasury, 40 per cent to 
municipal councils and 10 per cent to village committees that manage forest royalties. In 
the interests of fairness, under Act No. 2009/019 of 15 December 2009, on local tax 
systems, a share of revenue can now be allocated to non-forest communities. Under this 
new system of equalization payments, 50 per cent goes to the Treasury, 20 per cent to 
FEICOM &#8212; the community mutual assistance fund &#8212; 20 per cent to municipal councils 
and 10 per cent to local committees. According to a publication issued by the Programme 
for Securing Property Tax Revenue and the Community Forest Technical Centre, a total of 
CFAF 63,729 billion was redistributed to local communities between 2000 and 2011. 
</p>
<p>58. This redistribution mechanism is to be welcomed, even though the impact on 
development has been modest or marginal to date27 and even though the contribution that 
harvesting of forests, and other natural resources, makes to poverty reduction and food 
security is still too small.

</b></p>
<p>59. Steps have been taken to improve this state of affairs so that the population can 
profit from the country&#8217;s natural resources in accordance with the requirements of the right 
to development. A joint order issued on 26 June 2012 fills a gap in the system that was first 
introduced in 1994 by providing for the establishment of an additional mechanism to 
monitor allocated funds, verify how they are being used and help to shape decisions on how 
this revenue should be spent. The Special Rapporteur encourages Cameroon to continue on 
this path by: (a) guaranteeing the transparency of transfers, for example by requiring 
councils and local committees to publish figures on the royalties paid to villages, informing 
citizens in radio broadcasts about how the money has been used and publishing a list of 
expenditures at the end of the budget year; (b) building the capacities of local communities, 
especially women and indigenous communities, to participate in taking decisions about the 
use of tax revenue; (c) encouraging investment of this revenue; and (d) strengthening 
monitoring, appeals and sanctions mechanisms. The Special Rapporteur also encourages 
the Government to issue a joint ministerial order for the mining sector, equivalent to the 
one issued in 2012 on the distribution of forest revenue in which the modalities for 
allocating royalties to local communities are defined in line with the decree of 2002 on the 
implementation of the 2001 Mining Code. 
</p>
<p>60. The strikingly low rate of tax on agricultural concessions is difficult to ignore. By 
way of illustration, SG Sustainable Oils Cameroon (SGSOC, a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Herakles) was given a 99-year lease on 73,086 hectares of land in exchange for paying an 
annual fee of US$ 1 per hectare (for developed land) and US$ 0.50 per hectare for 
undeveloped land. The 50-year lease granted to the HEVECAM company on 7 January 
1997 for an area of 40,000 hectares amounts to CFAF 150 million (subject to review every 
15 years by agreement between the parties). The 99-year lease granted to SOSUCAM on 20 
April 2006 on an area of 11,980 hectares is worth CFAF 77,354,860 (subject to review 
every five years), and the lease granted to SOCAPALM on 12 July 2000 for an area of 
78,529 hectares is worth CFAF 392,645,000 (subject to review every 15 years by 
agreement between the parties). According to a guide that the Ministry for Property and 
Land Affairs prepared for users of the land tenure system, the annual fee payable on land 
concessions is one CFA franc per square metre. 
</p>
<p>61. As for forest concessions, with the competition generated by the introduction of a 
public tendering system for awarding logging rights, payments from companies wishing to 
gain the access to forests (forest royalties, in particular) have increased from a baseline of 
US$ 0.6 per hectare per year in 1990 (set by the authorities). Average payments were US$ 
5.6 per hectare per year for forest management units in 2006, and US$ 13.7 per hectare for 
timber sales in 2005.28 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that it is a complex task to optimize the taxation 
of natural resources, particularly those in the forests of the Congo Basin. There is a high 
level of information asymmetry between the Government authorities and the forestry 
industry. It is not easy to estimate the value of the numerous species, of differing quality 
and types, that are traded within vertically integrated companies, nor is it easy to predict 
how companies will adapt to new measures.29 Lastly, the annual forest royalty fee on the 
basis of which competitive tenders are awarded is only one part, albeit the largest part, of 
the forest tax, which also includes a slaughter tax, exit rights for timber, the export 
surcharge on timber, and the sawmill entry tax.

<p>63. The Special Rapporteur notes the important initiatives that Cameroon has taken in 
this area, notably with regard to zoning, improved transparency, regulation of the process 
for awarding forest exploitation rights, as well as the efforts made to combat corruption &#8211; 
which remains a major challenge. He also notes the beneficial effects of the tendering 
system on the amounts that companies are willing to pay to gain access to forests.30 
However, he encourages the Government to continue to improve its policy on taxation of 
agricultural and forest concessions in order to optimize revenue from natural resources and 
ensure both that it matches the value of the resources being harnessed and that the resources 
are being sustainably managed. Cameroon has a set of agro-climatic conditions that are 
unique in Central Africa in terms of their suitability for oil palm cultivation, while the 
proximity of Douala port means that it costs less to harness forest resources than in other 
Central African countries where high transportation costs have a dampening effect on 
profits. Given these conditions, the Special Rapporteur finds it difficult to understand why 
Cameroon does not try to take full advantage of the exploitation of resources whose value-
added is taken by foreign groups which then expatriate their profits and engage in tax 
engineering and/or tax evasion, to minimize their tax burden, inter alia, by manipulating the 
prices of transfers to subsidiaries based in tax havens. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur notes that some stakeholders, notably the International 
Monetary Fund, recommend that Cameroon lower its taxes on the exploitation of natural 
resources, including forest resources. He disagrees entirely with this recommendation. 
Apart from the &#8220;race to the bottom&#8221; that this would trigger in the other countries of the 
Congo Basin, and the resulting loss of revenue for the State, there is no need to lower taxes 
in order to attract the main forestry companies (companies like Wijmar and Rougier operate 
in the country despite the current level of taxation). Such a measure would serve not only to 
attract companies that are less technically qualified and less concerned about the 
sustainable exploitation of the forests and respect for the rights of local communities, but 
also to accelerate the deforestation of tropical forests, which are slow to regenerate, and this 
when the true value of forests is better understood. In fact, most countries of the Congo 
Basin have raised forest taxes considerably over the past decade.31 The World Bank 
estimates that the tax rate has stabilized at an average of 19 per cent of company turnover.32 
</p>
<p>65. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur encourages Cameroon to learn from the 
experience with the Chad-Cameroon pipeline. Cameroon failed in its bid to have 
modifications made to the initial contract, the conditions of which (negotiated on the basis 
of the low price per barrel at the time) are extremely disadvantageous to Cameroon, with 
transit costs of only US$ 0.41 per barrel. The fact that the leases on agricultural concessions 
allow for the renegotiation of the annual royalty only every 15 years &#8220;by agreement 
between the parties&#8221; renders the clause a virtual dead letter. 
</p>
<p>66. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur notes that the Government is willing to take 
advantage of the opportunities presented by the United Nations Collaborative Programme 
on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing 
Countries (UN-REDD), which offers compensation for forest conservation. He encourages 
the Government to explore the possibilities for funding forest conservation activities, and

<p>stresses the importance, in the implementation of the mechanism, of providing guarantees 
for indigenous populations that depend on the forests in accordance with articles 25 to 27 of 
the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>67. By taking the above-mentioned measures, Cameroon could speed up the country&#8217;s 
poverty eradication and socioeconomic development process. In particular, Cameroon 
would be in a position to exploit its natural resources more sustainably, reducing the 
negative impact on the local population.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Towards a national strategy on the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>68. Cameroon has recently adopted a range of measures to improve food availability and 
affordability for the population; it is also taking steps to revive the agricultural sector. A 
number of challenges in the area of governance still need to be addressed, however. The 
responsibilities do not lie with one ministerial department alone. In addition to intervention 
by the Ministry for Agricultural and Rural Development, action by the Ministry of Trade is 
needed to organize distribution, by the Ministry of Labour and Social Services to ensure 
decent working conditions in plantations, by the Ministry of Social Affairs to protect 
vulnerable groups, and by the Ministry for the Advancement of Women to promote gender 
equality. There is a need for improved coordination between the different departments, 
whose efforts must complement and support each other. 
</p>
<p>69. There is also a need to strengthen the dialogue with civil society and producers&#8217; 
organizations. The establishment of a platform for focused and ongoing dialogue will open 
the way for the adoption of more informed policies that take account of the views of 
beneficiaries and will boost the legitimacy and effectiveness of the work done by the 
Government in this domain. The creation of a national framework for consultations with 
representatives of producers&#8217; organizations is a step in this direction. 
</p>
<p>70. Cameroon should take measures to guarantee food security in the short term by, 
inter alia, doing more to ensure the affordability of basic foodstuffs for vulnerable groups, 
and it should prepare for the long term by laying plans to expand social welfare coverage 
and revive subsistence agriculture, thus making the country less dependent on fluctuations 
in international market prices. Multi-year and multi-sectoral strategies are needed to 
manage the situation in the short-term while the preparations are being made for the 
transition over the long term. 
</p>
<p>71. Lastly, the deadlines for the adoption of measures, the responsibilities of the 
different actors involved and the remedies available to beneficiaries in the event that 
commitments are not honoured need to be defined more precisely. In this way, it will be 
possible to turn political pronouncements concerning the importance of food security into 
recognition of the right to food, even if a gradual approach to achieving the latter is 
required. 
</p>
<p>72. A framework law on the right to food would provide the legislative and institutional 
structure required to move forward along this path. It would mainly define: the modalities 
for adopting a national strategy on the right to food, with the participation of civil society 
and those involved in the food production sector; the procedures for measuring progress; 
the resources to be allocated to the strategy and ways and means of ensuring transparency 
in the utilization of these resources; and the penalties for failing to act in accordance with 
the strategy. The Special Rapporteur was informed about initiatives being taken to establish 
a framework law on agriculture, the draft text of which is being discussed by the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Rural Development. If Cameroon were to adopt a framework law on the 
right to food that included, among other things, elements of a framework law on 
agriculture, it would be joining the ranks of countries like Mali in West Africa and others in </p>

<p>southern and eastern Africa that are already moving in this direction. The Special 
Rapporteur stands ready to work with the authorities to take this process forward. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government should: 
</p>
<p> (a) Establish a framework-law on the right to food that includes, inter alia, 
elements of a framework law on agriculture, with a view to creating a legislative and 
institutional framework to foster the gradual realization of the right to food; improve 
coordination between different governmental departments (the Ministry of Agricultural and 
Rural Development, the Ministry of Trade, the Ministry of Labour and Social Services, the 
Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry for the Advancement of Women); strengthen 
dialogue with civil society and producers&#8217; organizations on the formulation of food security 
policies; define more precisely the time limits for the adoption of measures, the 
responsibilities of different actors and the remedies open to beneficiaries in the event that 
commitments are not honoured; 
</p>
<p> (b) Adopt measures to improve the situation of marginalized and vulnerable 
groups in respect to food, and, in particular: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure that the definition of indigenous peoples set out in the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is incorporated into the laws of 
Cameroon; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure that the views of communities are taken into account in decisions concerning 
the concessions of the land on which they depend for their livelihood; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Improve, with immediate effect, the food provided to prisoners; 
</p>
<p> (c) Meet the Government target, as set out in the Strategy Document for Growth 
and Employment, of increasing budgetary allocations for agriculture, by clarifying how 
public resources are to be allocated to different categories of producers (small producers, 
large businesses and agrifood companies); 
 (d) Invest in programmes, practices and policies to scale up agroecological 
approaches, as recommended by the Human Rights Council in resolution 16/27; 
</p>
<p> (e) Develop a programme to introduce structural improvements in the northern 
region, which is vulnerable to climate change, by, inter alia: formulating an ambitious 
policy on the creation of village grain stores; establishing large-scale programmes to plant 
fodder/fertilizer trees; and supporting measures, such as the installation of anti-erosion 
strips and micro-dams, to maximize both fodder production and rainwater collection; 
</p>
<p> (f) Stimulate local production by improving access to markets for farmers who 
belong to producers&#8217; organizations; pursue efforts to end the isolation of certain remote 
regions; promote the development of &#8220;magasins-t&#233;moins&#8221; in rural areas and, with a view to 
supporting local producers, ensure that local produce such as cassava, millet and maize is 
included among the price-controlled foods on offer at these outlets; 
</p>
<p> (g) Implement the advertised redeployment of agricultural outreach services 
provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development advisers and involve more 
women in the delivery of the services; and create the right conditions for a genuine 
partnership between the advisers, farmers&#8217; organizations and IRAD researchers, whose 
research deserves to be disseminated more widely; 
</p>
<p> (h) Review the tenure systems with a view to the implementation, in the context 
of national food security, of voluntary guidelines on responsible governance of tenure </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/50/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.12-18864 <b>19

<p>systems as they apply to land, fisheries and forests. In this process, take due account of the 
minimum principles and measures proposed to ensure that large-scale investments are made 
with due respect for all human rights (A/HRC/13/33/Add.2), so that the rights of land users, 
including indigenous communities, are better protected and a legal framework is 
established to avert the possibility of multiple land disputes in the future; 
</p>
<p> (i) In the framework of the review recommended above, hold a transparent and 
participatory dialogue on the opportunity costs of ceding land to investors intending to 
develop agro-industrial plantations, when providing local small farmers with improved 
access to land, through adequate State support, could be more effective in supporting local 
food security and reducing poverty; 
</p>
<p> (j) Adopt specific measures to extend social welfare coverage to the entire 
population through a combination of tax reforms (including a more rigorous system of 
progressive taxation) and the gradual upscaling of budgetary allocations for social welfare 
provision; 
</p>
<p> (k) Build the capacity of the Labour Inspection Service to carry out its mandate 
in large plantations and empower it to conduct surprise inspections; 
</p>
<p> (l) Reconsider the tax policy on concessions of agricultural land and on the 
exploitation of natural resources (particularly forests and minerals) so as to optimize the 
revenue earned from the harnessing of these resources and to improve food security for 
vulnerable groups; 
</p>
<p> (m) Ensure that defenders of the right to food are protected. 
</p><p>74. The Special Rapporteur recommends that international agencies and development 
partners provide adequate assistance in humanitarian crises and take a proactive approach, 
intervening before crises occur. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the countries of origin of foreigners that 
invest in the agro-industry sector in Cameroon abide by the above-mentioned minimum 
principles (A/HRC/13/33/Add.2). He recommends that investors in the agro-industry, 
forestry and extractive industry sectors provide local communities with all relevant 
information so that these communities can contribute to the implementation of the 
procedures provided for in domestic law to give effect to the United Nations Convention 
against Corruption.
