</p>
<p>*  Non-member States of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights 
Council and 5/2 on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of the Human 
Rights Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge his/her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the rights related to housing enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and elaborated in other international human rights treaties and instruments,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the principles and commitments with regard to adequate housing enshrined in the 
relevant provisions of declarations and programmes adopted by major United Nations 
conferences and summits and by special sessions of the General Assembly and their follow up 
meetings, inter alia, the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements and the Habitat Agenda 
(A/CONF.165/14), and the Declaration on Cities and Other Human Settlements in the New 
Millennium adopted at the twenty-fifth special session of the General Assembly, and annexed to 
its resolution S-25/2 of 9 June 2001, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> resolution 42/1 of 13 March 1998 of the Commission on the Status of Women, in 
which, inter alia, the Commission urged States to design and revise laws to ensure that women 
were accorded full and equal rights to own land and other property, and the right to adequate 
housing, including through the right to inheritance, and to undertake administrative reforms and 
other necessary measures to give women the same right as men to credit, capital, appropriate 
technologies, access to markets and information, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the resolve of the Heads of State and Government expressed in the 
United Nations Millennium Declaration to have achieved, by the year 2020, a significant 
improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum-dwellers, 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned</i> that any deterioration in the general housing situation disproportionally affects 
the poor, including women and children, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that adequate housing is a key element for fostering family integration, 
contributing to social equity and strengthening the feeling of belonging, security and human 
solidarity, as stated in the outcome document of the twenty-seventh special session of the </p>

 <p></p>
<p>General Assembly, on children, entitled &#8220;A world fit for children&#8221;, annexed to its 
resolution S-27/2 of 10 May 2002, and welcoming the commitment stated in the document to 
attach high priority to overcoming the housing shortage and other infrastructure needs, 
particularly for children in marginalized peri-urban and remote rural areas, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> the work of the United Nations treaty bodies, in particular of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in the promotion of the rights related to adequate housing,

adequate housing is of central importance for the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural 
rights, as well as general comments Nos. 7 and 16,

<p> 3. <i>Expresses concern</i> at the prevalence of homelessness and inadequate housing, the 
growth of slums worldwide, forced evictions, the increase in challenges faced by migrants in 
relation to adequate housing, as well as of refugees in conflict and post-conflict situations, 
challenges to the full enjoyment of the right to adequate housing caused by the impact of climate 
change, natural disasters and pollution, insecurity of tenure, unequal rights of men and women to 
property and inheritance, as well as other violations of and impediments to the full realization of 
the right to adequate housing;
