Review: I have reviewed the interim financial report and interim MD&A (together, the “interim 
filings”) of Endeavour Silver Corp. (the “issuer”) for the interim period ended June 30, 2016.
No  misrepresentations:  Based  on  my  knowledge,  having  exercised  reasonable  diligence,  the 
interim filings do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material 
fact required to be stated or that is necessary to make a statement not misleading in light of the 
circumstances under which it was made, with respect to the period covered by the interim filings.
Fair  presentation:  Based on  my  knowledge,  having  exercised  reasonable  diligence,  the  interim 
financial report together with the other financial information included in the interim filings fairly 
present in  all  material  respects the financial  condition,  financial performance and  cash flows  of 
the issuer, as of the date of and for the periods presented in the interim filings.
Responsibility: The issuer’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and 
maintaining  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  (DC&P)  and  internal  control  over  financial 
reporting  (ICFR),  as  those  terms  are  defined  in  National  Instrument  52-109  Certification  of 
Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings, for the issuer.
Design:  Subject to the limitations, if any, described in paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3, the issuer’s other 
certifying officer(s) and I have, as at the end of the period covered by the interim filings 
 
(a)
designed DC&P, or caused it to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable 
assurance that  
 
(i)
(ii)
material  information  relating  to  the  issuer  is  made  known  to  us  by  others, 
particularly during the period in which the interim filings are being prepared; and 
 
information  required  to  be  disclosed  by  the  issuer  in  its  annual  filings,  interim 
filings  or  other  reports  filed  or  submitted  by  it  under  securities  legislation  is 
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified 
in securities legislation; and
(b)
designed ICFR, or caused it to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with the issuer’s GAAP.
Control framework:  The control framework the issuer’s other certifying officer(s) and I used to 
design  the  issuer’s  ICFR  is  the  Internal  Control  –  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  (COSO 
Framework)  published  by  The  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway 
Commission (COSO).

Reporting changes in ICFR:  The issuer has disclosed in its interim MD&A any change in the 
issuer’s ICFR that occurred during the period beginning on April 1, 2016 and ended on June 30, 
2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the issuer’s ICFR.
