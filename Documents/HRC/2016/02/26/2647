<p><b>  </b>22/&#8230;<b> Birth registration and the right of everyone to recognition  
 everywhere as a person before the law 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles contained in the Charter of the United 
Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, in which the 
Assembly established the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the human right of everyone to be recognized everywhere as a person 
before the law, which is enshrined in, inter alia, the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other 
relevant international instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the obligation of States to register all children immediately after birth, as 
provided for in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers 
and Members of Their Families and other relevant international instruments to which they 
are party, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Recognizing</i> the importance of a human rights-based approach to birth registration, 
based on international human rights obligations and commitments operationally directed to 
promoting and protecting human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the continuing efforts of the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
towards universal birth registration, such as through recommendations widely addressed to 
States in this regard, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
Council calling upon States to ensure the registration of all children immediately after birth, 
the most recent being Assembly resolution 66/141 of 19 December 2011 and Council 
resolution 19/9 of 22 March 2012, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the importance of birth registration, including late birth registration and 
provision of documents of proof of birth, as a means for providing an official record of the 
existence of a person and the recognition of that individual as a person before the law; 
expressing concern that unregistered individuals have limited or no access to services and 
enjoyment of all the rights to which they are entitled; also taking into consideration that 
persons without birth registration are vulnerable to lack of protection; and aware that 
registering a person&#8217;s birth is a vital step towards the promotion and protection of all his or 
</p>
<p>her human rights, and protection from violence, exploitation and abuse, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> the importance of birth registration, including late birth 
registration, for the development of vital statistics and the effective implementation of 
programmes and policies intended to achieve internationally agreed development goals, 
including the Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing further</i> the efforts undertaken at the regional level to achieve universal 
birth registration, including the Conference of African Ministers responsible for Civil 
Registration, the Universal Civil Identity Program in the Americas, the High-level Meeting 
on the Improvement of Civil Registration and Vital Statistics in Asia and the Pacific, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Expresses concern</i> at the high number of persons throughout the world whose 
birth is not registered; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Reminds</i> States of their obligation to register births without discrimination of 
any kind and irrespective of the status of his or her parents; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon</i> States to establish or strengthen existing institutions at all levels 
responsible for birth registration and the preservation and security of such records, to 
ensure adequate training for registration officers, to allocate sufficient and adequate human, 
technical and financial resources to fulfil their mandate, and to increase, as needed, the 
number of birth registration facilities, paying attention to the local community level; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to take all appropriate measures to permanently store 
and protect civil registration records and to prevent the loss or destruction of records due to 
emergency situations; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Further calls upon</i> States to ensure free birth registration, including free or 
low-fee late birth registration, by means of universal, accessible, simple, expeditious and 
effective registration procedures without discrimination of any kind; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Calls upon</i> States to continuously raise awareness at national, regional and 
local levels of birth registration, including by engagement in collaboration with all relevant 
actors in public campaigns that raise awareness of the importance of birth registration for 
effective access to services and enjoyment of human rights; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Urges</i> States to identify and remove physical, administrative, procedural and 
any other barriers that impede access to birth registration, including late registration, paying </p>


<p>due attention to, among others, those barriers relating to poverty, disability, gender, 
nationality, displacement, illiteracy and detention contexts, and to persons in vulnerable 
situations; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Encourages</i> States to request technical assistance, if required, from relevant 
United Nations bodies, agencies, funds and programmes, including the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund, the United Nations Population Fund, the Department of Economic and 
</p>
<p>Social Affairs, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the 
World Health Organization, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights and the United Nations Development Programme, and other relevant 
stakeholders in order to fulfil their obligation to undertake birth registration as a means to 
respect the right of everyone to be recognized everywhere as a person before the law; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Invites</i> the above-mentioned United Nations bodies, agencies, funds and 
programmes and other relevant stakeholders to cooperate with States in providing technical 
assistance, upon request, and calls upon them to ensure that persons with no birth 
registration are not discriminated against in any of their programmes; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to prepare a report, in consultation with States, United Nations agencies, funds and 
programmes, non-governmental organizations and other relevant stakeholders, on legal, 
administrative, economic, physical and any other barriers to access to universal birth 
registration and possession of documentary proof of birth, as well as on good practices 
adopted by States in fulfilling their obligation to ensure birth registration, to be submitted to 
the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh session; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Decides</i> to consider this issue in accordance with its annual programme of 
work.
