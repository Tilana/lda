PARKER DRILLING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 - General
The Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements as of June 30, 2016 and for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited. In the opinion of Parker Drilling
Company (Parker Drilling or the Company), these financial statements include all adjustments,
which, unless otherwise disclosed, are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair
presentation of the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, and cash
flows for the periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
results for the entire year. The financial statements presented herein should be read in
connection with the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015.
Nature of Operations — Our business is comprised of two business lines: (1) Drilling Services
and (2) Rental Tools Services. We report our Rental Tools Services business as one reportable
segment (Rental Tools) and report our Drilling Services business as two reportable segments: (1)
U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling and (2) International & Alaska Drilling.
In our Drilling Services business, we drill oil and gas wells for customers in both the United
States (U.S.) and international markets. We provide this service with both Company-owned rigs
and customer-owned rigs. We refer to the provision of drilling services with customer-owned rigs
as our operations and maintenance (O&M) service in which operators own their own drilling rigs
but choose Parker Drilling to operate and maintain the rigs for them. The nature and scope of
activities involved in drilling an oil and gas well are similar whether the well is drilled with a
Company-owned rig (as part of a traditional drilling contract) or a customer-owned rig (as part of
an O&M contract). In addition, we provide project related services, such as engineering,
procurement, project management and commissioning of customer owned drilling facility
projects. We have extensive experience and expertise in drilling geologically difficult wells and in
managing the logistical and technological challenges of operating in remote, harsh and
ecologically sensitive areas.
    Our U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling segment provides drilling services with our Gulf of Mexico (GOM)
barge drilling fleet and markets U.S. (Lower 48) based O&M services. Our GOM barge drilling
fleet operates barge rigs that drill for oil and natural gas in shallow waters in and along the inland
waterways and coasts of Louisiana, Alabama and Texas. The majority of these wells are drilled
in shallow water depths ranging from 6 to 12 feet. Our International & Alaska Drilling segment
provides drilling services, with Company-owned rigs as well as through O&M contracts, and
project related services. We strive to deploy our fleet of Company-owned rigs in markets where
we expect to have opportunities to keep the rigs consistently utilized and build a sufficient
presence to achieve efficient operating scale.    
In our Rental Tools Services business, we provide premium rental equipment and services to
exploration and production (E&P) companies, drilling contractors and service companies on land
and offshore in the U.S. and select international markets. Tools we provide include standard and
heavy-weight drill pipe, all of which are available with standard or high-torque connections,
tubing, pressure control equipment, including blow-out preventers (BOPs), drill collars and more.
We also provide well construction services, which include tubular running services and
downhole tools, and well intervention services, which include whipstock, fishing products and
related services, as well as inspection and machine shop support. Rental tools are used during
well drilling programs and are requested by the customer when they are needed, requiring us to
keep a broad inventory of rental tools in stock. Rental tools are usually rented on a daily or
monthly basis.
Consolidation — The consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and subsidiaries over which we exercise control or in which we have a controlling
financial interest, including entities, if any, in which the Company is allocated a majority of the
entity’s losses or returns, regardless of ownership percentage. If a subsidiary of Parker Drilling
has a 50 percent interest in an entity but Parker Drilling’s interest in the subsidiary or the entity
does not meet the consolidation criteria, then that interest is accounted for under the equity
method.
Noncontrolling Interest — We apply accounting standards related to noncontrolling interests for
ownership interests in our subsidiaries held by parties other than Parker Drilling. We report
noncontrolling interest as equity on the consolidated balance sheets and report net income (loss)
attributable to controlling interest and to noncontrolling interest separately on the consolidated
condensed statements of operations. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we purchased the
remaining noncontrolling interest of ITS Arabia Limited for $6.75 million, of which $3.4 million
was paid in the 2015 fourth quarter. The final payment of the purchase price was made during the
second quarter of 2016. At the time of purchase, the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest
was $3.0 million.
Reclassifications — Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform
to the current period presentation. These reclassifications did not materially affect our
consolidated financial results.
7
Revenue Recognition — Drilling revenues and expenses, comprised of daywork drilling
contracts, call-outs against master service agreements and engineering and related project
services contracts, are recognized as services are performed and collection is reasonably
assured. For certain contracts, we receive payments contractually designated for the mobilization
of rigs and other drilling equipment. Mobilization payments received, and direct costs incurred for
the mobilization, are deferred and recognized over the primary term of the related drilling
contract; however, costs incurred to relocate rigs and other drilling equipment to areas in which a
contract has not been secured are expensed as incurred. For contracts that are terminated prior
to the specified term, early termination payments received by us are recognized as revenues
when all contractual requirements are met. Revenues from rental activities are recognized ratably
over the rental term, which is generally less than six months. Our project related services
contracts include engineering, consulting, and project management scopes of work and revenue
is typically recognized on a time and materials basis.
Reimbursable Revenues — The Company recognizes reimbursements received for out-of-
pocket expenses incurred as revenues and accounts for out-of-pocket expenses as direct
operating costs. Such amounts totaled $18.9 million and $27.8 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $37.9 million and $47.5 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, the Company typically receives a
nominal handling fee, which is recognized as revenues in our consolidated statement of
operations.
Use of Estimates — The preparation of consolidated condensed financial statements in
accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP)
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated condensed financial statements, and our revenues and expenses during the
periods reported. Estimates are typically used when accounting for certain significant items such
as legal or contractual liability accruals, mobilization and deferred mobilization, self-insured
medical/dental plans, income taxes and valuation allowance, and other items requiring the use of
estimates. Estimates are based on a number of variables which may include third party
valuations, historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions that we believe are
reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates,
actual results may differ from management estimates.
Purchase Price Allocation — We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its
identifiable assets and liabilities in accordance with the acquisition method based on estimated
fair values at the transaction date. Transaction and integration costs associated with an
acquisition are expensed as incurred. The excess of the purchase price over the amount
allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available
information to estimate fair values, including quoted market prices, the carrying value of acquired
assets, and widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows. We typically
engage third-party appraisal firms to assist in fair value determination of inventories, identifiable
intangible assets, and any other significant assets or liabilities. Judgments made in determining
the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as
well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. See Note 2 - Acquisitions for
further discussion.
Goodwill — We account for all business combinations using the acquisition method of
accounting. Under this method, assets and liabilities, including any remaining noncontrolling
interests, are recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, plus the value of any
noncontrolling interests, is recognized as goodwill. We perform our annual goodwill impairment
review as of October 1 of each year, and more frequently if negative conditions or other triggering
events arise. The quantitative impairment test we perform for goodwill utilizes certain
assumptions, including forecasted revenue and costs assumptions. See Note 3 - Goodwill and
Intangible Assets for further discussion.    
Intangible Assets — Our intangible assets are related to trade names, customer relationships,
and developed technology, which were acquired through acquisition and are generally amortized
over a weighted average period of approximately three to six years. We assess the recoverability
of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indicators of impairment are present
based on expected future profitability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their
contribution to our overall operations. Should the review indicate that the carrying value is not
fully recoverable, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the intangible assets
would be recognized as an impairment loss. See Note 3 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets for
further discussion.
Impairment — We evaluate the carrying amounts of long-lived assets for potential impairment
when events occur or circumstances change that indicate the carrying values of such assets may
not be recoverable. We evaluate recoverability by determining the undiscounted estimated future
net cash flows for the respective asset groups identified. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted
cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, we measure the impairment as the
amount by which the assets’ carrying value exceeds the fair value of such assets. Management
considers a number of factors such as estimated future cash flows from the assets, appraisals
and current market value analysis in determining fair value. Assets are written down to fair value
if the final estimate of current fair value is below the net carrying value. The assumptions used in
the impairment evaluation are inherently uncertain and require management judgment.
8
Concentrations of Credit Risk — Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables with a variety of national and
international oil and natural gas companies. We generally do not require collateral on our trade
receivables. We depend on a limited number of significant customers. Our largest customer,
Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL), constituted approximately 39.8 percent of our consolidated
revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Excluding reimbursable revenues of $36.9
million, ENL constituted approximately 28.7 percent of our total consolidated revenues for the six
months ended June 30, 2016. Our second largest customer, BP Exploration Alaska, Inc. (BP),
constituted approximately 11.9 percent of our consolidated revenues for the six months ended
June 30, 2016.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had deposits in domestic banks in excess of
federally insured limits of approximately $69.1 million and $91.3 million, respectively. In addition,
we had uninsured deposits in foreign banks as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 of
$41.7 million and $44.1 million, respectively.    
Income Taxes — Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method and have
been provided for based upon tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are
conducted and income or losses are generated. There is little or no expected relationship
between the provision for or benefit from income taxes and income or loss before income taxes
as the countries in which we operate have taxation regimes that vary not only with respect to
nominal rate, but also in terms of the availability of deductions, credits, and other benefits.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled and the effect of changes in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period in which the change is enacted. Valuation allowances
are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In order to determine the amount of deferred tax
assets or liabilities, as well as the valuation allowances, we must make estimates and
assumptions regarding future taxable income, where rigs will be deployed and other matters.
Changes in these estimates and assumptions, including changes in tax laws and other changes
impacting our ability to recognize the underlying deferred tax assets, could require us to adjust
the valuation allowances.
The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely
than not to be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount
that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized and changes in recognition or
measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
Legal and Investigation Matters — We accrue estimates of the probable and estimable costs for
the resolution of certain legal and investigation matters. We do not accrue any amounts for other
matters for which the liability is not probable and reasonably estimable.  Generally, the estimate
of probable costs related to these matters is developed in consultation with our legal advisors.
The estimates take into consideration factors such as the complexity of the issues, litigation risks
and settlement costs. If the actual settlement costs, final judgments, or fines, after appeals, differ
from our estimates, our future financial results may be adversely affected.
Note 2 - Acquisitions     
Acquisition of 2M-Tek
On April 17, 2015 we acquired 2M-Tek, a Louisiana-based manufacturer of equipment for tubular
running and related well services (the 2M-Tek Acquisition) for an initial purchase price of $10.4
million paid at the closing of the acquisition, plus $8.0 million of contingent consideration payable
to the seller upon the achievement of certain milestones over the 24-month period following the
closing of the 2M-Tek Acquisition. The fair value of the consideration transferred was $17.2
million, which includes the $10.4 million liability paid at closing plus the estimated fair value of
the contingent consideration of $6.8 million. We paid $2.0 million of the contingent consideration
upon the achievement of certain milestones during the fourth quarter of 2015 and $2.0 million
during the first quarter of 2016. The remaining $4.0 million of the contingent consideration was
paid in April 2016.
Note 3 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets    
As part of the 2M-Tek Acquisition we recognized $6.7 million of goodwill and acquired definite-
lived intangible assets with an acquisition date fair value of $13.5 million. As part of the 2013
acquisition of International Tubular Services Limited (ITS) and related assets (the ITS
Acquisition), we acquired definite-lived intangible assets with an acquisition date fair value of
$8.5 million. All of the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets are allocated to the Rental
Tools segment.

Goodwill
During the 2016 second quarter, circumstances indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit
may not be in excess of the carrying value of the goodwill. Therefore we performed a goodwill
impairment review and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying
value and therefore, no goodwill impairment was identified. Should current market conditions
worsen or persist for an extended period of time, an impairment of the carrying value of our
goodwill could occur.
The change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the period ended June 30, 2016 is as follows:

Note 6 - Reportable Segments
Our business is comprised of two business lines: (1) Drilling Services and (2) Rental Tools
Services. We report our Rental Tools Services business as one reportable segment (Rental
Tools) and report our Drilling Services business as two reportable segments: (1) U.S. (Lower 48)
Drilling and (2) International & Alaska Drilling. Within the three reportable segments, we have
aggregated our U.S. and international rental tools business units under Rental Tools, one
business unit under U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling, and our Arctic, Eastern Hemisphere and Latin
America business units under International & Alaska Drilling for a total of six business units. The
Company has aggregated each of its business units in one of the three reporting segments
based on the guidelines of ASC Topic 280, “Segment Reporting” (ASC Topic 280). We eliminate
inter-segment revenues and expenses. We disclose revenues under the three reportable
segments based on the similarity of the use and markets for the groups of products and services
within each segment.
Drilling Services Business Line
In our Drilling Services business, we drill oil and gas wells for customers in both the U.S. and
international markets. We provide this service with both Company-owned rigs and customer-
owned rigs. We refer to the provision of drilling services with customer-owned rigs as our O&M
service in which operators own their own drilling rigs but choose Parker Drilling to operate and
maintain the rigs for them. The nature and scope of activities involved in drilling an oil and gas
well is similar whether it is drilled with a Company-owned rig (as part of a traditional drilling
contract) or a customer-owned rig (as part of an O&M contract). In addition, we provide project
related services, such as engineering, procurement, project management and commissioning of
customer-owned drilling facility projects. We have extensive experience and expertise in drilling
geologically difficult wells and in managing the logistical and technological challenges of
operating in remote, harsh and ecologically sensitive areas.
U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling
Our U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling segment provides drilling services with our GOM barge drilling rig
fleet and markets U.S. (Lower 48) based O&M services. Our GOM barge drilling fleet operates
barge rigs that drill for oil and natural gas in shallow waters in and along the inland waterways
and coasts of Louisiana, Alabama and Texas. The majority of these wells are drilled in shallow
water depths ranging from 6 to 12 feet. Our rigs are suitable for a variety of drilling programs, from
inland coastal waters requiring shallow draft barges, to open water drilling on both state and
federal water projects requiring more robust capabilities. The barge drilling industry in the GOM
is characterized by cyclical activity where utilization and dayrates are typically driven by oil and
gas prices and our customers’ access to project financing. Contract terms tend to be well-to-well
or multi-well programs, most commonly ranging from 45 to 150 days.
International & Alaska Drilling
Our International & Alaska Drilling segment provides drilling services, with Company-owned rigs
as well as through O&M contracts, and project related services. The drilling markets in which this
segment operates have one or more of the following characteristics:
customers that typically are major, independent or national oil and natural gas companies or
integrated service providers;
drilling programs in remote locations with little infrastructure, requiring a large inventory of spare
•parts and other ancillary equipment and self-supported service capabilities;
complex wells and/or harsh environments (such as high pressures, deep depths, hazardous or
geologically challenging conditions and sensitive environments) requiring specialized
equipment and considerable experience to drill; and
•
12
•drilling and O&M contracts that generally cover periods of one year or more.
Our Rental Tools Services Business
Our Rental Tools segment provides premium rental equipment and services to E&P companies,
drilling contractors and service companies on land and offshore in the U.S. and select
international markets. Tools we provide include standard and heavy-weight drill pipe, tubing,
pressure control equipment, including BOPs, drill collars and more. We also provide well
construction services, which include tubular running services and downhole tools, and well
intervention services, which include whipstock, fishing products and related services, as well as
inspection and machine shop support. Our largest single market for rental tools is U.S. land
drilling. Rental tools are used during well drilling programs and are usually rented on a daily or
monthly basis.

Note 7 - Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
We apply the accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. This
guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial
statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be
sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. At June 30, 2016 we had a liability for
unrecognized tax benefits of $5.7 million, all of which would favorably impact our effective tax
rate upon recognition, primarily related to foreign operations. At December 31, 2015, we had a
liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $7.8 million, including $3.6 million of benefits which
would favorably impact our effective tax rate upon recognition, primarily related to foreign
operations. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties that could be applied to uncertain tax
positions in periodic income tax expense. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had
approximately $1.6 million and $3.4 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties
related to uncertain tax positions.
Note 8 - Income Tax Benefit/Expense
During the second quarter of 2016 we had income tax benefit of $0.9 million compared to income
tax benefit of $6.9 million during the second quarter of 2015. The income tax benefit in the
second quarter of 2016 was primarily related to the jurisdictional mix of income and loss during
the quarter, along with our continued inability to recognize the benefits associated with certain
losses as a result of valuation allowances. The income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2015
was primarily related to pre-tax losses generated during that period.

6.75% Senior Notes, due July 2022
On January 22, 2014, we issued $360.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior
Notes due 2022 (6.75% Notes) pursuant to an Indenture between the Company and The Bank of
New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Net proceeds from the 6.75% Notes offering
plus a $40.0 million term loan draw under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit
Agreement (2012 Secured Credit Agreement) and cash on hand were utilized to purchase
$416.2 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 9.125% Senior Notes due 2018
pursuant to a tender and consent solicitation offer commenced on January 7, 2014.
The 6.75% Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equal in right of
payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 6.75% Notes are
jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under the
Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement, as amended from time-to-
time (2015 Secured Credit Agreement) and our 7.50% Senior Notes due 2020 (7.50% Notes, and
collectively with the 6.75% Notes, the Senior Notes). Interest on the 6.75% Notes is payable on
January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2014. Debt issuance costs related to the
6.75% Notes of approximately $7.6 million ($5.9 million net of amortization as of June 30, 2016)
are being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method.
At any time prior to January 15, 2017, we may redeem up to 35 percent of the aggregate principal
amount of the 6.75% Notes at a redemption price of 106.75 percent of the principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of certain equity
offerings by us. On and after January 15, 2018, we may redeem all or a part of the 6.75% Notes
upon appropriate notice, at a redemption price of 103.375 percent of the principal amount, and at
redemption prices decreasing each year thereafter to par beginning January 15, 2020. If we
experience certain changes in control, we must offer to repurchase the 6.75% Notes at 101.0
percent of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.
14
The Indenture restricts our ability and the ability of certain subsidiaries to: (i) sell assets, (ii) pay
dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock or
subordinated indebtedness, (iii) make investments, (iv) incur or guarantee additional
indebtedness, (v) create or incur liens, (vi) enter into sale and leaseback transactions, (vii) incur
dividend or other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries, (viii) merge or consolidate with other
entities, (ix) enter into transactions with affiliates, and (x) engage in certain business activities.
Additionally, the Indenture contains certain restrictive covenants designating certain events as
Events of Default. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and
qualifications.
7.50% Senior Notes, due August 2020
On July 30, 2013, we issued $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes
pursuant to an Indenture between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company, N.A., as trustee. Net proceeds from the 7.50% Notes offering were primarily used to
repay the $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of a term loan used to initially finance the
ITS Acquisition, to repay $45.0 million of term loan borrowings under the 2012 Secured Credit
Agreement, and for general corporate purposes.
The 7.50% Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equal in right of
payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 7.50% Notes are
jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under the
2015 Secured Credit Agreement and the 6.75% Notes. Interest on the 7.50% Notes is payable on
February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning February 1, 2014. Debt issuance costs related
to the 7.50% Notes of approximately $5.6 million ($3.6 million, net of amortization as of June 30,
2016) are being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method.
At any time prior to August 1, 2016, we were entitled to redeem up to 35 percent of the aggregate
principal amount of the 7.50% Notes at a redemption price of 107.50 percent of the principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of
certain equity offerings by us. On and after August 1, 2016, we may redeem all or a part of the
7.50% Notes upon appropriate notice, at a redemption price of 103.750 percent of the principal
amount, and at redemption prices decreasing each year thereafter to par beginning August 1,
2018. To date we have not made any redemptions. If we experience certain changes in control,
we must offer to repurchase the 7.50% Notes at 101.0 percent of the aggregate principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.
The Indenture restricts our ability and the ability of certain subsidiaries to: (i) sell assets, (ii) pay
dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock or
subordinated indebtedness, (iii) make investments, (iv) incur or guarantee additional
indebtedness, (v) create or incur liens, (vi) enter into sale and leaseback transactions, (vii) incur
dividend or other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries, (viii) merge or consolidate with other
entities, (ix) enter into transactions with affiliates, and (x) engage in certain business activities.
Additionally, the Indenture contains certain restrictive covenants designating certain events as
Events of Default. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and
qualifications.
2015 Secured Credit Agreement
On January 26, 2015 we entered into the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement, which amended and
restated the 2012 Secured Credit Agreement. The 2015 Secured Credit Agreement was
originally comprised of a $200.0 million revolving credit facility (Revolver) set to mature on
January 26, 2020. On June 1, 2015, we executed the first amendment to the 2015 Secured Credit
Agreement in order to amend certain provisions regarding the definition of “Change of Control.”
On September 29, 2015, we executed the second amendment to the 2015 Secured Credit
Agreement to, among other things, (a) amend certain covenant ratios; (b) increase the Applicable
Rate for certain higher levels of consolidated leverage to a maximum of 4.00 percent per annum
for Eurodollar Rate loans and to 3.00 percent per annum for Base Rate loans; (c) permit multi-
year letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $5.0 million; (d) limit payment prior to
September 30, 2017 of certain restricted payments and certain prepayments of unsecured senior
notes and other specified forms of indebtedness; and (e) remove the option of the Company,
subject to the consent of the lenders, to increase the Credit Agreement up to an additional $75
million. On May 27, 2016, we executed the third amendment to the 2015 Secured Credit
Agreement (the Third Amendment), which reduced availability under the Revolver from $200
million to $100 million. Additionally, among other things, the Third Amendment: (a) eliminates the
Leverage Ratio covenant until the fourth quarter of 2018 when the covenant is reinstated with the
ratio established at 4.25:1.00, and remains at 4.25:1.00 thereafter; (b) eliminates the
Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio covenant until the fourth quarter of 2017 when the
covenant is reinstated with the ratio established at 1.00:1.00 and increases by 0.25 each
subsequent quarter until reaching 2.00:1.00 in the fourth quarter of 2018, and remains at
2.00:1.00 thereafter; (c) immediately increases the maximum permitted Senior Secured Leverage
Ratio from 1.50:1.00 to 2.80:1.00 until it decreases to 2.20:1.00 in the second quarter of 2017, to
1.75:1.00 in the third quarter of 2017, and to 1.50:1.00 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and remains at
1.50:1.00 thereafter; (d) immediately decreases the minimum permitted Asset Coverage Ratio
from 1.25:1.00 to 1.10:1.00 until it increases to 1.25: 1.00 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and
remains at 1.25:1.00 thereafter; (e) requires that, at any time our Consolidated Cash Balance in
U.S. bank accounts is over $50 million, we repay borrowings under the 2015 Secured Credit
Agreement until our Consolidated Cash balance is no more than $50 million or all borrowings
have been repaid, and (f) allows up to $75 million of Junior Lien Debt.
15
At the time the Third Amendment was executed, the remaining debt issuance costs for the 2015
Secured Credit Agreement totaled approximately $2.2 million. Since the Revolver was reduced
by 50 percent, we wrote off approximately $1.1 million in May 2016. We incurred debt issuance
costs relating to the Third Amendment of approximately $0.3 million, bringing total debt issuance
costs to $1.4 million ($1.3 million, net of amortization as of June 30, 2016) which are being
amortized through January 2020, or the term of the Third Amendment, on a straight line basis.
Our obligations under the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of
our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, other than immaterial subsidiaries and subsidiaries
generating revenues primarily outside the United States, each of which has executed guaranty
agreements, and are secured by first priority liens on our accounts receivable, specified rigs
including barge rigs in the GOM and land rigs in Alaska, certain U.S.-based rental equipment of
the Company and its subsidiary guarantors and the equity interests of certain of the Company’s
subsidiaries. The 2015 Secured Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative
covenants, such as limitations on indebtedness, liens, restrictions on entry into certain affiliate
transactions and payments (including payment of dividends) and maintenance of certain ratios
and coverage tests. We were in compliance with all covenants contained in the 2015 Secured
Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2016.
Our Revolver is available for general corporate purposes and to support letters of credit. Interest
on Revolver loans accrues at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Rate or LIBOR plus an Applicable
Rate. Revolving loans are available subject to a quarterly asset coverage ratio calculation based
on the Orderly Liquidation Value of certain specified rigs including barge rigs in the GOM and
land rigs in Alaska, and certain U.S.-based rental equipment of the Company and its subsidiary
guarantors and a percentage of eligible domestic accounts receivable. The $30.0 million draw
outstanding at the closing of the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement was repaid in full during the
first quarter of 2015 with cash on hand. Letters of credit outstanding against the Revolver as of
June 30, 2016 totaled $11.8 million. There were no amounts drawn on the Revolver as of
June 30, 2016.    
Note 10 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Certain of our assets and liabilities are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
For purposes of recording fair value adjustments for certain financial and non-financial assets
and liabilities, and determining fair value disclosures, we estimate fair value at a price that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants in the principal market for the asset or liability.
The fair value measurement and disclosure requirements of FASB Accounting Standards
•
Codification Topic No. 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures (ASC 820) requires inputs
that we categorize using a three-level hierarchy, from highest to lowest level of observable
inputs, as follows:
•Level 1 — Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;
Level 2 — Direct or indirect observable inputs, including quoted prices or other market data, for
similar assets or liabilities in active markets or identical assets or liabilities in less active
markets; and
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that require significant judgment for which there is little or no
market data.
When multiple input levels are required for a valuation, we categorize the entire fair value
measurement according to the lowest level of input that is significant to the entire measurement
even though we may also have utilized significant inputs that are more readily observable. The
amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value.

Fair value of our debt instruments is determined using Level 2 inputs. Fair values and related
carrying values of our debt instruments were as follows for the periods indicated: 
  
Dollars in thousandsCarrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the 2M-Tek Acquisition were recorded at fair
value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Acquisition date fair values represent either Level 2 fair
value measurements (current assets and liabilities, property, plant and equipment) or Level 3 fair
value measurements (intangible assets).
Market conditions could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2, or Level 2
to Level 3. There were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy or any changes in
the valuation techniques used during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  
Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies
We are a party to various lawsuits and claims arising out of the ordinary course of business. We
estimate the range of our liability related to pending litigation when we believe the amount or
range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is
considered probable. When a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no
best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the lawsuits or
claims. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to
our pending litigation and claims and revise our estimates. Due to uncertainties related to the
resolution of lawsuits and claims, the ultimate outcome may differ significantly from our estimates.
In the opinion of management and based on liability accruals provided, our ultimate exposure
with respect to these pending lawsuits and claims is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial position or cash flows, although they could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular reporting period.
Customs Agent and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) Settlement
On April 16, 2013, the Company and the Department of Justice (DOJ) entered into a deferred
prosecution agreement (DPA), under which the DOJ deferred for three years prosecuting the
Company for criminal violations of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA relating to the
Company’s retention and use of an individual agent in Nigeria with respect to certain customs-
related issues, in return for: (i) the Company’s acceptance of responsibility for, and agreement not
to contest or contradict the truthfulness of, the statement of facts and allegations that have been
filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia concurrently with the
DPA; (ii) the Company’s payment of an approximately $11.76 million fine; (iii) the Company’s
reaffirming its commitment to compliance with the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption
laws in connection with the Company’s operations, and continuing cooperation with domestic
and foreign authorities in connection with the matters that are the subject of the DPA; (iv) the
Company’s commitment to continue to address any identified areas for improvement in the
Company’s internal controls, policies and procedures relating to compliance with the FCPA and
other applicable anti-corruption laws if, and to the extent, not already addressed; and (v) the
Company’s agreement to report to the DOJ in writing annually during the term of the DPA
regarding remediation of the matters that are the subject of the DPA, implementation of any
enhanced internal controls, and any evidence of improper payments the Company may have
discovered during the term of the agreement. The DPA provided that as long as the Company
remained in compliance with the terms of the DPA throughout its effective period, the charge
against the Company would be dismissed with prejudice. The Company also settled a related
civil complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The third written annual report
was filed with the DOJ on April 15, 2016, and the term of the DPA expired on April 23, 2016. On
May 20, 2016, the DOJ filed a Motion to Dismiss the case based on its determination that the
Company had complied with all of its obligations under the DPA. On the same date, the Court
entered an Order dismissing with prejudice the United States’ case against the Company. With
the dismissal of the case, the DPA was also terminated.

Note 12 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The objective of
this update is to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities,
and classification on the statement of cash flows. The standard becomes effective for public
companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing the impact of
the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This update establishes
a new lease accounting model for lessees. Upon adoption, a modified retrospective approach is
required for leases that exist, or are entered into, after the beginning of the earliest comparative
period presented. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018,
including interim periods within those fiscal years, although early adoption is permitted. We are in
the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. We have not yet determined the effect of the standard on
our ongoing financial reporting.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This
ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification
605 - Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Codification. The
standard requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and should be applied retrospectively to
each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially
applying the ASU recognized at the date of initial application. ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017. We are in the process of assessing the impact of the
adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We
have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on
our ongoing financial reporting.

Note 13 - Parent, Guarantor, Non-Guarantor Unaudited Consolidating Condensed Financial
Statements
Set forth on the following pages are the consolidating condensed financial statements of Parker
Drilling. The 2015 Secured Credit Agreement and Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, other than
immaterial subsidiaries and subsidiaries generating revenues primarily outside the United
States, subject to the following customary release provisions:
in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that
guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a person that is not (either before or
after giving effect to such transaction) a subsidiary of the Company;
in connection with any sale of such amount of capital stock as would result in such guarantor no
longer being a subsidiary to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such
transaction) a subsidiary of the Company;
if the Company designates any restricted subsidiary that is a guarantor as an unrestricted
subsidiary;
if the guarantee by a guarantor of all other indebtedness of the Company or any other guarantor
is released, terminated or discharged, except by, or as a result of, payment under such
guarantee; or
•upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance (satisfaction and discharge of the indenture).
There are currently no restrictions on the ability of the restricted subsidiaries to transfer funds to
Parker Drilling in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. Parker Drilling is a holding
company with no operations, other than through its subsidiaries. Separate financial statements
for each guarantor company are not provided as the Company complies with Rule 3-10(f) of
Regulation S-X. All guarantor subsidiaries are owned 100 percent by the parent company.
We are providing unaudited consolidating condensed financial information of the parent, Parker
Drilling, the guarantor subsidiaries, and the non-guarantor subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The consolidating condensed financial statements present investments in both
consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting.
Upon the closing of our 2015 Secured Credit Agreement, one of our subsidiaries was released
as a guarantor subsidiary and is now classified as a non-guarantor subsidiary. In accordance
•
with the guidance Topic No. 810, Consolidation (ASC 810), we have retrospectively updated the
unaudited consolidating condensed financial information as of December 31, 2015 and June 30,
2015.

In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “anticipate,”
“believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “outlook,” “may,” “should,” “will” and “would” or
similar words. Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses we
make in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected
future developments and other factors we believe are relevant. Although we believe that our
assumptions are reasonable based on information currently available, those assumptions are
subject to significant risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. The

Executive Overview and Outlook
The oil and gas industry is highly cyclical. Activity levels are driven by traditional energy industry
activity indicators, which include current and expected commodity prices, drilling rig counts,
footage drilled, well counts, and our customers’ spending levels allocated towards exploratory
and development drilling.
Historical market indicators are listed below:

U.S. (land and offshore)
International (2)

(1) Estimate of drilling activity measured by the average active rig count for the periods indicated
- Source: Baker Hughes Incorporated Rig Count
(2) Excludes Canadian Rig Count.
(3) Average daily commodity prices for the periods indicated based on NYMEX front-month
composite energy prices.
The current business environment continues to be challenging despite signs that industry
fundamentals are beginning to improve. Supply and demand dynamics are starting to come into
balance but historic high global inventories persist and will likely act as a headwind against
additional commodity price increases and increased capital spending by our customers in the
near-term.
We anticipate results in our Rental Tools segment to stabilize in the short-term. As of July 15,
2016, U.S. rig count had increased 6 out of 7 weeks and was up over 10% since the low of 404
rigs set on May 27, 2016. Our Rental Tools Tubular Goods Utilization Index declined from 32.5 in
April to 29.7 in May before recovering to 32.0 in June. This was the first increase in the index this
year. While U.S. drilling activity is showing signs of improvement, we do expect further declines
in U.S. offshore activity. Internationally, we expect stabilization in our business as project start-
ups begin in the third quarter. We also anticipate lower operating expenses across the segment.
For our U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling segment, we do not anticipate any material changes in activity
levels at current commodity prices, so we expect to see a continuation of low barge utilization
levels and dayrates. Activity in the inland waters of the Gulf of Mexico remains muted as
operators continue to defer spending due to limited access to capital and uncertainty in
commodity prices.  In the International & Alaska Drilling Segment, we expect activity to remain
low through the second half of 2016 and results to be impacted by lower realized dayrates
attributable to price concessions, more rigs operating in standby mode, and the completion of a
project services engagement.
Although we do not know the depth or duration of this downcycle, we have taken steps to align
resources with the ongoing market downturn by lowering our cost base, sustaining our utilization,
and managing our cash and liquidity. We will continue to adjust and adapt to the business
environment and market conditions, while remaining opportunistic and positioning the Company
for longer-term growth.

Results of Operations
Our business is comprised of two business lines: (1) Drilling Services and (2) Rental Tools
Services. We report our Rental Tools Services business as one reportable segment (Rental
Tools) and report our Drilling Services business as two reportable segments: (1) U.S. (Lower 48)
Drilling and (2) International & Alaska Drilling. We eliminate inter-segment revenues and
expenses.
We analyze financial results for each of our reportable segments. The reportable segments
presented are consistent with our reportable segments discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated
condensed financial statements. We monitor our reporting segments based on several criteria,
including operating gross margin and operating gross margin excluding depreciation and
amortization. Operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization is computed as
revenues less direct operating expenses, and excludes depreciation and amortization expense,
where applicable. Operating gross margin percentages are computed as operating gross margin
as a percent of revenues. The operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization
amounts and percentages should not be used as a substitute for those amounts reported under
accounting policies generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), but should be viewed
in addition to the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Management believes this information may provide additional, meaningful comparisons between
current results and results of prior periods to users of this financial information.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
Revenues decreased $80.6 million, or 43.4 percent, to $105.3 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 as compared to revenues of $185.9 million for the three months ended June 30,
2015. Operating gross margin decreased $24.2 million, to a loss of $20.2 million, for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to income of $4.0 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015.

The number of rigs available for service is determined by calculating the number of days each
rig was in our fleet and was under contract or available for contract. For example, a rig under
contract or available for contract for six months of a year is 0.5 rigs available for service during
such year. Our method of computation of rigs available for service may not be comparable to
other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Rig utilization rates are based on a weighted average basis assuming total days availability
for all rigs available for service. Rigs acquired or disposed of are treated as added to or
removed from the rig fleet as of the date of acquisition or disposal. Rigs that are in operation or
fully or partially staffed and on a revenue-producing standby status are considered to be
utilized. Rigs under contract that generate revenues during moves between locations or during
mobilization or demobilization are also considered to be utilized. Our method of computation
of rig utilization may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Drilling Services Business Line
U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling
U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling segment revenues decreased $5.7 million, or 83.8 percent, to $1.1
million for the second quarter of 2016 compared with revenues of $6.8 million for the second
quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower utilization driven by substantial
reductions in drilling activity by operators in the inland waters of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM)
resulting from lower oil prices. Utilization declined to 5.0 percent for the quarter ended June 30,
2016 from 14.0 percent for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, resulting in a $2.8 million decrease
in revenue. The remainder of the decrease in revenue was primarily driven by a decrease of $2.5
million from our O&M contract supporting three platform operations located offshore California, as
the O&M contract ended during the 2015 fourth quarter.
U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling segment operating gross margin excluding depreciation and
amortization decreased $1.9 million to a loss of $3.9 million for the second quarter of 2016
compared to a loss of $2.0 million for the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily
due to the decline in utilization and the ending of the O&M contract discussed above.
International & Alaska Drilling
International & Alaska Drilling segment revenues decreased $43.1 million, or 37.5 percent, to
$71.9 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared with $115.0 million for the second quarter
of 2015.
The decrease in revenues was primarily due to the following:
a decrease of $13.2 million resulting from decreased utilization for Company-owned rigs driven
by the decline in oil prices resulting in reduced customer activity. Utilization for the segment
decreased to 41.0 percent for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 from 61.0 percent for the quarter
ended June 30, 2015;
a decrease of $14.0 million driven by a decline in revenues per day resulting from certain
Company-owned and customer-owned rigs shifting to standby mode during the second quarter
of 2016 compared to operating mode during the second quarter of 2015, as well as a reduction
•
•
•
in average dayrates due to pricing pressures from customers resulting from the decline in oil
prices; and
a decrease in reimbursable revenues of $10.1 million, which decreased revenues but had a
minimal impact on operating margins.
International & Alaska Drilling segment operating gross margin excluding depreciation and
amortization decreased $4.8 million, or 21.2 percent, to $17.8 million for the second quarter of
2016 compared with $22.6 million for the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in operating
gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the impact of reduced
utilization and reduced revenues discussed above.
Rental Tools Services Business Line
Rental Tools segment revenues decreased $31.8 million, or 49.6 percent, to $32.3 million for the
second quarter of 2016 compared with $64.1 million for the second quarter of 2015. The
decrease was due to a $17.4 million decrease in our U.S. revenues and a $14.4 million decrease
in our international revenues. The decreases were primarily attributable to the continued
reduction in customer activity and pricing pressures resulting from lower oil prices.
Rental Tools segment operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization
decreased $19.5 million, or 89.9 percent, to $2.2 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared
with $21.7 million for the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in operating gross margin
excluding depreciation and amortization primarily consists of a $9.8 million decrease for our U.S.
operations and a $9.7 million decrease for our international operations. In both cases the
decrease was due to the declines in oil prices and customer activity discussed above, partially
offset by lower operating costs resulting from cost reduction efforts.
Other Financial Data
General and administrative expense
General and administration expense decreased $1.5 million to $8.0 million for the second quarter
of 2016, compared with $9.5 million for the second quarter of 2015 primarily due to reduced
personnel costs resulting from cost savings initiatives.
35
Provision for reduction in carrying value of certain assets
There was no provision for reduction in carrying value of certain assets recorded during the
second quarter of 2016 compared to a $2.3 million provision for reduction in carrying value
recorded during the second quarter of 2015 related to certain international rental tools and drilling
rigs. Management concluded that due to changing market conditions the rigs were no longer
marketable and the carrying value of the rigs and equipment was no longer recoverable.
Gain/loss on disposition of assets
Net losses recognized on asset dispositions were nominal for the second quarters of 2016 and
2015, respectively. Activity in both periods included the results of asset sales. We periodically
sell equipment deemed to be excess, obsolete, or not currently required for operations.
Interest income and expense
Interest expense increased $0.8 million to $12.2 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared
with $11.4 million for the second quarter of 2015. The increase in interest expense was primarily
related to write off of $1.1 million of debt issuance costs during the second quarter of 2016 in
conjunction with the execution of the Third Amendment to the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement
on May 27, 2016, which resulted in the reduction of our Revolver by 50 percent. This increase
was partially offset by $0.3 million of accretion of contingent consideration recorded in the
second quarter of 2015 that did not recur in the second quarter of 2016, as the contingent
consideration had been fully paid as of April 2016. Interest income during each of the 2016 and
2015 second quarters was nominal.
Other income and expense
Other expense was $0.4 million and $1.5 million for the second quarters of 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Other expense for the second quarters of 2016 and 2015 included the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations. Other expense for the second quarter of 2015 also included a loss
on divestiture of our controlling interest in a consolidated joint venture.
Income tax expense (benefit)
During the second quarter of 2016 we had income tax benefit of $0.9 million compared to a tax
benefit of $6.9 million during the second quarter of 2015. The income tax benefit in the second
quarter of 2016 was primarily related to the jurisdictional mix of income and loss during the
quarter along with our continued inability to recognize the benefits associated with certain losses
as a result of valuation allowances. The income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2015 was
primarily related to pre-tax losses generated during that period.

Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Revenues decreased $154.2 million, or 39.5 percent, to $235.8 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 as compared to revenues of $390.0 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015. Operating gross margin decreased $62.0 million, or 219.1 percent, to a loss of $33.7
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to income of $28.3 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2015.

The number of rigs available for service is determined by calculating the number of days each
rig was in our fleet and was under contract or available for contract. For example, a rig under
contract or available for contract for six months of a year is 0.5 rigs available for service during
such year. Our method of computation of rigs available for service may not be comparable to
other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Rig utilization rates are based on a weighted average basis assuming total days availability
for all rigs available for service. Rigs acquired or disposed of are treated as added to or
removed from the rig fleet as of the date of acquisition or disposal. Rigs that are in operation or
fully or partially staffed and on a revenue-producing standby status are considered to be
utilized. Rigs under contract that generate revenues during moves between locations or during
mobilization or demobilization are also considered to be utilized. Our method of computation
of rig utilization may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
Drilling Services Business Line
U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling
U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling segment revenues decreased $17.7 million, or 84.7 percent, to $3.2
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared with revenues of $20.9 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower utilization driven by
substantial reductions in drilling activity by operators in the inland waters of the GOM resulting
from lower oil prices. Utilization declined to 6.0 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2016
from 17.0 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2015, resulting in a $9.0 million decrease in
revenue. The remainder of the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by a decrease of $6.7
million from our O&M contract supporting three platform operations located offshore California, as
the O&M contract ended during the 2015 fourth quarter.
U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling segment operating gross margin excluding depreciation and
amortization decreased $5.3 million to a loss of $7.2 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared with a loss of $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease
was primarily due to the decline in utilization and the ending of the O&M contract discussed
above.
International & Alaska Drilling
International & Alaska Drilling segment revenues decreased $68.4 million, or 29.9 percent, to
$160.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared with $228.9 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2015.
The decrease in revenues was primarily due to the following:
38
•
•
a decrease of $31.8 resulting from decreased utilization for Company-owned rigs driven by the
decline in oil prices resulting in reduced customer activity. Utilization for the segment decreased
to 44.0 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from 66.0 percent for the six months
ended June 30, 2015;
a decrease of $19.9 million driven by a decline in revenues per day resulting from certain
Company-owned and customer-owned rigs shifting to standby mode during the second quarter
of 2016 compared to operating mode during the second quarter of 2015, as well as a reduction
in average dayrates due to pricing pressures from customers resulting from the decline in oil
prices;
•a decrease in reimbursable revenues of $10.1 million, which decreased revenues but had a
minimal impact on operating margins; and
•a decrease of $8.9 million of revenues earned from mobilization and demobilization activities.
The decrease in revenues was partially offset by an increase of $5.1 million of revenues
generated from our project service activities.
International & Alaska Drilling segment operating gross margin excluding depreciation and
amortization decreased $21.3 million, or 36.7 percent, to $36.7 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared with $58.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The
decrease in operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization was primarily due to
the impact of reduced utilization and revenues discussed above.
Rental Tools Services Business Line
Rental Tools segment revenues decreased $68.1 million, or 48.6 percent, to $72.1 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 compared with $140.2 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015. The decrease was due to a $40.7 million decrease in our U.S. revenues and a $27.4
million decrease in our international revenues. The decreases were primarily attributable to the
continued reduction in customer activity and pricing pressures resulting from lower oil prices.
Rental Tools segment operating gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization
decreased $42.0 million, or 82.4 percent, to $9.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared with $51.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in operating
gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization primarily consists of a $23.6 million
decrease for our U.S. operations and an $18.4 million decrease for our international operations.
In both cases the decrease was due to the declines in oil prices and customer activity discussed
above, partially offset by lower operating costs resulting from cost reduction efforts.
Other Financial Data
General and administrative expense
General and administration expense decreased $2.5 million to $17.8 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016, compared with $20.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
General and administrative expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 benefited from cost
savings initiatives, while general and administrative expense for the six months ended June 30,
2015 was higher primarily due to increased expenses as we implemented the second phase of
our new enterprise resource planning system.
Provision for reduction in carrying value of certain assets
There was no provision for reduction in carrying value of certain assets recorded during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a $2.3 million provision for reduction in carrying value
recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2015 related to certain international rental tools
and drilling rigs. Management concluded that due to changing market conditions the rigs were no
longer marketable and the carrying value of the rigs and equipment was no longer recoverable.
Gain/loss on disposition of assets
Net losses recognized on asset dispositions were $0.1 million during the six months ended June
30, 2016, compared with net gains of $2.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Activity in both periods included the result of asset sales; however, the net gains for the six
months ended June 30, 2015 were primarily due to an insurance settlement received during the
quarter related to previously realized asset losses. Additionally, we periodically sell equipment
deemed to be excess, obsolete, or not currently required for operations.
39
Interest income and expense
Interest expense increased $1.2 million to $23.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared with $22.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest
expense was primarily related to write off of $1.1 million of debt issuance costs during the second
quarter of 2016 in conjunction with the execution of the Third Amendment to the 2015 Secured
Credit Agreement on May 27, 2016, which resulted in the reduction of our Revolver by 50
percent. Interest income during each of the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was
nominal.
Other income and expense
Other income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $2.1 million compared with other
expense for the six months ended June 30, 2015 of $2.9 million. Other income for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to a reclassification of $1.9 million of realized
foreign currency translation gains from accumulated other comprehensive income and the
settlement of certain legal claims, resulting in other income of $0.6 million. Other expense for the
six months ended June 30, 2015 was primarily driven by losses related to foreign currency
fluctuations and a loss on divestiture of our controlling interest in a consolidated joint venture.
Income tax expense (benefit)
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 we had income tax expense of $62.6 million
compared to a tax benefit of $7.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Despite the
pre-tax operating loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized income tax
expense as a result of recording a valuation allowance in the first quarter of $73.1 million against
our U.S. domestic deferred tax assets, which primarily consist of U.S. federal net operating
losses.  We established the valuation allowance based on the weight of positive and negative
evidence available, including the recent and current results of operations which reflect continued
degradation in market activity and including the increased contractual uncertainty materializing
during the period in the U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. In order to determine the need for
a valuation allowance, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding events occurring
during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Changes in these estimates and assumptions,
including changes in tax laws and other changes impacting our ability to recognize the
underlying deferred tax assets, may require us to adjust the valuation allowances in the future.
The income tax benefit in the six months ended June 30, 2015 was primarily related to pre-tax
losses generated during that period.
Backlog
Backlog is our estimate of the dollar amount of revenues we expect to realize in the future as a
result of executing awarded contracts. The Company’s backlog of firm orders was approximately
$446 million at June 30, 2016 and $438 million at June 30, 2015 and is primarily attributable to
the International & Alaska segment of our Drilling Services business. We estimate that, as of
June 30, 2016, 18 percent of our backlog will be recognized as revenues within the fiscal year.
The amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned
could be different from amounts disclosed in our backlog calculations due to a lack of
predictability of various factors, including unscheduled repairs, maintenance requirements,
weather delays, contract terminations or renegotiations, new contracts and other factors. See
“Our backlog of contracted revenue may not be fully realized and may reduce significantly in the
future, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows” in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2015 Form 10-K.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of resources in
view of expansion plans, debt service requirements, and other operational cash needs. To meet
our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, including payment of operating expenses and
repaying debt, we rely primarily on cash from operations. We also have access to cash through
the Revolver, subject to our compliance with the covenants contained in the 2015 Secured Credit
Agreement. We expect that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to provide us the ability to
fund our operations, provide the working capital necessary to support our strategy, and fund
planned capital expenditures. When determined appropriate we may seek to raise additional
capital in the future. We do not pay dividends to our shareholders.
Liquidity

Total liquidity
(1) As of June 30, 2016, approximately $41.7 million of the $109.0 million of cash and

(2) Availability under the Revolver included $100 million undrawn portion of our Revolver less
$11.8 million of letters of credit outstanding. In order to access the 2015 Revolver, we must be in
compliance with the covenants contained in the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement.
The earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016 were reinvested to fund our
international operations.  If in the future we decide to repatriate earnings to the United States, the
Company may be required to pay taxes on these amounts based on applicable United States tax
law, which would reduce the liquidity of the Company at that time.
We do not have any unconsolidated special-purpose entities, off-balance sheet financing
arrangements or guarantees of third-party financial obligations. As of June 30, 2016, we have no
energy, commodity, or foreign currency derivative contracts.
Cash Flow Activity
As of June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $109.0 million, a decrease of $25.3
million from cash and cash equivalents of $134.3 million at December 31, 2015. The following

Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities were a source of $0.6 million for the six months ended June
30, 2016 compared to a source of $103.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Cash
flows from operating activities in each period were largely impacted by our earnings and changes
in working capital. Changes in working capital were a source of cash of $8.5 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a source of cash of $45.9 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. In addition to the impact of earnings and working capital changes cash

)
flows from operating activities in each period were impacted by non-cash charges such as
depreciation expense, gains on asset sales, deferred tax benefit, stock compensation expense,
debt modification and amortization of debt issuance costs.
Over the past few years we have reinvested a substantial portion of our operating cash flows to
enhance our fleet of drilling rigs and our rental tools equipment inventory. It is our long term
intention to utilize our operating cash flows to fund
41
maintenance and growth of our rental tool assets and drilling rigs; however, given the decline in
demand in the current oil and natural gas services market, our short-term focus is to preserve
liquidity by managing our costs and capital expenditures.
Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities were a use of $14.9 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared with a use of $62.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Our primary
use of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $16.3 million and $54.6
million, respectively, for capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in each period were primarily
for tubular and other products for our Rental Tools Services business and rig-related
maintenance. During the six months ended June 30, 2015 we had a use of cash of $10.4 million,
net of cash acquired, in connection with the 2M-Tek Acquisition.
Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing activities were a use of $11.0 million for the six months ended June
30, 2016, primarily due to the payment of $6.0 million of the contingent consideration related to
the 2M-Tek Acquisition. The payment was made upon the achievement of certain milestones
during the first and second quarters of 2016. In addition, during the six months ended June 30,
2016, we had a use of cash of $3.4 million in connection with the final payment of the purchase
price for the remaining noncontrolling interest of ITS Arabia Limited. Cash flows from financing
activities were a use of $32.4 million for the 2015 comparable period, primarily driven by the
repayment of the $30.0 million balance on a term loan in the first quarter of 2015.
Long-Term Debt Summary
Our principal amount of long-term debt, including current portion, was $575.5 million as of
June 30, 2016 which consisted of:
•$360.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Notes; and
•$225.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.50% Notes; less
•$9.5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs
6.75% Senior Notes, due July 2022
On January 22, 2014, we issued $360.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior
Notes due 2022 (6.75% Notes) pursuant to an Indenture between the Company and The Bank of
New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Net proceeds from the 6.75% Notes offering
plus a $40.0 million term loan draw under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit
Agreement (2012 Secured Credit Agreement) and cash on hand were utilized to purchase
$416.2 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 9.125% Senior Notes due 2018
pursuant to a tender and consent solicitation offer commenced on January 7, 2014.
The 6.75% Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equal in right of
payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 6.75% Notes are
jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under the
Second Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement, as amended from time-to-
time (2015 Secured Credit Agreement) and our 7.50% Senior Notes due 2020 (7.50% Notes, and
collectively with the 6.75% Notes, the Senior Notes). Interest on the 6.75% Notes is payable on
January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2014. Debt issuance costs related to the
6.75% Notes of approximately $7.6 million ($5.9 million net of amortization as of June 30, 2016)
are being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method.
At any time prior to January 15, 2017, we may redeem up to 35 percent of the aggregate principal
amount of the 6.75% Notes at a redemption price of 106.75 percent of the principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of certain equity
offerings by us. On and after January 15, 2018, we may redeem all or a part of the 6.75% Notes
upon appropriate notice, at a redemption price of 103.375 percent of the principal amount, and at
redemption prices decreasing each year thereafter to par beginning January 15, 2020. If we
experience certain changes in control, we must offer to repurchase the 6.75% Notes at 101.0
percent of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.
The Indenture restricts our ability and the ability of certain subsidiaries to: (i) sell assets, (ii) pay
dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock or
subordinated indebtedness, (iii) make investments, (iv) incur or guarantee additional
indebtedness, (v) create or incur liens, (vi) enter into sale and leaseback transactions, (vii) incur
dividend or other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries, (viii) merge or consolidate with other

7.50% Senior Notes, due August 2020
On July 30, 2013, we issued $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes
pursuant to an Indenture between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company, N.A., as trustee. Net proceeds from the 7.50% Notes offering were primarily used to
repay the $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of a term loan used to initially finance the
ITS Acquisition, to repay $45.0 million of term loan borrowings under the 2012 Secured Credit
Agreement, and for general corporate purposes.
The 7.50% Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equal in right of
payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The 7.50% Notes are
jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under the
2015 Secured Credit Agreement and the 6.75% Notes. Interest on the 7.50% Notes is payable on
February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning February 1, 2014. Debt issuance costs related
to the 7.50% Notes of approximately $5.6 million ($3.6 million, net of amortization as of June 30,
2016) are being amortized over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method.
At any time prior to August 1, 2016, we were entitled to redeem up to 35 percent of the aggregate
principal amount of the 7.50% Notes at a redemption price of 107.50 percent of the principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of
certain equity offerings by us. On and after August 1, 2016, we may redeem all or a part of the
7.50% Notes upon appropriate notice, at a redemption price of 103.750 percent of the principal
amount, and at redemption prices decreasing each year thereafter to par beginning August 1,
2018. To date we have not made any redemptions. If we experience certain changes in control,
we must offer to repurchase the 7.50% Notes at 101.0 percent of the aggregate principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.
The Indenture restricts our ability and the ability of certain subsidiaries to: (i) sell assets, (ii) pay
dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock or
subordinated indebtedness, (iii) make investments, (iv) incur or guarantee additional
indebtedness, (v) create or incur liens, (vi) enter into sale and leaseback transactions, (vii) incur
dividend or other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries, (viii) merge or consolidate with other
entities, (ix) enter into transactions with affiliates, and (x) engage in certain business activities.
Additionally, the Indenture contains certain restrictive covenants designating certain events as
Events of Default. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and
qualifications.
2015 Secured Credit Agreement
On January 26, 2015 we entered into the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement, which amended and
restated the 2012 Secured Credit Agreement. The 2015 Secured Credit Agreement was
originally comprised of a $200.0 million revolving credit facility (Revolver) set to mature on
January 26, 2020. On June 1, 2015, we executed the first amendment to the 2015 Secured Credit
Agreement in order to amend certain provisions regarding the definition of “Change of Control.”
On September 29, 2015, we executed the second amendment to the 2015 Secured Credit
Agreement to, among other things, (a) amend certain covenant ratios; (b) increase the Applicable
Rate for certain higher levels of consolidated leverage to a maximum of 4.00 percent per annum
for Eurodollar Rate loans and to 3.00 percent per annum for Base Rate loans; (c) permit multi-
year letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $5.0 million; (d) limit payment prior to
September 30, 2017 of certain restricted payments and certain prepayments of unsecured senior
notes and other specified forms of indebtedness; and (e) remove the option of the Company,
subject to the consent of the lenders, to increase the Credit Agreement up to an additional $75
million. On May 27, 2016, we executed the third amendment to the 2015 Secured Credit
Agreement (the Third Amendment), which reduced availability under the Revolver from $200
million to $100 million. Additionally, among other things, the Third Amendment: (a) eliminates the
Leverage Ratio covenant until the fourth quarter of 2018 when the covenant is reinstated with the
ratio established at 4.25:1.00, and remains at 4.25:1.00 thereafter; (b) eliminates the
Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio covenant until the fourth quarter of 2017 when the
covenant is reinstated with the ratio established at 1.00:1.00 and increases by 0.25 each
subsequent quarter until reaching 2.00:1.00 in the fourth quarter of 2018, and remains at
2.00:1.00 thereafter; (c) immediately increases the maximum permitted Senior Secured Leverage
Ratio from 1.50:1.00 to 2.80:1.00 until it decreases to 2.20:1.00 in the second quarter of 2017, to
1.75:1.00 in the third quarter of 2017, and to 1.50:1.00 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and remains at
1.50:1.00 thereafter; (d) immediately decreases the minimum permitted Asset Coverage Ratio
from 1.25:1.00 to 1.10:1.00 until it increases to 1.25: 1.00 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and
remains at 1.25:1.00 thereafter; (e) requires that, at any time our Consolidated Cash Balance in
U.S. bank accounts is over $50 million, we repay borrowings under the 2015 Secured Credit
Agreement until our Consolidated Cash balance is no more than $50 million or all borrowings
have been repaid, and (f) allows up to $75 million of Junior Lien Debt.
At the time the Third Amendment was executed, the remaining debt issuance costs for the 2015
Secured Credit Agreement totaled approximately $2.2 million. Since the Revolver was reduced
by 50 percent, we wrote off approximately $1.1 million in May 2016. We incurred debt issuance
costs relating to the Third Amendment of approximately $0.3 million, bringing total debt issuance
costs to $1.4 million ($1.3 million, net of amortization as of June 30, 2016) which are being
amortized through January 2020, or the term of the Third Amendment, on a straight line basis.
43
Our obligations under the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of
our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, other than immaterial subsidiaries and subsidiaries
generating revenues primarily outside the United States, each of which has executed guaranty
agreements, and are secured by first priority liens on our accounts receivable, specified rigs
including barge rigs in the GOM and land rigs in Alaska, certain U.S.-based rental equipment of
the Company and its subsidiary guarantors and the equity interests of certain of the Company’s
subsidiaries. The 2015 Secured Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative
covenants, such as limitations on indebtedness, liens, restrictions on entry into certain affiliate
transactions and payments (including payment of dividends) and maintenance of certain ratios
and coverage tests. We were in compliance with all covenants contained in the 2015 Secured
Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2016.
Our Revolver is available for general corporate purposes and to support letters of credit. Interest
on Revolver loans accrues at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Rate or LIBOR plus an Applicable
Rate. Revolving loans are available subject to a quarterly asset coverage ratio calculation based
on the Orderly Liquidation Value of certain specified rigs including barge rigs in the GOM and
land rigs in Alaska, and certain U.S.-based rental equipment of the Company and its subsidiary
guarantors and a percentage of eligible domestic accounts receivable. The $30.0 million draw
outstanding at the closing of the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement was repaid in full during the
first quarter of 2015 with cash on hand. Letters of credit outstanding against the Revolver as of
June 30, 2016 totaled $11.8 million. There were no amounts drawn on the Revolver as of
June 30, 2016.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
