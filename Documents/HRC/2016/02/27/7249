<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its twenty-second session from 4 to 
</p>
<p>15 May 2015. The review of the Marshall Islands was held at the 12th meeting, on 11 May 
</p>
<p>2015. The delegation of the Marshall Islands was headed by the Minister for Foreign 
</p>
<p>Affairs, Tony A. deBrum. At its 17th meeting, held on 15 May 2015, the Working Group 
</p>
<p>adopted the report on the Marshall Islands. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the Marshall Islands: China, Congo and 
</p>
<p>Mexico. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following 
</p>
<p>documents were issued for the review of the Marshall Islands: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report (A/HRC/WG.6/22/MHL/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) (A/HRC/WG.6/22/MHL/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR (A/HRC/WG.6/22/MHL/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Germany, Liechtenstein, 
</p>
<p>Mexico, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
</p>
<p>was transmitted to the Marshall Islands through the troika. These questions are available on 
</p>
<p>the extranet of the Working Group 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of the Marshall Islands thanked OHCHR, the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>and the Working Group of the Universal Periodic Review for allowing the Marshall Islands 
</p>
<p>to present its second report on its human rights situation. The delegation also thanked the 
</p>
<p>Regional Rights Resource Team of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, the Pacific 
</p>
<p>Islands Forum Secretariat and their bilateral partners for assistance in the preparations 
</p>
<p>leading up to the submission of the report of the Marshall Islands as well as their 
</p>
<p>participation before the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>6. The Marshall Islands stated that with a population of roughly over 60,000 people, it 
</p>
<p>consisted of low-lying coral atolls (29) and islands (5) in the central Pacific with a total 
</p>
<p>land area of approximately 181 km
2
 scattered over an exclusive economic zone of 2 million 
</p>
<p>km
2
 of ocean.  
</p>
<p>7. The Marshall Islands emphasized that after the Second World War it was 
</p>
<p>administered by the United States of America as a United Nations-mandated Trust Territory 
</p>
<p>of the Pacific Islands. During that period, the United States had detonated in the country, 
</p>
<p>namely the atolls of Bikini and Enewetak, 67 atmospheric, land and underwater atomic and 
</p>
<p>thermonuclear weapons from 1946 to 1958, or the equivalent of 1.6 Hiroshima bombs 
</p>
<p>every single day during the 12 years of the United States Nuclear Testing Program. Such 
</p>
<p>was the legacy of the United States, and to the present day outstanding issues arising from 
</p>
<p>the Program were yet to be resolved. The Marshall Islands adopted its Constitution in 1979 </p>


<p><b>4</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p>and on 21 October 1986 entered into the Compact of Free Association with the United 
</p>
<p>States. An amended version of the Compact was signed in 2003.  
</p>
<p>8. The Marshall Islands stated that it had made important strides since its first universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review in 2010. In addition to being party to the Convention on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women, it was now party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Prior to accession to the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, consultations had taken place to develop the 
</p>
<p>National Policy on Disability Inclusive Development, which was approved by the &#8220;Nitijela&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(Parliament) in late 2014. The Policy was developed in line with the Convention, the 
</p>
<p>Pacific Regional Strategy on Disability and the Incheon Strategy to &#8220;Make the Right Real&#8221; 
for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the Pacific. Subsequent to acceding to the 
</p>
<p>Convention, the Marshall Islands drafted a bill on the rights of persons with disabilities, 
</p>
<p>which was before the Nitijela. The country received technical assistance from the Economic 
</p>
<p>and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and 
</p>
<p>the Pacific Disability Forum throughout the entire process. 
</p>
<p>9. With respect to the other core human rights treaties and existing optional protocols, 
</p>
<p>the Cabinet had approved the accession of the Marshall Islands to those treaties and 
</p>
<p>optional protocols subject to constitutional processes. Given its limited resources, the 
</p>
<p>country had to be careful not only to accede to those important treaties and protocols, but 
</p>
<p>also to apply them to domestic law in order to ensure proper implementation. 
</p>
<p>10. The Marshall Islands reported that the Nitijela had enacted a number of laws that 
</p>
<p>supported the Bill of Rights and criminalized any violations thereof, particularly the 
</p>
<p>Domestic Violence Prevention and Protection Act 2011, an updated Criminal Code 2011 
</p>
<p>and the Marshall Islands Public School System Act 2013. Also before the Nitijela, in 
</p>
<p>addition to the bill on the rights of persons with disabilities, were two bills, one on child 
</p>
<p>protection and the other on the human rights commission. The latter would codify the 
</p>
<p>Resource Development Committee and its monitoring and implementation responsibilities 
</p>
<p>with respect to human rights. 
</p>
<p>11. Furthermore, and in addition to the National Policy on Disability Inclusive 
</p>
<p>Development, the Marshall Islands stressed that it had developed the National Strategic 
</p>
<p>Plan, with technical assistance from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 
</p>
<p>The Plan covered the period from 2015 to 2017 and would continually be updated in three-
</p>
<p>year increments so as to meet longer-term objectives which would be achieved in 
</p>
<p>five sectors: social development; the environment, climate change and resiliency; 
</p>
<p>infrastructure development; sustainable economic development; and good governance.  
</p>
<p>12. The Marshall Islands added that the Cabinet had recently adopted a number of 
</p>
<p>important gender-inclusive national policies, including the Gender Equality Policy, the 
</p>
<p>aforementioned National Strategic Plan, the National Climate Change Policy Framework 
</p>
<p>and the National Energy Policy. They all incorporated goals and outcomes for gender 
</p>
<p>equality and the advancement of women, and called for the development of gender-
</p>
<p>sensitive strategies for climate change responses and the advancement of women in 
</p>
<p>decision-making and economic empowerment. 
</p>
<p>13. Regarding violence against women, the Marshall Islands indicated that the Nitijela 
</p>
<p>had passed the Domestic Violence Prevention and Protection Act 2011 after several years 
</p>
<p>of work by several non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including Women United 
</p>
<p>Together Marshall Islands. The Domestic Violence Prevention and Protection Task Force 
</p>
<p>was established in 2012, as an attachment to the Secretary of Internal Affairs, to ensure the 
</p>
<p>law was implemented, make recommendations, pool resources and lobby for the Nitijela to 
</p>
<p>provide financial support from the Ministry of Internal Affairs&#8217; recurrent budget. To further </p>


<p>help the work of eliminating domestic violence, the Government submitted an application 
</p>
<p>to a United Nations trust fund and was awarded US$ 372,000 for the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Act for three years according to the Act&#8217;s costing table developed by UNDP. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>development of a family health study survey, with assistance from the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Population Fund (UNFPA), began in 2012; the survey was projected to be launched later in 
</p>
<p>2015. One of the recommendations arising from the exercise was to improve administrative 
</p>
<p>data collection and analysis with regard to health, justice, education and social services. 
</p>
<p>That would strengthen the referral system among essential services while allowing the 
</p>
<p>country to carry out its analysis of the services to ensure that they were responding to the 
</p>
<p>high prevalence rates of violence against women recorded in the survey, and make policy 
</p>
<p>and programme reform where administrative reporting was low. The Marshall Islands 
</p>
<p>stated that it urgently needed international assistance at the grass-roots and local levels to 
</p>
<p>better achieve visible elimination of  domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>14. Other policies had been developed in the Marshall Islands, namely the National 
</p>
<p>Youth Policy (2009&#8211;2014), with assistance from NGOs and regional development partners; 
</p>
<p>the National Reproductive Health Policy/Strategy (2014&#8211;2016), with assistance from the 
</p>
<p>UNFPA Pacific Subregional Office; the Country Prevention of Adolescent Pregnancy: A 
</p>
<p>Three-Year Strategy (2014&#8211;2016), with assistance from UNFPA; and the Marshallese Joint 
</p>
<p>National Plan for Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management (2014&#8211;2018), 
</p>
<p>with help from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community Applied Geoscience and 
</p>
<p>Technology Division, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme and 
</p>
<p>UNDP. The delegation thanked those international and regional partners, and asked for 
</p>
<p>their continued support. 
</p>
<p>15. The Marshall Islands emphasized that those accomplishments had been made while 
</p>
<p>it continued to face the challenges of climate change and the lingering effects of the United 
</p>
<p>States Nuclear Testing Program. The country had been outspoken in seeking to address the 
</p>
<p>human rights dimension of climate change, including in early 2009, when it told the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council in a formal report that climate risks would seriously threaten nearly each 
</p>
<p>and every core human right sector, including the right to statehood for the entire nation. In 
</p>
<p>2013, the country led efforts for the Pacific Islands Forum leaders to adopt the Majuro 
</p>
<p>Declaration for Climate Leadership, which set forward national commitments to reduce 
</p>
<p>emissions. That principle &#8212; that every nation, large and small, rich and poor, commit to 
</p>
<p>action &#8212; had helped change multilateral politics. The country was also working very hard 
</p>
<p>to secure a strong and practical post-2020 climate agreement in Paris, but the Paris 
</p>
<p>agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was very 
</p>
<p>likely to leave serious exposure to human rights risks. 
</p>
<p>16. The Marshall Islands also emphasized that impacts of climate change on local 
</p>
<p>communities continued to worsen; a recent drought had affected a quarter of the nation and 
</p>
<p>necessitated the serious involvement of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
</p>
<p>Affairs of the United Nations. Unusually strong king tides and coastal flooding had 
</p>
<p>devastated local communities. That was also an issue shared in the wider Pacific region as 
</p>
<p>seen when the Federated States of Micronesia and Vanuatu suffered from the recent 
</p>
<p>hurricanes. While natural events had always occurred in small islands, it was irrefutable 
</p>
<p>that there were climate drivers and that the scale and intensity of their impact were 
</p>
<p>increasing. 
</p>
<p>17. The Marshall Islands highlighted the fact that the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of 
</p>
<p>hazardous substances and wastes visited the Marshall Islands from 27 to 30 March 2012 
</p>
<p>and the United States from 24 to 27 April 2012 to assess the impact on human rights of the 
</p>
<p>Nuclear Testing Program conducted in the Marshall Islands by the United States from 1946 
</p>
<p>to 1958. One of the issues identified in his report was the limited access to information </p>


<p><b>6</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p>relating to the Program. Many of the historical documents provided to the Marshall Islands 
</p>
<p>were incomplete and in &#8220;deleted version only&#8221; form and labelled as &#8220;extracted, redacted or 
</p>
<p>sanitized&#8221; with information of an unknown nature and the volume removed. Following the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report, the country had as recently as 27 April 2015 been trying to 
</p>
<p>gain access to that information but to no avail. The repeated failure or refusal of the United 
</p>
<p>States to provide full access to those records could only be taken as a blatant indignity 
</p>
<p>towards and lack of respect for the Marshallese people and represented an ongoing 
</p>
<p>violation of basic human rights. 
</p>
<p>18. Despite those challenges and other constraints, such as human and financial 
</p>
<p>resources, the delegation stated that the Marshall Islands continued to do its outmost to 
</p>
<p>address recommendations from the first universal periodic review to improve the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>capacity to address human rights issues. As it had in 2010, the Marshall Islands once again 
</p>
<p>requested the kind assistance of the international community for the following: 
</p>
<p>(a) Technical and financial assistance for capacity-building of public servants 
</p>
<p>and government-elected officials with respect to implementation of human rights in the 
</p>
<p>country; 
</p>
<p>(b) Technical and financial assistance in improving public awareness 
</p>
<p>programmes of both the Government and NGOs with respect to the human rights of the 
</p>
<p>Marshallese people;  
</p>
<p>(c) Technical and financial assistance to address climate change, educational and 
</p>
<p>health issues. 
</p>
<p>19. The Marshall Islands reiterated its commitment to fulfilling its human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations. Although it was a small island developing State, much progress had been made 
</p>
<p>in five years, and the country was confident that more progress was forthcoming. It 
</p>
<p>recognized that more work needed to be done, none of which would be relegated. The 
</p>
<p>country would continue to do its part in the promotion and protection of human rights for 
</p>
<p>the Marshallese people and the improvement thereof, but it would like to point out that that 
</p>
<p>was a collaborative, universal effort requiring the partnership and assistance of the 
</p>
<p>international community. To that end, the Marshall Islands looked forward to the 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the Working Group, which would be seriously considered given its 
</p>
<p>domestic process. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>20. During the interactive dialogue, 43 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>21. The Netherlands referred to the standing invitation extended to the special 
</p>
<p>procedures and welcomed steps taken to implement recommendations by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management 
</p>
<p>and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. It was concerned about the protection of 
</p>
<p>the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and/or other sexually transmitted 
</p>
<p>diseases. It mentioned the steps taken in the field of women&#8217;s rights and that improvements 
</p>
<p>could be made regarding the political participation of women. The Netherlands made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>22. New Zealand was conscious of the challenges faced by small island developing 
</p>
<p>States. It congratulated the Marshall Islands on ratifying the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities and commended its development of domestic legislation. It 
</p>
<p>indicated that violence against women was an ongoing problem and offered to share its own 
</p>
<p>experiences in dealing with domestic violence. New Zealand made recommendations. </p>


<p>23. The Philippines appreciated the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child, recalling that during the first universal periodic review, the Marshall Islands had 
</p>
<p>received numerous recommendations regarding ratification of core international human 
</p>
<p>rights treaties. It inquired about actions taken towards the ratification of those treaties. It 
</p>
<p>pointed out that the Marshall Islands was late in submitting periodic reports in compliance 
</p>
<p>with its obligations under those human rights conventions. The Philippines made a 
</p>
<p>recommendation. 
</p>
<p>24. Portugal welcomed the steps taken to protect and promote human rights since the 
</p>
<p>first universal periodic review, including the adoption of the Public School System Act 
</p>
<p>2013, which established a public free-of-charge school system. It welcomed the 
</p>
<p>determination of the Marshall Islands to prevent adolescent pregnancy as reflected in the 
</p>
<p>development of its 2014&#8211;2016 strategy. Portugal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. The Russian Federation noted with satisfaction the progress achieved, including the 
</p>
<p>new Criminal Code and the National Strategic Plan 2015&#8211;2017. It appreciated the policies 
</p>
<p>to promote gender equality, improve the quality of life of persons with disabilities, and for 
</p>
<p>the development of youth. It highlighted the need for the international community to 
</p>
<p>provide support relating to health care and the environment. The Russian Federation made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Rwanda noted with appreciation the legislative development, national measures and 
</p>
<p>policies aimed at promoting and protecting human rights. It commended the Domestic 
</p>
<p>Violence Prevention and Protection Act. It noted with appreciation the development of the 
</p>
<p>National Gender Policy, scheduled for review by the Cabinet in early 2015 and inquired 
</p>
<p>about its outcome. It commended the adoption of the Disability Inclusive Development 
</p>
<p>Policy. Rwanda made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Sierra Leone commended efforts to address human rights issues in a holistic manner 
</p>
<p>by engaging various stakeholders at the regional and international levels and pointed out 
</p>
<p>that the Marshall Islands was well on its way to meeting Millennium Development Goal 4. 
</p>
<p>It commended climate change management initiatives and encouraged the Marshall Islands 
</p>
<p>to continue to seek technical assistance from the international community. Sierra Leone 
</p>
<p>made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Singapore welcomed the accession of the Marshall Islands to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention against Corruption and commended it for including good governance as one of 
</p>
<p>the five sectors of activity through which it sought to achieve the objectives of its National 
</p>
<p>Strategic Plan. It acknowledged the efforts of the Marshall Islands in protecting and 
</p>
<p>promoting the rights of women. Singapore made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. Slovenia commended the Marshall Islands for ratifying the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It welcomed efforts in the field of gender equality and 
</p>
<p>the empowerment of women, including the adoption of the Domestic Violence Prevention 
</p>
<p>and Protection Act 2011 and work on a new National Gender Policy. It pointed out efforts 
</p>
<p>made to ensure the right to education but remained concerned about high-school dropout 
</p>
<p>rates. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Spain recognized the efforts made by the Marshall Islands in the area of the rights of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities and congratulated it on the recent ratification of the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. Responding to questions, the Marshall Islands underlined the fact that, concerning 
</p>
<p>gender equality, even though there was only one female member of Parliament out of 33, a 
</p>
<p>number of the country&#8217;s positions in the public service were held by women such as the </p>


<p><b>8</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p>Head of the Public Service Commission. The Marshall Islands strived to bring forward its 
</p>
<p>goals of gender equality in that small country. 
</p>
<p>32. In terms of public health, the Marshall Islands had some of the best records in both 
</p>
<p>follow-up and treatment of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.  
</p>
<p>33. The Marshall Islands appreciated comments regarding its continuous efforts to 
</p>
<p>secure justice for people who had been exposed to radiation during the nuclear testing 
</p>
<p>program and their descendants. It was working on solving issues regarding claims that had 
</p>
<p>been adjudicated but not paid and also on holding the United States responsible for the 
</p>
<p>monitoring of exposed areas and homelands that could not be resettled because of the high 
</p>
<p>level of radiation. That continued to be work in progress. The Marshall Islands had reached 
</p>
<p>some milestones but there were still many impediments to the final resolution of that issue 
</p>
<p>beginning with the freedom and access to information which it knew the United States 
</p>
<p>possessed but never shared, invoking security reasons. 
</p>
<p>34. Sweden referred to the Committee on the Rights of the Child&#8217;s recommendation to 
</p>
<p>the Marshall Islands that corporal punishment of children be prohibited in all settings and 
</p>
<p>that the Criminal Code authorized the use of force to correct children&#8217;s misconduct. It 
</p>
<p>pointed out that despite legal prohibition, violence against women was a widespread 
</p>
<p>problem. Sweden made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Thailand welcomed legislative and political reforms, in particular the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>Domestic Violence Prevention and Protection Act 2011, the new Criminal Code and the 
</p>
<p>active cooperation with international organizations. It encouraged the Marshall Islands to 
</p>
<p>intensify its efforts to adopt and apply a global national policy on disabilities. It also 
</p>
<p>encouraged awareness-raising programmes to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and 
</p>
<p>early pregnancy. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Timor-Leste noted with appreciation the adoption of a new law on education in 2013 
</p>
<p>that ensured the right to education, as well as the adoption of the Domestic Violence 
</p>
<p>Prevention and Protection Act. It mentioned that the Marshall Islands was in the process of 
</p>
<p>reviewing its legislation concerning persons with disabilities. Timor-Leste made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. The United Kingdom commended the efforts of the Marshall Islands to implement 
</p>
<p>recommendations, despite capacity and resource challenges. It welcomed measures to 
</p>
<p>combat gender-based violence and protect the rights of children. It was concerned that 
</p>
<p>levels of sexual and gender-based violence remained high and encouraged the Marshall 
</p>
<p>Islands to take further action in that area and ensure that perpetrators of domestic violence 
</p>
<p>were prosecuted. The United Kingdom made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. The United States indicated that the Government had approved the formation of a 
</p>
<p>National Task Force on Human Trafficking, but stated that it had not demonstrated efforts 
</p>
<p>to prosecute alleged traffickers, protect victims or prevent trafficking. It said that additional 
</p>
<p>government efforts were needed to raise awareness and enforce laws prohibiting 
</p>
<p>employment discrimination, particularly with regard to persons with disabilities. The 
</p>
<p>United States made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Uruguay congratulated the Marshall Islands on the recent ratification of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and encouraged it to continue its 
</p>
<p>efforts aimed at harmonizing domestic legislation with international human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations. Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela listed the legislative changes that had taken 
</p>
<p>place during the past years, such as the new Penal Code and the Domestic Violence 
</p>
<p>Prevention and Protection Act 2011. It highlighted the National Strategic Plan of 2014, the </p>


<p>National Gender Policy and the Public School System Act. The Bolivarian Republic of 
</p>
<p>Venezuela made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>41. Algeria commended the efforts deployed by the Marshall Islands to promote and 
</p>
<p>protect human rights, in particular the adoption of the Domestic Violence Prevention and 
</p>
<p>Protection Act. It also congratulated the Marshall Islands on the measures adopted for the 
</p>
<p>protection of children. It mentioned that the review of its national report referred to major 
</p>
<p>challenges such as climate change and nuclear tests. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Argentina congratulated the Marshall Islands for the establishment of the National 
</p>
<p>Strategic Plan 2015&#8211;2017 and the National Policy on Disability Inclusive Development 
</p>
<p>2014&#8211;2018. Argentina made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Armenia noted the steps taken for raising awareness about human rights including 
</p>
<p>through the mass media, the open invitation extended to all special procedures of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, and the initiatives to promote women&#8217;s rights. Armenia was 
</p>
<p>concerned, however, that the Marshall Islands had not yet ratified numerous core 
</p>
<p>international human rights instruments. It also encouraged the Marshall Islands to take 
</p>
<p>additional measures to promote human rights education. Armenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Australia congratulated the Marshall Islands for the enactment of the Domestic 
</p>
<p>Violence Prevention and Protection Act 2011, while recognizing that efforts were still 
</p>
<p>required to address the challenges posed by domestic violence. It also commended the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s participation in the visit of the Special Rapporteur on the implications for human 
</p>
<p>rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and 
</p>
<p>wastes, and stated that Australia would be pleased to assist the Marshall Islands in 
</p>
<p>implementing the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation to improve water sanitation and 
</p>
<p>waste management. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Belgium welcomed the efforts deployed by the Marshall Islands to follow up on the 
</p>
<p>results of the first universal periodic review. In particular it commended the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>Domestic Violence Prevention and Protection Act 2011, which represented a real stride 
</p>
<p>forward. Despite the globally positive records of the Marshall Islands in the human rights 
</p>
<p>sphere, Belgium suggested expanding the ratification of international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments and approving the implementation of existing legislation. Belgium made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Responding to other questions, the Marshall Islands indicated that it was a 
</p>
<p>matriarchal society. Traditionally, women dealt with the most important aspect of island 
</p>
<p>life, the passage of land rights. The sense of belonging to the community in an extended 
</p>
<p>family or a clan situation was based on where you must work, own land and be a caretaker 
</p>
<p>for the future children of that land. That aspect, which was the most important of 
</p>
<p>Marshallese society, influenced the behaviour of adults in the community. Over the past 
</p>
<p>decades, with the urbanization of the island population, with the need to be displaced not 
</p>
<p>just by choice but for various reasons including drugs, famine, floods and other reasons, the 
</p>
<p>population had not lent itself to the traditional manner of dealing with extended family 
</p>
<p>issues. As a result, it had to rely on modern law and processes to which access was limited 
</p>
<p>and of which it had an even more limited understanding.  
</p>
<p>47. The Marshall Islands strived to make sure that Government measures for the 
</p>
<p>prevention of domestic and gender violence and the protection of children, including 
</p>
<p>guaranteeing their rights to health and education, were part of the country&#8217;s constitutional 
</p>
<p>responsibility. It still remained a task and a challenge for the Government to ensure that 
</p>
<p>domestic violence was avoided first of all and then when it did occur it was properly 
</p>
<p>prosecuted and prevented from future expansion. The Marshall Islands underlined that it 
</p>
<p>was doing its best to deal with the problem, with the assistance of regional organizations, 
</p>
<p>the United Nations as well as NGOs. </p>


<p><b>10</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Marshall Islands stated that the updated Criminal Code of 2011 was close to 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards such as provisions for human trafficking. A task force 
</p>
<p>on human trafficking had been established and the Government would be working closely 
</p>
<p>with the International Organization for Migration on the implementation of the United 
</p>
<p>States office grant to monitor and combat trafficking in persons. The Marshall Islands 
</p>
<p>asked for closer cooperation with the United States and requested more information on how 
</p>
<p>to track down, prevent and prosecute trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>49. Brazil commended the Marshall Islands for the review of the legal framework to 
</p>
<p>strengthen women&#8217;s rights. It also referred to the progress made with regard to rights 
</p>
<p>relating to disability. Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Canada welcomed the enactment of the law addressing domestic violence. It 
</p>
<p>encouraged the Marshall Islands to finalize the remaining protocols and develop strategies 
</p>
<p>to implement the Domestic Violence Prevention and Protection Act 2011. Canada remained 
</p>
<p>concerned, however, about reports of child malnutrition and limited access to health care 
</p>
<p>and immunizations in rural communities. It encouraged the Marshall Islands to continue to 
</p>
<p>work towards the achievement of its Millennium Development Goals. Canada made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. China welcomed the ratification by the Marshall Islands of the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other important international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments; its accession to the United Nations Convention against Corruption; the 
</p>
<p>enactment of the Domestic Violence Prevention and Protection Act which was an important 
</p>
<p>step in strengthening legal protection for women and children; its revision of the Criminal 
</p>
<p>Code to criminalize human trafficking; and the fact that it pursued a national strategic plan 
</p>
<p>and took measures to implement policies on gender equality, disability, inclusive 
</p>
<p>development and child protection. China noted that as a small island developing State, the 
</p>
<p>Marshall Islands was facing financial difficulties, lack of capacity and resources in the 
</p>
<p>protection and promotion of human rights and called upon the international community to 
</p>
<p>provide it with constructive help. China made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. The Congo noted with satisfaction that the Marshall Islands had marked an 
</p>
<p>important stage in its development through adopting an inclusive policy to improve the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s capacity to address human rights issues. In the context of the recommendations of 
</p>
<p>the first cycle of the universal periodic review, the Congo welcomed the ratification of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the progress achieved in the 
</p>
<p>empowerment of women. The Congo made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Costa Rica highlighted the importance of being a party to the main human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments and encouraged strengthened cooperation with the human rights treaty bodies, 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council and its special procedures and OHCHR. Costa Rica welcomed 
</p>
<p>the standing invitation made to special procedures and mentioned the measures taken to 
</p>
<p>step up efforts to deal with the problem of domestic violence and encouraged the continued 
</p>
<p>waging of an effective war on that scourge. Costa Rica made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>54. Cuba pointed out the adverse effects of the nuclear tests carried out in some of the 
</p>
<p>Marshall Islands, which had been exacerbated by the negative consequences of climate 
</p>
<p>change. Cuba highlighted the progress made with the enactment of the new Criminal Code 
</p>
<p>in line with international human rights standards as well as the adoption of the Domestic 
</p>
<p>Violence Prevention and Protection Act 2011, the Marshall Islands Public School System 
</p>
<p>Act 2013 and the National Policy on Disability Inclusive Development. Cuba made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Denmark was pleased to note that the first cycle recommendations to ratify the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment had been accepted. Denmark welcomed the fact that a draft paper had been </p>


<p>prepared seeking a decision from the Cabinet to direct the national reporting and 
</p>
<p>monitoring body to plan and consult with relevant stakeholders on the accession to human 
</p>
<p>rights treaties. Denmark made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>56. Egypt pointed out that, despite the fact that it had accepted the recommendation 
</p>
<p>arising from the universal periodic review, the Marshall Islands had not ratified the 
</p>
<p>majority of the key human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>Egypt was also concerned that indigenous rights had been seriously affected by, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>environmental contamination and displacement. Egypt was further concerned that the 
</p>
<p>population experienced threats of increased drought, freshwater shortages, sanitation 
</p>
<p>problems, food insecurity and coastal erosion. Egypt made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>57. Estonia referred to steps to implement previous recommendations including on the 
</p>
<p>rights of persons with disabilities with the approval of the National Policy on Disability. 
</p>
<p>Estonia commended the enactment of a new Criminal Code closely in line with 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards and of the Domestic Violence Prevention and 
</p>
<p>Protection Act 2011, which criminalized domestic violence. Estonia encouraged continued 
</p>
<p>cooperation with the special procedures. Estonia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>58. Fiji congratulated the Marshall Islands for the introduction of laws and policies to 
</p>
<p>proactively prevent and deal with gender-based violence against women and girls, 
</p>
<p>particularly the 2011 domestic violence law, the Child Protection Act and the recently 
</p>
<p>approved National Gender Policy. Fiji shared with the Marshall Islands the challenges 
</p>
<p>related to the loss of land and livelihood as a result of climate change, and concerning the 
</p>
<p>course set to empower communities to be able to enforce social and economic rights in 
</p>
<p>jeopardy as a result of climate change. Fiji made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Responding to questions, the Marshall Islands thanked Fiji for its cooperation in the 
</p>
<p>context of its participation in the Working Group session. The Marshall Islands reaffirmed 
</p>
<p>that Parliament would certainly adopt those treaties and optional protocols before it in the 
</p>
<p>course of 2015. The Marshall Islands stressed that because it had adopted its Constitution in 
</p>
<p>1978/1979, after many neighbouring countries had adopted theirs, it had had the benefit of 
</p>
<p>learning from their laws and their judiciary&#8217;s history to draft and approve a bill of rights 
</p>
<p>that was quite extraordinary. The Marshall Islands had been trying during the past decades 
</p>
<p>to harmonize its domestic legislation with international treaties and protocols despite the 
</p>
<p>many obstacles and impediments to implementing those treaties. 
</p>
<p>60. The Marshall Islands stated that in some parts of the country, it was still distributing 
</p>
<p>drinking water. It indicated that when it had to decide whether to build a prison for women 
</p>
<p>or a maternity ward, it would choose the latter. It emphasized that it was not for lack of 
</p>
<p>political will, but a matter of managing limited resources and that the Marshall Islands 
</p>
<p>would abide by its commitments made in the context of the universal periodic review and 
</p>
<p>regional meetings to implement them as soon as possible.  
</p>
<p>61. France welcomed the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
</p>
<p>Disabilities by the Marshall Islands and its standing invitation to the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>France regretted that the Marshall Islands had still not ratified the two fundamental 
</p>
<p>international covenants in line with its commitments from the first universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review cycle. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Germany acknowledged the challenges facing the Marshall Islands, especially its 
</p>
<p>resource constraints and the consequences of climate change. Germany welcomed steps 
</p>
<p>taken since the first universal periodic review such as the development of the National 
</p>
<p>Strategic Plan and policies on disability, youth and gender as well as revision of the 
</p>
<p>Criminal Code, criminalizing all forms of domestic violence. Germany indicated that some </p>


<p><b>12</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p>gaps remained in the enjoyment of all human rights, especially for vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Indonesia commended the implementation of the National Strategic Plan 2015&#8211;
</p>
<p>2017, including on social development, climate change and resilience and good 
</p>
<p>governance. Indonesia commended the adoption of gender and disability policies and the 
</p>
<p>new Criminal Code in line with international human rights standards. Indonesia appreciated 
</p>
<p>the establishment of the Resource Development Committee to address human rights issues 
</p>
<p>and the universal periodic review reporting process. Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Ireland welcomed the introduction of legislation on domestic violence and the right 
</p>
<p>to education. Ireland hoped that steps would be taken as soon as possible to ratify the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Ireland recognized efforts, including through 
</p>
<p>compensation, made to address the detrimental legacy of nuclear weapons-testing 
</p>
<p>programmes. Ireland urged implementation of the recommendations of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management 
</p>
<p>and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes to develop a health strategy and plan of 
</p>
<p>action. Ireland was concerned at the low level of women&#8217;s representation in politics and 
</p>
<p>mentioned the challenges of poor immunization coverage and child malnutrition. Ireland 
</p>
<p>made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Israel recognized the significant efforts taken to address the constant threat of the 
</p>
<p>effects of climate change that demanded increased attention and growing budget 
</p>
<p>allocations. Israel highlighted measures taken such as accession to the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities, development of gender, disability and youth policies 
</p>
<p>and the prevention of adolescent pregnancy strategy, creation of a Disability Coordination 
</p>
<p>Office, enactment of the Domestic Violence Prevention and Protection Act, and to ensure 
</p>
<p>free and public education. Israel made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Japan appreciated that the Marshall Islands had recently become a party to the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Japan welcomed the policies 
</p>
<p>formulated on gender equality, domestic violence and persons with disabilities notably in 
</p>
<p>the National Strategic Plan. Japan encouraged enhanced efforts to promote gender equality. 
</p>
<p>Japan expected the steady implementation of relevant policies including the Domestic 
</p>
<p>Violence Prevention and Protection Act concerning the reportedly high incidence of 
</p>
<p>violence against women, underage pregnancy and cases of child abuse. Japan made a 
</p>
<p>recommendation.  
</p>
<p>67. Maldives respected the progress achieved since the first review, given the immense 
</p>
<p>challenges of small island developing States struggling with the severe consequences of 
</p>
<p>climate change. Maldives commended the  Domestic Violence Prevention and Protection 
</p>
<p>Act 2011 and encouraged its prompt and effective implementation. Maldives mentioned the 
</p>
<p>progress made in implementing a national programme aimed at eliminating violence against 
</p>
<p>children and encouraged the expeditious passing into law of the Child Protection Bill. It 
</p>
<p>welcomed the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>Maldives made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Mexico congratulated the Marshall Islands on ratifying the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities, on awareness-raising programmes in different local 
</p>
<p>media and on its mobile team expanding capacity-building and the delivery of information 
</p>
<p>on reproductive health, family planning and food security. Mexico welcomed the 
</p>
<p>commitment to combat the effects of climate change and indicated that lack of capacity and 
</p>
<p>insufficient resources were major obstacles to dealing fully with problems and 
</p>
<p>commitments on human rights. Mexico made recommendations. </p>


<p>69. Montenegro welcomed the adoption of the Domestic Violence Prevention and 
</p>
<p>Protection Act 2011 and asked about activities for its full implementation and whether there 
</p>
<p>was any intention to define 18 years as the legal age of marriage for girls. Montenegro also 
</p>
<p>asked the Marshall Islands for information on the expected finalization of its internal 
</p>
<p>accession procedure and on becoming a party to specific treaties. It inquired about the 
</p>
<p>measures taken to strengthen laws and policies on child protection and integrate them into 
</p>
<p>existing mechanisms. Montenegro made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>70. Morocco highlighted the commitment of the Marshall Islands to social and 
</p>
<p>economic development with the adoption of the National Strategic Plan (2015&#8211;2017). It 
</p>
<p>welcomed the visit of the Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the 
</p>
<p>environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. 
</p>
<p>Morocco welcomed the measures taken aimed at accession to the main international human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments, including the Convention against Torture, the International Convention 
</p>
<p>for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Optional Protocol to 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It 
</p>
<p>highlighted the adoption of the new Penal Code and various policies and strategies on 
</p>
<p>disability, reproductive health, family planning and climate change. Morocco made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. Namibia encouraged the Marshall Islands to continue its efforts to promote and 
</p>
<p>protect the rights of its people despite the challenges of climate change and environmental 
</p>
<p>disasters. It was pleased to note the enactment of the Domestic Violence Prevention and 
</p>
<p>Protection Act 2011 and inquired about the status of the national women&#8217;s policy. Namibia 
</p>
<p>made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>72. The Marshall Islands thanked those State representatives who had encouraged it and 
</p>
<p>commended the work that had been done since the last universal periodic review. It thanked 
</p>
<p>Israel for the installation of drinking water facilities in Eba, which would ensure that 
</p>
<p>children attended school and had access to clean drinking water. It also mentioned the good 
</p>
<p>cooperation with Japan along with the European Union in a programme of energy supply in 
</p>
<p>the country. The Marshall Islands would continue to work with neighbouring countries, 
</p>
<p>including Maldives, to deal with climate change issues. 
</p>
<p>73. The Marshall Islands considered that the most important human right was the right 
</p>
<p>to exist. Countries in the Pacific and particularly the Marshall Islands had been subjected to 
</p>
<p>forces beyond their control in terms of displacement of population as well as difficulty in 
</p>
<p>providing basic health and education to their populations. The Marshall Islands considered 
</p>
<p>that responsibility to be less important just because there were other priorities. It was a 
</p>
<p>matter of making choices on what to address first and what to address next. The Marshall 
</p>
<p>Islands viewed the right to exist as primarily important.  
</p>
<p>74. The Marshall Islands emphasized that there were places in the country that would be 
</p>
<p>forbidden for human habitation for the following years. Displaced persons from the Nuclear 
</p>
<p>Testing Program remained scattered not only throughout the Marshall Islands but also 
</p>
<p>throughout the United States and in other parts of the world. Their human rights should be 
</p>
<p>part of the discussion. The country also had issues with climate change over which it had 
</p>
<p>absolutely no control. The Marshall Islands had been vocal in world forums on that issue 
</p>
<p>because it was a right to exist issue. The Marshall Islands stressed the need to anticipate and 
</p>
<p>urgently find answers to the rising of the ocean and what to do with the population, 
</p>
<p>displaced people and how to secure their other human rights in the future. The Marshall 
</p>
<p>Islands reiterated its commitment to ensure that universal periodic review recommendations 
</p>
<p>were implemented. </p>
