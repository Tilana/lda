<p><b>Human Rights Council 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 8/11.</b> <b>Human rights and extreme poverty 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>the international covenants on human rights, the ideal of free human beings enjoying 
</p>
<p>freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby 
</p>
<p>everyone may enjoy his or her economic, social and cultural rights, as well as his or her 
</p>
<p>civil and political rights, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
</p>
<p>2006,  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>and 5/2 on a code of conduct for special procedures mandate-holders of the Council of 18 
</p>
<p>June 2007, and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge his or her duties in 
</p>
<p>accordance with these resolutions and their annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>all previous resolutions on the issue of human rights and extreme 
</p>
<p>poverty adapted by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights, as well 
</p>
<p>as its own relevant resolutions including Council resolutions 2/2 and 7/27, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> further the United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted by Heads 
</p>
<p>of State and Government on the occasion of the Millennium Summit, and their 
</p>
<p>commitment to eradicate extreme poverty and to halve, by 2015, the proportion of the </p>

<p>world&#8217;s people whose income is less than one dollar a day and of those suffer from 
</p>
<p>hunger,  
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that, in its resolution 62/205 of 19 December 2007, the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly proclaimed  the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty 
</p>
<p>(2008&#8211;2017), in order to support, in a efficient and coordinated manner, the 
</p>
<p>internationally agreed development goals related to poverty eradication, including the 
</p>
<p>Millennium Development goals,  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the resolutions of the General Assembly on human rights and 
</p>
<p>extreme poverty, and the importance they attach to giving persons living in extreme 
</p>
<p>poverty the wherewithal to organize and participate in all aspects of political, economic 
</p>
<p>and social life,  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that extreme poverty persists in all countries of the world, 
</p>
<p>regardless of their economic, social and cultural situation, and that its extent and 
</p>
<p>manifestations are particularly severe in developing countries,  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> at the insufficient progress notwithstanding the priority and urgency 
</p>
<p>given by the Heads of State and Government to the eradication of poverty, as expressed 
</p>
<p>in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic 
</p>
<p>and social fields,  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the fight against extreme poverty must remain a high priority for 
</p>
<p>the international community,  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the need to better understand the causes and consequences of extreme 
</p>
<p>poverty,  
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><i>Stressing</i> <i>also</i> that respect for all human rights, which are universal, indivisible 
</p>
<p>and interdependent and interrelated, is of crucial importance for all policies and programs 
</p>
<p>to fight extreme poverty at the local and national levels, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
