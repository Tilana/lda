PROXY STATEMENT
General Information
Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.
On or about March 10, 2011, we will furnish a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to most of our
stockholders containing instructions on how to access the proxy materials and to vote online. In addition,
instructions on how to request a printed copy of these materials may be found on the Notice. For more
information on voting your stock, please see “Voting Your Shares” below. If you received a Notice by mail,
you will not receive a paper copy of the proxy materials unless you request such materials by following the
instructions contained on the Notice. Your vote is important no matter the extent of your holdings.
Stockholders Entitled to Vote.
The holders of record of the following securities at the close of business on February 18, 2011 are entitled to
vote at Newmont Mining Corporation’s (“Newmont” or the “Company”) 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to
be held on Tuesday, April 19, 2011 (the “Annual Meeting”):
(cid:129) common stock of Newmont, par value $1.60 per share, of which there were 486,564,649 shares outstanding
as of the record date; and
(cid:129) exchangeable shares of Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited, a Canadian federal corporation
(“Newmont Canada”), of which there were 6,703,999 shares as of the record date entitled to vote pursuant to
the terms of the Newmont Special Voting Stock described below.
Voting Your Shares.
Newmont Common Stock. Each share of common stock that you own entitles you to one vote. Your Notice
or proxy card shows the number of shares of common stock that you own. You may elect to vote in one of three
methods:
(cid:129) By Mail - If you have received or requested a paper copy of the proxy materials, please date and sign the
proxy card and return it promptly in the accompanying envelope.
(cid:129) By Internet - If you received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, you can access our
proxy materials and vote online. Instructions to vote online are provided in the Notice.
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
In Person - You may attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. We will give you a ballot when you
arrive. If your stock is held in the name of your broker, bank or another nominee (a “Nominee”), then you
must present a proxy from that Nominee in order to verify that the Nominee has not already voted your
shares on your behalf.
If you hold Newmont Common Stock at your Broker - If your shares were held in an account at a
brokerage firm, bank, dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held
in “street name” and the Notice or proxy materials, as applicable, are being forwarded to you by that
organization. Your voting instruction form from Broadridge or your Notice provides information on how to
vote your shares. The organization holding your account is considered the shareholder of record for
purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do not provide the organization that holds
your shares with specific voting instructions, the organization that holds your shares may generally vote on
“routine” matters such as ratification of auditors but cannot vote on “non-routine” matters, which now
include matters such as votes for the election of directors and the Say-on-Pay and Say-When-On-Pay
proposals. Thus, if the organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to
vote your shares on a non-routine matter, that organization will inform the inspector of election that it does
not have the authority to vote on this matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a
“broker non-vote.”
Newmont Exchangeable Shares. Each Newmont exchangeable share that you own has economic rights
(such as the right to receive dividends and other distributions) that are, as nearly as practicable, equivalent to rights
of shares of Newmont common stock. Holders of exchangeable shares have a right through a Voting and Exchange
Trust Agreement (the “Voting Agreement”) to vote at stockholders’ meetings of Newmont. The exchangeable
shares, however, are not shares issued by Newmont and, therefore, a holder of exchangeable shares is not a
registered stockholder of Newmont, but is a registered stockholder of Newmont Canada. The exchangeable shares
are exchangeable at the option of the holders into the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. There are
two ways to vote your exchangeable shares:
(cid:129) By Mail - You may vote by signing and returning the enclosed voting instruction form. This form permits
you to instruct Computershare Trust Company of Canada, as trustee under the Voting Agreement (the
“Trustee”), to vote at the Annual Meeting. The Trustee holds one share of special voting stock of Newmont
(the “Newmont Special Voting Stock”) that is entitled to vote on all matters on which the shares of the
Company’s common stock vote. The Newmont Special Voting Stock has a number of votes in respect to the
Annual Meeting equal to the lesser of (a) the number of exchangeable shares outstanding on the record date
(other than the Company’s exchangeable shares held by Newmont or its affiliates), or (b) 10% of the total
number of votes corresponding to the common stock then outstanding. Based upon the foregoing, the
Trustee will be entitled to cast up to 6,703,999 votes at the Annual Meeting. The Trustee must receive your
voting instructions by 5:00 p.m. in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on April 18, 2011. This will give the Trustee
time to tabulate the voting instructions and vote on your behalf. The Trustee will exercise each vote
attached to the Newmont Special Voting Stock only on the basis of instructions received from the relevant
holders of exchangeable shares. In the absence of instructions from a holder as to voting, the Trustee will
not have any voting rights with respect to such exchangeable shares.
In Person - You may attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. As a holder of exchangeable shares,
you may attend the Annual Meeting in person to vote directly the number of votes to which you are entitled
under the Voting Agreement. Please refer to the Notice to Exchangeable Shareholders and Voting
Instruction Form for additional instructions on voting at the meeting.
(cid:129)
Quorum, Tabulation and Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions.
Quorum. The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote
at the Annual Meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy in order to constitute a quorum for all
matters to come before the meeting. For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, “shares of capital stock
of the Company” include all shares of common stock and the maximum number of shares of common stock that the
Trustee of the Newmont exchangeable shares is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.
Tabulating Votes and Voting Results. Votes at the Annual Meeting will be tabulated by two inspectors of
election who will be appointed by the Chairman of the meeting and who will not be candidates for election to the
Board of Directors. The inspectors of election will treat shares of capital stock represented by a properly signed and
returned proxy as present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, without regard to whether
the proxy is marked as casting a vote or abstaining.
Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions. Abstentions and broker “non-votes” as to particular matters are
counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions are counted in
tabulations of the votes cast on proposals presented to stockholders, whereas broker non-votes are not counted for
purposes of determining whether a proposal has been approved. Abstentions have the same effect as votes against
2
proposals presented to stockholders. A “broker non-vote” occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial
owner votes on one proposal, but does not vote on another proposal because the nominee does not have
discretionary voting power and has not received instructions to do so from the beneficial owner.
Votes Required to Approve the Proposals.
Proposal
Vote Required
Election of Directors
Ratification of independent auditors for 2011

longer vote your stock on your behalf for the election of directors if you have not provided instructions on your
voting instruction form, by telephone or internet. For your vote to be counted, you must submit your voting
instructions to your broker or custodian.
Ratify PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s Independent Auditors for 2011. The
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present and entitled to vote, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting
is required to ratify the Audit Committee’s appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s
independent auditors for 2011.
Advisory Votes. Because the votes on these proposals are advisory in nature, they will not (1) affect any
compensation already paid or awarded to any named executive officer, (2) be binding on or overrule any decisions
by the Board of Directors, (3) create or imply any additional fiduciary duty on the part of the Board of Directors, and
(3) restrict or limit the ability of stockholders to make proposals for inclusion in proxy materials related to executive
compensation. See Proposal No. 3 — Advisory Vote on the Compensation of the Named Executive Officers and
Proposal No. 4 — Advisory Vote on the Frequency of Stockholders Votes on Executive Compensation for a
description of these proposals.
Other Items. If any other items are presented at the Annual Meeting, they must receive an affirmative vote of
a majority of the shares present and entitled to vote, in person or by proxy, in order to be approved.
Revocation of Proxy or Voting Instruction Form.
Revocation of Newmont Common Stock Proxy. A stockholder who executes a proxy may revoke it by
delivering to the Secretary of the Company, at any time before the proxies are voted, a written notice of revocation
bearing a later date than the proxy, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person (although attendance at
the Annual Meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy). A stockholder also may substitute
another person in place of those persons presently named as proxies. Written notice revoking or revising a proxy
should be sent to the attention of the Secretary, Newmont Mining Corporation, at 6363 South Fiddlers Green Circle,
Greenwood Village, Colorado 80111 USA.
Revocation of Newmont Exchangeable Shares Voting Instruction Form. A registered holder of
Newmont exchangeable shares who has submitted a Voting Instruction Form may revoke the Voting
Instruction Form by completing and signing a Voting Instruction Form bearing a later date and depositing it
with the Trustee. No notice of revocation or later-dated Voting Instruction Form, however, will be effective unless
received by the Trustee prior to 5:00 p.m., Toronto time, on April 18, 2011.
3
A non-registered holder of Newmont exchangeable shares may revoke a Voting Instruction Form at any time
by written notice to the intermediary, except that an intermediary is not required to act on a revocation of a Voting
Instruction Form that is not received by the intermediary at least ten days prior to the Annual Meeting.
Solicitation Costs.
The cost of preparing and mailing the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, requests for proxy
materials, and the cost of solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Board of Directors will be borne by the Company.
The proxy materials will be mailed to the holders of the Company’s common stock, and Newmont exchangeable
shares, on March 10, 2011. In addition, solicitation of proxies and voting instruction forms may be made by certain
officers and employees of the Company by mail, telephone or in person. The Company has retained Georgeson Inc.
to aid in the solicitation of brokers, banks, intermediaries and other institutional holders in the United States and
Canada for a fee of $15,000. All costs of the solicitation will be borne by the Company. The Company also will
reimburse brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of
common stock and exchangeable shares.
Notes to Participants in Newmont Employee Retirement Savings Plans.
Participants in the Retirement Savings Plan of Newmont and Retirement Savings Plan for
Hourly-Rated Employees of Newmont. If you are a participant in the Retirement Savings Plan of Newmont or
Retirement Savings Plan for Hourly-Rated Employees of Newmont (401(k) Plans) and hold the Company’s
common stock under either of the 401(k) Plans, you will be furnished a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy
Materials containing instructions on how to access the proxy materials and to vote online. In addition, instructions
on how to request a printed copy of these materials may be found on the Notice. The 401(k) Plans are administered
by Vanguard, as trustee. The trustee, as the stockholder of record of the Company’s common stock held in the plans,
will vote the shares held for you in accordance with the directions you provide. If you do not vote your shares by
11:59 p.m. Eastern time on April 15, 2011, the Trustee will vote your common shares in the 401(k) Plans in the same
proportion as it votes shares as to which directions have been received.
Stockholder Proposals for the 2012 Annual Meeting.
For a stockholder proposal, including a proposal for the election of a director, to be included in the proxy
statement and form of proxy for the 2012 Annual Meeting, the proposal must have been received by us at our
principal executive offices no later than November 11, 2011. Proposals should be sent to the attention of the
Secretary of the Company at 6363 South Fiddlers Green Circle, Greenwood Village, Colorado 80111 USA. We are
not required to include in our proxy statement and form of proxy a stockholder proposal that was received after that
date or that otherwise fails to meet the requirements for stockholder proposals established by SEC regulations.
In addition, under our By-Laws, stockholders must give advance notice of nominations for directors or other
business to be addressed at the 2012 Annual Meeting no later than the close of business on February 17, 2012. The
advance notice must be delivered to the attention of the Secretary of the Company at 6363 South Fiddlers Green
Circle, Greenwood Village, Colorado 80111 USA.

Proposal No. 1 — Election of Directors
Voting for Directors.
If you hold your Newmont stock through a broker, bank or other financial institution, your Newmont stock will
no longer be voted on your behalf on the election of directors unless you complete and return the voting instruction
form or follow the instructions provided to you to vote your stock via telephone or the internet. If you do not instruct
your broker, bank or other financial institution how to vote, your votes will be counted as “broker non-votes” and
your shares will not be represented in the election of directors vote at the Annual Meeting.
Majority Vote Standard for the Election of Directors.
Our By-Laws were amended to require that in an uncontested election each director will be elected by a vote of
the majority of the votes cast, which means the number of votes cast “for” a director’s election exceeds 50% of the
number of votes cast with respect to that director’s election. Votes cast shall include votes to withhold authority, but
shall exclude abstentions. Votes will not be deemed cast if no authority or direction is given.
If a nominee for director does not receive the vote of at least a majority of votes cast at the Annual Meeting, it is the
policy of the Board of Directors that the director must tender his or her resignation to the Board. In such a case, the
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject
the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken, taking into account all of the facts and circumstances.
The director who has tendered his or her resignation will not take part in the deliberations. For additional information, our
Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on our website at www.newmont.com/our-investors/our-governance.
Director Skills and Qualifications.
In addition to meeting the minimum qualifications set out by the Board of Directors under “Director
Nomination Process and Review of Director Nominees,” each nominee also brings a strong and unique
backgrounds and set of skills to the Board, giving the Board, as a whole, competence and experience in a
wide variety of areas, including board service, corporate governance, compensation, executive management, private
equity, finance, mining, operations, manufacturing, marketing, government, law, international business and health,
safety, environmental and social responsibility. The unique background, skills and qualifications that led the Board
of Directors and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee to the conclusion that each of the nominees
should serve as a director for Newmont are set forth in the “Nominees” section below.
Board of Directors Recommendation.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” ALL
OF THE FOLLOWING NOMINEES AND, UNLESS A STOCKHOLDER GIVES INSTRUCTIONS ON
THE PROXY CARD TO THE CONTRARY, THE PROXIES NAMED THEREON INTEND SO TO VOTE.
Nominees.
Each of the 10 persons named below is a nominee for election as a director at the Annual Meeting for a term of
one year or until his/her successor is elected and qualifies. Unless authority is withheld, the proxies will be voted for
the election of such nominees. All such nominees are currently serving as directors of the Company. All such
nominees were elected to the Board of Directors at the last Annual Meeting. If any such nominees cannot be a
candidate for election at the Annual Meeting, then the proxies will be voted either for a substitute nominee
designated by the Board of Directors or for the election of only the remaining nominees.

Director Nomination Process and Review of Director Nominees.
We have established a process for identifying and nominating director candidates that has resulted in the
election of a highly-qualified and dedicated Board of Directors. The following is an outline of the process for
nomination of candidates for election to the Board: (a) the Chief Executive Officer, the Corporate Governance and
Nominating Committee or other members of the Board of Directors identify the need to add new Board members,
with careful consideration of the mix of qualifications, skills and experience represented on the Board of Directors;
(b) the Chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee coordinates the search for qualified
candidates with input from management and other Board members; (c) the Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee engages a candidate search firm to assist in identifying potential nominees, if it deems such engagement
necessary and appropriate; (d) selected members of management and the Board of Directors interview prospective
candidates; and (e) the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee recommends a nominee and seeks full
Board endorsement of the selected candidate, based on its judgment as to which candidate will best serve the
interests of Newmont’s stockholders.
The Board of Directors has determined that directors should possess the following minimum qualifications:
(a) the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity and values; (b) commitment to representing the long-term
interest of the stockholders; (c) broad experience at the policy-making level in business, government, education,
technology or public interest; and (d) sufficient time to effectively fulfill duties as a Board member. The Corporate
Governance and Nominating Committee considers any candidates submitted by stockholders on the same basis as
any other candidate. Any stockholder proposing a nomination should submit such candidate’s name, along with
curriculum vitae or other summary of qualifications, experience and skills to the Secretary, Newmont Mining
Corporation, 6363 South Fiddlers Green Circle, Greenwood Village, Colorado 80111 USA.
Newmont considers diversity, age and skills in deciding on nominees. The Corporate Governance and
Nominating Committee considers a broad range of diversity, not limited to merely race, gender or national origin,
but considering all relevant background and experience. We consider this through discussions at the Corporate
Governance and Nominating Committee meetings. In evaluating a director candidate, the Corporate Governance
and Nominating Committee considers factors that are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
Independence of Directors.
The Board affirmatively determines the independence of each director and each nominee for election as
director. For each individual deemed to be independent, the Board has determined (a) that there is no relationship
with the Company, or (b) the relationship is immaterial. The Board has considered the independence standards of
the New York Stock Exchange and adopted more stringent categorical independence standards described below.
The Board has determined that the relationships that fall within the standards described in its independence
standards are categorically immaterial. As such, provided that no law, rule or regulation precludes a determination
of independence, the following relationships are not considered to be material relationships with the Company for
purposes of assessing independence: service as an officer, director, employee or trustee or greater than five percent
beneficial ownership in (i) a supplier of goods or services to the Company if the annual sales to the Company are less
than $1 million or two percent of the gross revenues or sales of the supplier, whichever is greater; (ii) a lender to the
Company if the total amount of the Company’s indebtedness is less than one percent of the total consolidated assets
of the lender; (iii) a charitable organization if the total amount of the Company’s total annual charitable
contributions to the organization is less than $1 million or two percent of that organization’s total annual gross
receipts (excluding any amounts received through the Company’s employee matching program for charitable
contributions), whichever is greater; or (iv) any relationship arising out of a transaction, or series of transactions, in
which the amount involved is less than $60,000.
In making its independence determinations, the Board considered the circumstances described below.
Mr. Hamson is a director of Genesis Emerging Markets Ltd. The committee administering the investment of
Company funds for its pension plan selected one of the Genesis Emerging Market funds as one investment in its
portfolio in 2010. This relationship meets categorical independence standard (i) above.
11
Mr. Thompson is a director of Sandvik AB, an international engineering group that provides certain products to
the Company including certain mining equipment for rock excavation. Mr. Thompson also is a director of AMEC
plc, an international engineering and project management company, which provides certain consulting services to
the Company. These relationships both meet the categorical independence standard (i) above.
Based on the foregoing analysis, the Board determined that the following directors are independent:
Glen A. Barton
Vincent A. Calarco
Joseph A. Carrabba
Noreen Doyle
Veronica M. Hagen
Michael S. Hamson
John B. Prescott
Donald C. Roth
Simon R. Thompson
In addition, based on these standards, the Board has affirmatively determined that Richard T. O’Brien is not
independent because he is President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
Stock Ownership of Directors and Executive Officers.
As of February 18, 2011, the directors and executive officers of the Company as a group beneficially owned, in
the aggregate, 1,482,561 shares of the Company’s outstanding capital stock, constituting, in the aggregate, less than
1% of the Company’s outstanding capital stock.
No director or executive officer beneficially owned (a) more than 1% of the outstanding shares of the
Company’s common stock or the exchangeable shares, or (b) shares voting power in excess of 1% of the voting
power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company. Each director and executive officer has sole voting power
and dispositive power with respect to all shares beneficially owned by them, except as set forth below.
The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of common stock as of February 18, 2011 held by
(a) each current director and nominee; (b) the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and each of the
other highly compensated executive officers (the “Named Executive Officers”); and (c) all current directors and
executive officers as a group. The address for each of the named individuals below is c/o Newmont Mining

(1) For 2010, director stock units were awarded to all non-employee directors under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, except Mr. Prescott elected to

(1) Mr. O’Brien’s compensation is shown in the Summary Compensation Table.
(2) For 2010, all non-employee directors elected to receive $120,000 in the form of director stock units, except Mr. Prescott who elected to
receive his award in the form of the Company’s common stock. Amounts shown represent dollar amounts recognized for 2010 for financial
statement reporting purposes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R. The number of shares of common stock was
calculated based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the third business day following re-election at the Company’s Annual
Meeting by taking the average of the high and low sales prices for a share of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for such date,
as reported by Bloomberg Professional, the independent commercial reporting service selected by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors. There are no other assumptions made in the valuation of the stock awards.
(3) Gov. Miller retired from the Board of Directors in April 2010. Upon retirement, 1,303 director stock units awarded in 2005 in connection
with Newmont’s director stock award program, vested and one share of Newmont common stock for each director stock award was issued to
Gov. Miller. The value of such stock award was determined by taking the closing price of a share of Newmont common stock on Gov.
Miller’s date of retirement. The amount shown as All Other Compensation represents (a) $69,189 for common stock issued on retirement,
(b) $34,305 in cash retirement payments (see description under “Retirement” below), (c) accrued dividends of $2,475, and (d) $147,519 for
services as Chairman of the Nevada Advisory Panel as described on page 18.
(4) Dr. Taranik retired from the Board of Directors in July 2010. Upon retirement, 12,214 director stock units awarded to Dr. Taranik from 2005
to 2010 in connection with Newmont’s director stock award program, vested and one share of Newmont common stock for each director
stock award was issued to Dr. Taranik. The value of such stock award was determined by taking the closing price of a share of Newmont
common stock on Dr. Taranik’s date of retirement. The amount shown as All Other Compensation represents (a) $676,655 for common stock
issued on retirement from the Board, (b) $21,236 in cash retirement payments, and (b) accrued dividends of $11,220. It is currently
contemplated that in 2011 Dr. Taranik will receive approximately $80,000 for consulting services, such amount is not included above.
Retirement. The Company has no current retirement plan for non-employee directors. The retirement
payments included in the “All Other Compensation” column of the table above paid to Gov. Miller and Dr. Taranik
were grandfathered under the previous plan, which provided that on retirement from the Board of Directors at any
time after attaining age 65, a non-employee director who was serving on the Board of Directors on January 27, 1999
and who has served for at least ten consecutive years as a Director is entitled to be paid an annual sum of $50,000 for
life.

Share Ownership Guidelines. All directors are encouraged to have a significant long-term financial
interest in the Company. To encourage alignment of the interests of the directors and the stockholders, each director
is expected to own, or acquire within three years of becoming a director, shares of the Company’s common stock
having a market value of five times the annual cash retainer payable under the Company’s director compensation
policy. All directors meet the share ownership guidelines.
Compensation Consultant. The Board of Directors has engaged Frederic W. Cook & Co. (“Cook & Co.”)
during 2010 to assist in the evaluation of independent director compensation. For a description of executive
compensation consulting services provided by Cook & Co. to the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors, see pages 25-26 of the Compensation, Discussion and Analysis.
Committees of the Board of Directors and Attendance.
Attendance at Meetings. During 2010, the Board of Directors held eight meetings. Each incumbent
director attended 75% or more of all meetings of the Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors on
which he or she served. It is the policy and practice of the Company that nominees for election at the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders attend the meeting. All of the Board members at the time of the 2010 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders held on April 23, 2010, attended the meeting.
Board Committees. The Board of Directors has, in addition to other committees, Audit, Compensation, Corporate
Governance and Nominating, Operations and Safety, and Environmental and Social Responsibility Committees. All
members of these five committees are independent, as defined in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange
and the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines. Each Committee functions under a written charter adopted by the
Board which are available on our website at http://www.newmont.com/our-investors/our-governance. The current
members of these Committees and the number of meetings held in 2010 are shown in the following table:

Corporate Governance.
Corporate Governance Guidelines and Charters. The Company has adopted Corporate Governance
Guidelines that outline important policies and practices regarding the governance of the Company. In addition, each of
the committees has adopted a charter outlining responsibilities and operations. The Corporate Governance Guidelines
and the charters are available on our website at http://www.newmont.com/our-investors/our-governance.
16
Board Leadership and Independent Chairman. The Board of Directors selects the Chairman of the
Board in the manner and upon the criteria that it deems best for the Company at the time of selection. The Board of
Directors does not have a prescribed policy on whether the roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
should be separate or combined. At all times, the Board of Directors has either a Non-Executive Chairman or lead
director of the Board, which Chairman or lead director will meet the Company’s independence criteria and will be
elected annually by the independent members of the Board of Directors.
Before 2008, the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer were held by a single person. Due to
the potential efficiencies of having the Chief Executive Officer also serve in the role of Chairman of the Board and the long
tenure of the Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors determined that the interests of the Company and its
stockholders were best served by the leadership and direction provided by a single person as Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer. In 2007, the Board of Directors considered a shareholder proposal included in the 2007 Proxy Statement regarding
the separation of such roles. The Board agreed to separate the roles as of January 1, 2008 in response to the stockholder vote
and the Board’s determination regarding what was in the best interest of the Company at such time. The Board will
continue to evaluate whether this leadership structure is in the best interests of the stockholders on a regular basis.
In January 2008, the independent members of the Board of Directors elected Vincent A. Calarco an
independent Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. Mr. Calarco has been re-elected each year since 2008 as
Non-Executive Chairman. He presides at independent directors sessions scheduled at each regular Board meeting.
The Non-Executive Chairman serves as liaison between the Chief Executive Officer and the other independent
directors, approves meeting agendas and schedules and notifies other members of the Board of Directors regarding
any significant concerns of stockholders or interested parties of which he or she becomes aware. The Non-Executive
Chairman presides at stockholders meetings and provides advice and counsel to the Chief Executive Officer.
Board Oversight of Risk Management. The Board of Directors is engaged in company-wide risk management
oversight. Directors are entitled to rely on management and the advice of the Company’s outside advisors and auditors, but
must at all times have a reasonable basis for such reliance. The Board of Directors relies upon the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer to supervise the day-to-day risk management, each of whom provides reports directly to the
Board of Directors and certain Board Committees, as appropriate. The Company has a global Enterprise Risk
Management team, led by the Company’s Vice President and Treasurer. The Enterprise Risk Management team’s
objectives include conducting the compensation risk assessment and reporting the process and findings to the Audit
Committee and the Compensation Committee regularly, and to the full Board of Directors on at least an annual basis.
The Board of Directors also delegates certain oversight responsibilities to its Board Committees. For a description
of the functions of the various Board Committees, see “Board Committees” above. For example, while the primary
responsibility for financial and other reporting, internal controls, compliance with laws and regulations, and ethics rests
with the management of the Company, the Audit Committee provides risk oversight with respect to the Company’s
financial statements, the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and corporate policies and
controls,
the independent auditor’s selection, retention, qualifications, objectivity and independence, and the
performance of the Company’s internal audit function. Additionally, the Compensation Committee provides risk
oversight with respect to the Company’s compensation program. For a discussion of the Compensation Committee and
Enterprise Risk Management team’s assessments of compensation-related risks, see “Compensation Discussion and
Analysis — Risk Assessment.” The Operations and Safety Committee provides oversight and direction with regard to
safety and operating risks. The Environmental and Social Responsibility Committee provides oversight and direction
with respect to environmental, social responsibility and community relations risks.
Communications with Stockholders or Interested Parties. Any stockholder or interested party who
desires to contact the Company’s Chairman, the non-management directors as a group or the other members of the Board
of Directors may do so by writing to the Secretary, Newmont Mining Corporation, 6363 South Fiddlers Green Circle,
Greenwood Village, Colorado 80111 USA. Any such communication should state the number of shares owned, if
applicable. The Secretary will forward to the Chairman any such communication addressed to him, the non-management
directors as a group or to the Board of Directors generally, and will forward such communication to other Board
members, as appropriate, provided that such communication addresses a legitimate business issue. Any communication
relating to accounting, auditing or fraud will be forwarded immediately to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
17
Majority Voting Policy. At the 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the stockholders approved a proposal
submitted by United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America to initiate the appropriate process to amend
the Company’s governance documents to provide that director nominees be elected by the affirmative vote of the
majority of votes cast at an Annual Meeting in a non-contested election. As a result, the Board of Directors amended
the Company’s By-Laws to require that in an uncontested election each director will be elected by a vote of the
majority of the votes cast, which means the number of votes cast “for” a director’s election exceeds 50% of the
number of votes cast with respect to that director’s election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a
“contested election” of the directors (as defined in the Company’s By-Laws), directors shall be elected by the vote
of a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present.
If a nominee for director does not receive the vote of at least a majority of votes cast at an Annual Meeting, it is the
policy of the Board of Directors that the director must tender his or her resignation to the Board. In such a case, the
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will make a recommendation to the Board, whether to accept or
reject the tendered resignation, taking into account all of the facts and circumstances. The director who has tendered his
or her resignation will not take part in the deliberations. For additional information, our Corporate Governance
Guidelines describing this policy are available on our website at www.newmont.com/our-investors/our-governance.
Retirement Age. The Company’s retirement policy for non-employee directors provides that, except at the
request of the Board of Directors, no non-employee director may stand for re-election to the Board after reaching age 72.
Code of Business Ethics and Conduct. Newmont has adopted a Code of Business Ethics and Conduct
(the “Code”) applicable to all of its directors, officers and employees, including the Chief Executive Officer, the
Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Accounting Officer and other persons performing financial reporting functions.
The Code is available on our website at http://www.newmont.com/our-investors/our-governance. The Code is
designed to deter wrongdoing and promote (a) honest and ethical conduct; (b) full, fair, accurate, timely and
understandable disclosures; (c) compliance with laws, rules and regulations; (d) prompt internal reporting of Code
violations; and (e) accountability for adherence to the Code. The Company will disclose any amendments to, or
waivers from, certain provisions of the Code that apply to the Company’s directors or executive officers within four
days of such event on Form 8-K.
Related Person Transactions. The Board has adopted written policies and procedures for approving
related person transactions. Any transaction with a related person, other than transactions available to all employees
generally or involving aggregate amounts of less than $120,000 must be approved or ratified by the Audit
Committee, the Compensation Committee for compensation matters or disinterested members of the Board. The
policies apply to all executive officers, directors and their family members and entities in which any of these
individuals has a substantial ownership interest or control.
With approval of the Board of Directors, Gov. Miller, who retired from the Board of Directors in April 2010,
was appointed the Newmont Chairman of a Nevada Advisory Panel, for a two-year term effective April 23, 2010
through April 22, 2012. Gov. Miller has provided and will continue to provide high-level strategic advice on Nevada
political and operational issues to the Company. For his services, Newmont will pay him an annual fee of $215,000,
$147,519 of which was paid to Gov. Miller in 2010 for services rendered.

Report of the Compensation Committee on Executive
Compensation
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) is composed
entirely of directors who are not officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and are
independent, as defined in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and the Company’s Corporate
Governance Guidelines. The Compensation Committee has adopted a Charter that describes its responsibilities in
detail, and the Compensation Committee and Board review and assess the adequacy of the Charter on a regular
basis. The Compensation Committee has the responsibility of taking the leadership role with respect to the Board’s
responsibilities relating to compensation of the Company’s key employees, including the Chief Executive Officer,
the Chief Financial Officer and the other executive officers. Additional information about the Compensation
Committee’s role in corporate governance can be found in the Compensation Committee’s Charter, available on the
Company’s web site at www.newmont.com under the Our Investors section.
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Company’s Compensation
Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation
Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section be
included in this Proxy Statement and the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2010.

Executive Summary.
Company Overview and Summary of 2010 Business Results. Newmont is one of the world’s largest
gold producers and is the only gold company included in the S&P 500 Index and Fortune 500, and was the first gold
company included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index-World. We are engaged in the exploration for and
acquisition of gold, copper and certain base metals properties. We have significant assets or operations in the United
States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, New Zealand and Mexico.
During 2010 the Company continued on its journey of transformation and evolution. In our drive to be the most
valued and respected mining company through industry-leading performance, we have successfully executed on the
key benchmarks that we set out for the Company at the beginning of the year.

(cid:129)
Investing in people.
Our executive compensation programs support the achievement of the results stated above, as further described
in our CD&A.
Compensation Structure. Our executive compensation program — composed of salary, short-term
incentives and long-term incentives — is intended to align the interests of our Officers with those of our
stockholders. This program accomplishes this by rewarding performance that is designed to, over time, result
in an increase in the value of our stockholder’s investments in Newmont. We believe that the proportion of at-risk,
performance-based compensation should rise as an employee’s level of responsibility increases. As such, short- and
long-term incentives made up approximately 80% of 2010 target total compensation (as noted in the charts below)
with long-term and equity compensation representing a significant portion of total pay. Overall, approximately two-
thirds of targeted compensation for our Officers is based on the long-term financial and stock price performance of
Newmont. The incentive compensation actually received by Officers varies based upon the Company’s short-term
and long-term performance and Newmont’s stock price. While incenting performance, the design of our program is
intended to mitigate excessive risk taking by executives. The mix and structure of compensation as described in this
CD&A strike an appropriate balance to promote sustained performance without motivating or rewarding excessive
risk.

Managing Executive Compensation in the Commodities Industry. Our stock price is heavily
influenced by gold, copper and other commodity prices, which are in turn primarily driven by macroeconomic
factors that are outside of the Company’s control. Since our stock price is significantly influenced by these external
factors, Newmont’s compensation program is designed to focus management’s efforts in areas where they have the
most influence on driving business performance, as well as to motivate and retain outstanding leadership through
various economic and commodity price cycles. We believe this approach aligns the incentive structure with business
performance elements that support the goal of providing long-term performance gains for our stockholders. To
achieve this, the Company utilizes a comprehensive performance-based compensation structure, ensuring an
appropriate balance of operational, financial and share price incentives based on:
(cid:129) Annual and long-term performance;
(cid:129)
Internal and external performance comparisons;
(cid:129) Absolute and relative performance measures; and
(cid:129) Formulaic and discretionary programs.
This structure is illustrated in the following chart.

Company Performance and Relationship to Officer Compensation for 2010. In 2010, management
delivered solid results on operational, financial and stockholder return measures, and these results had direct
linkages to our incentive compensation plans. The measures used in incentive compensation are what we believe to
be the key drivers of Newmont’s long-term success and stock price performance, and are directly correlated to the
pay received by the Company’s Officers. Components of Officer compensation increased or decreased in 2010
based on the level of achievement of these goals as shown in the chart below.
(See the “2010 Compensation” section of this Proxy Statement for additional information on the measures,
results and payments.)

Incentive Plan Measures, Overall Company Performance and Resulting Compensation. The
metrics listed below are general indicators of the Company’s overall performance in 2010 which results from the
performance on the incentive plan measures. The Compensation Committee believes the incentive plan measures
are the key drivers of the metrics below and support sustained, long-term performance. As noted previously, the
Compensation Committee prefers to use a balance of operational and financial measures, rather than only high-level
financial measures, to provide a more direct “line of sight” and to incent management’s performance on the key
performance drivers. Again, this balanced approach also helps to manage commodity price volatility, such as the
record gold price experienced in 2010, by incorporating measures that are not significantly influenced by

Summary of Key Compensation Committee Actions. The following highlights some of the key actions
by the Compensation Committee, as well as the changes in Officer compensation, in 2010.
Policy changes:
(cid:129)
Introduced a new long-term incentive plan, based on share price performance to further align executive
compensation, stockholder returns and company performance, is based on:
(cid:129) Newmont’s change in share price over the performance period; and
(cid:129) Newmont’s TSR performance relative to its peer group TSR;
(cid:129) Added copper to the incentive plan measures for both production and costs given the Company’s significant
(cid:129)
production of copper;
Increased the stock ownership requirements for the Chief Executive Officer from four-times to five-times
base salary;
(cid:129) Revised the executive pay philosophy to reflect a “reasonable range” for targeting compensation based on a
variety of internal and external factors;
(cid:129) Revised the Compensation Committee charter to formally add items regarding annual review of
stockholder relations, peer group review, management development and succession planning, and
annual review of severance policies; and
(cid:129) Established the “Compensation Committee Operating System” to support the governance activities of the
Compensation Committee.
These policy changes build upon our strong governance model and other policies that are in place, including:
(cid:129) Stock ownership requirements for Officers to own significant holdings of Newmont stock;
23
(cid:129) A clawback policy to recover excess compensation from incentive payouts and stock gains if the financial
results were misstated, whether intentionally or by administrative error;
(cid:129) Stock trading policy prohibiting executives from buying Newmont stock on margin, or hedging Newmont
stock holdings;
(cid:129) Change-of-control plans that provide cash payments only upon termination following a change-of-control
(“double-trigger”);
(cid:129) No employment contracts for Officers;
(cid:129) Prohibition against the repricing of stock options without stockholder approval; and
(cid:129) Use of an independent compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (“Cook & Co.”), to advise
regarding executive and director compensation (the consultant does not perform any other services to the
Company).
Summary of Changes in Compensation, Performance Results and Corresponding Compensation Plan
Payments (further details are provided in the “2010 Compensation” section of this CD&A):
(cid:129) The Company adjusted base salaries following a competitive market review completed by the
Compensation Committee’s independent consultant, Cook & Co. The base salaries of the Officers
were below the targeted competitive market position. Given this, and based on the performance of the
Officers and overall Company performance, the Compensation Committee approved salary increases
which place the Officers within their competitive range;
(cid:129) For the Corporate Performance Bonus (based on the measures stated above), the aggregate performance for
2010 was 124.3% of target;
(cid:129) For the Strategic Objectives Bonus (based on individual qualitative and quantitative goals), the awards
ranged from 98%-136% of the mid-point;
(cid:129) For the Financial Performance Stock Bonus Plan (based on the weighted average three-year prior
the aggregate three-year
the financial and operational measures noted above),
performance of
performance was 126.7% of target;
(cid:129) For the Performance-Leveraged Stock Units (based on stock price growth and relative total shareholder return),
Newmont’s stock price increased 25.3% in 2010, resulting in a TSR performance that placed Newmont at the
74.7th percentile of the peer companies, which combined, funded the program at 174.7%; and
In addition, the Company awarded stock options to the Officers with compensation from the stock options
fully tied to any growth in share price over the vesting period.
(cid:129)
Philosophy and Objectives.
Compensation Philosophy. Newmont’s executive compensation programs are designed to effectively link
the actions of our executives to business outcomes that drive value creation for stockholders. In designing these
programs, we are guided by the following principles:
(cid:129) Maintaining a clear link between the achievement of business goals and compensation
payout. Our Compensation Committee believes that (1) Officers should be measured and paid on
performance that leads to long-term success and relative stock price improvement, and (2) Officer
compensation programs can be an effective means of driving the behavior needed to accomplish our
objectives, but only if each executive clearly understands how achievement of predetermined business
goals influences his or her compensation.
(cid:129) Selecting the right performance measures. Equally important is the selection of those performance
measures which need to be measurable and linked to both increased stockholder value and Newmont’s
short- and long-term success.
(cid:129) Sharing information and encouraging feedback. Focused and clear program design supports
transparency for our stockholders. It is important for stockholders to understand the basis for our Officers’
compensation, as this provides stockholders insight into our goals, direction and the manner in which
24
resources are being used to increase stockholder value. We welcome stockholder input and have regularly
responded to feedback from stockholders in this regard.
As a core component of Newmont’s values, we are committed to transparency and open disclosure. We hope
this information provides insight into the process that we follow in designing and implementing our executive
compensation programs.
Compensation Objectives. We believe that executive compensation should be directly linked to
continuous improvements in corporate performance and increases in stockholder value. Newmont’s executive
compensation programs are designed to:
(cid:129) Motivate executives to achieve business goals that drive value for our stockholders;
(cid:129) Provide competitive compensation opportunities to attract and retain highly qualified executives;
(cid:129) Emphasize long-term performance, which includes our high safety and social responsibility standards;
(cid:129) Blend the mix of cash and equity compensation and financial and non-financial performance;
(cid:129) Provide incentives to improve performance without taking excessive risks; and
(cid:129) Encourage an ownership mentality and stewardship of long-term stockholder interests.
Components of Total Compensation.
The components of target total direct compensation for our Officers are described in the Executive Summary
and stated below. As noted in our Philosophy section, we emphasize performance-based “at-risk” compensation,
based on operational, financial and share price performance.

Developing Our Executive Compensation Program. Each year the Compensation Committee
conducts a detailed analysis of executive compensation designed to:
(cid:129) Assess the competitiveness of the Company’s executive compensation levels against peer groups;
(cid:129) Consider the desired target benchmark for total executive compensation levels; and
(cid:129) Make necessary refinements to the compensation components to further align executive compensation with
performance goals and ensure good governance practices.
The Compensation Committee meets on a regular basis with the Chief Executive Officer, representatives from
the Company’s Human Resources, Corporate Legal, and Finance Departments. The role of management is to
provide the Compensation Committee with perspectives on the business context and individual performance to
assist the Compensation Committee in making its decisions. The Company’s Human Resources Department
support the Compensation Committee by providing data and analyses on compensation levels and trends. In
addition, external independent compensation experts consult with the Compensation Committee regarding specific
topics as further described in the following paragraph. An executive session, without management present, is
generally held at the end of each Compensation Committee meeting. The independent members of the Board of
Directors make all decisions regarding the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation in executive session, upon the
recommendation of the Compensation Committee. The Committee Chairman provides regular reports to the Board
of Directors regarding actions and discussions at Compensation Committee meetings.
The Compensation Committee, which has the authority to retain special counsel and other experts, including
compensation consultants, has engaged Cook & Co. to assist the Compensation Committee in making its decision
25
and to provide (1) advice regarding trends in executive compensation, (2) independent review of management
proposals and (3) an independent review and recommendation on Chief Executive Officer compensation, as well as
other items that come before the Compensation Committee. Cook & Co. has reviewed the compensation
philosophy, objectives, strategy, benchmark analyses and recommendations regarding Officer compensation.
Cook & Co. is engaged solely by the Compensation Committee and does not provide any services or advice
directly to management.
When making compensation decisions for Officers, the Compensation Committee considers factors beyond
market data and the advice of consultants. The Compensation Committee considers the individual’s performance,
tenure and experience, the overall performance of the Company, any retention concerns, the individual’s historical
compensation and the compensation of the individual’s peers within the Company and market. While the
Compensation Committee does have certain guidelines, goals, and tools that it uses to make its decisions, as
explained below, the compensation process is not an exact science but incorporates the reasoned business judgment
of the Compensation Committee. In making decisions for executives other than the Chief Executive Officer, the
input and perspective of the Chief Executive Officer is considered by the Compensation Committee.
Compensation Components and Alignment to Compensation Philosophy.
The components of our executive compensation program contain six main elements as shown in the chart
above. We explain the philosophy and key features of each below.
Determining the Proper Mix of Different Pay Elements. In determining how we allocate an executive’s
total compensation package among various components, we emphasize compensation elements that reward
performance on measures that align closely with business success, underscoring the pay-for-performance
philosophy. A significant portion of our executive compensation is performance-based or “at-risk.” Our Chief
Executive Officer and other Officers have a higher percentage of at-risk compensation relative to other employees.
We believe this is appropriate because our Officers have the greatest influence on Company performance. Stock-
based long-term incentives represent the largest component of pay, in order to encourage sustained long-term
performance and ensure alignment with stockholders. In the graphs below, we show the emphasis on at-risk or
stockholder aligned compensation through performance-based short-term and long-term incentives compared to
base salary.

Components of Compensation and Alignment to Goals. The Company recognizes that its share price
is heavily influenced by the price of gold, copper and other commodities, which are outside of the control of the
Company. Thus, as a way to balance the commodity fluctuation, the Company grants a mix of incentives including
stock options, financial performance stock bonuses (common stock and restricted stock units) and performance
leveraged stock units (based on share return measures) to align the interests of management with the long-term
interests of stockholders. This balanced approach means that management needs to achieve specific performance
goals to earn the common stock and restricted stock units even in periods of positive gold/copper price movement,
and that the equity package continues to motivate performance in down-cycles as the common stock and restricted
stock units retain value and have motivational impact even when gold/copper prices are falling. At the same time,
the use of stock options ensures that the highest rewards will only occur with an increasing share price.

Determination of Target Total Compensation. We consider a variety of factors when determining target
Officer compensation to ensure we have a comprehensive understanding of alignment of goals, reasonableness of
pay, internal equity, pay for performance, and ability to attract and retain executive talent. The primary items are
discussed in detail below, and include:
(cid:129) Market information;
27
(cid:129)
Individual performance;
(cid:129) Experience, skills and scope of responsibilities;
(cid:129) Company performance;
(cid:129) Succession planning;
(cid:129) Value of the compensation relative to the corresponding objective; and
(cid:129) Other key measures which assist in providing a comprehensive understanding of pay, such as pay mix,
internal equity, Chief Executive Officer compensation versus Total Shareholder Return, and performance
sensitivity analysis.
Competitive Considerations (Market information).
Peer Group. We strive to compensate our Officers competitively relative to industry peers. To evaluate the
reasonableness and competitiveness of Newmont’s position in the industry, the Compensation Committee spent
considerable time in 2009 selecting a relevant peer group with the aid of its independent consultant, Cook & Co.,
and with input from management. The resulting peer group consists of mining and extractive industry companies.
This peer group was reviewed again in 2010 and reaffirmed as an appropriate benchmark reference. To create the
peer group, the Compensation Committee’s analysis included a review of each potential peer company’s industry,
complexity of their business and organizational size information, including revenue, net income, total assets,
market capitalization and number of employees. This approach ensures each company’s industry and size provide a
reasonable basis of comparison. Below is the peer group selected by the Compensation Committee:
Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd
Anglogold Ashanti Ltd
Barrick Gold Corp
Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Inc
Gold Fields Ltd
Goldcorp Inc
Kinross Gold Corp
Teck Resources Ltd
Apache Corp
Chesapeake Energy Corp
Consol Energy Inc
EOG Resources Inc
Peabody Energy Corp
Talisman Energy Inc
Vulcan Materials Co
The companies included in the comparator group differ from those listed in the General Industry Classification
Standard (“GICS”), a grouping commonly used by advisory services, as the Compensation Committee does not
believe the GICS comparator group appropriately represents the mining and extractive industry companies, which
constitute a directly relevant industry and labor peer group.
The table below compares Newmont’s 2010 company scope metrics versus the peer group. While Newmont tends
to be larger than the companies in the peer group (and has outperformed the peers on several key measures as noted in the
table below), which is a conservative approach for pay comparison, the Compensation Committee believes that those
selected are appropriate reference points based on the industry. Additionally, the Compensation Committee recognizes
that Newmont is one of the world’s largest gold companies, and therefore, will be by default one of the larger companies
in the gold mining peer group. Newmont’s relative size and performance is considered by the Compensation Committee
when determining an appropriate compensation market reference point, as described in the following section.

Positioning of Pay Relative to Peers. Upon completing an in-depth analysis of executive compensation
in 2009, the Company determined that Newmont’s Officer pay was below the historical target positioning.
Specifically, the results of the 2009 peer group comparison found that base salaries, targeted annual cash
compensation, long-term incentives and target total direct compensation were below the 50th percentile of the
peer group.
Because executive pay was well below its targeted position in 2009, the Compensation Committee decided to
take a measured approach and target compensation between the 50th and 75th percentile, gradually moving
compensation back into this range over time as performance, scope and other key criteria warranted. In 2010, the
Compensation Committee again reviewed our pay philosophy and determined that for 2011, it would be appropriate
to target the 62.5 percentile of the market and to use the broader philosophy of “market median up to the
75th percentile as the reasonable range for target compensation, considering Company and peer group metrics,
individual and Company performance, and the industry labor market context.” This philosophy was formulated with
input from the Compensation Committee’s consultant, Cook & Co. Under this more general approach, the
Compensation Committee retains flexibility in determining the appropriate target for compensation each year based
on a variety of factors such as performance, company size, changes in peer group, competition for talent,
year-over-year changes in market pay, and other factors.
Material Differences Among Officers. With the exception of the Chief Executive Officer, the Company
has set the same target percentages of base salary for each compensation component for all of the Officers for 2010.
The Chief Executive Officer’s target percentage for each incentive compensation component is greater than the
other Officers due to his position as the top executive officer of the Company. Market pay levels for top executives
are in general significantly higher than the pay levels for other executives, as indicated by general survey and peer
group data utilized by the Compensation Committee and described above. Additionally, the pay mix for the Chief
Executive Officer typically includes a greater emphasis on at-risk pay, commensurate with the level of
responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer position and the greater degree of impact that this executive can
have on overall business results.
Other Factors Used to Determine Compensation.
Effect of Individual Performance. The Compensation Committee takes into consideration subjective
elements, such as the Officer’s skill set, individual achievements and role with Newmont during the relevant fiscal
year. Additionally, an assessment of each Officer’s progress against their stated Strategic Objectives (discussed later
in this CD&A) is completed by the Compensation Committee based on input provided by the Chief Executive
Officer. The Compensation Committee ultimately makes the compensation decisions for all of the Officers, based
on the Committee members’ own collective experience and business judgment.

Performance Sensitivity Analysis
To ensure pay “at-risk” is consistent with philosophy and
comparator group practices; a significant majority of pay
should be “at-risk.”
To understand whether internal pay differences are reasonable
between executive levels and consistent with market practice.
The Compensation Committee also considers scope and
accountability of the role in determining reasonable
differences for internal compensation rates.
To understand the purpose and amount of each pay
component as well as the sum of all compensation elements
in order to gauge the reasonableness and the total potential
expense.
To ensure that pay is aligned with performance and set
appropriately given industry performance and pay rates.
To understand potential payments assuming various company
performance outcomes; understand how potential performance
extremes are reflected in pay; a component of our
compensation risk assessment.
2010 Compensation.
While the amount of compensation may differ among our Officers, the compensation policies and factors
affecting the amounts, as considered by the Compensation Committee, are generally the same for each of our
Officers, including our Chief Executive Officer. In this section, we discuss the Compensation Committee’s
considerations with respect to each element of compensation paid in 2010.
Base Salary. The Compensation Committee considered the compensation levels of comparable positions in
the survey data as a general guidepost in setting base salaries, but also considered individual performance, tenure
and experience, the overall Company performance, any retention concerns, individual historical compensation and
input from other Board members. Based on these considerations, the Compensation Committee implemented
certain salary adjustments in 2010 to more closely align the salaries of our Officers with base salaries offered to
similarly positioned senior executives at our peer companies. While the Compensation Committee has not adopted
a policy with regard to the internal relationship of compensation among the Officers or other employees, this
relationship is reviewed and discussed when the Compensation Committee determines total compensation for our
Officers. The increases in base salaries earned in 2010 from those earned in 2009 were as follows:

With the exception of Randy Engel and Brian Hill, the salary increases ranged from 3% to 5%. Because Randy
Engel serves in a unique role that incorporates various company functions, the Compensation Committee
determined that an above average increase was appropriate in recognition of the added scope of his role and
his sustained performance. Brian Hill transferred from Australia to the U.S. in 2009 and the reduction in the pay rate
is primarily related to him becoming eligible for the U.S. Pension Plan, rather than the superannuation benefits in
Australia.

Short-Term Non-Equity Incentive Compensation.
Short-Term Incentive Compensation Highlights
(cid:129) Comprised of two components:
(cid:129) Corporate Performance Bonus (50% of the total short-term incentive opportunity); and
(cid:129) Strategic Objectives Bonus (50% of the total short-term incentive opportunity).
Short-term non-equity incentives include a Corporate Performance Bonus and a Strategic Objectives Bonus.
Each is expressed as a percentage of base salary. The Corporate Performance Bonus has a target level and the
Strategic Objectives Bonus has a maximum level, leaving the Board full discretion to decrease the maximum level.
The total of the target Corporate Performance Bonus and 50% of the maximum Strategic Objectives Bonus is
designed to achieve between the 50th and 75th percentile of the peer data for total short-term compensation, as
described above.

Corporate Performance Bonus.
Corporate Performance Bonus Highlights
(cid:129) Annual Company financial and operational measures;
(cid:129) Payment based on overall Corporate performance;
(cid:129) Payment ranges from 0-200% of target Corporate performance;
(cid:129) Five of seven measures performed near target or above target levels;
(cid:129) Low or no payment for the two measures that were below target levels; and
(cid:129) Weighted performance resulted in an award of 124.3% of target payment.
The Corporate Performance Bonus provides an annual reward based on seven publicly-reported measures1
designed to balance short-term and long-term factors, business performance and successful investment in and
development of Company assets. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the performance metrics and
target levels of performance annually. The amounts of 2010 Corporate Performance Bonuses earned by the Officers
are shown in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table. The
metrics that the Compensation Committee established for 2010 are listed below.
31
Corporate Performance
Bonus Measure(1)
Equity Production
What It Is
Why It Is Used
Measures the ounces of gold
and pounds of copper
produced each year
(cid:129) Production of gold and copper is the basis
of Newmont’s business. Production is the
primary factor within the Company’s
control.
(cid:129) The metric also provides incentive to
bring various projects into production in a
timely manner.
Costs Applicable to Sales
Measures the costs of
producing an ounce of gold
and pound of copper
(cid:129) The cost metric balances the production
metric by encouraging efficient, safe
production.
Capital Expenditures
Reserves and Non-Reserve
Mineralization
Measures actual capital
expense against the planned
capital investments for the
year, as approved by the
Board. The target includes
assumptions for variables
such as commodities prices,
currency fluctuation, and
deferral or acceleration of
projects. At the end of the
year, the actual impact of
these variables is determined,
and the target is adjusted up
or down, accordingly.
Measures the proven and
probable mineral reserves
(Reserves) as well as the
mineralization not yet proven
to the level required for
public disclosure (Non-
Reserve Mineralization)
(cid:129) The cost metric is designed to promote
implementation of Company-wide cost
control measures.
(cid:129) As a capital intensive business, the capital
expenditure metric focuses on efficient
utilization of capital in developing and
completing projects. Efficient use of
capital impacts the years to payback and
the overall long-term return of the project.
(cid:129) The Reserves and Non-Reserve
Mineralization metrics promote the
discovery of new deposits and the
successful completion of the work needed
to report these as reserves and non-reserve
mineralization. In a business that depletes
its resources every year through
production, the ability to maintain reserve
levels is a substantial challenge, but
necessary for sustainability.
(1) For Equity Production and Costs Applicable to Sales, both gold and copper are measured separately. In addition, Reserves and Non-Reserve
Mineralization are also measured separately, resulting in a total of 7 measures.
Calculation of Corporate Performance Bonuses. The 2010 targets were a mix of demanding financial,
production, and reserve/non-reserve mineralization targets derived from the annual business planning process. It is
the Compensation Committee’s perspective that the target should be challenging, yet achievable, and the target is
structured accordingly. Over the past 10 years, the Company bonus plan has paid below target in four years, which
we consider as one measure of the level of difficulty of achieving a target award.
If the Company achieves its targeted performance for each of the metrics, the payout percentage for the
Corporate Performance Bonus is 100%. If the minimum amounts are not achieved for a particular metric (the
“threshold”), no Corporate Performance Bonus is payable for that metric. For performance between the threshold
and maximum for any metric, the amount is prorated to result in a payout percentage between 50% and 200%. The
slope of the bonus payout range increases upon reaching target performance in an effort to provide a stronger
32
incentive and reward for outperforming the targets. Below target performance, upon reaching the threshold level,
the incremental payout for each increment of performance remains moderate, ensuring an appropriate incentive and
reward while not compensating beyond the reasonable amount for the given level of performance.

While the Compensation Committee may exercise discretion regarding cash bonus awards under the Corporate
Performance Bonus Plan, all of the Officers received cash bonus awards based solely on the formula funding results
prescribed by the bonus structure as stated above.
To calculate the Corporate Performance Bonus for each of the Officers, the relevant target percentage of base
salary was multiplied by 124.3%.
The targets for 2011 Corporate Performance Bonus had not been finalized as of the date of filing of this Proxy
Statement.
Strategic Objectives Bonus.
Strategic Objectives Bonus Highlights
(cid:129) Individualized strategic objectives established for each Officer by the Compensation Committee;
(cid:129) Objectives support long-term sustainability and performance;
(cid:129) Incorporates the leadership areas of people and organizational development, safety, operational execution
and efficiency, corporate sustainability and financial strength;
(cid:129) Objectives are pre-approved by the Compensation Committee;
(cid:129) May be single or multi-year; and
(cid:129) Payments based on discretion and reasoned business judgment of the Compensation Committee as a percent
of maximum.
33
The purpose of the Strategic Objectives Bonus is to align personal performance with key individualized
strategic objectives that will support the long-term sustainability and performance of the Company. The strategic
objectives encompass the broad spectrum of responsibilities inherent in senior leadership roles and in many cases,
do not have immediate or tangible measures. The Strategic Objectives component of the executive compensation
program provides for a well-rounded assessment of executive performance, resulting in an improved correlation
of pay and performance. Specifically, the program serves to provide the ability to:
(cid:129) Holistically consider performance against a broad set of strategic, operational, environmental, social and
financial business goals;
(cid:129)
Incentivize and reward efforts that are difficult to quantify, but provide long-term stockholder value;
(cid:129) Reward for timely adjustments to business dynamics not anticipated prior to the performance period;
(cid:129) Consider the multitude of complex factors that can affect performance inside and outside of management’s
control for the purpose of assessing performance and providing appropriate compensation (e.g., economic
cycles, market volatility, and fluctuations in commodities prices);
(cid:129) Take an extended long-term perspective ensuring directional alignment of current performance with the
vision of the organization’s future;
(cid:129) Control the potential risk of sub-optimized results due to a focus on set goals which may no longer be a key
priority; and
(cid:129) Differentiate awards based on a broad perspective of an individual’s contribution to the Company.
The Strategic Objectives Bonus is not formulaic given the difficulty in explicitly quantifying the aggregate
performance. Accordingly, payments under this program are awarded at the discretion of the Compensation
Committee pursuant to the qualified business judgment of its members. The Compensation Committee can award
payments out of a total bonus opportunity assigned to each Officer based upon their overall performance on the
variety of business objectives. To assist the Compensation Committee’s understanding of each individual’s
achievements, the Compensation Committee receives a year-end performance assessment and recommendation
for each of the Officers (except for the Chief Executive Officer) from the Chief Executive Officer. For the Chief
Executive Officer, the Board of Directors determines the Strategic Objectives Bonus based on his performance
against the stated strategic objectives for the year, as well as other factors potentially not contemplated prior to the
start of the year. While the Strategic Objectives Bonus is based on pre-established individual Strategic Objectives,
these pre-established individual Strategic Objectives do not constitute performance measures the achievement of
which automatically results in specific payout levels, but instead provide a context for the Board and Compensation
Committee to evaluate each Officer’s performance and contributions to the Company’s success when making the
bonus payout determinations.
The Board designated several common Strategic Objectives for each Officer in 2010, and also designated
Strategic Objectives tailored to each Officer’s specific role. The common Strategic Objectives for the Officers in
2010 included:
(cid:129) People, Our Most Valued Resource — Retain, Develop and Attract Employees;
(cid:129) Operational and Project Planning and Execution — Deliver On Our Plans in a Safe and Environmentally
and Socially Responsible Manner;
(cid:129) Sustainability through Financial Strength and Flexibility and through Growth — Think and Invest
Strategically; and
(cid:129) Leverage, Scope and Scale — Create Operating and Business Efficiencies.
34
Regarding the common Strategic Objectives, the efforts of the Officers resulted in the following achievements:
targets in areas of performance management and talent development were exceeded; good progress was made on
implementation of safety and Community Relationships Review programs; operating targets were generally met or
exceeded; excellent liquidity and balance sheet strength were achieved; cost savings, productivity and efficiency
were enhanced through business process improvements.
While no single Strategic Objective is either material to an understanding of the Company’s compensation
policies relating to the Strategic Objective Bonus program or dispositive in the Compensation Committee’s
decisions regarding the specific payout levels, in determining the awards for 2010, the Compensation Committee
considered the following key accomplishments of each Officer, in each case concluding that the Officer had
successfully achieved and often exceeded the stated Strategic Objectives:
(cid:129) Richard O’Brien: led efforts to promote cultural changes with the objective of positioning the Company to
deliver high performance over the long-term, such as through enhancing the Company’s safety mindset and
improving planning capabilities; enhanced governmental and external relationship programs; positioned
the Company’s environmental and social responsibility programs as competitive strengths through sound
environmental performance and enhanced programs; fully established the foundation of the ongoing
Community Relationships Review Program; increased the Company’s Human Resources capabilities,
including improved succession planning, management training and employee engagement; delivered on
the Company’s business plans in a safe, environmentally and socially responsible manner; refined the
Company’s overall strategic plans, including defining the appropriate mix between internal projects/
development opportunities and external merger/acquisition opportunities; managed the Company’s
divestiture obligations and external relationships relating to the Company’s interest in the Batu Hijau
mine in Indonesia; improved the Company’s financial strength and flexibility; and implemented programs
to achieve operational efficiency.
(cid:129) Russell Ball: ensured access to capital and financial flexibility; eliminated waste and maximized value of
assets through Business Excellence programs, such as Continuous Improvement and creation of a
Management Operating System; successfully strengthened Newmont’s balance sheet; and successfully
completed the integrations for the supply chain, information technology, accounting and tax functions.
(cid:129) Randy Engel: developed and led a planning initiative, making changes to allow increased understanding of
the direction of the business, promoting focused analysis of results and options around alternative plan
decisions; identified and analyzed several growth opportunities; enhanced Newmont’s Investor Relations
function; and improved bench strength in the groups he oversees.
(cid:129) Brian Hill: delivered on targeted operating metrics in-line with expectations despite geotechnical events
and ore grade reconciliation issues; deployed the Business Excellence programs resulting in cost reductions
and operational improvements; established and led the Company’s Safety Task Force; and improved
leadership bench strength.
(cid:129) Guy Lansdown: built and led exploration programs that delivered above targets; successfully advanced key
development and exploration projects, including the Conga project in Peru and the Akyem project in
Ghana; reinstituted innovation and research and development to advance Newmont’s technical practices.
The Compensation Committee considered each Officer’s performance and key accomplishments listed above
in determining his bonus amount. In most cases, each of the Officers successfully achieved and often exceeded the
stated objectives. Based on these reviews, the overall performance of the Company, and recommendations from
Richard O’Brien in the case of Russell Ball, Randy Engel, Brian Hill and Guy Lansdown, each of the Officers
received the following amounts:

Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation.
Long-term Equity Incentive Compensation Highlights
(cid:129)
Includes three performance-based elements:
(cid:129) Financial Performance Stock Bonus;
(cid:129) Stock Options; and
(cid:129) Performance Leveraged Stock Units.
Mix of Equity Incentive Components. Each component of the long-term equity incentive represents one-
third of the total equity opportunity. Three elements are used to balance long-term financial, operational and share
price performance, as well as to balance incentives for company and peer group performance.
Equity Award Target Values. The Compensation Committee designed target values of equity incentives
for each Officer based upon competitive market data to achieve the target range as discussed above. The
Compensation Committee has determined that all of the Officers, with the exception of the Chief Executive
Officer, should have the same target as a percentage of salary for 2010 to balance competitiveness of compensation
with teamwork and relative contributions to Newmont’s success. These target values are expressed as a percentage
of base salary as follows:

Determination of Awards. Equity awards are granted by the Board of Directors, based upon the
recommendation of
the
Compensation Committee is responsible for determining who should receive awards, when the awards should
be made, the exercise price/purchase price per share and the number of shares to be granted for each award, in
accordance with Newmont’s policy with Respect to the Granting of Equity Compensation (as described below). The
Compensation Committee considers grants of long-term incentive awards to the Officers each fiscal year, usually at
meetings scheduled shortly after the release of quarterly earnings, in which case, financial performance and
potentially other material items have already been disclosed publicly, prior to the granting of any awards.

Criteria Considered in Determining the Amount of Equity-Based Compensation Awards. The
Compensation Committee considers several factors in its determination as to the amount of equity awards to grant
to our Officers, including market practice, projected business needs, the projected impact on stockholder dilution,
and the associated compensation expense that will be included in our financial statements. Based on these
36
considerations, the Compensation Committee has managed stockholder dilution well within the norms of our peers
and stated guidelines from proxy advisory services and institutional investors. For 2010, Newmont’s net dilution
(net annual use of shares as a percentage of shares outstanding) was 0.4%, well below the median of our peer group
of 1.0%.
Equity Awards Granted in 2010. In 2009, the Compensation Committee conducted an in-depth analysis of
the Company’s executive pay positioning with the assistance of its independent consultant, Cook & Co. The data
indicated a significant gap in long-term incentive compensation versus our peer group. Based on these findings, the
Compensation Committee designed a new long-term incentive equity vehicle for 2010 in an effort to bridge the gap
to the targeted pay position and further align executive compensation to long-term Company and share price
performance. This new program, Performance Leveraged Stock Units, rewards executives for absolute share price
growth over the measurement period and for total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance relative to the TSR peer
group.
Awards granted in 2010 were determined in accordance with the terms of each long-term incentive plan as
approved by the Compensation Committee. In the case of stock options, the awards were also based upon each
Officer’s individual performance.
Newmont’s Policy with Respect to the Granting of Equity Compensation. Equity awards are
granted by the Board of Directors, based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee.
Financial Performance Stock.
Financial Performance Share Highlights
(cid:129) Provides long-term focus on key operational and financial measures that drive Company success;
(cid:129) Supports linearity in production, supporting stable and predictable long-term results;
(cid:129) Performance basis is the weighted average of the Corporate Performance Bonus over three years;
(cid:129) Performance is weighted 20% for 2008, 30% for 2009, 50% for 2010;
(cid:129) Shares are set at the beginning of the performance period, so pay is “at-risk” to changes in share price over
the performance period; and
(cid:129) Weighted payout for 2010 was 126.7% of the target award.
The Financial Performance Stock Bonus is tied to overall Company performance in two ways:
(cid:129) The target grant is set in number of shares, versus dollars, so that the Officer is “at-risk” to changes in share
price over the performance period.
(cid:129) Target shares are set by dividing the Officer’s eligible wages by the average Newmont share price for
the month prior to the performance period.
(cid:129) The number of shares granted at the end of the performance period is based upon the three year weighted
average of the Corporate Performance Bonus metrics and can range from 0% to 200% of target.
For the 2010 Financial Performance Stock Bonus, the payout factor was 126.7%, calculated as shown below:

One third of the Financial Performance Stock Bonus was paid in common shares on the date of actual grant
(February 28, 2011) and two-thirds of the Financial Performance Stock Bonus will be paid in restricted stock units
that vest in equal annual increments on the second and third anniversaries from the date of grant (February 28, 2012
and 2013).
The Company accrues cash dividend equivalents on restricted stock units and pays them upon vesting when
common stock is issued.
Stock Option Awards.
(cid:129) Directly align executive Officers and stockholder interests;
Stock Option Highlights
(cid:129) Performance-based, at-risk incentive as the executive does not receive any benefit unless the stock price
rises after the date of grant;
(cid:129) Further performance-based as the award size is also subject to the Officer’s performance;
(cid:129) Exercise price is equal to the fair market value on the date of grant;
(cid:129) Awards are only granted at predetermined Compensation Committee meeting dates; and
(cid:129) Awards vest over three years, sale of shares after exercise is subject to each executive meeting Newmont’s
stock ownership requirements.
The stock option vehicle rewards executives for growth in the value of Company stock over the long-term. This
is the high-risk, high-return component of the executive total compensation program because stock options deliver
value to an executive only if the share price is above the grant price after the date of vesting. Therefore, stock price
volatility will have a greater impact on total compensation results delivered from stock options as compared to
restricted stock units.
Each Officer has a target percent of base salary to be awarded in options. The Compensation Committee has
discretion to grant above or below the target, with management’s recommendation that individuals with high
personal performance should receive a grant above target. In April 2010, all of the Officers received at least the
targeted amount of stock options, as well as additional options in recognition of high personal performance during
2009. The Compensation Committee makes recommendations regarding the amount of option grants, and such
recommendations are ratified by the full Board. The 2010 option grants were based upon the Compensation
Committee’s subjective evaluation of each Officer’s performance as measured against 2009 Strategic Objectives. In
this context, the Compensation Committee considered the following key accomplishments of each Officer, in each
case concluding that the Officer had successfully achieved and often exceeded the stated Strategic Objectives:
38
(cid:129) Richard O’Brien: improved company work environment to allow retention and attraction of high
performing employees; delivered on Company business plans in a safe en environmentally and
socially responsible manner; successfully implemented strategic business plans related to the
Boddington mine in Australia; refined the Company’s overall strategic plans; implemented plans to
achieve operational efficiency and improved the Company’s financial strength and flexibility through
successful capital markets transactions.
(cid:129) Russell Ball: successfully completed the capital effectiveness program; exceeded goal
to provide
additional liquidity for improved financial strength and flexibility through a two billion dollar debt
offering and a $1.3 billion equity issuance; successfully completed integrations for supply chain,
information technology, accounting and tax functions; and led an operating review for improved
efficiencies.
(cid:129) Randy Engel: led the successful closing of a number of transactions, including the acquisition of the
outstanding ownership interest
identified other growth opportunities;
implemented improved process for earnings communications and other investor engagements; and led
the re-engineering project for the planning function.
in the Boddington project;
(cid:129) Brian Hill: deployed the business excellence program resulting in $140 million of cost reductions and
operational improvements; established Management Operating System designed to drive organizational
efficiency; launched Newmont’s safety journey; improved leadership bench strength; and delivered solid
operating results.
(cid:129) Guy Lansdown: successfully executed key development and exploration projects including the Boddington
project in Australia and the Conga project in Peru; exceeded the number of planned due diligence reviews;
completed projects that are expected to result in overachieving on the non-reserve mineralization and
reserve growth targets; reinstituted innovation and research and development to advance Newmont’s
operating practices.
To determine the exact number of options to grant, the Company divides the percentage of base salary for the
grant by the Black Scholes value on the date of grant, which was $20.01 for 2010.
The stock option exercise price granted by Newmont (i.e. not an option assumed or granted in relation to an
acquisition) is the average of the high and low sales share price on the date of grant.

2010 Performance Leveraged Stock Units (PSUs).
PSU Compensation Highlights
(cid:129) Long-term pay-for-performance vehicle based on:
(cid:129) Newmont’s share price performance versus peers; and
(cid:129) Absolute share price growth over the performance period.
(cid:129) Contains a baseline to support retention and succession planning in down commodity cycles;
(cid:129) Performance Period is three years; and
(cid:129)
2010 performance resulted in a weighted payout of 174.7% of target.
The Performance Leveraged Stock Units (“PSUs”) align Officer compensation to long-term Company and
stock price performance. The number of PSUs earned is determined at the end of a three-year performance period
based upon the change in Newmont’s stock price and the relative performance of Newmont’s stock price versus the
peer group. Payment for the PSU program can range from 50% to 200% in total, as detailed below.
Determining PSU Awards. The calculation of the PSU awards is based on the Target Stock Bonus, Market
Payout Factor and the TSR Payout Factor:
PSU Award = Target Stock Bonus x (Market Payout Factor + TSR Payout Factor)
(cid:129) Target Stock Bonus. The target stock bonus for each Officer is calculated by multiplying the Officer’s base
salary by their target PSU award percentage. This value is then divided by the average daily closing price for the
fourth quarter prior to the performance period (the “baseline”).
Target Stock Bonus = (base salary x target %) / baseline
(cid:129) Market Payout Factor (“MPF”). The MPF is based on the absolute stock price change versus the baseline
over the three year performance period. The baseline is compared to the average daily closing price of the last
quarter of the performance period to determine the overall stock price change.
The payment for the MPF can range from a minimum of 50% to a cap of 150% of target based on the absolute
stock price performance during the performance period. A minimum award of 50% of target is provided for
retention, succession and competitive pay purposes. The minimum award is also provided in recognition that
significant stock price declines may be related to changes in commodities prices which are outside of the
Company’s control. Conversely, Officers can earn up to 150% of target to incent performance. The award is
capped at 150% in recognition that significant stock price appreciation may be related to changes in commodities
prices. This range of payment is believed to strike an appropriate balance between retention, incentive and
mitigation of excessive risk. The performance range is displayed in the graph below.

Stock Price Performance versus Baseline
(cid:129) TSR Payout Factor (“TPF”). The TPF is based on the relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) of
Newmont over the three- year performance period versus the TSR of an index of gold mining peer companies. The
stock prices used in the TPF calculation are based on the same approach as noted for the MPF, however the
calculation also adjusts for dividends paid during the period.
40
The payment for the TPF can range from 0 to 50% of target based on Newmont’s relative share price
performance. Newmont’s stock price must reach at least threshold performance for Officers to receive any level of
payment. Threshold performance under the TPF is defined as the median (50th percentile) TSR of the peer group
index. Upon exceeding the peer group median TSR, each percent increase above the median TSR corresponds to a
payment equal to 2% of target, up to a maximum of 50%. This 2% multiplier is used to incent over-achievement yet
make the maximum award realizable without incenting excessive risk taking. For example, if Newmont’s TSR
percentile ranking reaches the 60th percentile (10% above the median), the resulting payment would be 20% of
target (10% above the median X 2% multiplier).

TSR Percentile Performance
In sum, the maximum PSU payout of 200% of the target PSUs would be awarded if the Company’s stock price
at the end of the performance period equals 150% of the baseline and if the Company’s TSR reaches the 75th
percentile of the peer group. If the Company’s TSR is at or below the median of the peer group, there will be no
payout of PSUs for the TPF (TSR) metric.
Implementation of PSUs in 2010. In addition to the three-year PSU target set in 2010 which will result in
payouts in 2013, in 2010 the Company set one-time target PSU awards for each participant equal to the value of the
2010 target award. The Compensation Committee implemented initial one- and two-year periods (“feather-in
awards”; award values were weighted at one-third and two-thirds of the three-year values) to provide a transition
into the new long-term program, allowing executives the opportunity to earn PSUs prior to early 2013, which is the
payout date of the first full three-year PSU performance period.
PSU Peer Group. The companies in the TSR peer group are listed below, and may be altered from time to
time due to mergers, acquisitions or at the discretion of the Compensation Committee:
Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd
Anglogold Ltd
Barrick Gold Corp
Compania De Minas Buenaventura SA
Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Inc
Goldcorp Inc
Gold Fields Ltd
Harmony Gold Mining Co Ltd
Kinross Gold Corp
Newcrest Mining Ltd
Yamana Gold Inc
The TSR peer group varies from the total compensation peer group because the TSR peer group is comprised
of only companies with large gold mining operations and irrespective of comparable company size. The
Compensation Committee determined that a relative TSR peer group should focus on gold operations entities,
as those are the Company’s direct competitors for investors. The total compensation peer group includes companies
total assets, market
without gold operations, but those entities are more similar in revenue, net income,
capitalization and number of employees. The Compensation Committee determined that
the total
compensation peer group is a superior peer group for total compensation, rather than the TSR peer group,
because the entities in the total compensation peer group are the Company’s competitors for employees and whose

Post-Employment Compensation.
In order to alleviate concerns that may arise in the event of an employee’s separation from service with us and
enable employees to focus on Company duties while employed by us, the Company has a package of post-
employment compensation plans and policies in place that
include Company funded benefits as well as
employee-contribution benefits. Our post-employment compensation plans and policies provide for broad
range of post-employment benefits to our employees, including Officers, and create strong incentives for
employees to remain with the Company. The Company’s decisions regarding post-employment compensation
take into account the industry sector and general business comparisons to ensure post-employment compensation is
aligned with the broader market.
Retirement. On a regular basis, usually every three years, the Company reviews its retirement benefits. The
purpose of the review is to assess the level of replacement income that the Company’s retirement plans provide for a
full career Newmont employee. The Company attempts to maintain a competitive suite of retirement benefits that
accomplishes income replacement post retirement. The level of income replacement varies depending on the
income level of the employee. Those employees at lower-income levels enjoy much higher levels of income
replacement with the Company retirement benefits package, compared to higher-income level employees. The
42
benefits included in the analysis are the pension plan, pension equalization plan, 401(k) matching contribution and
social security benefits. The Company retirement benefits are important hiring and retention tools for all levels of
employees within the Company.
The Company offers two tax-qualified retirement plans, the Pension Plan, which is a defined benefit plan and
the Savings Plan, which is a defined contribution plan (401(k)). Both of these plans are available to a broad range of
Company employees, generally including all salaried U.S. based employees. Because of the qualified status of the
Pension Plan and Savings Plan, the Internal Revenue Code limits the benefits available to highly-compensated
employees. As a result, the Company provides a non-qualified defined benefit plan (Pension Equalization Plan) and
a non-qualified savings plan (Savings Equalization Plan) for highly-compensated employees who are subject to the
Internal Revenue Code limitations in the qualified plans. The two equalization plans are in place to give employees
the full benefit intended under the qualified plans by making them whole for benefits otherwise lost as a result of
Internal Revenue Code annual compensation limits.
See the Pension 2010 Benefits Table and 2010 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table for a description
of benefits payable to the Officers under the Pension Plan, Pension Equalization Plan and the Savings Equalization
Plan.
Change of Control. The Company recognizes that the potential for a change of control can create
uncertainty for its employees that may result in loss or distraction of executives during a critical period. As a
result, the Company adopted the Executive Change of Control Plan of Newmont (“Change of Control Plan”) to
retain executives and their critical capabilities to enhance and protect the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders during an actual or threatened change of control. When the Company adopted the original Change of
Control Plan in 1998, the Compensation Committee at the time determined that the level of benefits in the plan were
competitive within the mining industry. The levels of benefits provided in the Change of Control Plan are intended
to motivate and retain key executives during an actual or threatened change of control.
In the event of a Change of Control, as defined in the Plan, and a qualifying termination of employment, the
Officers receive three times annual pay and other benefits. See the Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change
of Control section for potential amounts payable to the Officers under the Change of Control Plan. These benefits,
paid upon termination of employment following a change of control on what is sometimes referred to as a “double-
trigger” basis, provide incentive for executives to remain employed to complete the transaction and provide
compensation for any loss of employment thereafter.
The Company’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan generally provides for vesting of unvested restricted stock and stock
options upon a change of control of the Company. This provision does not apply to Performance Leveraged Stock
Units or Mr. O’Brien’s October 31, 2008 grant of restricted stock units and stock options. The cash bonus plan
provides for payment of pro-rated target Corporate Performance Bonuses and Strategic Objectives Bonuses upon a
change of control. These single trigger events upon a change of control of the Company provide immediate
compensation to executives in the forms of cash (Corporate Performance Bonus/Strategic Objectives Bonus) and
vesting of outstanding equity (Financial Performance Shares/options). In the case of cash bonuses, the amounts
represent a pro-rated target amount commensurate with the portion of the year that the Officer worked prior to the
change of control. In the case of equity, the outstanding equity represents equity that the Officer already earned, but
was not yet vested (Financial Performance Shares/options). These benefits, paid on what is sometimes referred to as
a “single-trigger” basis, align compensation directly with stockholder interests at the time of acquisition to
complete the transaction on favorable terms and recognize the decreased probability that the executives will retain
the ability to impact share price after the change of control.
Severance. The Severance Plan of Newmont (“Severance Plan”) provides a certain number of weeks of
salary and pro-rated annual cash bonus (at target levels) to U.S. domestic salaried employees of the Company
following involuntary termination. Officers O’Brien, Ball, Hill, Engel, and Lansdown are all salaried employees of
the Company and thus eligible to participate in the Severance Plan. The purpose of the Severance Plan is to provide
basic income and benefit replacement for a period of weeks following employment termination, where termination
is not due to an employee’s poor performance or misconduct. The Severance Plan allows the terminated employee
time and resources to seek future employment.
43
See the Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control section for potential amounts payable to
the Officers under the Severance Plan.
Officer’s Death Benefit. The Company maintains group life insurance for the benefit of all salaried
employees of the Company. In addition, for highly-compensated executives, including the Officers, the Company
provides a supplemental Officer Death Benefit Plan. The purpose of the Officer Death Benefit Plan is to provide
benefits to Officers of the Company beyond the maximum established in the Company’s group life insurance, as
appropriate to their higher income levels.
See the Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control section for potential amounts payable to
the Officers under the Officer Death Benefit Plan.
Executive Agreements.
All of the Officers are at-will employees of the Company, without employment agreements.
Other Policies and Considerations.
Executive Compensation Risk Assessment.
We believe that Newmont’s compensation program for the Chief Executive Officer and Officers is structured in
a way that balances risk and reward, yet mitigates the incentive for excessive risk taking. Through a thoughtful
balance of performance vehicles, such as performance-based equity denominated in restricted stock units, there is a
meaningful level of performance incentives without excessive leverage. Additionally, through discussions with the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as reviewing planning projections, the
Compensation Committee gains valuable insight
regarding the reasonable range of future performance
expectations, which is considered in determining the funding structures of incentive plans.
Beyond prudent plan design and compensation policies, in 2009, the Compensation Committee conducted a
comprehensive risk assessment of the Company’s executive compensation program. The Company has a global
Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) team, led by the Company’s Vice President and Treasurer. One of the ERM
team’s objectives is to conduct the compensation risk assessment and report on the process and findings to the
Compensation Committee and the Audit Committee, as well as the full Board of Directors. In 2009, the ERM team
reviewed the executive compensation program, identified risk factors in compensation plans that may lead to
excessive risk taking (meaning risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company) by
executives, made an initial assessment as to whether the Company’s compensation program includes risk factors
that may lead to excessive risk taking, and assessed the design features in the compensation program that moderate
the potential for excessive risk-taking in the short and long-term.
In November 2009, the team reported to the Compensation Committee that the current analysis of the
Company’s compensation program did not uncover risk factors that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse
effect on the Company. The Compensation Committee agreed with the conclusions of the risk assessment. This
analysis was revalidated in 2010 upon review of the ERM team. The risk assessment of the compensation program
will be an ongoing process for the ERM team.
Accelerated Vesting of Stock Awards.
Change of Control. A change of control will have certain immediate effects on stock awards granted to
Officers. Immediately prior to a change of control, among other things:
(cid:129) Financial Performance Stock Bonuses: all restrictions applicable to outstanding Financial Performance
Stock Bonuses will lapse;
(cid:129) Stock Options: all outstanding options will become fully exercisable and those options will remain
exercisable until at least the first anniversary of any termination of the holder’s employment or service
within one year after the change of control, subject to any earlier expiration date of those options; and
44
(cid:129) PSUs: PSU performance will be measured using the change of control price of the Company stock. The
pro-rata percentage of the actual payout of PSUs correlating to the period of time that elapsed prior to the
change of control shall be granted in common stock. For the remainder of the actual PSUs correlating to the
performance period that did not elapse prior to the change of control, the Company will issue restricted
stock units that will vest at the end of the performance period. In the event that the acquiring company will
not issue equity, the acquiring company may issue cash equivalent awards.
The restricted stock and stock option awards to Richard O’Brien on October 31, 2008 do not vest upon a
change of control, but do vest upon any involuntary termination of employment, excluding termination for cause as
defined in the Executive Change of Control Plan.
Death/Long-Term Disability/Retirement/Severance.
(cid:129) Financial Performance Stock Bonus: Termination of employment due to death, long-term disability or
retirement under the Pension Plan (entitling the executive to immediate pension benefits) or severance
(following approval by the Executive Vice President of Human Resources and execution of a release)
triggers the immediate vesting of all Financial Performance Stock Bonuses granted to the executive.
(cid:129) Stock Options: In the event of employment termination due to death, severance (after execution of release)
or long-term disability, a pro-rata portion of the executive’s stock options (such pro-rata portion is based on
days of service from the date of grant until the date of termination of employment in relation to the full
vesting period) will immediately vest and all previously vested and accelerated vested options will be
exercisable for a period beyond termination. If an executive retires and is entitled to an immediate pension
under the Pension Plan, the executive’s unvested stock options will vest and all previously vested and
accelerated vested options will remain exercisable beyond termination for a certain period. Despite the
extension of time to exercise options after termination in the event of death, long-term disability, retirement
or severance, no option remains exercisable beyond 10 years from the date of grant.
(cid:129) PSUs: In the event of death or disability during the performance period, payout is pro-rated at target and
common stock is issued as soon as practicable. In the event of severance during the first year of the
performance period, all PSUs are forfeited. In the event of severance after the first year of the performance
period, payout is pro-rated at the lesser of target or actual performance and paid at the end of the
performance period. In the event of retirement under the Pension Plan (entitling the executive to immediate
pension benefits), the Company will issue a pro-rata award at the end of the performance period based upon
actual performance.
The restricted stock and option awards to Mr. O’Brien on October 31, 2008 vest on a pro-rated basis upon the
death or disability of Mr. O’Brien.
Granting Stock Options. The Company, at the direction of the Compensation Committee, has examined its
policies and procedures relating to the grant of stock options. The Company:
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
does not have a program, plan or practice to time stock option grants to its executives in coordination with
the release of material nonpublic information;
does not set the date of its stock option grants to newly-hired executives in coordination with the release of
material nonpublic information;
does not plan to time, nor has it timed, the release of material nonpublic information for the purpose of
affecting the value of executive compensation; and
does not have a program, plan or practice related to setting stock option prices based on the value of the
Company’s stock on a date other than the stock option’s actual grant date.
The Company has a written policy governing the grant of stock options. The policy applies equally to grants of
stock options to executives and other employees. The policy provides, among other things, that:
(cid:129)
the Company will not time release of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value
of executive compensation;
45
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
stock options will be granted only by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee designated
under the applicable stock plan, and authority to grant options will not be delegated to management;
stock options will be priced at fair market value on the day of the grant (as defined in the Company’s stock
plan); and,
stock options will generally be granted annually, at least three days after announcement of financial and
operations results for the first quarter of the year. In deviating from this policy, the Compensation
Committee may consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including the desirability of granting options
for new employees or granting stock options at meetings held at other times of the year.
The Company’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan defines fair market value of the stock as the average of the high and
low sales price on the date of the grant. The Company selected, and the Compensation Committee approved, this
formula to mitigate the effect of the volatility of the Company’s stock price, often a direct result of day-to-day
changes in the gold price and not factors related to Company performance. The formula does not increase the
likelihood that recipients will be granted in-the-money stock options.
Stock Ownership Guidelines. The Company’s stock ownership guidelines require that all employees
designated as “executives” for purposes of this policy (approximately 85 individuals) own shares of the Company’s
stock, the value of which is a multiple of base salary. For the Officers, the stock ownership guidelines are as follows:

Stock ownership guidelines were put in place to increase the alignment of interests between executives and
stockholders by encouraging executives to act as equity owners of the Company. The Compensation Committee sets
the ownership guidelines by considering the size of stock awards. Based upon the historic conservative levels of
stock awards to Company executives, the Compensation Committee sets the ownership guidelines at corresponding
levels. Unvested shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units and shares held in retirement accounts are
considered owned for purposes of the guidelines. The Compensation Committee reviews compliance with the
guidelines annually. Executives who are new to their positions have three years to comply with the guidelines. All of
the executives identified above are in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines.
Restrictions on Trading Stock. The Company has adopted a stock trading policy for its employees,
including the Officers. The policy prohibits certain employees from trading during specific periods at the end of
each quarter until after the Company’s public disclosure of financial and operating results for that quarter, unless
they have received the approval of the Company’s General Counsel. The Company may impose additional restricted
trading periods at any time if it believes trading by employees would not be appropriate because of developments at
the Company that are, or could be, material. In addition, the Company requires pre-clearance of trades in Company
securities for its Officers, and prohibits buying shares on margin or using shares as collateral for loans.
Perquisites. The Company’s philosophy is to provide a minimum of personal-use perquisites to its
executives. The Company seeks to provide perquisites that involve a significant business purpose. In 2010,
such business related perquisites for the Officers were: (a) country club membership for the President and Chief
Executive Officer, Richard O’Brien; and (b) personal use of administrative assistant services for Richard O’Brien.
Richard O’Brien uses the country club for substantial business purposes, including business entertainment,
meetings and dinners. In recognition of the fact that some portion of the membership is used for personal purposes,
the entire amount reimbursed is considered a perquisite, is fully taxable to Richard O’Brien, not grossed up, and
reported in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table.
46
Tax Deductibility of Compensation. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
limits the amount of compensation in excess of $1,000,000 that the Company may deduct in any one year with respect to
its Chief Executive Officer and three other most highly compensated officers (excluding the chief financial officer)
whose compensation must be included in this proxy statement because they are the most highly compensated executive
officers. There are exceptions to the $1,000,000 limitation for performance-based compensation meeting certain
requirements. The Company has not adopted a formal policy requiring all compensation to meet the exception
requirements under Section 162(m) and therefore not be subject to the $1,000,000 deductibility limitation. The Company
has decided not to implement a formal policy so that the Company can maintain flexibility in compensating Officers in a
manner designed to promote various corporate goals.
In 2010, Messrs. O’Brien, Engel, Hill and Lansdown earned amounts greater than $1,000,000, and a portion of
their salaries, bonuses, stock awards, and other compensation items are not deductible by the Company. Stock
option awards pursuant to stockholder approved plans are performance-based and are fully deductible, regardless of
the $1,000,000 limit in Section 162(m). Corporate Performance Bonuses, Strategic Objectives Bonuses and
Financial Performance Stock Bonuses do not meet the performance-based exception under Section 162(m) and are
therefore subject to the $1,000,000 deduction limit. To date, the Company has deemed the additional tax benefits
that it could receive from a Section 162(m) executive compensation plan as immaterial to the Company. However,
the Company continually assesses the materiality of additional Section 162(m) tax benefits that it could receive
from a Section 162(m) executive compensation plan as executive compensation evolves.

(1) Amounts shown represent the Strategic Objective Bonuses paid in cash.
(2) Amounts shown represent the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718. For the financial performance stock bonus, the grant date fair value is the number of shares
granted multiplied by the fair market value on the date of grant. The Company’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan defines fair market value of the
stock as the average of the high and low sales price on the date of the grant, which is the grant date fair value for the financial performance
stock bonus. The fair market values are $49.45 (February 2008), $43.19 (February 2009) and $49.64 (March 2010). Mr. O’Brien received an
additional stock grant in October 2008 with a fair market value of $26.91 per share. See 2010 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End
Table for the number of shares granted in each award. In 2010, the Company added the Performance Leveraged Stock Unit bonus program,
including a 3-year feather-in of the grants, as described in the CD&A. As a result, the stock awards for 2010, appear large due to the one-time
feathering-in process for the Performance Leveraged Stock Unit bonus program. Pursuant to FASB 718, the aggregate grant date fair value
of Performance Leveraged Stock Units is determined by a Monte Carlo simulation method, which determined a grant date fair value of
$64.55 for the 2010 grant, $67.50 for the 2010-2011 grant and $70.25 for the 2010-2012 grant.
(3) Amounts shown represent the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, which is the number of options granted multiplied by the Black Scholes value. The Black
Scholes values are $12.99 (April 2008), $12.88 (May 2009) and $20.01 (April 2010). Mr. O’Brien received an additional option grant in
October 2008 with a Black Scholes value of $8.12 per share. See 2010 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End Table for the number
of options granted in each award.
(4) Amounts shown represent Corporate Performance Bonuses paid in cash.
(5) Amounts shown represent the increase in the actuarial present value under the Company’s qualified and non-qualified defined benefit
pension plans. The change in pension value for the non-qualified pension plan increased significantly in 2010 due to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) rate change, decrease in interest rates (both Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) rates and
FASB rates) as well as increase in pay. The non-qualified pension plan (Pension Equalization Plan “PEP”) present values are based on both
the Financial Accounting Standards Board and PEP interest rates. The PEP interest rate is based upon the PBGC interest rate. At
December 31, 2010 the PBGC lump sum interest rate was 2.25%, at December 31, 2009 the PBGC lump sum interest rate was 2.50% and at
December 31, 2008 the PBGC lump sum rate is 4.75%. The PBGC rate change increased the present values of the PEP. At December 31,
2010 the FASB rate was 5.75%, at December 31, 2009 the FASB rate was 6.1% and at December 31, 2008 the FASB rate was 6.05%.
(6) Amounts shown are described in the All Other Compensation Table below.
(7) Amount includes $5,000 for salary correction from 2009, when Mr. O’Brien was underpaid $5,000 in salary due to administrative error.

(1) All calculations in the 2010 Pension Benefits Table were calculated using target Corporate Performance Bonus for 2010, and 50% of maximum Strategic Objectives Bonus.
The Company provides two tax-qualified retirement plans, a Pension Plan and a Savings Plan (401(k) plan). In
addition, the Company offers a non-qualified pension plan (the “Pension Equalization Plan”), and non-qualified
savings plan (the “Savings Equalization Plan”) for highly compensated employees.
Pension Plan. Messrs. O’Brien, Ball, Engel, Hill and Lansdown are participants in the qualified Pension
Plan. The Pension Plan is available to a broad group of Company employees, which generally includes
U.S. domestic salaried employees of the Company. The plan provides for post-retirement payments determined
by a formula based upon age, years of service and pension-eligible earnings for employees hired before January 1,
2007, called the final average pay calculation. For employees hired after January 1, 2007, the plan provides for post-
retirement payments determined by a formula based upon years of service.
Final Average Pay Calculation. Age 62 is the normal retirement age under the Pension Plan for final
average pay calculation, meaning the age upon which the employee may terminate employment and collect
benefits, or a participant may retire at age 55 with 10 years of service and collect reduced benefits immediately. If a
Pension Plan participant terminates employment prior to age 55, but has a vested benefit by having acquired 5 years
of service with the Company, the participant will begin to collect a benefit at age 62. If the participant terminates
employment prior to age 55, but has 10 or more years of service with the Company, the participant may elect to
52
collect a reduced benefit at age 55. If a participant attains the age of 48, has 10 years of service, and is terminated
from employment within 3 years of a change of control, the participant is entitled to commence benefits. The
Pension Plan utilizes the same definition of change of control as the Executive Change of Control Plan. The formula
based upon age and years of service for benefits provides a strong incentive for Company employees to remain
employed with the Company, even in times of high demand in the employment marketplace.
According to the Pension Plan, at the normal retirement age of 62, the Company calculates the monthly
pension benefit amount through the following formula:
1.75% of the average monthly salary minus (⫺) 1.25% of the participant’s
primary social security benefit times (⫻) the participant’s years of credited service
To determine the average monthly salary, the Company calculates the highest average from 5 consecutive prior
years of employment within the last 10 years of employment of regular pay, vacation pay, cash bonus and a pro-
rated severance or change of control payment, if applicable. Salary does not include stock based compensation,
foreign assignment premiums, signing bonuses, fringe benefits, payments from non-qualified plans or indemnity
benefit payments. In the event a vested participant dies prior to the commencement of benefit payments, the
participant’s legal spouse receives survivor benefits which are calculated based upon the pension benefit that the
participant would have received upon retirement the day prior to death with an additional reduction factor applied. If
the participant does not have a legal spouse, there is no benefit paid.
In the event of early retirement, meaning after reaching the age of 55 and at least 10 years of service, a
participant is eligible to collect a monthly pension benefit upon retirement using the formula above with the
following reductions:

Stable Value Calculation
For a participant in the stable value pension, benefits are determined as follows:

Services Completed

Plan Year

to and including Social
Security Wage Base
Percent of Salary
Over the Social

The stable value benefit, as of a given date, is the sum of all of the amounts accrued for each year of service.
Salary in the stable value pension is defined the same as in the final average pay pension. Normal retirement age
under the stable value pension is 65 and the vesting period is 5 years. If a stable value participant has 5 years of
service and separates employment with Newmont prior to age 65, the participant is entitled to a reduced benefit.
Under the stable value pension, participants may take their benefit in lump sum or an annuity.

Messrs. O’Brien, Ball, Engel and, Lansdown have vested benefits under the Pension Plan by virtue of five or
more years of service. Mr. Hill participates in the stable value calculation of the Pension Plan of Newmont based
upon his date of hire and he does not have vested benefits under the Pension Plan, as he does not have five years of
service with the Company.
The Pension Plan contains a cap on eligible earnings as required by the Internal Revenue Code as well as a cap
on benefits as required by section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. This cap limits the pension benefits that
executive-grade employees of the Company can receive under the Pension Plan.
Pension Equalization Plan. The Pension Equalization Plan provides for an actuarially determined present
value cash lump sum amount upon retirement at age 62, or upon termination after 5 years of service with the
Company. The Company determines the lump sum amount by calculating a full pension benefit under the Pension
Plan, utilizing the definition of Salary from the Pension Equalization Plan, and subtracting the actual benefit owed
under the Pension Plan that is subject to the cap in benefits. The definition of Salary under the Pension Equalization
Plan excludes bonus amounts in the form of restricted stock for executives hired or promoted to executive status
after January 1, 2004. In other words, if a Company executive attained executive status before January 1, 2004, that
executive will have restricted stock bonus amounts included as eligible earnings in the Pension Equalization Plan
until December 31, 2007. Any bonus amounts in the form of restricted stock after December 31, 2007 will not be
included for pension equalization benefits calculation purposes. The Company will calculate Salary for any
executive entitled to include restricted stock in the definition of salary as of December 31, 2007. When such
executive terminates employment with the Company, the executive shall receive benefits under the Pension
Equalization Plan calculated with the higher of the salary calculation as of December 31, 2007 that includes
restricted stock, or the salary calculation at the time of termination that excludes restricted stock.
If a participant dies while employed with the Company, or after retirement but before receipt of benefits under
the Pension Equalization Plan, and the participant was entitled to benefits under the Pension Plan, the participant’s
legal spouse receives survivor benefits which are calculated based upon the full Pension Equalization benefit minus
the Pension Plan benefit amount. If the Company terminates a participant for cause, the participant forfeits all
benefits under the Pension Equalization Plan.
Pension Calculation Assumptions. The qualified pension present value uses a discount rate at
December 31, 2010 of 5.75% and FASB mortality. The pension equalization value uses a pension equalization
plan lump sum rate of 2.25% as of December 31, 2010 and mortality as defined in the Pension Equalization Plan to
determine the lump sum payable at an executive’s earliest unreduced retirement age. The present value of the
qualified and pension equalization pensions are also discounted from the earliest unreduced retirement age to
current age using the FASB rate of 5.75%.

Amounts shown are part of the Company’s Savings Equalization Plan. The Company maintains a Savings Plan
and a Savings Equalization Plan for eligible employees.
Savings Plan. The Savings Plan is the Company’s defined contribution plan that is available to a broad group
of Company employees, which generally includes U.S. domestic salaried employees of the Company. The Savings
Plan provides that eligible employees may contribute before-tax or after-tax compensation to a plan account for
retirement savings. Under the Savings Plan, the Company will match 100% of the first 6% of a participant’s
contribution to the Savings Plan up to a limit of $12,000 annually. The Company contribution vests as follows:

In the event of death, disability, retirement, change of control (same definition as Executive Change of Control
Plan explained in the Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control section below) or termination of
the Savings Plan, a participant is fully vested in the Company contribution component of the Savings Plan. In
accordance with the Internal Revenue Code, the Savings Plan limits the before-tax and after-tax contributions that
highly compensated participants may make to the Savings Plan.

Savings Equalization Plan. The Savings Equalization Plan allows eligible participants the opportunity to
defer up to 100% of compensation (minus before-tax contributions under the Savings Plan) beyond the Internal
Revenue Code limitations set forth in the Savings Plan on a pre-tax basis. The Savings Equalization Plan is a non-
qualified deferred compensation plan. To participate in the Savings Equalization Plan, an employee must have a
base salary over $175,000 and be eligible to participate in the Savings Plan of Newmont. The purpose of the Savings
Equalization Plan is to allow highly compensated employees a way to defer additional compensation for post-
employment savings purposes beyond the limits set forth in the Savings Plan. A participant’s deferred compensation
is contributed at the direction of the participant to various hypothetical investment alternatives, including a
hypothetical investment in shares of Company stock. Such investments are selected by a committee of Company
representatives, with the advice of professional investment managers. Company matching contributions are
credited to a participant’s account in phantom shares of Company stock. The Company contribution in the
Savings Equalization Plan is subject to a cap of $12,000 per year (in the aggregate with any Company contribution
to the Savings Plan) for each participant. The Savings Equalization Plan contains a 4 year vesting period for the
Company contribution that is the same as for the Savings Plan.
Upon distribution of Savings Equalization Plan accounts, the participant receives a cash amount equal to the
value of the contributions if such contributions had been invested in the Savings Plan, as of the applicable valuation
date. A participant receives distribution of Savings Equalization amounts in lump-sum form, or at a pre-selected
distribution date in the future according to the provisions of the plan.
In the event a participant of the Savings Equalization Plan terminates employment with the Company due to
retirement, death or disability, or change of control, the Company contribution will vest at 100% regardless of years
of service, and the participant receives a single lump sum cash payment for the value of the accounts and Company
match as soon as administratively possible following the applicable valuation date. In the event a participant of the
Savings Equalization Plan terminates employment with the Company for any reason other than retirement, death,
change of control or disability, the participant receives a single lump sum cash payment for the value of the accounts
and the applicable percentage of vested Company match based upon years of service as provided above, as soon as
administratively possible following the applicable valuation date. A participant in the Savings Equalization Plan is
subject to the risk of decline in his or her account if the hypothetical investments chosen decline in value. In the
event the Company terminates the employment of a participant of the Savings Equalization Plan due to cause, the
participant forfeits all Company contributions under the Savings Equalization Plan.
In early 2010, the Company established a trust for participants account balances in the Savings Equalization
Plan and the Company funds the participant account balances in the trust. The assets held in this trust may be subject
to claims of the Company’s creditors in the event the Company were to file for bankruptcy.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control.
Terms of Plans: See the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section and the text following the tables for
a description of the material terms, conditions and assumptions for any of the Company’s benefit plans.
Retirement Benefits: None of the currently employed Named Executive Officers are eligible for retirement
as of December 31, 2010. However, Messrs. O’Brien, Ball, Engel and Lansdown have vested benefits under the
Pension Plan and Pension Equalization Plan. See the Pension Benefits Table for the present value of vested benefits
under these plans.
Voluntary Termination: The Named Executive Officers would receive no payments or other benefits upon
voluntary termination, except for vested benefits under the Pension Plan and Pension Equalization Plan. See the
Pension Benefits Table for the present value of vested benefits under these plans.
Termination Not For Cause: The Company’s Severance Plan provides for benefits in the case of
termination not for cause in the event of job elimination, based on salary and length of service. Certain
positions are not eligible for job elimination such as the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
positions. However, severance benefits under the Severance Plan are provided in the potential payments on the
Termination Table below for comparison purposes. According to the Severance Plan, an involuntary termination is
job elimination, plant abandonment or closing or a reduction in force. The Severance Plan provides that even if the
termination was the result of one of the circumstances stated in the prior sentence, it shall not be an involuntary
termination if the Company offers the employee another position within 75 miles of the former position, at the same
or higher base salary, and involving responsibilities of somewhat similar levels of importance to the Company as the
prior position. Involuntary termination does not include terminations as a result of poor work performance, failure
to follow policy or direction, or cause.
In the event of an involuntary termination, the eligible employee is entitled to:
(cid:129) four weeks of salary plus two weeks of additional salary for each year of service with the Company up to a
maximum of 104 weeks of salary (The Severance Plan defines salary as the higher of annual base salary or
the base salary and annual cash bonus for the year preceding termination.); and
(cid:129) pro-rated (based upon percentage of year worked) annual cash bonus paid at target; and
(cid:129) Company paid COBRA benefits and life insurance for the number of weeks of severance pay.
Termination For Cause: No additional benefits are payable in any case of termination for cause. The
Company’s plans generally define cause as: (a) willful and continued failure of participant to perform substantial
duties, follow Company policy or Company code of conduct, after written demand for substantial performance;
(b) illegal conduct, gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (c) dishonest or fraudulent conduct or breach of
contract.
Change of Control: The Company’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan provides for vesting of unvested restricted
stock and stock options upon a change of control of the Company, unless otherwise provided in an incentive plan or
award agreement, such as Mr. O’Brien’s October 2008 grant of stock and options and the PSU program that the
Company began in 2010. The cash bonus plan provides for payment of pro-rated target Corporate Performance
Bonus and Strategic Objectives Bonus upon a change of control. Additionally, the Savings Plan and Savings
Equalization Plan provide for immediate vesting of the Company matching contributions which is capped at a
cumulative total of $12,000 per year for both plans.
The Company’s Executive Change of Control Plan applies to executive grade level employees, including the
Named Executive Officers, in the event of a change of control, which is generally defined as:
1) The acquisition of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of either (a) the then outstanding shares of the
Company; or (b) the combined voting power of the then outstanding shares of the Company entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors (but not an acquisition by a Company entity or Company benefit
plan); or
2) The individuals constituting the Company’s Board of Directors on January 1, 2008 cease to constitute at
least a majority of the Board, with certain exceptions allowing the Board the ability to vote in new
members by a majority; or
3) Consummation of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale or other disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company or an acquisition of assets of another corporation. The acquisition of
assets of another corporation does not constitute a change of control if certain requirements are met to
56
evidence that the Company is the acquiring company and will conduct the business of the combined entity
going forward.
Termination After Change of Control: The Company’s Executive Change of Control Plan provides for
enhanced benefits in the case of termination within three years following change of control of the Company, in most
cases based on salary and bonus payments in previous years. The Pension Plan provides a retirement option at
age 48 with 10 years of service and a lesser reduction factor in benefits, compared to circumstances not involving a
change of control.
Executives are eligible for benefits under the Executive Change of Control Plan if terminated within three
years of a change of control or if the executive terminates for good reason within three years of change of control.
The Change of Control Plan generally defines good reason as any of the following without the executive’s prior
consent: (a) reduction in salary, bonus, stock-based compensation from the level immediately preceding the change
of control; (b) requiring the executive to relocate his or her principal place of business more than 35 miles from the
previous principal place of business; (c) failure by the employer to comply with the obligations under the Change of
Control Plan; or (d) assigning the executive duties inconsistent with the executive’s position immediately prior to
such assignment or any action resulting in the diminution of the executive’s position, authority, duties or
responsibilities.
If an executive is eligible for termination benefits under the Executive Change of Control Plan, the executive is
entitled to:
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
pro-rated bonus determined by percentage of the year worked at target level;
2 times the “annual pay” for most executives and 3 times for individuals specified by the Newmont Board.
Annual pay is defined as annual salary, annual cash bonus at the highest amount that the executive received
in the three years prior to the change of control, and the highest employer matching contribution made to
the Savings Plan on behalf of the executive in the three years prior to the change of control;
a cash amount equal to the actuarial equivalent of three years of additional benefits under the Pension Plan,
Pension Equalization Plan, Savings Equalization Plan and credit for three additional years under these
plans for purposes of actuarial calculations;
for a three year period, health, dental, vision, prescription, disability and life insurance benefits for the
executive and his or her family;
outplacement services consistent with the Company’s practices during the one-year period prior to the
change of control; and
certain gross-up payments for excise taxes on the change of control payment.
(cid:129)
Messrs. O’Brien, Ball, Engel, Hill and Lansdown participate in the Executive Change of Control Plan at the
three times annual pay level as of December 31, 2010. These individuals are designated for the enhanced benefits
because they all hold positions that would require continuity during a change of control or threatened change of
control. In addition, the positions that the designated individuals hold are at high risk for change of personnel in the
event of a change of control and the enhanced benefit provides additional incentive for such executives to stay with
the Company despite any concerns regarding a change of control.
Death: Upon the death of one of the Named Executive Officers, payment is made to the estate based on the
terms of the Officers Death Benefit Plan. The Officer’s Death Benefit Plan provides for a cash payment upon the
death of currently employed executive-level officers of the Company, as well as eligible retired executive-level
officers. The Officer Death Benefit Plan provides a lump sum cash benefit paid by the Company upon death as
follows:
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
3 times final annual base salary for an executive officer who dies while an active employee;
1 times final annual base salary for an eligible executive officer who dies after retiring at or after normal
retirement age of 62; and
30% to 90% of final annual base salary for an eligible executive officer for retirement prior to normal
retirement age, depending on the number of years remaining to normal retirement age.
Messrs. O’Brien, Ball, Engel, Hill and Lansdown are currently employed executive-level officers of the
Company, and thus eligible for the Officer Death Benefit Plan, in the event of death during employment.
57
Disability: The Company has a short-term disability plan that provides for up to five months of disability
absence with base pay depending upon the employee’s years of service with the Company. In the event of long-term
disability, the Company has an insurance plan that provides a maximum monthly benefit to executives and officers
of the Company of $13,000 per month. The maximum benefit period for the long-term disability benefit varies
depending upon the age on date of disability.
Disability Coverage: The value of disability coverage is based on the incremental additional cost to the
Company for an additional coverage. The Executive Change of Control Plan generally provides for 3 years of
disability coverage for the Named Executive Officers.
2010 Performance Bonuses: All amounts shown for Bonuses include Corporate Performance Bonuses,
Performance Leveraged Stock Bonuses and Financial Performance Stock Bonuses and are calculated at target level
for 2010 performance. The Strategic Objectives Bonuses are calculated at 50% of the maximum payout.
Accelerated Vesting of Restricted Stock and Stock Options: The amounts shown assume vesting as
of December 31, 2010 of restricted stock, restricted stock units or stock options at the December 31, 2010 closing
price of $61.43. The amounts shown do not include any vested stock awards.
Performance Leverage Stock Bonus: The amounts shown for the Performance Leveraged Stock Bonus
in the event of a Change of Control assume target payout and a stock price of $61.43 the December 31, 2010 closing
price, because there is no change of control price to determine actual payout, as contemplated by the PSU program.
Incremental Non-Qualified Pension: The amounts shown as Incremental Non-Qualified Pension are
based on 3 additional years of service credit following termination of employment in the case of change of control,
and an additional period of service based on years of service in the case of termination not for cause. All amounts
payable are based upon the same assumptions and plan provisions used in the Summary Compensation Table and
Pension Benefits Table, except that for the Termination After Change of Control calculation does not include a
present value discount.
Health Care Benefits: The value of health care benefits disclosed below is based on the incremental
additional cost to the Company for the length of coverage specified in the Severance Plan, the Executive Change of
Control Plan or Disability Plan, except that for Change of Control, the amount is determined without any present
value discount.
Life Insurance: Life insurance coverage and proceeds are provided under the terms of the Officers Death
Benefit Plan.
280G Tax Gross-Up: Upon a change of control of the Company, the executive may be subject to certain
excise taxes pursuant to Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has agreed to reimburse the
executive for all excise taxes that are imposed on the executive under Section 280G and any income taxes and excise
taxes that are payable by the executive as a result of any reimbursements for Section 280G taxes, if payment to an
individual beneficiary exceeds 110% of the safe harbor under Section 4999. If the payment to the individual does
not exceed 110% of the safe harbor under Section 4999, the change of control benefit will be reduced to fall within
the safe harbor, rather than providing an excise tax gross-up. Any 280G tax gross-up amounts reflected in the tables
below assume that the executive is entitled to a full reimbursement by the Company of any (a) excise taxes that are
imposed on the executive as a result of the change of control, (b) any income and excise taxes imposed on the
executive as a result of the Company’s reimbursement of the excise tax amount, and (c) any additional income taxes
and excise taxes that are imposed on the executive as a result of the Company’s reimbursement of the executive for
any excise or income taxes. The calculation of the 280G gross-up amount in the tables below is based upon a 280G
excise tax rate of 20%, a 35% federal income tax rate, a 1.45% Medicare tax rate and a 4.63% state income tax rate.
For purposes of the Section 280G calculation, it is assumed that no amounts will be discounted as attributable to
reasonable compensation and no value will be attributed to the executive executing a non-competition agreement.
58
The following tables describe the estimated potential payments upon termination or change of control of the
Company for the Named Executive Officers. The amounts shown assume that the termination or change of control
occurred on December 31, 2010. The actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of such
executive’s separation from the Company.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company’s executive officers and directors
and holders of greater than 10% of the Company’s outstanding common stock to file initial reports of their
ownership of the Company’s equity securities and reports of changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the New York Stock Exchange. Based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to
the Company and written representations from the Company’s executive officers and directors, the Company
believes that all Section 16(a) filing requirements were complied with in 2010, except for Thomas R. Kerr, Senior
Vice President, North American Operations, who inadvertently failed to report on a timely basis a sale of Company
shares in the Retirement Savings Plan of Newmont (401(k) plan), and Roger Johnson, Vice President and Chief
Accounting Officer, and Thomas P. Mahoney, Vice President and Treasurer, who each inadvertently failed to report
on a timely basis a distribution from the Company’s Savings Equalization Plan. The transactions described above
were subsequently filed on a late Form 4 for each officer.

Proposal No. 2 — Ratify Appointment of Auditors
Proposal.
The Audit Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) as the independent auditors for
Newmont and its subsidiaries for 2011, after evaluation of audit quality, fees, independence and other relevant
factors. PwC has served as Newmont’s independent auditors since 2002.
The Board is asking that stockholders ratify the appointment of PwC as independent auditors. If stockholders
fail to ratify the appointment of PwC, the Audit Committee may reconsider this appointment. Representatives of
PwC are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be allowed to make a statement if they wish.
Additionally, they will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders during the meeting.
Board Recommendation.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE RATIFICATION
OF PwC AS NEWMONT’S INDEPENDENT AUDITORS FOR 2011.

The Audit Committee has established procedures for engagement of PwC to perform services other than audit,
review and attest services. In order to safeguard the independence of PwC, for each engagement to perform such
non-audit service, (a) management and PwC affirm to the Audit Committee that the proposed non-audit service is
not prohibited by applicable laws, rules or regulations; (b) management describes the reasons for hiring PwC to
perform the services; and (c) PwC affirms to the Audit Committee that it is qualified to perform the services. The
Audit Committee has delegated to its Chair its authority to pre-approve such services in limited circumstances, and
any such pre-approvals are reported to the Audit Committee at its next regular meeting. All services provided by
PwC in 2010 were permissible under applicable laws, rules and regulations and were pre-approved by the Audit
Committee in accordance with its procedures. The Audit Committee considered the amount of non-audit services
provided by PwC in assessing its independence.
63
Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed entirely of directors who are not officers or
employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and are independent, as defined in the listing standards of the
New York Stock Exchange and the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Committee has adopted a
Charter that describes its responsibilities in detail. The Charter is available on the Company’s web site at
http://www.newmont.com under the Investor Relations section.
The primary responsibility for financial and other reporting, internal controls, compliance with laws and
regulations, and ethics rests with the management of the Company. The Committee’s primary purpose is to oversee
the integrity of the Company’s financial statements, the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory
requirements and corporate policies and controls, the independent auditor’s selection, retention, qualifications,
objectivity and independence, and the performance of the Company’s internal audit function. The Committee
reviews the financial information that will be provided to the stockholders and others, the systems of internal
controls that management and the Board have established, and the audit process. Additional information about the
Committee’s role in corporate governance can be found in the Committee’s charter.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”),
the Company’s independent auditors, the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2010. Management has affirmed to the Audit Committee that the financial statements were prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Audit Committee has also
reviewed and discussed the Company’s compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
The Audit Committee has discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing
Standards No. 61 (Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, AU 380). The Audit Committee has received
the disclosure and letter required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board regarding the independent accountant’s communications with the audit committee concerning independence,
and has discussed PwC’s independence with them.
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of
Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2010 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Submitted by the following members of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors:
Noreen Doyle, Chair
Vincent A. Calarco
Michael S. Hamson

Proposal No. 3 — Advisory Vote on
the Compensation of the Named Executive Officers
In accordance with the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the
“Dodd-Frank Act”), we are asking stockholders to approve an advisory resolution on compensation of our named
executive officers as described in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” the compensation tables and related
narrative discussion included in this Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as a “Say on Pay” proposal,
gives stockholders the opportunity to approve, reject or abstain from voting with respect to our fiscal 2010 executive
compensation programs and policies and the compensation paid to the named executive officers. This vote is not
intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive
officers as described in this Proxy Statement.
This proposal allows our stockholders to express their opinions regarding the decisions of the Compensation
Committee on the prior year’s annual compensation to the named executive officers. Because your vote on this
proposal is advisory, it will not be binding on us, the Board or the Compensation Committee. However, your
advisory vote will serve as an additional tool to guide the Board and the Compensation Committee in continuing to
improve the alignment of the Company’s executive compensation programs with the interests of the Company and
its stockholders, and is consistent with our commitment to high standards of corporate governance.
Proposed Resolution
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company’s named executive officers, as disclosed
pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including the
“Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” compensation tables and related-narrative discussion in this
2011 Proxy Statement, is hereby APPROVED.
Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote
on, and who vote for and against, the proposal.
Board of Directors Recommendation
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE “FOR” THE FOREGOING
RESOLUTION FOR THE REASONS OUTLINED BELOW.
Our executive compensation program is composed of salary, short-term incentives and long-term
incentives and is designed to:
(cid:129) motivate executives to achieve business goals that drive value for our shareholders;
(cid:129) provide competitive compensation opportunities to attract and retain highly qualified executives;
(cid:129) offer performance-based compensation that emphasizes Newmont’s long-term performance, including our
high safety and social responsibility standards;
(cid:129) provide a mix of cash and equity compensation based on financial and non-financial performance; and
(cid:129) provide incentives to improve performance without taking excessive risks.
Our compensation program for our named executive officers includes the following elements:
(cid:129) Long-term equity compensation has multi-year performance-based vesting. Long-term equity compensation
is designed to align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders by rewarding
management for long-term operational, financial and stock price performance — with performance-
leverage share units, financial performance stock bonus awards and stock option awards vesting over
multi-year periods;
(cid:129) Total cash compensation is tied to performance. Cash awards for the corporate performance bonus
component are based upon defined performance metrics, including production, costs applicable to sales,
capital expenditures, and reserves and non-reserve mineralization additions, in order to support annual
operating and financial performance, and cash awards for the strategic objective bonus component are based
upon measures and objectives approved in advance by the Compensation Committee, which are designed to
reward achievement of group and individual strategic objectives in support of both current initiatives and
long-term sustainability and performance of the Company; and
(cid:129) Excluding base salary, all compensation components are at-risk. The Compensation Committee and
management believe that the proportion of at-risk, performance-based compensation should rise as an
65
employee’s level of responsibility increases. As such, for our executive officers, all compensation
components (excluding base salary) are at-risk, expressed as a percentage of base salary, and designed
to drive performance within the control of management, and/or align management with long-term
performance rather than simply rewarding shorter-term performance and payout periods. We believe
that the mix and structure of compensation strikes the appropriate balance to promote long-term returns
without motivating or rewarding excessive risk taking.
We encourage you to read the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” for additional details about our
executive compensation programs, including information about the fiscal year 2010 compensation of our named
executive officers.
Proposal No. 4 — Advisory Vote on
the Frequency of Stockholders Votes on Executive Compensation
Background of the Proposal
In accordance with the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Act, companies are required to provide a separate non-
binding stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers once every six years to
determine whether the stockholders’ say-on-pay vote should occur every year, every two years or every three years.
In connection with this, we are seeking an advisory stockholder vote on whether an advisory “Say on Pay” vote
(such as Proposal No. 3) should be held every year, every two years or every three years. This proposal is commonly
known as a “Say When on Pay” or “Frequency” proposal. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that, after this initial Say
When on Pay vote is held, we submit to our stockholders another Say-When-on-Pay vote at least every six years
thereafter.
Frequency Vote on Say on Pay
We believe that it is important that our executive compensation program directly links executive compensation
to our financial performance and align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders. The
Board of Directors believes that giving our stockholders the right to cast an advisory Say on Pay vote is a good
corporate governance practice and provides the Company with valuable stockholder input on our compensation
philosophy, policies and practices.
The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee value the opinion of our stockholders and will take
into account the outcome of the vote when considering the frequency of the advisory vote. Because this Frequency
vote is advisory, however, it is non-binding on the Company and the Board of Directors may decide it is in the best
interests of the Company and the stockholders to hold an advisory Say on Pay vote on executive compensation more
or less frequently than the option approved by our stockholders.
The recommendation of the Board of Directors appears below. Stockholders may specify one of four choices
for this Proposal No. 4 on the proxy card: three years, two years, one year or abstain. Stockholders are not voting to
approve or disapprove the Board of Director’s recommendation.
Board of Directors Recommendation
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE TO HOLD A VOTE FOR A ONE-
YEAR FREQUENCY FOR THE NON-BINDING ADVISORY STOCKHOLDERS VOTE TO APPROVE
THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY’S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.
Other Matters
The Board of Directors does not intend to bring other matters before the Company’s Annual Meeting of
Stockholders, except items incident to the conduct of the meeting. However, on all matters properly brought before
the meeting by the Board of Directors or by others, the persons named as proxies in the accompanying proxy, or
their substitutes, will vote in accordance with their best judgment. Additional information about Newmont,
including its Annual Report on Form 10-K, is available through the Company’s web site, at www.newmont.com.

NEWMONT MINING CORPORATION
Notice to Exchangeable Shareholders
Our  records  show  that  you  hold  Exchangeable  Shares  of  Newmont  Mining  Corporation  of  Canada  Limited  (“Newmont  Canada”),  a 
Canadian company. The Exchangeable Shares provide you with economic and voting rights that are, as nearly as practicable,
2
equivalent  to  those  of  holders  of  shares  of  common  stock  of  Newmont  Mining  Corporation  (the  “Company”),  the  U.S.  parent  of  Newmont 
Canada,  including  the  right  to  attend  and  vote  at  meetings  of  the  common  stockholders  of  the  Company.  The  Company  will  be  holding  an
annual meeting (the “Annual Meeting”) of its common stockholders on April 19, 2011 to
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
(cid:129)
Elect directors;
Ratify the Audit Committee’s appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Newmont’s independent auditors for 2011;
Conduct an advisory vote (non-binding) on the compensation of the named executive officers;
Conduct an advisory vote on the frequency of stockholders votes on executive compensation; and
Transact such other business that may properly come before the meeting.
At such Annual Meeting you will have voting rights, based on the number of Exchangeable Shares you hold. You are permitted to instruct
Computershare Trust Company of Canada, the Trustee under a Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement as to how the Trustee is to vote your
Exchangeable Shares at the Annual Meeting of the Company. If you do not give voting instructions, the Trustee will not be entitled to exercise
the voting rights attached to your Exchangeable Shares. Alternatively, you may instruct the Trustee to give you or a person designated by you a
proxy to exercise personally the voting rights attached to your Exchangeable Shares. To instruct the Trustee as to how you wish to exercise
your voting rights, you must complete, sign, date and return the enclosed Voting Instruction Form to the Trustee by 5:00 p.m., Toronto time, on
April 18, 2011. The Trustee will not be obligated to act on any instructions received after that time.
You  have  the  right  to  revoke  any  instructions  to  the  Trustee  by  giving  written  notice  of  revocation  to  the  Trustee  or  by  executing  and
delivering to the Trustee a later-dated Voting Instruction Form. No notice of revocation or later-dated Voting Instruction Form, however, will 
be effective unless received by the Trustee prior to 5:00 p.m., Toronto time, on April 18, 2011.
Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please sign, date and return the Voting Instruction Form in the envelope provided in
order to ensure that your Exchangeable Shares will be represented at the Annual Meeting.
Non-Registered Holders
Only  registered  holders  of  Exchangeable  Shares  of  Newmont  Canada  are  permitted  to  instruct  the  Trustee  as  to  how  to  vote  their
Exchangeable Shares at the Annual Meeting or to attend and vote at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy as described above. You may be
a beneficial owner of Exchangeable Shares (a “Non-Registered Holder”) if your Exchangeable Shares are registered either:
(i)
in the name of an intermediary (an “Intermediary”) with whom you deal in respect of the Exchangeable Shares, such as, among others,
banks,  trust  companies,  securities  dealers  or  brokers  and  trustees  or  administrators  of  self-administered  RRSPs,  RRIFs,  RESPs  and 
similar plans; or
(ii)   in the name of a clearing agency (such as The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited) of which the Intermediary is a participant.

Newmont  Canada  has  distributed  copies  of  the  Notice  of  Meeting,  the  Proxy  Statement  and  this  Notice  to  Exchangeable  Shareholders
(collectively, the “meeting materials”) to Intermediaries who are required to forward these meeting materials to Non-Registered Holders unless 
a Non-Registered Holder has  waived the right to receive  them.  If  you are a Non-Registered Holder who has  not waived the right to  receive 
meeting materials you will be given either:
(i)
a  voting  instruction  form,  which  has  already  been  signed  by  the  Intermediary  (typically  by  a  facsimile,  stamped  signature)  which
specifies the number of Exchangeable Shares beneficially owned by you but which is otherwise uncompleted. This voting instruction
form need not be signed by you. In this case, if you wish to direct the voting of the Exchangeable Shares held by you or attend and
vote  at  the  Annual  Meeting  (or  have  another  person  attend  and  vote  on  your  behalf)  you  should  properly  complete  the  voting
instruction form and deposit it with Computershare Trust Company of Canada, 100 University Avenue, 9th Floor, Toronto, Ontario
M5J 2Y1 or by fax to (416) 263-9524 prior to 5:00 p.m., Toronto time, on April 18, 2011; or
(ii)   a voting instruction form, which must be completed and signed by you in accordance with the directions on the voting instruction form
(which may in some cases permit the completion of the voting instruction form by telephone).
The  purpose  of  these  procedures  is  to  permit  you,  as  a  Non-Registered  Holder,  to  direct  the  voting  of  the  Exchangeable  Shares  you
beneficially own or to attend and vote at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy. A Non-Registered Holder generally may revoke a voting 
instruction  form  given  to  an  Intermediary  by  providing  written  notice  to  the  Intermediary  in  a  reasonable  time  period  prior  to  the  Annual
Meeting. Non-Registered Holders should carefully follow the instructions of their Intermediaries and their service companies and contact their
Intermediaries promptly if they need assistance.
