<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
7/22, in which the Council called upon the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation to prepare a compendium of best practices. 
</p>
<p>2. In undertaking the above-mentioned task, the Special Rapporteur announced her 
intention to collect &#8220;good&#8221; rather than &#8220;best&#8221; practices, as explained in her first report 
submitted to the Human Rights Council.1 She also observed that since &#8220;good&#8221; was a 
subjective concept, it was critical to first elaborate criteria against which to judge a practice 
from a human rights perspective, and then apply the same criteria to all practices under 
consideration. These criteria were discussed with various stakeholders at a consultation 
convened by the Special Rapporteur in Lisbon in October 2009. The outcome was the 
identification of 10 criteria, 5 of which are normative (availability, accessibility, 
quality/safety, affordability and acceptability) and 5 cross-cutting (non-discrimination, 
participation, accountability, impact and sustainability). The criteria are explained in her 
progress report on good practices.2 
</p>
<p>3. While practices may not meet all 10 criteria, they should specifically aim to achieve 
at least some of the aspects, and must not undermine any of the other criteria. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur prepared a questionnaire and invited submissions of good 
practices from all stakeholders based on this framework. She also organized seven 
consultations with Governments, civil society organizations, national human rights 
institutions and regulators, development cooperation agencies, the private sector, service 
providers and United Nations agencies. On the basis of 157 written answers to the 
questionnaire and the dozens of practices presented at stakeholder consultations, the Special 
Rapporteur prepared the present compilation of good practices.3 
</p>
<p>5. While the State is responsible for ensuring the realization of the rights to water and 
sanitation, the present report will consider a wide range of practices by different 
stakeholders in many environments. Partnership between stakeholders, whether concerning 
legislative design and policy, the delivery of services or advocacy and capacity-building, is 
a consistent theme in all the practices presented. 
</p>
<p>6. The present compilation, which is subject to United Nations documentation word 
limits, does not present every good practice received by the Special Rapporteur.4 She has 
gained important insights from all of the submissions received and is grateful to all the 
organizations and individuals who engaged in this process. She intends to publish a book in 
2012, which will go into greater detail about the practices in the report and also include 
others that could not be addressed here owing to lack of space. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal and institutional frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>7. Human rights law places considerable importance on the explicit recognition of 
rights. The significance of enshrining a right in a legal framework is to confer on people an

<p>entitlement; standards and approaches can then be defined in relevant laws and policies. In 
this section, the Special Rapporteur examines initiatives at the international and regional 
levels to recognize the right to water and sanitation and legal frameworks, strategies, plans 
and regulatory systems developed by States. 
</p>
<p><b> A. International and regional frameworks and initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>8. In 2002, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted general 
comment No. 15, in which it clarified standards for the right to water and pointed out the 
importance of sanitation and hygiene to realize that right. The general comment has played 
a catalytic role in further developments in the right to water. Subsequently, in 2010, the 
Committee issued a statement on the right to sanitation, contributing to greater 
understanding of that right.5 Germany, Spain and Bolivia (Plurinational State of) have been 
at the forefront of international initiatives in the rights to water and sanitation, and worked 
to secure the initial appointment of the independent expert on the issue of human rights 
obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation by the Human Rights 
Council in March 2008, the General Assembly resolution 64/292, in which the Assembly 
recognized the right to water and sanitation, in July 2010, and the Human Rights Council 
affirmation of this recognition by consensus, in its resolution 15/9, the same year. In March 
2011, recognizing the significance of the resolutions adopted in 2010, the Council, in its 
resolution 16/2, changed the title of the mandate to the Special Rapporteur on the human 
right to safe drinking water and sanitation and extended it for a further three years. These 
political developments have had a positive impact by confirming the rights to water and 
sanitation as legally binding for all States party to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights and other human rights treaties, promoting the formation of 
international customary law in this area and requiring that States create an environment 
conducive to the realization of these rights. The above-mentioned resolutions also sent an 
important signal of the significance of human rights in achieving universal access to water 
and sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Economic Commission for Europe Protocol on Water and Health 
</b></p>
<p> The Protocol on Water and Health, of the Economic Commission for Europe 
(ECE) and the World Health Organization (WHO), signed in 1999 aims to ensure 
universal access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation by linking water 
management and health issues. The Protocol shares the same principles as the rights 
to water and sanitation, with specific attention paid to equitable access. To date, 24 
parties have signed the Protocol, while many other countries are in the process of 
accession. 
</p>
<p> The Protocol stresses the importance of the participation of all stakeholders, 
including the private sector and civil society, and provides an opportunity to 
redesign policies and programming. Parties are accountable for their progress 
through a compliance review. The first reporting cycle on implementation, 
concluded in April 2010, showed that the Protocol had triggered national action to 
improve access, although institutional, social and economic challenges remained. 
The water and sanitation sectors were particularly fragmented in countries with 
economies in transition, and there were insufficient resources to respond to the need 
to renovate existing, and build new, water supply and sanitation systems. 
</p>
<p>

<p>GE.11-14347 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>9. The rights to water and sanitation have also been prioritized in international 
initiatives in the context of development cooperation. The development cooperation of 
Germany has, for example, provided instrumental assistance in incorporating the right to 
water and sanitation into the water sector reform in Kenya. The Water and Sanitation Fund 
of the Agency for International Cooperation and Developments (Spain) dedicates US$ 1.5 
billion6 to improve policies and planning processes for water and sanitation delivery, 
incorporating the human right to water, with a particular focus on highly indebted poor 
countries in Latin America. 
</p>
<p>10. The partnership of developing countries, donors, multilateral agencies and civil 
society, Sanitation and Water for All,7 was initiated in 2010 to increase political 
prioritization for sustainable sanitation and drinking water, focusing on the mutual 
accountability of Governments and development partners. The immediate focus is on 
achieving the Millennium Development Goals in countries that are not on track to meet 
them. 
</p>
<p>11. In a similar vein, the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council launched 
the Global Sanitation Fund8 in 2008 during the International Year of Sanitation, 
encouraging donors to make multi-year commitments to facilitate long-term financial 
planning. The Fund has already been instrumental in developing good collaborative 
practice between Government and civil society in Madagascar, Senegal and Nepal. 
</p>
<p>12. WaterAid, an international non-governmental organization focusing on water and 
sanitation for the poor, has recently incorporated a commitment to promoting and securing 
the rights of people living in poverty into their global strategy, with national offices 
developing rights-based approaches into their own strategies and budgets.9 WaterAid has 
also integrated the concepts of equity and inclusion throughout the organization, ensuring 
that the needs of people with disabilities and those who are traditionally excluded are 
included in project design and implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> B. National legal frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>13. States are increasingly recognizing the rights to water and sanitation in domestic 
legislation, with some countries having also recognized the rights to water and/or sanitation 
in their constitutions.10 This is critical for ensuring that the rights to water and sanitation are 
integrated into policies and programmes, relevant standards are set and the necessary 
regulatory framework is established. 
</p>
<p><b>  South Africa 
</b></p>
<p> The right to water is enshrined in the Constitution of South Africa of 1996a, 
the 1997 Water Services Actb includes recognition of the right to sanitation. This 
legal framework has been used to ensure the development of appropriate policies 
and strategies and to secure financing to ensure implementation of the rights.

</p>
<p> The Water Services Act sets the norms and standards defining &#8220;basic water 
supply&#8221; and &#8220;basic sanitation&#8221;, and identifies the roles and responsibilities of 
different Government entities to ensure, inter alia, participation and mobilization of 
all available resources. It compels the Minister for Water Affairs to establish and 
maintain a national information system on water services, essential for monitoring 
the impact of relevant policies and practices. The 2002 Free Basic Water 
Implementation Strategy sets out the framework for the supply of 6,000 litres of 
free, safe water per household per month, and was followed in 2009 by the Free 
Basic Sanitation Implementation Strategy. The National Framework for Municipal 
Indigent Policiesc sets out how these strategies are to be realized for those living in 
poverty. 
</p>
<p> The 2003 Strategic Framework for Water Servicesd was developed to align 
policies, legislation and strategies within the water sector, while the 2008 National 
Water and Sanitation Regulatory Strategy outlines 11 key performance indicators, 
including water quality and customer service standards, to ensure compliance with 
the Water Services Act. 
</p>
<p> A particular measure relating to realising the right to sanitation is the Bucket 
Eradication Programme.e Prior to 1994, there were nationally some 250,000 
households in townships using bucket latrines. In 2005, the Government launched 
the Programme with the aim of replacing all bucket latrines with safe, acceptable 
sanitation by December 2007. By March 2008, 91 per cent of buckets had been 
replaced by better alternatives, such as VIP latrines and flush toilets, consistent with 
the right to sanitation.

<p>14. Full and meaningful participation is a defining tenet of the human rights framework. 
In Brazil, the 2007 Law on Environmental Sanitation, itself developed through a multi-
stakeholder process, expressly states the centrality of participatory processes to achieve the 
goal of universal access, with a focus on poor and marginalized groups. Service providers 
are responsible for delivering services to all those living in urban areas, including informal 
settlements, with a requirement for extensive participation in decision-making processes 
through the Council of Cities. This multi-stakeholder body is set up to discuss and make 
decisions on urban issues, including allocation of resources. In order to receive funds from 
the central Government, each municipality needs to develop a fully articulated plan, 
including data collection and monitoring processes. 
</p>
<p><b> C. National policies, planning and programming 
</b></p>
<p>15. Including the rights to sanitation and water in the national legal framework is a 
critical step for embedding human rights in the sector. However, without good policies and 
planning to ensure that these laws are implemented, the rights cannot be realized. Bringing 
national policies and plans into compliance with human rights standards requires significant 
sectoral reform, in line with the criteria outlined in paragraph 2 above. </p>

<p>16. Recognizing that poorer, marginalized and isolated rural populations often lack 
access to water and sanitation services, the National Programme for Rural Water and 
Sanitation in Peru11 focuses specifically on improving water and sanitation access in rural 
areas and smaller cities, as well as building local capacity to manage these systems 
effectively. Similarly, Paraguay has initiated a programme, to expand the water and 
sanitation network, whereby access to drinking water and basic sanitation must be 
integrated into all Government housing projects. The Government of Paraguay is 
increasingly moving towards a more participatory model by including civil society in the 
design and implementation of projects.  
</p><p>17. Hungary also prioritizes access for low-income and disadvantaged groups, having 
developed national legislation and a national environmental plan that addresses access to 
water and sanitation and focuses on the Roma community. Affordability is addressed 
through a combination of cross-subsidies, State assistance and debt management schemes, 
as well as a comprehensive disconnections policy designed to ensure that people always 
have access to at least minimum amounts of water for personal and domestic uses.  
</p>
<p><b>  Kenya 
</b></p>
<p> Government reform in Kenya to create a pro-poor, rights-based focus in the 
water and sanitation sectors was initiated in the legal framework by the 2002 Water 
Services Act,a and has been continued by the 2010 Constitution recognizing the 
human rights to water and sanitation.b The policy and planning framework reflects 
this rights-based focus through the 2007 National Water Services Strategy and the 
2007 Pro-Poor Implementation Plan for Water and Sanitation.c A comprehensive 
range of institutions has been created or reformed, defining roles and responsibilities 
in ensuring access to water and sanitation for all, including reform of the Ministry of 
Water and Irrigation and the creation in 2002 of the Water Services Trust Fundc and 
of the Water Services Regulatory Board in 2003.d 
</p>
<p>The National Water Services Strategy sets ambitious targets to increase 
access to water in urban areas (from 60 to 80 per cent) and in rural areas (from 40 to 
75 per cent) by 2015. The Water Services Trust Fund was set up to focus exclusively 
on informal settlements in an effort to fast-track access by providing service 
providers with financial incentives to extend services to these areas and to eliminate 
the heavy reliance on informal service providers, as these generally charge 
considerably higher prices than the formal sector and offer no guarantees of service 
quality.  
</p>
<p>Water kiosks sell safe water at controlled affordable prices as stipulated by 
the new Kenyan tariff guideline, and offer alternative payment options for those who 
cannot budget for a monthly bill. The guideline demands pro-poor tariff structures 
and establishes a maximum of 5 per cent of household expenditure on water and 
sanitation. The Trust Fund also carries out a slum-mapping exercise, Maji Data,d to 
monitor access to water and sanitation for the poor.  
</p>
<p>The Water Services Regulatory Board is responsible for developing 
regulations and minimum standards and for approving tariffs. Water utilities must 
adhere to these minimum standards and consider affordability in their tariff 
structure. They are also required to set up adequate complaints mechanisms, 
including customer-care desks and surveys to measure customer satisfaction and to 
expose corruption. Additionally, the Board empowers consumers and the unserved

commenting on tariff adjustments.

<p>18. Target-setting is an important aspect of ensuring progress towards realistic goals, 
playing an important role in planning and budgeting processes. Nepal aims to be able to 
ensure an adequate supply of, and universal access to, both water and sanitation by 2017. 
This ambitious target of universal access is broken down into specific subtargets, 
differentiated by basic-, medium- and high-quality levels of supply, and includes hygiene 
awareness. For instance, 27 per cent of the population are expected to have medium- or 
high-quality water services by 2017, and 50 per cent by 2027.12 
</p>
<p><b> D. Regulation 
</b></p>
<p>19. To ensure that water and sanitation standards are upheld, monitored and protected, 
many States have created independent regulators. A regulator can play a range of different 
roles, including examining water and sanitation services for compliance with relevant 
standards; providing a place where complaints can be lodged; setting tariffs to ensure that 
services are affordable; and monitoring non-discrimination and access by marginalized or 
vulnerable groups. Effective regulators are independent and endowed with the capacity to 
carry out their mandate, in terms of human and financial resources and political support. 
Countries have interpreted the role of the regulator in accordance with the needs and norms 
of the local situation, leading to a range of different policies and institutional set-ups. 
</p>
<p>20. In Mozambique, the Water Regulatory Council13 is involved in decisions regarding 
service delivery standards and affordability in order to ensure access for people in poverty, 
particularly in slums. The regulator has found that, to deliver services effectively, it is 
necessary to go beyond traditional models, to understand who does not have access and 
why, and find solutions based on the reality on the ground. Mozambique promotes the 
restructuring of tariffs to improve affordability, including by providing alternatives to 
paying a monthly bill and restructuring the connection charge so that it is included in a 
longer term bill, while still allowing for profitable service delivery. All options of service 
are considered, including legalizing the resale of water from a neighbour&#8217;s yard tap and 
other informal approaches. The regulator supports the regularization of tenure status, 
promoting upgrading from low-tenure security to a situation with more security. For 
sanitation, both on- and off-site options are considered, with an emphasis on encouraging 
greater coverage through business models.

<p>21. The Latin American network of water regulators, ADERASA,14 was established to 
share experiences. One of the network&#8217;s focus areas is benchmarking, target-setting and 
monitoring, particularly for water quality testing and affordability. While not all members 
of the network are yet able to provide comprehensive figures, the exchange of information 
provides guidance for regulators on the relevance of the monitoring process. 
</p>
<p>22. The Portuguese regulator, ERSAR, has played a critical role in ensuring universal 
access to water and sanitation by recommending social and family tariffs and a gradual 
elimination of connection charges. The costs of connecting new users are incorporated into 
tariff charges throughout the contract lifetime, to reduce barriers to services. Target groups 
include large families, low-income and unconnected households, with financing coming 
from cross-subsidies in the tariff structure and tax revenues obtained from municipal 
activities. 
</p>
<p>23. The regulator for England and Wales, OFWAT, which is responsible for financial 
aspects of water and sanitation service provision, has developed policies and strategies to 
ensure that services are affordable for all. This includes not only a policy that provides 
capped bills for those living in large households, those living with an illness that requires 
large quantities of water or for those living on social benefits, but also an assistance centre 
that provides guidance on how to improve water efficiency. Moreover, the Water Industry 
Act of 199915 prohibits disconnection from the water service for the non-payment of bills.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Financing and budgeting 
</b></p>
<p>24. Ensuring sustained access to water and sanitation has significant cost implications, 
as reaching the unserved and underserved, often living in remote areas or informal 
settlements, can be expensive.  
</p>
<p>25. Governments must ensure that available funds are well targeted, that they benefit 
those most in need and are spent in a manner that supports sustainable systems. Financing 
and budgeting considerations must be addressed in the context of national planning 
processes to ensure that services are affordable and of an adequate standard.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Targeted budget allocation 
</b></p>
<p>26. Some States allocate specific funds to improve access to water and sanitation for 
poor communities. For instance, Bangladesh earmarks 20 per cent of its pro-poor annual 
development plan funds for sanitation and hygiene promotion and recommends that 75 per 
cent of this allocation be used for free latrines for the families living in extreme poverty and 
25 per cent for promotional activities. Subsidized hardware is also given to public places 
like schools or markets. Furthermore, Bangladesh is carrying out an assessment of access to 
sanitation in the country, and will use this to develop an action plan, using the skills and 
experience of the Government, non-governmental organizations and others, with the aim of 
ensuring sanitation for all by 2013. 
</p>
<p>27. In Zambia, the Devolution Trust Fund was created in 2003 to provide utilities with 
grants to extend water and sanitation services to poor urban areas via kiosks and household 
connections. Community members are represented in the project task team and decide 
where the kiosks are to be placed, and water watch groups act as an accountability 
mechanism. The regulator establishes tariffs for the sale of water at the kiosks, cross-

<p>subsidized by richer water consumers served by the same utility. The Fund also provides 
funding for individual household waterborne sanitation facilities, billed as a percentage of 
water used. 
</p>
<p>28. Even targeted funding, however, often fails to reach those most in need, particularly 
those living in informal settlements. To counter this, in Manila, the Output-Based Aid 
project, managed by the World Bank, releases funding to the utility, the Manila Water 
Company, only on completion of connections to poor households. Local government 
agencies and Manila Water have adopted approaches to assess household eligibility for 
subsidized connections.  
</p>
<p>29. Operation and maintenance costs are often underestimated, with budgets available 
for initial construction, but insufficient attention paid to sustaining the services. This issue 
has been explored by the International Water and Sanitation Centre in their WASHCost16 
programme, which has carried out research in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mozambique and India 
into the life-cycle cost of different technologies.  
</p>
<p>30. The Clean Water Programme in Kyrgyzstan also recognizes the need for better 
financing for operation and maintenance, and has ensured that additional funding 
specifically for annual repairs is transferred to the local authority budget. Rural water-user 
unions have been established to encourage participation in decision-making and to ensure 
relevant capacity-building. The unions also have the role of ensuring affordability, with 
local authorities providing subsidies to households with incomes below the poverty level. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Subsidies  
</b></p>
<p>31. To ensure the sustainability of water and sanitation services, some States require 
service providers to recover their costs by means of user charges, particularly for expenses 
relating to treatment, operation and maintenance. This can result in unaffordable tariffs for 
people living in poverty or in areas where service provision is expensive to deliver. Specific 
mechanisms must be put in place to ensure that tariffs based on cost recovery do not 
prevent people from having basic access to water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Subsidy mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>Different mechanisms can be adopted to ensure that water and sanitation are 
affordable to people living in poverty.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Income supplements provide direct support to households based on their household 
income (Chile) or geographic location  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Cross-subsidies can also be targeted on the basis of the type of service delivery, for 
example, kiosks or yard taps having lower tariffs than household connections 
(Zambia)  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Free basic water or a lifeline tariff ensures access to a minimum amount of water for 
personal and domestic uses for free or for a minimal charge (South Africa) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Increasing block tariffs charge less for limited amounts of water, and progressively 
more for greater consumption 
</p>
<p>32. In Colombia, the Drinking Water and Sanitation Regulatory Commission17 works 
with the Government to develop tariff structures that are sensitive to the economic means of

</b></p>
<p>various groups. This is coordinated with a subsidy system that supports those least able to 
afford drinking water and sanitation services.  
</p>
<p>33. In the Walloon region of Belgium, a social water fund has been introduced with the 
aim of preventing disconnections from the water supply and consequently violations of the 
right to water. The fund is financed through an obligatory charge added to every bill and is 
used to assist poor households to pay their water bills. Beneficiaries are identified through 
the Belgium social services, or through the water company referring defaulters to the social 
services for verification. Similar legislation was recently passed in France.18 
</p>
<p><b> C. Construction and connection costs 
</b></p>
<p>34. In addition to regular user charges, many utilities charge for connecting new users to 
offset the costs of extending the network. It is essential that these costs do not restrict the 
ability of households to have access to water and sanitation. As in the case of Portugal, 
flexible payment mechanisms can be adopted to ensure that this high one-off cost does not 
present a barrier to access.  
</p>
<p>35. Another approach is to involve users in the construction of infrastructure. In poor 
urban areas of Buenos Aires, the utility Aguas y Saneamientos Argentinos implements the 
Plan Agua+Trabajo (Working for water) and Plan Cloaca+Trabajo (Working for toilets). 
The utility works with local governments and local working cooperatives to construct the 
extension of the drinking water and sewerage network. The utility is responsible for the 
expansion projects, consulting with local governments, providing materials and technical 
support and training for local worker cooperatives. The utility is then responsible for 
ensuring the provision and maintenance of drinking water and sanitation services once 
work is complete.  
</p>
<p>36. In Egypt, three rural Upper Egypt governorates, together with the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the water and sanitation authorities, have piloted a loan 
system (revolving fund) for poor households, specifically for household connections for 
water, and are exploring options for including sanitation. The fund has made it possible to 
extend access for households that have otherwise been unable to afford the high household 
connection costs.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Implementation 
</b></p>
<p>37. There are many reasons for lack of access to water and sanitation, including 
financial, social or technical constraints, discriminatory practices and lack of understanding 
or neglect of the needs of particular groups or communities. Poverty is defined as much by 
a lack of political voice as by a lack of money to pay for services. Households and 
communities living without access to sanitation and water services also tend to suffer from 
a range of other deprivations, such as lack of education or health care and lost productivity.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Rural areas 
</b></p>
<p>38. Remote locations and large distances between households have significant 
implications for extending networked supply or constructing sufficient numbers of wells, as 
well as for the access of individuals and communities to political processes. People living in

 Act No. 2011-156 of 7 February, 2011. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.11-14347 
</p>
<p>rural areas often have limited incomes and cannot pay for services. Particular attention has 
to be paid to ensuring sustainability, in terms of financial, management and technical 
issues, particularly where technical capacity and access to spare parts are limited.  
</p>
<p>39. For sanitation, households and users are frequently among the greatest contributors 
of funding, both in the construction of latrines and in their operation and maintenance, and 
these costs can limit access. 
</p>
<p>40. In the United Republic of Tanzania, following years of problems with the 
sustainability of constructed water points, the Government, with the support of the non-
governmental organization Ingenier&#237;a Sin Fronteras, has created District Water and 
Sanitation Unit Support, which has the role of assisting community-managed water user 
groups to be more effective. The support is multisectoral, and includes representatives from 
the water, finance, health, community development, education and district land 
departments. As the support team is trained in the rights to water and sanitation, it is able to 
promote participatory and non-discriminatory practices in water user group activities.  
</p>
<p>41. Community-led planning and implementation is at the heart of the work of Church 
World Service Cambodia. Using participatory rural assessments and wealth ranking, 
households rank themselves according to their ability to pay for construction costs, which 
then defines what each household pays for the service. This approach guarantees non-
discrimination, affordability and a pro-poor orientation, as well as ownership of the 
decisions made by the community.  
</p>
<p>42. Rural sanitation is a particular challenge, as the need for safe sanitation often goes 
unrecognized. One solution is to ensure that households themselves benefit financially from 
having access to a latrine and the wastes that are stored in them. Sanitation entrepreneurs in 
Malawi work with local communities to encourage the construction of eco-latrines, so that 
households may benefit from the additional income of either selling manure or improving 
their crops using their own manure. 
</p>
<p>43. Community-led Total Sanitation is an approach pioneered by the non-governmental 
organization Village Education Resource Centre in rural Bangladesh, which uses a process 
of educating communities about the consequences of not using safe latrines, and then 
encouraging them to build or buy their own latrines rather than defecating in the open. This 
approach relies on communities making decisions about their own sanitation practices and 
monitoring their own compliance, and aims at making whole villages &#8220;open defecation 
free&#8221;, promoting human dignity and improving health. In some areas, there is also a 
revolving sanitation fund that households can use to pre-finance their sanitation facilities. 
Beyond access to sanitation, this approach has been noted as being a useful entry point for 
building the capacity of civil society, leading to other development initiatives. The 
approach has proven especially effective in rural areas, and has been successfully employed 
in other countries in Asia and Africa. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Deprived urban areas 
</b></p>
<p>44. Although people living in urban slums are among the most vulnerable to extreme 
poverty, research from a wide range of countries has shown that slum-dwellers pay 
considerably more per litre for water of dubious quality than those living in formal areas, 
where water quality is monitored. Many settlements are poorly planned, with narrow 
streets, making the provision of services complex. Often, the lack of secure tenure 
aggravates these challenges. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/33/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-14347 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>45. In Bangladesh, the non-governmental organization Dushtha Shasthya Kendra19 has 
been working in Dhaka since the 1980s to facilitate access to water and sanitation services 
for those living in slums. Local government and service providers were wary of installing 
services in slums, concerned that this would be taken as a tacit acceptance of the 
settlements, encouraging further settlements, and that the residents would not pay their 
bills. The organization successfully worked with the local government and the Dhaka utility 
to provide those living in informal settlements with legal connections. The success of the 
programme led to the large-scale Advancing Sustainable Environmental Health20 
programme funded by the Department for International Development (United Kingdom), 
also implemented in other cities, with this approach becoming part of national policy and 
legislation. 
</p>
<p>46. Dushtha Shasthya Kendra has also successfully experimented with new 
technologies, such as the <i>Vacutug</i>, a small hand-drawn exhauster for emptying public and 
private latrines, small enough to pass through the narrow lanes of the informal settlements. 
</p>
<p>47. Another organization that works in low-income settlements is The Inpart 
Waterworks and Development Company, based in Manila. Potential project sites are 
identified by the monitoring of environmental conditions, thereby identifying where access 
to water is evidently poor. Local communities are introduced to the options available to 
them through sensitization programmes. The company has experience in working with 
different technical options, designing for blocks of flats as well as informal settlements. 
Households may decide either to have a household connection or to take water from a 
standpipe, and are involved in project design, construction and management. The person 
responsible for managing the water supply on a daily basis, as well as the director of the 
company, is available to receive complaints. 
</p>
<p>48. In Senegal, Senegalaise des eaux, in Dakar, is responsible for providing all residents 
of the city with services, regardless of where they live. Before being contracted in 1996, 
service provision was poor, with poor water quality, unreliable supply and significant 
numbers of unpaid bills. Users are now reportedly more willing to pay because they receive 
a safe, reliable service with good-quality water, and the service has been extended to low-
income settlements, with social tariffs available. Detailed customer surveys and a 
complaints system are also in place. 
</p>
<p>49. Urban sanitation requires carefully designed and considered solutions. In densely 
populated urban areas, on-site latrines are seldom practical owing to lack of space, but lack 
of adequate planning also often precludes household-level toilets connected to a sewerage 
system. The large volume of excreta produced in densely populated urban areas needs to be 
handled safely to ensure that water resources are not contaminated. Lack of secure tenure 
reinforces these problems: improvements, such as latrine construction, may not be allowed 
owing either to regulations or to landowners refusing permission to build; without secure 
tenure, households are unwilling to invest in sanitation hardware if they are under threat of 
eviction, and service providers may not be willing to extend services to low-income areas 
for fear of not being able to recover costs. 
</p>
<p>50. Innovative solutions are generally not technical in nature, but rather focus on new 
approaches to management, changes in legislation (see paragraphs 7 to 23 above) and 
improved planning to include informal settlements in citywide planning. 
</p>
<p>51. One common solution is the construction of shared or public latrines to 
accommodate the needs of multiple households, but these have critical management

</p>
<p>implications. Badly managed sanitation facilities can be expensive, unhygienic and largely 
inaccessible, a problem particularly for women and children, who need a safe place to use 
at night. To resolve this, public sanitation blocks must be well managed and open 24 hours 
a day. The Indian non-governmental organization SPARC, together with the slum women&#8217;s 
network, Mahila Milan and the National Slum Dwellers Federation, construct community 
toilets within slums, where the process of designing and constructing community toilets 
starts by gathering community interest through community-led mapping. Using this 
information to collaborate with local government to identify and acquire the necessary land, 
the women themselves are empowered to build and manage the toilets to their own 
specifications. The financial model is then pay-per-use, with special provision for those 
who are too poor to pay and with free access for children. 
</p>
<p>52. In India, a non-governmental organization focusing on sanitation, Sulabh 
International, constructs and manages public latrines and also has significant practice in 
low-cost technologies and latrines that take up a minimal amount of space, thus particularly 
relevant to the urban slum context. More than 10 million people in India use Sulabh 
International sanitation facilities daily. 
</p>
<p>53. Condominial sewerage is an affordable alternative to standard sewers, using small 
diameter pipes, laid along sidewalks or backyards, at a shallower depth. While the system 
demands a higher level of household/user involvement to manage waste effectively, it is 
significantly cheaper than the conventional alternative. This option has been extensively 
used in many countries of Latin America, but is best known in Brazil, where it also forms 
part of the national sanitation strategy.21 
</p>
<p>54. In developed countries, there are major challenges with regard to public toilets, and 
access to sanitation and water for homeless people. A good practice can be found in Paris, 
where public toilets that were previously pay-for-use are now free of charge. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Water quality  
</b></p>
<p>55. When people have to rely on unprotected sources of water (such as unprotected 
wells or rivers), they are often unsafe, frequently as a result of inadequate sanitation and 
other forms of pollution. Even where people have access to water from safe sources, 
problems with distribution or delivery systems can contaminate the water before use. Water 
quality can be a particular problem in urban areas, where lack of adequate sanitation 
contaminates existing groundwater supplies. 
</p>
<p>56. An interim measure can be point-of-use water purification, such as boiling or 
chlorination. However, this can be prohibitively expensive. One cheap alternative is solar 
disinfection (also known as SODIS), which relies on direct sunlight to disinfect water in 
plastic bottles. The Water School in Uganda promotes this technology, together with other 
simple technologies for sanitation and hygiene.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Hygiene promotion 
</b></p>
<p>57. Good hygiene is an essential aspect of acquiring the full health benefits of access to 
water and sanitation. Considerations of menstrual hygiene are a relatively recent advance, 
as development workers and community members have found this a difficult topic to 
discuss; it is, however, a critical issue for women&#8217;s health and their enjoyment of many 
human rights. WaterAid Bangladesh and its partners carried out a baseline study in the

</b></p>
<p>slums of Dhaka early in 2005, to understand the beliefs and practices of menstrual hygiene 
and management. It found that many unhygienic practices were due to a lack of awareness 
and unwillingness to talk about menstruation, as well as to a lack of safe water facilities for 
washing and drying rags. An underlying culture of shame and inadequate attention can lead 
to serious reproductive and other health problems. As a result, WaterAid piloted the design 
of different women-friendly toilets and has developed educational and communication 
materials to raise awareness. 
</p>
<p>58. In the United Republic of Tanzania, assisting women and girls in managing 
menstrual hygiene is also an issue addressed by the non-governmental organization Water 
and Environmental Sanitation in a schools sanitation project. The aim is to contribute to 
improving the ability of girls reaching puberty to manage menstruation with dignity and 
confidence and hence remain in school. Teacher sensitization and lesson planning to teach 
girls menstrual hygiene management is available for use across the entire country. 
</p>
<p>59. To encourage good hygiene behaviour from a young age, and to make the lesson 
engaging, The WASH United campaign uses sport to create demand for sanitation and to 
promote hand-washing. Activities include football-based education in schools and youth 
football teams, games and poster campaigns. Using football as a door opener, WASH 
United also engages political decision makers at all levels to promote the recognition and 
realization of the human right to water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>60. One central aspect of realizing the rights to water and sanitation is addressing 
discrimination, which requires specific attention to be paid to disadvantaged and 
marginalized members of society. Regardless of where one lives, one&#8217;s tribe or any other 
potential ground for discrimination, everyone has an equal right to have access to sufficient, 
safe, acceptable and affordable water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>61. Discriminatory practices originate not only from the State, but also from deeply 
ingrained cultural and social practices. In Tamil Nadu, India, the Department for Water 
Affairs22 committed itself to addressing discriminatory practices based on caste, using 
access to water and sanitation as the entry point for discussing discrimination. The 
programme implementers found that, frequently, it was not just policies and programmes 
that were perpetuating discriminatory practices, but also that local communities needed 
awareness training to recognize that their own attitudes were discriminatory. 
</p>
<p>62. Owing to religious, cultural or social norms, women are often not able to participate 
fully in decision-making processes, and taboos surrounding latrine use are often stronger 
for women than for men. In Nepal, the Rural Village Water Resources Management Project 
promoted the inclusion of women and disadvantaged groups in water and sanitation 
delivery processes by means of the Gender Equity and Social Inclusion Strategy. The 
strategy promotes and supports the socio-economic empowerment of women, the poor and 
socially excluded through capacity-building, equal access to resources, participation in 
decision-making, promoting income-generation and advocating for social change, 
particularly in relation to discriminatory practices, such as the isolation of women during 
menstruation. 
</p>
<p>63. For the elderly, children, and people with disabilities, particular care has to be taken 
to ensure that facilities are appropriate and that these groups are involved in decisions 
regarding the service. In the United Republic of Tanzania, UNICEF, the Comprehensive

<p>Community Based Rehabilitation in Tanzania and the Environmental Engineering Pollution 
Control Organisation formed a partnership, bringing the disability and water and sanitation 
sectors to support the Government in mainstreaming considerations relating to disability 
into national school water and sanitation guidelines. Through better access to water, 
sanitation and hygiene in schools, the programme seeks to ensure the realization of the right 
to education for all children. The involvement of disability organizations and persons with 
disabilities was central to raising awareness about disability among water and sanitation 
stakeholders. Trials of different simple and low-cost latrines were conducted in 2010, 
together with the development of school WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) 
guidelines and toolkits, for use by both Government and non-State actors. 
</p>
<p>64. In Malawi, Churches Action in Relief and Development emphasizes the inclusion of 
marginalized groups. Communities write their own by-laws to ensure access for all, 
including providing free water to those who cannot afford to pay, and installing taps 
specifically designed for those with physical disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Emergency situations 
</b></p>
<p>65. Emergencies require particular consideration in the realization of the rights to water 
and sanitation owing to the immediate and generally unexpected nature of the need. 
Although the need may be initially perceived as short-term, all too often people remain in a 
precarious situation for many years. 
</p>
<p>66. Several international organizations have published manuals and guidelines for the 
provision of water and/or sanitation in emergencies, such as the Water Manual for Refugee 
Situations published by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees23 and the Handbook for the Protection of Internally Displaced Persons by the 
Inter-Agency Standing Committee, containing an action sheet regarding the human rights to 
water and sanitation.24 
</p>
<p>67. The Sphere project,25 initiated in 1997 by a group of humanitarian non-governmental 
organizations and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, 
specifies standards for provision and construction in emergencies. The recently updated 
Sphere handbook points to the rights to water and sanitation, and demands that the 
principles of non-discrimination, participation and access to information are upheld. 
</p>
<p>68. Church World Service Pakistan/Afghanistan uses the Sphere standards in their work 
to ensure that communities have at least minimum access to safe water and sanitation in the 
time immediately after a disaster. The initiative always includes hardware (handpumps, 
latrines), hygiene education (hand-washing, household water treatment) and the provision 
of hygiene materials, such as soap. While water is initially provided for free in crisis 
situations, Church World Service works closely with the Government to ensure that they 
can assume responsibility for services upon project completion, thereby contributing to 
long-term sustainability and affordability of the water supply. The Tearfund Afghanistan 
Disaster Management Team integrates advocacy into its emergency work, encouraging 
communities to understand their role in ensuring sustainability of projects and creating the 
link of accountability between a Government and its citizens. 
</p>
<p>69. Action contre la faim and the UNICEF WASH cluster identified a gap in knowledge 
concerning the relevance of human rights in emergencies, leading to the holding of a series

<p>of regional practitioners&#8217; workshops, and eventually to the development of a handbook 
explaining the rights to water and sanitation and clarifying how emergency workers can use 
this framework to improve access to water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Schools, institutions and other public buildings and places 
</b></p>
<p>70. Schools and other educational centres, public venues and buildings, including 
hospitals, prisons and workplaces, require water and sanitation services. 
</p>
<p>71. By means of the Nepal School Health and Nutrition Water and Sanitation Project in 
Kailali, a water and sanitation programme has been introduced in 170 primary schools with 
the aim of encouraging children to attend school, with a special focus on increased access 
to safe drinking water and sanitation, and behaviour change. 
</p>
<p>72. Access to safe sanitation facilities can be a particular problem in prisons and 
detention centres. After visiting Portugal in 2008, the European Committee for the 
Prevention of Torture found that the practice &#8220;of defecating in a bucket in a confined space 
used as a living area&#8221; to be degrading, and recommended immediate measures to put an end 
to it.26 In 2011, following up on the 2008 visit, the Committee confirmed that the objective 
had been reached.27 
</p>
<p><b> H. Advocacy and capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>73. All stakeholders have the potential to play a role in raising awareness of, and 
lobbying for, the rights to water and to sanitation. These activities can have a significant 
impact when articulating community demands and pressuring official responses in relation 
to inadequate access. The Advocates Handbook published by the Freshwater Action 
Network28 serves as a guide to adopting a human rights-based approach to advocacy for 
better water and sanitation service provision and regulation. 
</p>
<p>74. The Emergency Water and Sanitation-Hygiene (EWASH) Group29 in the occupied 
Palestinian territories was founded in 2002 to coordinate the work in the water, sanitation 
and hygiene sectors, including coordination of emergency interventions, and to ensure a 
coherent response and advocacy messages on the rights to water and to sanitation. 
</p>
<p>75. In Egypt, the non-governmental organization New Horizon has been working with 
people living in informal settlements to assist them in claiming their rights by 
demonstrating community-based models in which communities receive capacity-building 
and tools to pursue their objective of having access to water and sanitation services. This 
includes communities learning how to approach and communicate with authorities. 
Through this process, New Horizon has a high impact on sustainability levels, as 
communities are able to organize themselves and advocate for their right to water while 
mobilizing and supporting other communities to follow their model. 
</p>
<p>76. Disadvantaged groups often suffer from a lack of voice. Since 2007, the community-
based organization Community Development Bethesda in Indonesia has been facilitating 
the provision of primary health-care services, particularly access to water and sanitation, 
using a participative rights-based approach that includes mobilizing, advocating and

<p>77. Academic research and training for water and sanitation professionals also play a 
critical part in informing better policy and programming for universal access to safe and 
affordable water and sanitation. There are numerous initiatives in this regard, housed in 
universities, think tanks, non-governmental organizations and other institutions. In 
particular, the Special Rapporteur notes increased research and training specifically on the 
rights to water and to sanitation, including research on the impact of recognizing these 
rights and training on how to translate these rights into reality. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Third-party responsibilities 
</b></p>
<p>78. While the obligation to realize the rights to water and to sanitation rests with the 
State, business enterprises also have the responsibility to respect human rights. This 
includes not preventing others from exercising their rights by, for example, over-extraction 
of water or limiting access to a source, or contamination of water resources through 
polluting practices. The CEO Water Mandate is an initiative under the United Nations 
Global Compact, which has embarked on human rights discussions with companies, 
encouraging more responsible water use. PepsiCo,30 a member of the CEO Water Mandate, 
has adopted guidelines regarding the right to water that considers community requirements 
both before construction of a new factory and during its life. PepsiCo is also exploring the 
use of human rights impact assessments in its activities. The asset management company, 
Northstar,31 based in the United States of America, selects companies to include in its 
portfolio on the basis of socially responsible investments and includes respect of the right to 
water in its considerations. As part of its engagement, Northstar has worked with PepsiCo, 
Intel and Connecticut Water Services to develop specific policies on the right to water. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Accountability and monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>79. For the rights to water and to sanitation to be realized, service providers and public 
officials must be accountable to users. Promoting accountability involves, inter alia, 
developing effective monitoring bodies and processes; devising sound indicators for 
assessing progress, affordability, and the fair and equitable distribution of water and 
sanitation resources according to needs; creating reliable, accessible and effective judicial 
and administrative complaints mechanisms that allow individuals to air and satisfactorily 
redress their grievances; and promoting good governance.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Monitoring and indicators 
</b></p>
<p>80. The monitoring of existing and new services in terms of quality, affordability and 
non-discrimination plays a central role in ensuring accountability, and is carried out by a 
variety of stakeholders, ranging from Government entities, including regulators (see 
paragraphs 19 to 23 above) to local civil society organizations. Monitoring is essential for 
understanding access levels, barriers to access and how to improve service provision.

<p>GE.11-14347 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>81. Monitoring at the global level is reported in the UN-Water Global Annual 
Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking Water (GLAAS) report, which assesses policies, 
priorities and financing flows for appropriateness for reaching the Millennium 
Development Goals on water and sanitation.32 Recent developments suggest that aspects of 
the rights to water and sanitation will also be included in the GLAAS report for 2012.  
</p>
<p>82. At the national level, the African Ministers&#8217; Council on Water has commissioned 
Country Status Overviews,33 which consider the extent to which countries have the 
appropriate institutions, policies and budgets to improve and sustain water and sanitation 
service delivery. 
</p>
<p>83. In some countries, national human rights institutions play an important role in 
monitoring access to water and sanitation services. For instance, the national human rights 
institutions of Colombia, Ecuador and Peru34 engage in a number of activities, including 
revising fee structures to ensure affordability, responding to citizen complaints, and 
initiating investigations for non-compliance with human rights. Frequently, the institutions 
monitor Government bodies as well as service providers, and work closely with regulatory 
bodies, making recommendations on how to improve access to and quality of water and 
sanitation services in a non-discriminatory manner.  
</p>
<p>84. Civil society organizations are also well placed to assess both State and private 
compliance with the rights to water and to sanitation. For instance, the Citizen Observatory 
of Public Services, based in Guayaquil, Ecuador, promotes accountability among private 
service providers by monitoring whether their practices are in compliance with their 
contractual obligations and the law. In the event of alleged violations, they file complaints 
in a variety of forums while simultaneously publicizing them in the local news.  
</p>
<p>85. Civil society has also been pivotal in developing strategies and methods to improve 
budget monitoring, which is essential for ensuring that Government funding in support of 
water and sanitation services is sufficient, spent in the appropriate sectors, and that those 
funds are effectively targeted. WaterAid Nepal has developed a budget primer for use by 
civil society organizations to assist communities in understanding and monitoring budgets 
for water, sanitation and hygiene.35 Such tools enable civil society to judge whether policies 
designed to support access to water and sanitation are supported by the necessary budget 
allocations. Similarly, in the United Republic of Tanzania, Norwegian Church Aid 
promotes accountable governance of community water services through a public 
expenditure tracking system, which tracks whether funds allocated for vital public services, 
including water and sanitation, are spent as planned and on behalf of their intended 
beneficiaries.  
</p>
<p>86. From an advocacy standpoint, monitoring is more effective when the information 
collected is relevant to the needs of the community. All too often, data are collected by the 
national Government or other agencies to be used for external purposes, and are not 
actively disseminated among local stakeholders. The relevance of monitoring can also be 
improved by ensuring that civil society, service providers and public officials have a better 
understanding of existing water and sanitation resources, as disparities in access become 
clearer and it is easier to identify and target unserved areas. Slum Dwellers International, a 
global network of community-based organizations, has developed a flexible, community-

<p>driven process called enumeration,36 whereby data collection on access to water and 
sanitation and other relevant issues is conducted by community members, often in 
collaboration with local academics or professionals. The process ensures that information 
accurately reflects the problems faced by those living in slums, and communities can make 
use of these data when negotiating improved services with local municipalities.  
</p>
<p>87. Since the advent of GoogleEarth and more accessible Geographic Information 
System and Global Positioning System mapping systems, a range of approaches to water-
point and sanitation mapping37 has evolved. This type of mapping assists communities and 
local authorities in determining the existence, functionality, safety and affordability of 
water points and latrines, and can also be used to lobby Governments for improved access 
in underserviced areas.  
</p>
<p>88. Water quality monitoring is a specific aspect of screening that often requires 
additional expertise. In Romania, specific legislation requires the Ministry of Health, in 
collaboration with local governments and service providers, to monitor water quality and 
report cases of non-compliance to the relevant authorities and to the public. Romania is 
moving towards improving water quality monitoring of water sources in rural areas, as 
these are not yet monitored as closely as those in urban areas.  
</p>
<p>89. A non-governmental organization, Women in Europe for a Common Future, works 
with local partners and schools in Armenia, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and 
Romania to develop water safety plans. In the context of limited Government action to 
enact water protection measures, the organization has created an educational package for 
schools to develop community-based water safety plans for local small-scale water supply 
systems. A toolkit explains information-gathering approaches for local authorities and 
informs stakeholders on the properties of drinking water and sources of pollution, and 
related health risks. 
</p>
<p>90. Effective monitoring is only possible with sound indicators. Existing indicators on 
water and sanitation frequently fail to measure aspects that are crucial from a human rights 
perspective, such as non-discrimination or affordability. Developing indicators that measure 
human rights principles allows monitoring bodies to consider a broader range of issues. 
Specific, relevant rights-based indicators are being planned for incorporation into the WHO 
and UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation,38 to provide a 
better understanding of those who do not have access to water and sanitation, and why.  
</p>
<p>91. In Nicaragua, national surveys monitoring access to water and sanitation have 
traditionally focused exclusively on the availability of infrastructure. To increase visibility 
of human rights aspects, Nicaragua, in collaboration with civil society, incorporated rights-
based criteria and indicators into its most recent national survey by investigating factors 
such as user perception of the availability and adequacy of water and sanitation services 
and the populations most affected by discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Litigation 
</b></p>
<p>92. Litigation can be costly and time-consuming and is thus frequently viewed as a last 
resort; when Governments continuously refuse to respect human rights, however, it can be 
an effective way of ensuring that individuals and communities have access to essential

<p>services. The cases below illustrate some ways that litigation has assisted in the realization 
of the rights to water and to sanitation. 
</p>
<p>93. In January 2011, two representatives of a group of indigenous people living in a 
game reserve in Botswana successfully filed a suit under the country&#8217;s Water Act. The 
Basarwa had been denied access to a borehole that they had been using for decades as an 
attempt to force them to move out of the game reserve, where they had been living even 
before its designation as a reserve. The court referred to the recent General Assembly 
resolution on the right to water and sanitation, and found that denying the Basarwa 
permission to use, at their own expense, the borehole located on the land where they resided 
amounted to degrading treatment, which is prohibited by, inter alia, the Convention against 
Torture. The judgement specifically cites general comment No. 15 of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as well as General Assembly resolution 64/292, in 
which the Assembly recognized the right to water and sanitation.39 
</p>
<p>94. In 2004, in a case brought before the Civil and Commercial Court of Cordoba, 
Argentina, residents of Chacras de la Merced sought remedial action against a municipality 
that allowed a sewage treatment plant to leak untreated sewerage into the community&#8217;s 
drinking water supply. Also referencing general comment No. 15, the Court ordered the 
municipality to rehabilitate, restore and improve the sewage treatment plant and ordered the 
provincial government to provide the community with an alternative source of drinking 
water until the improvements were completed. The provincial government finished work on 
a new potable water system in 2006.40 
</p>
<p>95. Even though there is less jurisprudence in support of the right to sanitation, the body 
of case law is slowly growing. As early as 1980, the Supreme Court of India recognized 
State obligations to provide adequate sanitation facilities, observing that the failure to 
provide access to sanitation &#8220;drives the miserable slumdwellers to ease in the streets, on the 
sly for a time, and openly thereafter, because under Nature&#8217;s pressure, bashfulness becomes 
a luxury and dignity a difficult art.&#8221;41 Similarly, in 2007, the Constitutional Chamber of 
Costa Rica held that poorly maintained sewerage systems in Villa Flores, which contributed 
to the flooding of households with wastewater, violated the constitutional right to health 
and ordered the municipality and various Government entities to take immediate remedial 
measures.42 
</p>
<p>96. Even where litigation is not successful, it can have a positive impact when combined 
with civil society campaigns exerting pressure on policymakers, and can lead to policy 
change. In <i>Mazibuko v. City of Johannesburg</i>, residents of Phiri, Soweto, sued the City of 
Johannesburg, Johannesburg Water (Pty) Ltd. and the Department of Water Affairs and 
Forestry, alleging that the free basic water policy did not provide residents with sufficient 
water and that the installation of prepayment water meters was unlawful. The Constitutional 
Court ultimately ruled against the plaintiffs, but the municipality changed its policy to 
provide larger amounts of free water to households registered as indigent.

</p>
<p><b> C. Good governance and transparency 
</b></p>
<p>97. The practices described above outline specific strategies designed to promote 
accountability among service providers and relevant public entities. Ultimately, however, 
the long-term realization of the rights to water and sanitation, as with all human rights, 
demands a broader culture of accountability, which can only flourish in a climate of good 
governance, strong democratic institutions and transparency. 
</p>
<p>98. High levels of corruption are symptomatic of a lack of accountability and can lead to 
higher cost for water users. For instance, in some countries, households must pay a bribe to 
have access to water, whether to gain a connection or as part of the regular water bill. Most 
prefer to pay the bribe rather than challenge it and potentially have no access to services. 
Similarly, a lack of transparency in the contractual process between Government entities 
and service providers, or between providers and consumers, can also lead to price increases. 
By one estimate, corruption could raise the cost of realizing the water and sanitation target 
of Millennium Development Goals by 2015 by as much $48 billion.43 
</p><p>99. There are several transnational initiatives designed to support good governance and 
reduce corruption. For instance, the Urban Governance Index, developed by the Global 
Campaign on Urban Governance, the Global Urban Observatory and the United Nations 
Human Settlement Programme is a self-assessment tool for local authorities, designed to 
promote dialogue with a range of governmental and non-governmental stakeholders on 
development priorities. The Index captures urban decision-making processes as well as 
mechanisms and institutions through which various stakeholders articulate their interests, 
exercise their rights, meet their obligations and mediate their differences. The indicators 
also focus on the quality of relationships between key stakeholders at the local level, and 
consider factors such as the existence of a pro-poor pricing policy for water. The process of 
assessment prioritizes participatory data collection to improve accuracy and ensure 
collective ownership of the results.44 
</p>
<p>100. Good governance and accountability may be supported by encouraging Government 
and private entities to accept binding legal agreements whereby they commit to avoiding 
corrupt practices in the procurement of public contracts. In support of these integrity pacts, 
Transparency International has developed a reference manual in which it describes how to 
design and implement such agreements and how to ensure compliance.45 Similarly, the 
2009 Uganda baseline water integrity survey, commissioned by Transparency 
International,46 identifies corrupt practices and proposes participatory processes to develop 
strategies to limit opportunities for corruption.  
</p>
<p>101. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Water Integrity 
Network recently launched a water integrity training manual that specifically references the 
right to water and sanitation.47 
</p>
<p>102. A more localized approach to supporting good governance and transparency is 
reflected in the UNDP water sector integrity vulnerability assessment conducted in 
Tajikistan, which aims to develop a risk mitigation plan for the sector. Experiences from 
other countries show that these types of assessments can lead to open acknowledgement by

</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions 
</b>103. <b>The present compilation includes diverse practices concerning different aspects 
of implementing the human rights to water and to sanitation in different regions of the 
globe. It demonstrates that human rights allow for different solutions, that there are 
no one-size-fits-all solutions, but rather many ways to transform these human rights 
into reality. The compilation also clearly demonstrates that it is possible to implement 
human rights even in seemingly difficult circumstances, such as in remote areas, slums 
or in emergency situations. A vision for the sectors, a commitment to ensuring access 
for all and the political will for implementation, as well as some imagination, 
contribute to the realization of these rights. Crucially, the compilation also shows that 
the application of human rights principles and standards defined by the rights to 
water and to sanitation can lead to greater levels of access to safe, acceptable and 
affordable water and sanitation in sufficient quantities. There is certainly still more to 
be achieved and studied, but the number of States and organizations specifically using 
the rights to water and to sanitation framework to inform their approach to their 
work has produced a welcome focus on the most neglected, excluded and forgotten 
persons.  
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Special Rapporteur is convinced that the process itself of preparing the 
present compendium was a good practice, facilitating exchanges between States and 
other key stakeholders to explore the detail and complexities of implementing the 
rights to water and to sanitation. The Special Rapporteur hopes to continue this 
exchange of ideas and practices. She is convinced that the adoption of resolution 
64/292 by the General Assembly in 2010, as well as the examples contained in the 
present compilation, will lead to more efforts to ensure the enjoyment of the rights to 
water and to sanitation around the world. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The Special Rapporteur hopes that the very concrete examples contained in the 
present compendium demonstrate that the application of human rights standards is 
not utopian, and that they will inspire further practices to be influenced by the rights 
to water and to sanitation.
