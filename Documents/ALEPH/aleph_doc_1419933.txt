BUSINESS
Corporate Organization
PART I
Our company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 16, 2003 under the name "Carlin Gold 
Inc."  During 2004 we changed our business operations and focus from precious metals exploration in the State of 
Nevada to the exploration for economic reserves of uranium throughout the United States.  On January 24, 2005, we 
filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation changing our name to "Uranium Energy Corp.".
On January 24, 2005, we completed a reverse stock split of our shares of common stock on the basis of one share for 
each two outstanding shares.  Effective February 28, 2006, we completed a forward split of our shares of common 
stock on the basis of 1.5 shares for each outstanding share to increase liquidity for our shares of common stock.  
Effective  February  28,  2006,  we  amended  our  Articles  of  Incorporation  with  the  Nevada  Secretary  of  State 
increasing  our  authorized  capital  stock  from  75,000,000  shares  of  common  stock,  with  a  $0.001  par  value,  to 
750,000,000 shares of common stock with a similar par value.
In June 2007, we determined to change our fiscal year end from December 31 to July 31.  Accordingly, on October 
29, 2007, we filed a Transition Report on Form 10-KSB for the year ended July 31, 2007, as subsequently amended, 
with the SEC and commenced a new reporting period.
On  December  31,  2007,  we  incorporated  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  under  the  laws  of  the  Province  of  British 
Columbia, Canada, UEC Resources Ltd.
On May 1, 2007, we entered into a joint venture with Neutron Energy Inc. ("NEI"), a Wyoming corporation, in 
connection with the exploration of a property covering approximately 6,700 acres located in Cibola County, New 
Mexico,  for  uranium  resources.    In  connection  with  the joint  venture,  Cibola  Resources  LLC,  a  limited  liability 
company under the laws of the State of Delaware, was formed to undertake the exploration activities contemplated 
by the parties. NEI acquired the mining lease to the property from La Merced del Pueblo de Cebolleta ("Cebolleta"), 
a  private  entity  that  has  the  authority  over  the  natural  resources  of  the  property,  pursuant  to  a  letter  agreement 
between  Cebolleta  and  NEI  dated  January  27,  2007,  and  has  contributed  the  lease  to  Cibola  Resources.    In 
connection with the acquisition of the lease, NEI has made cash payments to Cebolleta of $5,000,000 to date.  The 
Company has reimbursed an aggregate of $2,450,000 to NEI to date.  As a result, NEI and the Company held a 51% 
and 49% interest, respectively, in Cibola Resources.  On April 12, 2010, the Company received a cash payment in 
the amount of $11,000,000 from NEI for the sale of our 49% interest in the Cibola Resources LLC joint venture.
Effective on December 18, 2009, we closed on our acquisition of a 100% ownership interest in the South Texas 
Mining  Venture,  L.L.P.  ("STMV"),  a  Texas  limited  liability  partnership,  from  each  of  URN  Resources  Inc. 
("URN"),  a  subsidiary  of  Uranium  One  Inc.,  and  Everest  Exploration,  Inc.  ("Everest").    In  connection  with  this 
transaction, we acquired URN's 99% interest in STMV and issued 2,500,000 restricted shares of our common stock 
to URN.  In addition, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Everest, including its 1% interest in STMV, and 
issued 200,000 restricted shares of our common stock and paid an aggregate of $1,000,000 to Everest to be used, in 
part, for the final reclamation on two properties previously mined and restored by Everest.
The  assets  of  STMV  include:  the  fully  licensed  and  permitted  Hobson  in-situ  recovery  ("ISR")  Processing  Plant 
("Hobson");  the  La  Palangana  Uranium  project  ("Palangana"),  which  is  at  an  advanced  stage  of  permitting;  a 
portfolio of exploration-stage properties located in South Texas; and significant data files that document decades of 
South Texas-focused uranium exploration and mining. The Hobson facility is expected to form the basis of a new 
regional operating strategy for our projects in South Texas. We anticipate that our Goliad, Nichols and Palangana 
projects will become satellite ISR operations with loaded resins being transported to Hobson for further processing 
into dried U3O8.

General
We are a natural resource exploration company engaged in the exploration of properties that may contain uranium 
minerals in the United States.  Our strategy is to acquire properties that are prospective for uranium exploration, and 
have undergone some degree of uranium exploration but have not yet been mined.  As of the date of this annual 
report, we have interests in 50,253 gross acres of leased or staked mineral properties, consisting of claim blocks 
located in the States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.  Our ability to complete future 
acquisitions will be subject to obtaining sufficient financing and being able to conclude agreements with property 
owners on terms that are acceptable to us.
As of the date of this annual report we have interests in an aggregate of 50,253 gross acres (43,960 net mineral 
acres) of properties that have been either leased or staked, which we intend to explore for economic deposits of 
uranium.  Some of these leases are subject to varying net royalty interests.  These properties consist of claim blocks 
located in the States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.  Most of these properties have 
been  the  subject  of  historical  exploration  by  other  mining  companies,  and  provide  indications  that  further 
exploration for uranium is warranted.
Our properties do not have any reserves.  We plan to conduct exploration programs on these properties with the 
objective  of  ascertaining  whether  any  of  our  properties  contain  economic  concentrations  of  uranium  that  are 
prospective for mining.  As such, we are considered an exploration, or exploratory stage company.  Since we are an 
exploration stage company, there is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on any of our 
properties, and a great deal of further exploration will be required before a final evaluation as to the economic and 
legal feasibility for our future exploration is determined.  We have no known reserves of uranium or any other type 
of  mineral.    Since  inception  we  have  not  established  any  proven  or  probable  reserves  on  our  mineral  property 
interests.
Background
The United States is the largest consumer of uranium in the world and consumed approximately 55 million pounds 
of  uranium  in  2009.   Production  of  uranium  in  the  United  States  in  2009  was  approximately  three  and  one  half 
million  pounds.   Nuclear  power  supplied  approximately  20%  of  the  electricity  consumed  in  the  United  States  in 
2009.
The price for uranium is generally determined by near term supply and demand, but it is certainly also affected by 
perception of supply/demand imbalances in the future.  We believe that there is potential for further increases in the 
price for uranium based upon an expected imbalance of supply and demand going forward, particularly considering 
the  expiration  of  the  US/Russian  HEU  agreement  which  expires  in  2013.  This  agreement  currently  supplies 
approximately 24 million pounds to the US nuclear fuel market (i.e. nearly 45% of US demand).
Between 1960 and 1985 a significant amount of exploration work was conducted in the United States for uranium.  
A large number of these exploration projects were not pursued, however, these projects accumulated a significant 
amount of exploration data.
We have acquired a significant amount of this exploration data and have acquired interests in properties that we 
believe warrant further exploration for uranium based upon the exploration data we have acquired.  Our properties 
do  not  have  any  reserves.   We  plan  to  conduct  exploration  programs  on  these  properties  with  the  objective  of 
ascertaining  whether  any  of  our  properties  contain  economic  concentrations  of  uranium  that  are  prospective  for 
mining.   We  have  identified  a  number  of  low  grade  projects  that  we  believe  we  can  fast-track  to  production  by 
conducting a number of different exploration and permitting activities at the same time, particularly in the State of 
Texas.  Currently, most of our exploration activity is focused in the State of Texas.  Subject to many factors outside 
the control of the Company and including, without limitation, further exploration and development work and the 
possible  completion  of  an  acceptable  feasibility  study,  we  firmly  believe  that  we  will  commence  production  of
3962727.3
2
uranium in the fourth quarter of 2010.  However, there can be no assurance that we will achieve our objectives in 
this regard within the time frames targeted, or at all.
We  plan  to  utilize  the  in-situ  recovery  method  ("ISR")  when  mining  for  uranium,  which  is  an  alternative  to 
conventional mining.  We believe that this method of mining requires lower capital expenditures and has less impact 
on the environment, as well as a shorter lead time than conventional mining with respect to beginning production.  
ISR mining of uranium involves pumping oxidized water through an underground uranium deposit, dissolving it and 
then pumping it to surface for further processing.  Monitor wells on sides of the deposit assure none of the uranium-
rich waters leak away from the production zone.
According to a survey by the U.S. Department of Energy, in 1979 there were over 20,000 people employed in the 
uranium mining industry, compared to just over 400 people in 2004.  We believe that there is a shortage of human 
resources in the uranium mining industry currently which acts as a barrier in respect of the exploration for uranium.  
We  employ  a  team  of   highly  experienced  uranium  mining  professionals,  comprised  primarily  of  geologists, 
engineers,  technicians,  field  personnel,  administrative  and  support  staff,  which  we  believe  is  a  competitive 
advantage for our Company.  These persons are involved in the review of the historical exploration data we have 
acquired in order to determine projects that warrant pursuing, as well as the exploration of our properties.
Acquisition of STMV
On  December  18,  2009,  we  acquired  a  100%  ownership  interest  in  the  South  Texas  Mining  Venture,  L.L.P. 
(“STMV”),  a  Texas  limited  liability  partnership,  from  each  of  URN  Resources  Inc.  (“URN”),  a  subsidiary  of 
Uranium One Inc., and Everest Exploration, Inc. (“Everest”). 
 
Under a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with URN, we acquired URN’s 99% interest in STMV and 
issued 2,500,000 restricted shares of the ours common stock to URN. 
 
Under an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “APA”) with Everest we acquired substantially all of the assets of Everest, 
including  its  1%  interest  in  STMV  by  issuing  200,000  restricted  shares  of  our  common  stock  and  paying  an 
aggregate of $1,000,000 to Everest to be used, in part, for the final reclamation on two properties previously mined 
and restored by Everest. 
 
The  assets of STMV  include:  the  fully  licensed  and permitted  Hobson ISR  Processing  Plant  (“Hobson”);  the  La 
Palangana Uranium project (“Palangana”), which is at an advanced stage of permitting; a portfolio of exploration-
stage properties located in South Texas; and significant data files that document decades of South Texas-focused 
uranium  exploration  and  mining.  The  Hobson  facility  is  expected  to  form  the  basis  of  a  new  regional  operating 
strategy for our projects in South Texas.  We anticipate that our Goliad, Nichols and Palangana projects will now 
become satellite ISR operations with loaded resins being  transported to Hobson for further processing into dried 
U3O8. 
 
Overview of the Hobson Processing Facility and the Palangana Project 
 
The Hobson facility is located about 100 miles northwest of Corpus Christi in Karnes County, Texas.  Hobson was 
originally licensed and constructed in 1978, and was subsequently totally refurbished and expanded to a drying and 
packaging capacity of 2,500,000 pounds of U3O8 per year in Q3 2008.  We believe that Hobson’s capacity can be 
doubled with the installation of a second and larger vacuum dryer. 
 
The  facility  at  Hobson  is  designed  to  process  uranium-loaded  resins  from  satellite  facilities  to  a  final  product 
commonly known as yellowcake or U3O8.  By utilizing the Hobson facility as a central processing site, our near-
term plan is to have Goliad, and potentially Nichols and Palangana, ISR production processed at Hobson rather than 
to construct a new processing plant at Goliad. The Goliad and Nichols projects are located 40 miles east and 5 miles 
southwest of Hobson, respectively. 
 
Texas uranium mining was first established in the late 1950s in Karnes County where Hobson is situated, and the 
Karnes County Commissioners have recently passed resolutions in support of uranium mining.  Additionally, the
3962727.3
3
Duval  County  Commissioners,  in  late  2006,  similarly  adopted  a  pro-uranium  mining  resolution.   The  Palangana 
project is located in Duval County. 
 
The Palangana project is a prior-producing ISR project located in the South Texas uranium belt.  The 2,500-hectare 
(6,200-acre)  property  is  located  approximately  100  miles  south  of  the  Hobson  facility.   Over  4,000  historic 
exploration,  development  and  production  holes  were  drilled  at  the  project  by  Union  Carbide  Corp  (“UCC”), 
Chevron, and Everest Exploration Inc.  UCC produced uranium at the project in the mid to late 1970’s with ISR 
technology.  Harry Anthony, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer, was a member of UCC’s ISR mining team 
and oversaw the development and production of this project.  Palangana is a near-term production project and is 
currently in the final stage of permitting.  To date the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) has 
issued:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•
a Final Mine Area Permit; 
a Final Production Area-1 Authorization; 
a Permit by Rule (an Air Exemption permit); 
two Disposal Well Final Permits; 
an existing Aquifer Exemption from previous mining endeavors is still current and active; and 
a Draft Radioactive Material License has been issued by the TCEQ and it is expected to be finalized as an 
operating license very soon.
Our Database
We have acquired historical exploration data that will assist in the direction of proposed exploration program on 
lands held in our current property portfolio.  This prior exploration data consists of management information and 
work product derived from various reports, drill hole assay results, drill hole logs, studies, maps, radioactive rock 
samples,  exploratory  drill  logs,  state  organization  reports,  consultants,  geological  study  and  other  exploratory 
information.
The following provides information relating to our database:
Tronox Worldwide
Effective February 20, 2008, we acquired from Tronox Worldwide LLC certain assets, consisting of certain maps, 
data, exploration results and other information pertaining to lands within the United States (excluding New Mexico 
and Wyoming), Canada and Australia, and specifically including the former uranium exploration projects by Kerr 
McGee  Corporation.    The  Tronox  database  contains  records  on  some  of  our  properties  located  in  Arizona,  the 
Colorado Plateau and Texas.
We have exclusive ownership of this database.
Jebsen
The Jebsen database covers territory in Wyoming and New Mexico, including some of our existing properties.  The 
database belonged to a pioneering uranium developer and represents work conducted from the 1950s through to the 
present.
This  database  adds  over  500  drill  holes  and  over  500,000  feet  of  drilling  data  results  to  the  Company's  existing 
library of data.  Other than logs, the data set consists of volumes of maps, lithographic logs, geologic reports, and 
feasibility studies, and many other essential tools for uranium exploration and development.
Our geologists have linked contents of the database to some of our existing properties, specifically pertaining to our 
projects  in  the  Shirley  Basin  and  Powder  River  Basin  of  Wyoming,  and  in  the  Grants  Uranium  District  of  New 
Mexico.
We have exclusive ownership of this database.

Halterman
The  Halterman  database  consists  of  exploratory  and  development  work  compiled  during  the  1970s  and  80s, 
including extensive data on significant prospects and projects in the following known uranium districts in the States 
of Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, including Grants, San Juan Basin, Chama Basin, Moab, Lisbon Valley, Dove 
Creek, Slick Rock and Uravan districts.
This database includes drilling and logging data from over 200,000 feet of uranium exploration and development 
drilling,  resource  evaluations  and  calculations,  drill-hole  locations  and  grade  thickness  maps,  competitor  activity 
maps as well as several dozen geological and project evaluation reports covering uranium projects in New Mexico, 
Colorado, Utah, Texas and California.
We have exclusive ownership of this database.
Brenniman
The  Brenniman  database  includes drilling and  logging data  from  over 2  million  feet  of uranium  exploration  and 
development drilling, resource calculation reports and various other geological reports, drill hole location maps and 
other mapping.  This database includes approximately 142 drill hole gamma and E-logs.  The data was originally 
compiled  from  1972  to  1981  by  various  exploration  companies,  and  covers  over  100  uranium  prospects  in  15 
southern  US  states.    This  library  will  be  used  by  our  technical  personnel  to  determine  locations  of  where  drill-
indicated uranium may exist.
We have exclusive ownership of this database.
Nueces
We have acquired copies of uranium drill logs from previous uranium exploration drilling projects covering a large 
area in the South Texas uranium trend.  The data consists of approximately 150,000 feet of drill logs from 366 drill 
holes.  This drill data provides regional geologic information and will be used to locate possible mineralized zones 
within the area of the South Texas uranium trend.
The data was acquired from Nueces Minerals Company, a privately-held oil and gas production company which 
owns the mineral rights to 72,000 contiguous acres covering portions of four counties in south Texas.
We do not have ownership or exclusive rights to this data.
Kirkwood
We acquired a database of uranium exploration results covering an area of approximately 13,000 acres within the 
uranium zone known as the Poison Spider area, in central Wyoming.  The area covered includes property already 
held  by  us,  as  well  as  by  other  publicly-traded  uranium  exploration  companies.    The  database  was  compiled  by 
William Kirkwood of North American Mining and Minerals Company ("NAMMCO"), a significant participant in 
the uranium, coal, gold and oil and gas industries in the western United States since the 1960s.  The data acquired 
was generated from exploration originally conducted by companies such as Homestake Mining, Kennecott Corp, 
Rampart Exploration, as well as Kirkwood Oil and Gas, largely between 1969 and 1982.  The database consists of 
drill hole assay logs for 470 holes, including 75,200 feet of drilling, 22,000 feet of gamma logs, drill hole location 
maps, cross sections, geological maps, geological reports, and other assay data and will be used to locate possible 
mineralized zones in the Poison Spider area in central Wyoming.
We have exclusive ownership of this database.
3962727.3

Knupke
We  acquired  rights  to  a  uranium  database  consisting  of  40  years  worth  of  uranium  exploration  results,  gathered 
largely from the South Texas uranium trend, where we have already been actively acquiring interests in land on the 
basis of the data, and will be used to locate possible mineralized zones.
The rights to this exploration database were provided to the Company by James A. Knupke, Consulting Geologist of 
Corpus Christi, Texas.  Under terms of an agreement Mr. Knupke provided consulting services to the Company, 
which included the review of his database.  Upon review of the database we acquired several prospective properties.  
We have terminated the agreement as we had substantially exhausted our review of Mr. Knupke's data.
We do not own or have exclusive rights to this database.
Odell
We acquired the rights to a database containing over 50 years of uranium exploration data for the State of Wyoming.
This  database  consists  of  315,000  feet  of  drill  logs, over  400  maps,  copies  of  all  US  geological  survey  uranium 
publications dating back to 1954, and geological reports on uranium ore bodies throughout Wyoming.  The database 
will be used to locate possible mineralized zones.  The database is made available to the Company by Robert Odell, 
the compiler and publisher of the Rocky Mountain Uranium Minerals Scout since 1974.
We do not own or have exclusive rights to this database.
Moore
We acquired a database of US uranium exploration results from Moore Energy Corporation ("Moore Energy"), a 
private Oklahoma-based uranium exploration company.
The Moore Energy US uranium database consists of over 30 years of uranium exploration information in the States 
of Texas, New Mexico and Wyoming, originally conducted during the 1970s, 80s and 90s.  It includes results of 
over 10,000 drill holes, plus primary maps, and geological reports.  It covers approximately one million acres of 
prospective uranium claims, in the South Texas uranium trend, New Mexico, and Powder River Basin, Wyoming, as 
well as zones in Texas, and will be used to locate possible mineralized zones.
The database also provides the Company with exploration data about its Goliad Project in south Texas, including 
250,000 feet of drill logs and further delineates zones of potential uranium mineralization.  It also contains drilling 
results  from  properties  that  are  being  developed  by  other  uranium  exploration  companies,  and  also  widespread 
regional data from throughout the South Texas uranium trend.
We have exclusive ownership of this database.
Uranium Resources Inc.
We acquired the full database of historic drill results for the Company’s Salvo in-situ recovery uranium project in 
Bee County, TX.
The database consists of 433 gamma ray/resistivity and lithology logs, PGT logs and drill plan maps.

Goliad Project Technical Report
On  March  4,  2008,  we  issued  a  news  release  entitled  "Uranium  Energy  Corp  Reports  Independent  NI  43-101 
Resource Estimate at Goliad Project." This news release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to our Current Report on Form 
8-K filed with the SEC on the same day.
As  described  in  more  detail  in  the  news  release,  we  have  received  an  updated  technical  report  (the  "Technical 
Report")  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  National  Instrument  43-101,  Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral 
Projects ("NI 43-101"), of the Canadian Securities Administrators for our Goliad Project located in Goliad County, 
Texas.  The  complete  Technical  Report  was  filed  under  our  company's  profile  on  the  Canadian  Securities 
Administrators public disclosure website, at www.sedar.com, on March 10, 2008. The Technical Report is authored 
by Thomas A. Carothers, P.Geo., a qualified person as defined in NI 43-101, who has over 30 years of uranium 
experience,  substantially  in  the  South  Texas  Uranium  trend.  His  experience  includes  working  directly  for  two 
operating ISR mining companies in South Texas, US Steel and Tenneco Uranium, during the 1970s and 1980s.
As  required  by  NI  43-101,  the  Technical  Report  contains  certain  disclosure  relating  to  measured,  indicated  and 
inferred mineral resource estimates for the Company's Goliad Project. Such mineral resources have been estimated 
in accordance with the definition standards on mineral resources of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum referred to in NI 43-101. Measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral 
resources, while recognized and required by Canadian regulations, are not defined terms under the SEC's Industry 
Guide  7,  and  are  normally  not  permitted  to  be  used  in  reports  and  registration  statements  filed  with  the  SEC. 
Accordingly, we have not reported them in this annual report or otherwise in the United States.

Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral resources in these categories will ever be 
converted  into  mineral  reserves.  These  terms  have  a  great  amount  of  uncertainty  as  to  their  existence,  and  great 
uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. In particular, it should be noted that mineral resources which 
are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of 
measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources discussed in the news release 
and Technical Report will ever be upgraded to a higher category. In accordance with Canadian rules, estimates of 
inferred mineral resources cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies. Investors are cautioned not 
to assume that any part of the reported measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral 
resources referred to in this news release and in the Technical Report are economically or legally mineable.
Property Description and Location
The Goliad Project property is located in south Texas near the northeast end of the extensive South Texas Uranium 
trend.  The Goliad Project consists of multiple contiguous leases that would allow the mining of uranium by ISR 
methods while utilizing the land surface (with variable conditions) as needed, for mining wells and aboveground 
facilities for fluid processing and ore capture during the mining and groundwater restoration phases of the project.  
The UEC Goliad Project area is about 14 miles north of the town of Goliad and is located on the east side of US 
route 77A/183 (Figure 4-1), a primary highway that intersects with US 59 in Goliad and IH-10 to the north.  The 
approximate center of the project area is 28 d 52' 7" N latitude, 97 d 20 36" W longitude.  Site drilling roads are 
mostly gravel based and allow reasonable weather access for trucks and cars.  Four-wheel drive vehicles may be 
needed during high rainfall periods.

Virtually  all  mining  in  Texas  is  on  private  lands  with  leases  negotiated  with  each  individual  landowner/mineral 
owner.  Moore Energy obtained leases for exploration work in the project area in the early 1980s and completed an 
extensive  drilling program  resulting  in  a  historic  uranium  mineral  estimate  in  1985.    We  obtained  mining  leases 
from individuals and by assignment from a private entity in 2006.
The current leases range in size from 14 acres to 331.98 acres.  Most of the leases have starting dates in 2005 or 
2006  with  term  periods  of  five  years  with  a  five-year  renewal  option  (Figure  4-2).    The  various  lease  fees  and 
royalty conditions are negotiated with individual lessors and conditions may vary from lease to lease.  The following

No historic uranium mining is known to have occurred on any of the Goliad Project lease properties and only state 
permitted  uranium  exploration  drilling  has  taken  place.    There  are  believed  to  be  no  existing  environmental 
liabilities  at  the  property  leases.    Prior  to  any  mining  activity  at  the  Goliad  Project,  we  are  required  to  obtain  a 
Radioactive Materials License, a large area Underground Injection Control ("UIC") Mine permit and a Production 
Area Authorization (PAA) permit for each wellfield developed for mining within the Mine Permit area.  In addition, 
a  waste  disposal  well  will,  if  needed,  require  a  separate  UIC  Permit.    These  permits  will  be  issued  by  Texas 
regulatory agencies.  The current drilling and abandonment of uranium  exploration holes on any of the leases is 
permitted by the Texas Railroad Commission.  Potential future environmental liability as a result of the mining must 
be  addressed  by  the  permit  holder  jointly  with  the  permit  granting  agency.    Most  permits  now  have  bonding 
requirements for ensuring that the restoration of groundwater, the land surface and any ancillary facility structures or 
equipment is properly completed.
Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography
The Goliad Project area is situated in the interior portion of the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province.  The area 
is characterized by rolling topography with parallel to sub-parallel ridges and valleys.  There is about 130 feet of 
relief at the site with ground surface elevations ranging from a low of 150 to a high of 280 feet above mean sea 
level.  The leased property for the Goliad Project is used mostly for livestock grazing pasture and woodland.  The 
overall property area is shown as having a Post Oak Woods, Forest, and Grassland Mosaic vegetation/cover type.
3962727.3
11
The site property is accessed from combined route US 77A / 183 that trends north-south to the west of the property.  
Highway FM 1961 intersects with 77A-183 at the crossroad town of Weser.  Highway FM 1961 to the east of the 
intersection trends along the south side of the property.  Access from either of these roads into the property is via 
vehicular traffic on private gravel roads.
The property is in a rural setting at the north end of Goliad County.  The nearest population centers are Goliad (14 
miles  south), Cuero (18  miles  north)  and Victoria (about  30  miles  east).   While  Goliad  and  Cuero  are relatively 
small towns, they provide basic needs for food and lodging and some supplies.  Victoria is a much larger city and 
provides  a  well-developed  infrastructure  that  has  resulted  from  being  a  regional  center  to  support  oil  and  gas 
exploration and production.  The Goliad Project site area has generally very good accessibility for light to heavy 
equipment.    There  is  an  excellent  network  of  county,  state  and  federal  highways  that  serve  the  region  and  the 
moderate topography, with dominantly sandy, well-drained soils, provides good construction conditions for building 
gravel site roads necessary for site access.
The climate in Goliad County is mild with hot summers and cool to warm winters.  The moderate temperatures and 
precipitation  result  in  excellent  conditions  for  developing  an  ISR  mine.    Periods  of  freezing  temperatures  are 
generally  very  brief  and  infrequent.    Tropical  weather  from  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  can  occur  during  the  hurricane 
season  and  may  affect  the  site  area  with  large  rain  storms.    The  periodic  freezing weather  and  abnormally  large 
rainfalls  are  the  primary  conditions  that  can  cause  temporary  shutdowns.    Otherwise  there  is  not  a  regular  non-
operating season.
The necessary rights for constructing needed surface processing facilities are in-place on selected lease agreements.  
Sufficient  electric  power  is  believed  to  be  available  in  the  area;  however,  new  lines  may  be  needed  to  bring 
additional service to the plant site and wellfields.  We believe that within a 30 mile radius of the planned Goliad 
Project facility there is located sufficient population to supply the necessary number of suitable mining personnel.
History
Ownership History of the Property
The  Goliad  Project  site  is  located  in  the  north-central  portion  of  Goliad  County  to  the  east  and  north  of  the 
intersection of U.S. Routes 77A/183 and Farm to Market Route 1961.  There has been a long history of oil and gas 
exploration and production in the area and oil and gas is still a primary part of the economy for the relatively lightly 
populated county.  In the period from October 1979 to June 1980, as a part of a large oil, gas and other minerals 
lease holding (approximately 55,000 acres), Coastal Uranium utilized the opportunity to drill several widely spaced 
exploration holes in the region.  There were reported to be eight holes drilled at or near the Goliad Project area.
In  the  early  1980s  Moore  Energy  obtained  access  to  review  some  of  the  Coastal  States  wide-spaced  drilling 
exploration data.  The review resulted in Moore Energy obtaining several leases from Coastal Uranium, including 
several  of  the  current  Goliad  Project  leases.    During  the  period  from  March  1983  through  August  1984,  Moore 
Energy conducted an exploration program in the Goliad Project area.
No  further  drilling  was  done  at  the  Goliad  Project  area  until  we  obtained  the  leases  through  assignment  from  a 
private  entity.    During  the  period  from  May  2006  to  present  we  began  and  are  continuing  an  extended  drilling 
program at the site.
Exploration and Development Work Undertaken
This description of previous exploration and development work undertaken at the Goliad Project is based primarily 
on electric logs and maps produced by Moore Energy during the period 1983 to 1984.  Moore Energy completed 
479 borings on various leases.  Eight widespread exploration borings were completed by Coastal Uranium in 1980.  
We obtained leases from a private entity in 2006 and began confirmation drilling in May 2006.  As of the date of 
this  report,  approximately  958  confirmation-delineation  holes  totaling  338,615  feet  have  been  drilled  by  us  to 
confirm and expand the mineralization base at the Goliad Project with the intention of permitting the project as an 
ISR mining and recovery facility.
3962727.3
12
All  of  the  exploration  holes  (Coastal  Uranium,  Moore  Energy  and  the  Company)  have  been  drilled  using  truck-
mounted drilling  rigs  contracted  with various drilling companies.    The  holes were drilled  by  conventional rotary 
drilling methods using drilling mud fluids.  All known uranium exploration or confirmation drilling at the Goliad 
property has been by way of vertical holes.  Drill cuttings were typically collected from the drilling fluid returns 
circulating up the annulus of the borehole.  These samples were generally taken at 10-foot intervals and laid out on 
the ground in rows (10 cuttings piles per 100 feet of drilling) by the driller for review and description by a geologist.  
At completion the holes were logged for gamma ray, self potential and resistance by contract logging companies.  
The logging companies utilized by both Coastal Uranium and Moore Energy provided and primarily analog data.  
No down-hole deviation tool was available at the time.  In contrast, the Company has utilized a company (Century 
Geophysical) that has provided digital log data along with downhole deviation.  In an effort to be cost effective we 
have recently purchased and had built our own logging trucks.
Historical Mineral Estimates and Their Reliability
Historical mineral estimates were prepared by Moore Energy from 1983 through 1985.  For each drill hole, a grade 
thickness (GT) was determined.  GT is the product of the average equivalent uranium mineral grade, as determined 
by eU3O8 gamma ray readings, and the thickness of the mineralized zone.  An outline contouring all of the drill 
holes with intercepts meeting these criteria was produced and the area within the outline was determined using a 
planimeter.  The average GT of the holes within the contoured outline was then used to estimate the mineralization 
meeting the specified criteria.
During the field investigation by Moore Energy a prompt fission neutron ("PFN") specialty logging unit was used to 
determine  the  disequilibrium  factor  ("DEF")  in  the  four  different  mineralized  zones  identified  at  the  site.    The 
logging  unit  was  designed  to  determine  the  grade  of  uranium  only  while  excluding  the  daughter  products  that 
develop over time from the half-life decay rates.  The unit utilized by Moore Energy was provided by Princeton 
Gamma Technologies ("PGT").  A total of 30 boreholes were logged with the PFN unit by Moore Energy during the 
field investigation.  The log output data is on a printout with one-foot values for the logged mineralized intercepts.  
Numerical values of the PGT uranium were assayed in %U3O8, the gross gamma equivalent e%U3O8, and the unit 
calculated the DEF.  The log header contains logging unit factors and location and hole identification data.  The log 
output  also  provides  a  calculation  of  the  thickness,  average  grade,  starting  depth,  grade  thickness  and  DEF.    A 
review of the historic data and discussion with the Moore Energy geologist shows that DEF data from PGT logged 
holes were sorted by intervals according to what zone that interval was situated.  The DEF values from each zone 
were then averaged if there were enough values and those values used to adjust the historical estimate of Moore 
Energy.
Geological Setting
Regional Geology
The  Goliad  Project  area  is  situated  in  the  Texas  Gulf  Coastal  Plain  physiographic  province  that  is  geologically 
characterized by sedimentary deposits that typically dip and thicken toward the Gulf of Mexico from the northwest 
source  areas.    Additionally,  the  regional  dip  generally  increases  with  distance  in  the  down  dip  direction  as  the 
overall  thickness  of  sediments  increase.    The  sedimentary  units  are  dominantly  continental  clastic  deposits  with 
some near shore and shallow marine facies.  The uranium-bearing units are virtually all sands and sandstones in 
Tertiary formations ranging in age from Eocene (oldest) to Upper Miocene (youngest).
Local and Property Geology
The surface of the property is all within the outcrop area of the Goliad Formation (Figure 4-3).  The mineralized 
units are sands and sandstone within the Goliad Formation and are designated by us as the A through D sands from 
younger (upper) to older (lower), respectively.  The sand units are generally fine to medium grained sands with silt 
and varying amounts of secondary calcite.  The sand units vary in color depending upon the degree of oxidation-
reduction and could be from light brown-tan to grays.  The sands units are generally separated from each other by 
silty clay or clayey silts that serve as confining units between the sand units.
3962727.3
13
The Goliad Formation at the project site occurs from the surface to a depth of about 500 feet.  Depending upon the 
land surface elevation, groundwater occurs in the sands of the formation below depths of about 30 to 60 feet.  The 
four sand/sandstone zones (A-D) designated as containing uranium mineralization at the site are all considered to be 
a part of the Gulf Coast Aquifer on a regional basis.  At the project area, however, each zone is a hydrogeologic unit 
with  similar  but  variable  characteristics.    The  A  zone  is  the  uppermost  unit  and  based  on  resistance  logs, 
groundwater in this unit may be unconfined over portions of the site.  The three deeper zones are confined units with 
confining clays and silts above and below the water-bearing unit.
Groundwater from sands of the Goliad Formation is used for water supplies over much of the northern portion of 
Goliad County.  Water quality in the Goliad Formation is variable and wells typically can yield small to moderate 
amounts of water.  Data indicates an approximate average hydraulic conductivity of the water-bearing zones of the 
Goliad Formation in Goliad County is 100 gallons per day per square foot.  Based on this value, a 20 foot sand unit
3962727.3
14
would have an approximate transmissivity of 2,000 gallons per day.  With sufficient available drawdown properly 
completed ISR wells could have average yields in the range of 25 to 50 gallons per minute.
The hydrogeologic characteristics of the water-bearing sands at the Goliad Project have not been determined yet, but 
aquifer tests are required prior to submitting a mining permit application.  Hydrogeologic tests will determine the 
hydraulic character of the sands and the confining beds separating the individual sand zones.
The site area structures include two faults that intersect and offset the mineralized units.  These faults are normal, 
with one downthrown toward the coast and one downthrown toward the northwest.  The fault throws range from 
about 40 to 80 feet.
Project Type
The Goliad uranium project is characteristic of other known Goliad sand / sandstone deposits in south Texas.  The 
mineralization occurs within fluvial sands and silts as roll front deposits that are typically a "C" or cutoff "C" shape.  
The roll fronts are generally associated with an extended oxidation-reduction boundary or front.
The other Goliad projects in the region include the Kingsville Dome mine southeast of Kingsville, the Rosita mine 
west of Alice, the Mestena mine in Brooks County and the former Mt.  Lucas mine at Lake Corpus Christi.  These 
mines are all located south of the Goliad Project from about 60 to 160 miles.  The average tons and uranium grade 
information for these mines is not known, but all these ISR projects mining Goliad Formation sand units have been 
very successful with the following characteristics in common: excellent leaching characteristics rate, and favorable 
hydraulic conductivity of host sands.
At the Goliad Project there are four stacked mineralized sand horizons (A-D) that are separated vertically by zones 
of finer sand, silt and clay.  Deposition and concentration of uranium in the Goliad Formation likely resulted due to 
a combination of leaching of uranium from volcanic tuff or ash deposits within the Goliad Formation or erosion of 
uranium-bearing materials from older Oakville deposits.  The leaching process occurred near the outcrop area where 
recharge of oxidizing groundwater increased the solubility of uranium minerals in the interstices and coating sand 
grains  in  the  sediments.    Subsequent  downgradient  migration  of  the  soluble  uranium  within  the  oxygenated 
groundwater continued until the geochemical conditions became reducing and uranium minerals were deposited in 
roll front or tabular bodies due to varying stratigraphic or structural conditions.
There  are  at  least  two  northeast-southwest  trending  faults  at  the  Goliad  property  that  are  likely  related  to  the 
formation  of  the  Goliad  Project  mineralization.    The  northwesterly  fault  is  a  typical  Gulf  Coast  normal  fault, 
downthrown  toward  the  coast,  while  the  southeastern  fault  is  downthrown  to  the  northwest,  forming  a  graben 
structure.  Both faults are normal faults.  Throw on the northwest fault is about 75 feet and the southeast fault has 
about 50 feet of throw.  The presence of these faults is likely related to the increased mineralization at the site.  The 
faulting  has  probably  served  as  a  conduit  for  reducing  waters-gases  to  migrate  from  deeper  horizons  as  well  as 
altering the groundwater flow system in the uranium-bearing sands.
Mineralization
The Goliad Project uranium-bearing units occur as multiple roll-front type structures in vertically stacked sands and 
sandstones.    Groundwater  flowing  from  northwest  to  southeast  in  the  Goliad  sands  likely  contained  low 
concentrations of dissolved uranium resulting from oxidizing conditions and the relatively short distance from the 
recharge area.  The geochemical conditions in the sands near our property changed from oxidizing to reducing due 
to an influx of reductants.  Hydrogen sulfide and/or methane dissolved in groundwater are likely sources of creating 
a  reduction-oxidation  boundary  in  the  area  with  consequent  precipitation  and  concentration  of  uranium 
mineralization.
Specific  identification  of  the  uranium  minerals  has  not  been  done  at  the  Goliad  Project.    The  very  fine  uranium 
minerals found coating quartz grains and within the interstices in most south Texas sand and sandstone roll-front 
deposits has generally been found to be dominantly uraninite.  No uraninite has been identified on the Goliad Project 
and the presence of uraninite on other properties does not mean that such mineralization will be found on the Goliad
3962727.3

Project.    Detailed  petrographic  examination  of  disseminated  uranium  mineralization  within  sands/sandstones  is 
generally  not  suitable  for  identification  of  the  specific  uranium  minerals.    Laboratory  equipment  such  as  x-ray 
diffraction  units  may  be  used  to  identify  the  minerals,  however  the  specific  mineral  species  typically  found  in 
reduced sands are generally similar in south Texas ISR projects and leaching characteristics are also similar.  Based 
on the experience of the ISR mines throughout south Texas, the use of gamma-ray logging with a calibrated logging 
probe has become the standard method to determine the thickness and estimated grade of uranium bearing minerals.
At  the  project  site  the  Goliad  Formation  is  exposed  at  the  surface  and  extends  to  depths  exceeding  500  feet.  
Uranium mineralization occurs in four sand/sandstone units that are all below the saturated zone.  The zones are 
designated A to D from the top to the bottom of the sequence.  The sands are fluvial-deltaic in origin, and thicken 
and thin across the project site.  Each Zone is hydrologically separated by 10 to 50 feet or more of clay or silty clay.  
The uranium deposits are tabular in nature and can range from about one foot to over 45 feet in thickness.  The "C"-
shaped configuration is typically convex in a downdip direction with leading edge tails on the upper end.  Most of 
the  exploration  and  delineation  holes  with  elevated  gamma  ray  log  anomalies  are  situated  within  a  southwest-
northeast trending graben and most of the gamma ray anomaly holes are situated along the northernmost of the two 
faults  comprising  the  graben.    This  northernmost  fault  is  downthrown  to  the  southeast,  which  is  typical  for  the 
majority of faults along the Texas coastal area.
The A and B gamma ray anomaly zones are continuous, tabular bodies which extend for over 2000 feet along trend.  
The A Zone mineralized body ranges from about 100 feet to over 600 feet in width and the B Zone ranges from 
about 50 feet to over 300 feet in width.  The D Zone gamma ray anomaly extends for over 5,000 feet along trend and 
appears to be comprised of extensive, isolated pods of high grade gamma anomalies which range from 50 feet to 
over 500  feet in  width.    Confirmation drilling, however, has  shown high-grade gamma  ray  anomaly  connections 
between some of the pods.  The C Zone is the least extensive of the four gamma anomaly zones.
Exploration
A review of the available records for the Goliad Project indicated that approximately eight holes were drilled by 
Coastal Uranium on or near the current Goliad Project leases.  This original exploration program resulted in the 
original find of gamma ray logging responses indicating potential low grade uranium as a part of a very wide spaced 
preliminary exploration program by Coastal Uranium during the period from October 1979 through June 1980.
Records  indicate  that  Moore  Energy  obtained  leases  from  Coastal  Uranium  for  properties  in  the  current  Goliad 
Project area and conducted a thorough exploration program that consisted of drilling 479 exploration holes from 
March 1983 to August 1984.  The program utilized gamma ray, resistance and self-potential logging of each hole 
and a geologic description of the lithology from five to 10-foot interval drill cuttings.  In addition to gamma logs, 
several holes were also logged with a Princeton Gamma Tech Geophysical Services PFN type tool.  This logging 
tool was used to differentiate gamma radiation from uranium and daughter products, and determine a DEF for the 
mineralization  intervals.    The  Moore  Energy  exploration  program  provided  the  geological  basis  for  the  Goliad 
Project.
Drilling  at  the  property  in  2006  and  2007  has  been  performed  to  confirm  the  geological  details  of  the  uranium 
mineralization at the property.  The Goliad property work by our geologists is not exploration but confirmation-
verification  drilling.    Additionally,  our  staff  has  continued  peripheral  as  well  as  internal  drilling  to  expand  the 
historical mineralization.
Drilling
Drilling for the Goliad Project has been conducted by truck-mounted rigs drilling vertical holes ranging from about 
four to six inches in diameter.  After reaching the designated total depth, the hole is circulated from bottom to clear 
the heavy cuttings from the hole and condition the hole for logging with a specialized calibrated tool that recorded 
resistance, spontaneous potential and gamma ray.  The gamma ray probe on each logging truck working on uranium 
drilling projects has to maintain calibration by regular cross checking the probe at a US Department of Energy test 
pit  near  George  West,  Texas.    The  pit  is  set  up  for  logging  units  to  calibrate  the  gamma  probe  with  a  known 
radioactive source.  This method has been successfully used in Texas since at least the mid-1970s.  The available
3962727.3
16
data indicate that the logging companies contracted for this project have maintained industry standard calibration 
procedures for their probes.
Based  on  a  review  of  drilling  records  and  discussions  with  former  Moore  Energy  and  our  current  employees, 
previous drilling on the property was conducted using rotary mud drilling and truck-mounted drilling rigs.  Cuttings 
are typically taken at 10-foot intervals and placed in piles on the ground for a geologist to review for lithology and 
alteration.  The drill holes were completed at various depths depending on which of the four sand units may have 
been mineralized in the vicinity location.  Once completed, the drill holes were logged by a contract logger using a 
probe with gamma ray, self-potential and single point resistance capability.  Drift tools for bottom hole deviation 
were not used by Coastal Uranium nor for the vast majority of Moore Energy holes.  We have utilized the digital 
logging capability of Century Geophysical Corp. and have downhole deviation records for these holes.  The drill 
hole collar location was used to position the hole location for map locations of individual holes.  Although several 
boreholes had no deviation records, all drilling to date has been set up to be vertical drilling.  At the depth range 
(300-500 ft) of most Goliad Project drilling, measured bottom hole deviations from vertical are generally less than 
10 feet.
Initial exploration drilling in the general areas was conducted by Coastal Uranium in 1980.  Some scattered low 
level  gamma  ray  anomalies  were  noted  in  the  geophysical  logs  that  indicated  potential  low  grade  uranium 
mineralization was possible in three of the eight Coastal drill holes.  Moore Energy established leases in the area in 
1982 and began an exploration program in early 1983.  Between 1983 and August 1984 Moore Energy completed 
479 borings by mud rotary methods on several of their leases.  We obtained leases for the property by assignment 
from a private entity in 2006 and began confirmation drilling in May 2006.
As of the date of this annual report we had drilled a total of 958 confirmation holes.  Of the total 958 holes, 61 were 
strongly mineralized.
All uranium grades have been determined from evaluation (manual calculations or computerized logging equipment) 
of gamma logs of the drill holes.  The resulting grades are designated as equivalent percent uranium that have not 
been corrected or verified by chemical assay.  Because there has not been sufficient verification of the gamma log 
and PFN log data to arrive at a validated resource or reserve classification, the following data in Table 1 cannot be 
used to define a resource at this time.

Disequilibrium
Uranium  disequilibrium  can  be  defined  as  the  ratio  of  chemical  uranium  (cU3O8)  over  gamma-ray  equivalent 
uranium  (eU3O8).    The  first  determination  is  made  in  a  laboratory,  as  described  below,  whereas  the  second 
determination is typically a field measurement, from which an indirect or equivalent estimate of uranium content can 
be made.  The ratio, or disequilibrium, between "chemical" laboratory techniques and "equivalent" field techniques
3962727.3
18
exists because of the ongoing radioactive decay of uranium over time.  A positive DEF of 1.0 or greater indicates the 
presence of more chemical uranium than equivalent uranium.
During  exploration  of  the  Goliad  property  in  the  early  1980s,  Moore  Energy  utilized  the  prompt  fission  neutron 
(PFN) downhole logging technology of the Princeton Gamma-Tech Corporation (PGT) to identify disequilibrium.  
A review of available logs identified 30 Moore Energy drill holes on which PGT's PFN downhole logging tool was 
used to develop DEFs for the four mineralized zones on the project.  Approximately 2,000 feet of hole was logged 
by  PGT,  which  included  all  four  of  the  mineralized  zones.    Both  chemical  (PFN  direct  reading)  and  equivalent 
(gamma log) U3O8 readings were obtained for each foot of logged hole.
The DEF for each of the four zones at the Goliad Project were estimated by Moore Energy during the 1982-85 field 
investigation.  There were 30 borings during the Moore work that were logged with the PGT PFN tool to provide a 
direct  comparison  of  the  PGT  uranium  assay  (%U3O8)  with  the  gross  gamma  equivalent  (eU3O8)  from  the 
radiometric signature of the material being logged.  The A zone was the most logged unit, with about 14 PGT logs 
of mineralized zones.  The average DEF for these logs was approximately 1.7.  The B zone was penetrated by four 
PGT logs.  The B zone DEF was thus conservatively designated as 1.439.  The D zone was PGT logged at 6 holes 
had an average DEF of 1.435.  No PGT logs were obtained of the C zone during the field program, due to the more 
limited areal extent of this unit and the limited time periods the PGT logger was at the project site.  Because of the 
geologic similarity of the C zone sand with the B and D zones sands, Moore Energy assigned a DEF of 1.4 to the C 
zone to be consistent with the B and D zone sands.  Although the PFN derived DEFs are believed to be reliable 
based on the operator's experience and knowledge of the technology utilized, direct chemical assays were not done 
to verify the technique when this work was done.
Modern  day  field  logging  continues  to  use  the  PFN  tool  as  an  effective  direct  assay  technique  to  assess  the 
disequilibrium  between  standard  gamma  ray  logging  results  and  the  actual  grade  of  uranium  in  the  borehole.  
However, in order to verify the values obtained by historical or current PFN logging, a suitable verification program 
that uses laboratory chemical assays of core and/or definitive calibration testing by the equipment manufacturer or at 
certified test facilities would be needed.
Drill Cuttings
Drill cuttings are important sources of information for distinguishing and mapping alteration fronts and for use in 
correlating geophysical logs for lithology.  Field geologists will review the drill cuttings in the field and describe the 
sediments  encountered  in  the  boring  in  terms  of  color,  grain  size,  and  other  distinguishing  characteristics.    An 
important aspect of the lithology logs is to provide the level of the sediment alteration as an indication of reduction 
and oxidation conditions.  This information is important to locate the reduction-oxidation front/boundary.  Cutting 
samples are generally not used for chemical assay or other laboratory testing due to dilution and contamination with 
drilling mud.  Lithology logs are present for all of the drill holes, but they were not reviewed in full detail during this 
study.
Our policy has been to take samples of drill cuttings at 10-foot intervals from the surface to total depth.  Once the 
cuttings have been observed and the lithologic logs prepared, the cuttings are discarded back into the mud pit.  After 
allowing some drying time, the mud in the pit and the cuttings are eventually covered with soil that has been stored 
from the excavation of the pits.
Probe Truck and Calibration
Contract  logging  companies  were  utilized  by  Moore  Energy  and  UEC  for  logging  of  drill  holes.    The  contract 
logging companies maintained scheduled calibration of the gamma probes on each of their trucks against standards 
in a US Department of Energy maintained and monitored test pit facility outside George West, Texas.  Probe truck 
and calibration information records were kept by the logging companies.  We purchased two logging trucks and 
began using them on the Goliad Project in early June 2007, and January 2008.
3962727.3

Core Samples
We  have  taken  three-inch  core  samples  from  eight  drill  holes  representative  of  the  occurrence  of  uranium 
mineralization at the site.  The core holes are as follows:  30892-74C, 30892-85C, 30892-86C, 30892-102C, 30892-
111C, 30892-118AC  30892-120C,  and  32201-N100C)  (Figure 13-1).    The  cores have  included  samples  from  all 
mineralized zones but the C zone.  Samples have been used for the purpose of moisture content, total metals (U and 
Mo),  cU3O8  for  disequilibrium  evaluations,  leachability  tests,  density  analyses  and  X-ray  diffraction  for  mineral 
identification.  Selected intervals were put in bags, labeled and placed in core boxes for transport to the respective 
laboratories for analyses.  The remaining core is locked in a storage shed on the project site.  All of the analyses 
except density determinations were conducted by Energy Labs in Casper, Wyoming.  The laboratory has been in 
business since 1952, is fully certified, but not ISO certified.  Certifications include the US Environmental Protection 
Agency, US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the following US states: AZ, CA, CO, FL, ID, NV, OR, SD, TX, 
UT and WA.  The density analyses were conducted by Professional Service Industries in Austin, Texas.
Borehole Remediation and Abandonment
The Texas Railroad Commission requires exploration companies to obtain exploration permits before conducting 
drilling in any area.  The permits include standards for the abandonment and remediation of test bore holes.  The 
standards include the cementing of test bore holes, the filling and abandonment of mud pits, and the marking of bore 
holes at the surface.  Remediation requirements are sometimes specific to the area of exploration and may include 
segregation, storage, and re-covering with topsoil, regrading, and revegetation.  The Railroad Commission conducts 
monthly remediation inspections of the Goliad Project site.  Our Goliad Project site is in compliance with Railroad 
Commission remediation requirements.
Data Verification
Most of the historic logs were run with analog equipment except for some run by Century Geophysical with digital 
equipment, while our holes have all been logged with digital equipment.  Century Geophysical initially logged, and 
continues to log the drill holes when required.  In June 2007 and January 2008 we obtained new logging units and 
have logged with these units since that time in conjunction with Century Geophysical.
The use of selected core analyses by an analytical laboratory and field logging selected borings with a specialized 
logging tool that distinguishes uranium from its daughter products (such as delayed fission neutron or prompt fission 
neutron) will allow the operator to determine the average DEF of the project and utilize that and assay data to adjust 
(if necessary) the gamma-ray grade and thickness data.
The  radiometric  data  from  the  gamma  ray  logging  of  each  hole  has  provided  the  primary  tool  to  determine  the 
approximate  grade  of  uranium  in  the  subsurface.    Additionally,  some  individual  cores  with  chemical  assays  that 
verified  the  occurrence  of  cU3O8  have  been  collected  and  analyzed  during  our  drilling  program.    Primary 
verification that uranium mineralization is present at the site is from the large number of exploration/confirmation 
boreholes and the geophysical logs that document the presence of eU3O8 with the gamma logs and lithology with the 
resistance logs.  An independent geologist has reviewed core intervals representative of mineralization and, based on 
his review and evaluation of the historic and our current files and procedures, he determined that the records and 
files from the drilling programs have been well conducted and the information is suitable for estimated historical 
mineralization determination in a manner consistent with accepted practices in the ISR uranium mining industry.
For  partial  verification  of  the  historic  DEFs  the  Company  contracted  from  Energy  Labs  of  Casper,  Wyoming, 
laboratory analyses on samples from three A Zone cores and one B Zone core.  For the A Zone cores the analyses 
consisted  of  the  determination  of  total  chemical  uranium  and  radiometric  uranium  from  28  selected  one  foot 
mineralized core intervals.  This consisted of 15 intervals from core hole 30892-111C, eight intervals from core hole 
30893-85C and five intervals from core hole 30893-118AC.  From the B Zone, 30 continuous one foot samples were 
taken from core hole 32201-N100C.
3962727.3

Samples for chemical and radiometric gamma analysis are dried in a convection oven followed by grinding to -100 
mesh.  A 200 g sample is taken for the gamma analysis, placed in a tin and sealed with tape.  A minimum 15 day 
period is required to establish equilibrium between 226Ra and the daughter 214Bi.  The principal behind the gamma 
analysis is that in a particular uranium occurrence,  238U and  226Ra will be in equilibrium.  Since  238U is the only 
source of 226Ra, one can assume that ideally, measuring the activity of 214Bi can be used to indirectly determine the 
total uranium concentration.  Accuracy is determined by using certified 226Ra standards.  The chemical analysis uses 
a one-gram sample digested in a nitric acid-hydrogen peroxide mixture and measured by Inductively Coupled Argon 
Plasma (ICP) emission spectroscopy using certified standards for control.
Assay results indicate average DEFs for the A Sand core holes of 1.71, 1.15, and 0.16 for core holes 30892-111C, 
85C, and 118AC, respectively.  The 1.71 value was derived from the average of 15 one-foot sample intervals and the 
1.15  value  from  eight  one-foot  sample  intervals.    The  five  one-foot  intervals  from  the  third  core  suggest  a  thin 
interval where the average eU3O8 values exceed the chemical values.  Such intervals are common, even in core holes 
with high overall DEFs, but their presence in a limited sample group such as the present one will skew the results in 
a negative fashion.  The 1.71 value from the larger 15 sample group in core hole 30892-111C is consistent with the 
average 1.7 value derived from historic PGT logging by Moore Energy and is considered to be representative of the 
A Zone.  The 30 one-foot sample intervals from the B Sand core hole had an average DEF of 1.26; a value similar in 
magnitude to the 1.439 PGT value determined by Moore Energy.  Again, the PGT value was established from a 
larger sample grouping and may be considered more representative of the B Sand than that derived from the smaller 
sample group.
The  development  and  refinement  of  the  PFN  and  similar  specialty  logging  methods  over  the  past  30  years  has 
resulted in a tool that provides an accurate field determination of potential uranium grade and infrequent need for 
laboratory assays of core.  In order to maintain a consistent analysis of the disequilibrium factors throughout the 
mineral bodies, we are purchasing a PFN logging tool which will be used in conjunction with standard gamma ray 
logging  on  the  Goliad  project.    Use  of  the  PFN  technology  will  assist  in  developing  more  concise  future 
mineralization estimates, but still requires a level of verification with the accepted laboratory assay of core and/or 
calibration testing.
Additional  verification  of  select  historical  Moore  Energy  drilling-and  our  current  logging  data  was  done  by 
comparing sets of gamma logs from a Moore hole and a recent hole we drilled that was located in close proximity.  
The log pairs were located and then data tabulated for each pair to compare thickness of zone, equivalent U3O8 
grade, GT.  A positive correlation indicated the drill hole sets were comparable in character regarding the potential 
mineral grade and thickness and representative of the same general portion of the project.
Adjacent Properties
There has been no uranium exploration or mining activity on adjacent properties to our Goliad Project.  The nearest 
known uranium mine from the Goliad Formation was the former Mount Lucas ISR mine near Lake Corpus Christi.  
Uranium Resources Inc. has been mining from the Goliad Formation in Kleberg County, southeast of Kingsville, for 
several years at the Kingsville Dome ISR mine and at the Rosita ISR mine in Duval County west of Alice, Texas.  
With the large concentration of uranium mining and exploration properties in the Goliad, Oakville, Catahoula and 
Jackson formations throughout the South Texas uranium trend, it is likely that additional uranium target areas could 
be developed in the vicinity of our Goliad Project in the future.  The current or historic ISR operations mining from 
the Goliad Formation range from about 60 to 160 miles south and on strike of the Goliad Project.
Several historic ISR and open pit operations mining from the Oakville and Jackson Formations are located within 
about 50 miles west of the property
Leach Amenability
Mineral processing or metallurgical testing was not reported as being conducted on any of the samples drilled or 
recovered during the Moore Energy exploration in the mid-1980s.  We submitted selected core samples from our 
core hole # 30892-111C to Energy Laboratories, Inc. in Casper, Wyoming, in January 2007.  These samples from 
the Goliad Project were sent to the laboratory for leach amenability studies intended to demonstrate that uranium
3962727.3
21
mineralization at the property was capable of being leached using conventional in situ leach chemistry.  The tests do 
not approximate other in-situ variables (permeability, porosity, and pressure) but provide an indication of a sample's 
reaction rate and the potential chemical recovery.
Split sections of core were placed in laboratory containers and a lixiviate solution with 2.0 grams per liter HCO3 
(NaHCO3)  and  either  0.50  or  0.25  g/L  of  H2O2  (hydrogen  peroxide)  was  added  to  each  test  container.    The 
containers were then rotated at 30 rpm for 16 hours.  The lixiviate was then extracted from each test container and 
analyzed for uranium, molybdenum, sodium, sulfate, alkalinity (bicarbonate, carbonate), pH and conductance.  A 
clean charge of lixiviate was added and the container rotated another 16 hours.  Each sample rotation and lixiviate 
charge cycle was representative of 5 pore volumes with chemical analyses after each cycle.  The cycle was repeated 
for a total of 6 cycles or the equivalent of 30 pore volumes.
The four core samples subjected to the leach amenability tests were determined to contain from 0.04% to 0.08% 
cU3O8 before testing.  Leach tests conducted on the core samples from the A Zone indicate leach efficiencies of 60 to 
80% U3O8 extraction, while the tails analyses indicate efficiencies of 87-89%.  The differences between the two 
calculations involve the loss of solid clay based materials during multiple filtrations.  Based on post leach solids 
analysis, the core intervals were leachable to a very favorable 86 to 89%.  After tests the tails were reanalyzed for 
uranium  concentration  to  determine  the  recovery,  which  ranged  on  the 4  samples  using 2  methods  from  60%  to 
89%.
Laboratory  amenability  testing  of  the  cores  samples  indicated  the  uranium  (dissolved  elemental  U)  recoveries 
ranged from 86.4% to 88.9% in the four tests.  These results show that the mineralized intervals at the Goliad Project 
are very amenable to ISR mining even when exposed to only one-half of the oxidant concentration normally used in 
the  Leach  Amenability  test.    Based  on  the  Company's  experience  with  ISR  mining  of  Catahoula  and  Oakville 
uranium  deposits,  as  well  as  discussions  with  other  Goliad  deposit  mining  personnel,  the  geologically  younger 
deposits in Texas (Goliad formation) have been the most amenable to in situ leaching.  The uranium recovery is 
generally more complete (% recovery) and occurs in a shorter time period.  Both of these factors are important for 
ISR mine development economics.
Based on the amenability test results, the size of the mineralization at the Goliad Project, the geologic setting and the 
current and projected future demand and price of uranium, the most feasible and cost effective mining method for 
the Goliad property uranium is by ISR.  This method is most suitable for the size and grade of the deposits in sands 
that are below the water table and situated at depths that would be prohibitive for open pit or underground mining.
The  amenability  testing  described  above  was  conducted  on  core  recovered  from  four  depth  intervals  from  one 
boring.  While this was a limited sampling for this property, the samples are believed to be generally representative 
of  the  characteristics  of  the  mineralized  intervals  and  the  determined  recovery  ranges  for  these  intervals  is 
considered to be reliable.  Two of the four samples tested contained approximately 0.08% cU3O8 and two contained 
lower grades of uranium (~0.04% cU3O8).  Energy Laboratories, Inc. in Casper, Wyoming, conducted the laboratory 
testing  for  this  project.   The laboratory has  been  in business  since  1952,  is  fully  certified, but not  ISO  certified.  
Certifications  include  the  US  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  US  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  and  the 
following US states: AZ, CA, CO, FL, ID, NV, OR, SD, TX, UT and WA.
ISR Considerations
The Goliad Project appears to be most suitable for mining as an ISR (in-situ recovery) project.  Although leach and 
permeability tests are still being conducted, south Texas uranium deposits in permeable sands situated below the 
groundwater table are generally favorable to ISR production.
Environmental Considerations
We have completed all of the required environmental baseline studies for the various permits needed for production.  
The Mine Permit application was submitted to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) in mid 
August 2007.  The TCEQ completed their technical review in May, 2008 and issued a draft mine permit in early 
June, 2008.  The Radioactive Material License application was submitted to the TCEQ in early December, 2008.

Studies  completed  to  compile  this  document  include:  cultural  resources  (including  archaeology),  socioeconomic 
impact and soils mapping, baseline gamma survey, baseline soil/sediment/surface water/vegetation, baseline radon, 
and gamma exposure rates.  The cultural resources study found no adverse impacts to the site and socioeconomic 
impacts are projected to be positive for the community.  Texas Parks and Wildlife issued their report concerning the 
project stating that the proposed operation will have no adverse impact on natural resources.  Additionally the U.S. 
Corp  of  Army  Engineers  has  submitted  a  Jurisdictional  Determination  (JD)  that  the  project  will  not  impact 
neighboring wetlands.  The Waste Disposal Well application was completed and submitted in late September, 2008.  
The  TCEQ  issued  a  final  draft  permit  in  September,  2009.    The  initial  Production  Permit  Area  (PAA-1)  was 
completed and submitted in early September 2008, and a final draft permit was issued by the TCEQ in June, 2009.
Engineering Studies
The geotechnical engineering study for the proposed plant site has been completed and mine planning, including 
engineering design for the proposed plant site, is in progress.  20 Regional Baseline water quality wells have been 
installed  for  monitoring  the  aquifer  within  the  mineralized  zones  and  pump  tests  on  the  aquifer  are  planned.  
Laboratory  testing  has  indicated  86-89%  leach  ability  of  tested  core  samples  and  the  results  indicate  that  the 
mineralization is amenable to in situ leaching with an oxygenated bicarbonate lixiviant.
Soils in the upper 25 feet at the proposed site are variable with dominantly brown to light brown sandy silty clay in 
the upper 4 to 6 feet.  Soils grade to tan sandy clayey silt that is generally present to depth of the investigation (25 
feet).  The shallow clayey soils have relatively high plasticity indices (PI) with lower PIs in the silty soils below.  
Groundwater was not encountered while drilling the borings.
The  primary  recommendation  in  the  report  is  to  construct  a  reinforced  concrete  mat  type  foundation  sized  for  a 
uniform allowable loading of 2,000 pounds per square foot.
The  report  and  recommendations  indicates  there  are  no  apparent  problem  soils  and  the  recommended  slab  and 
foundation should be suitable for the intended use of the slab.
Goliad Project Permitting Plan - 2010/2011
There are currently no further exploratory programs scheduled or contemplated for the Goliad Project.
In regards to the environmental permitting at the Goliad Project, geologists and engineers performing work at the 
Goliad Project have developed a timetable of forecasted workflow, which includes the forecasted completion dates 
of various tasks which have been assigned to various personnel.  The workflow has been broken down into two 
broad categories, which have then been further broken down into individual tasks, many of which can be performed 
contemporaneously.  The two major categories of work relate to radioactive materials licenses and mine permits.
Within  these  two broad  categories  of  work  are  included  the  following  tasks,  many  of  which  are  required  by  the 
regulatory bodies to whom the Company is subject to oversight for its exploration activities.  The forecasted dates of 
completion of these tasks is also indicated.  These are internal forecasts only, and the actual dates of the beginning 
or completion of these tasks may differ materially from the forecasts. Material expenditures have been budgeted in 
the  amount  of  approximately  $250,000  for  additional  surveys  and  studies  as  required  by  the  respective  approval 
authorities.  At this time it has not been determined whether or not the Company will be required to draw upon all of 
the budgeted funds.
In September 2010, the administrative judge issued an initial Proposal for Decision which recommended findings in 
favor of the Company on the vast majority of the issues from the hearing referred to in the table below.  He also 
recommended  that  the  Texas  Commission  on  Environmental  Quality  allow  the  submission  of  additional  data  to 
address limited remaining issues.  The additional limited information involves a 24-hour pump test at the Goliad 
project.  The cost for this additional pump test is included in the above budgeted amount.

established  a  regional  baseline,  or  background,  water  quality  conditions  within  the  area  to  be 
mined.  As part of the establishment of baseline water quality conditions within the planned permit 
area,  the  TCEQ  required  that  20  regional  water  quality  wells  be  installed  within  the  proposed 
permit  area.    The  purpose  of  the  wells  is  to  assess  the  pre-mining  water  quality  of  the  four 
mineralized sands (A, B, C and D). Also included in the establishment of regional baseline water 
quality  conditions  is  the  sampling  and  analysis  of  private  water  wells  within  a  one-kilometer 
radius of the permit area.  This action has been completed; and
the Cultural Resource Survey and Assessment has been completed and concluded that the Goliad 
Project will not have any impact on cultural resources in the permit area, and that no further work 
is required on this matter by the Company.  The assessment was reviewed and approved by the 
Texas Historical Commission.
Texas  Parks  and  Wildlife  have  reviewed  our  proposal  mine  plan  and  have  concluded  that  no 
significant impact to wildlife, May - 2008.
The Corp of Army Engineers have also received our mine plan and have determined that it will 
not have any adverse impacts to area wetlands.
Palangana Project, Duval County, Texas
Property Description and Location
The Palangana uranium property is situated in Duval County, Texas.  It is located approximately 25 miles west of 
the town of Alice, 6 miles north of the town of Benavides, 15 miles southeast of the town of Freer and 12 miles 
southwest of the town of San Diego (Figure 1).  Benavides, Freer, and San Diego are small rural agricultural towns 
with populations of 1,600, 3,000 and 5,000, respectively. Alice has a population of approximately 20,000 and is the 
county seat of the adjoining Jim Wells County.

Mineral Titles
There are nineteen current leases covering the area of interest of the Palangana property.  The PA-1 deposit is on the 
DeHoyos lease while the PA-2 deposit, the Dome trend and the CC Brine trend are on the Palangana Ranch lease.  
Bordering the east side of the Palangana Ranch lease is the White Bell Ranch lease, comprised of 1,000 acres, which 
contains  the  Jemison  Fence  and  Jemison  East  trends.    The  fourth  major  lease  is  the  Garcia/Booth  lease  which 
borders the east side of the De Hoyos property. It contains the NE Garcia and SW Garcia trends.
Current lease ownership is in South Texas Mining Venture (“STMV”), which is a Texas limited partnership which is 
wholly  and  indirectly  owned  by  UEC  through  its  subsidiary  URN  Resources  Inc.  The  PA-1  deposit  is  on  the 
DeHoyos lease while the PA-2 deposit is on the Palangana Ranch lease.
Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and Physiography 
 
Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 
 
Elevations of the Palangana Project deposits at the surface range from about 410 feet to 500 feet.  
 
Climate and Length of Operating Season 
 
The  region's  subtropical  climate  allows  uninterrupted,  year-round  mining  operations.  Temperatures  during  the 
summer range from 75°F to 95°F, although highs above 100°F are common while winter temperatures range from 
45°F to 65°F. Humidity is generally over 85% year-round and commonly exceeds 90% during the summer months. 
Average annual rainfall is 30 inches. The climate is characterized by a warm desert-like to subtropical climate and 
low gentle relief with elevations of 300 to 500 feet above sea level. 
 
Physiography 
 
The  dome  area  to  the  west  of  the  PA-1  and  PA-2  deposits  is  a  concentric  collapsed  area  with  the  surrounding 
landscape being hilly and elevated. Surface water generally drains away from the dome area although no prominent 
creeks or rivers are evident. 
 
Access to Property 
 
The Palangana uranium in-situ recovery (“ISR”) project, of which PA-1 and PA-2 are a part, occurs in the South 
Texas Uranium Belt between San Antonio and Corpus Christi in Duval County. Corpus Christi is about 65 miles to 
the east of the Palangana property. It can be accessed off Texas Highway 44 toward Freer. Halfway between San 
Diego and Freer is a turn-off to the south called Ranch Road 3196 that runs right through the property about 8 miles 
from the turn. The road continues southward about 6 miles to the town of Benavides. Access is excellent, with major 
two  lane  roads  connecting  the  three  surrounding  towns  and  dirt  secondary  roads  connecting  Palangana  to  these. 
Corpus Christi, 65 miles east, is the largest nearby metropolitan district. 
 
Surface Rights 
 
The uranium leaseholders under most of the current leases have conveyed the surface rights under certain conditions 
of remuneration. These conditions essentially require payments for surface area taken out of usage.  
 
Local Resources and Infrastructure 
 
As of the date of this report, excepting the wellfield development, much of the infrastructure is in place including 
roads, and power maintenance faculties. The well control facilities and wellfields are currently under construction.  
We have now completed the first three phases of wellfield development at production area one (“PAA-1”) which 
includes  forty  injection  and  production  wells.    Construction of  Palangana’s  ion-exchange  satellite  facility  is  also 
underway which pumps and tanks currently being installed.  We have completed drilling and positive flow-testing 
for our class 1 non-hazardous waste disposal well, WDW419, for the Palangana project.  WDW419 is permitted for 
injection of by-product solutions generated during in-situ recovery of uranium and during restoration of the field.
3962727.3
27
Access Road and Transportation 
 
The property is readily accessible by existing roads. 
 
Power Supply 
 
Power for operating the wellfield already exists on the property. 
 
Buildings and Ancillary Facilities 
 
Currently a maintenance facility and office exists on the site. Other buildings associated with wellfield production 
are under construction. 
 
Manpower 
 
A  nearby  workforce  of  field  technicians,  welders,  electricians,  drillers  and  pipefitters  exists  in  the  local 
communities. The technical workforce for facility operations has largely disappeared from the area although ample 
qualified resources can be found in the south Texas area from the petrochemical industry. 
 
History 
 
Uranium  mineralization  was  discovered  during  potash  exploration  drilling  of  the  Palangana  Dome's  gypsum-
anhydrite cap rock in 1952 by Columbia Southern Inc. (“CSI”), a subsidiary of Pittsburgh Plate Glass Corp. CSI 
conducted active uranium exploration drilling on the property starting in March 1956. Records of CSI's exploration 
work  are  unavailable.  However,  both  CSI  and  the  U.S.  Atomic  Energy  Commission  (“USAEC”)  estimated 
underground mineable uranium mineralization. The only known details of the estimation method include a 0.15% 
eU3O8 CoG, a minimum mining thickness of 3 feet, and widely spaced drilling on a nominal 200 foot exploration 
grid.    Union  Carbide  Corp.  (“UCC”)  acquired  the  Palangana  property  in  1958  and  initiated  underground  mine 
development.  Development work was quickly abandoned due to heavy concentrations of H2S gas and UCC dropped 
the property. UCC reacquired Palangana in 1967 after recognizing that it would be amenable to exploitation by the 
emerging  ISR  mining  technologies.  During  the  1960’s  and  1970’s,  UCC  drilled  over  1,000  exploration  and 
development holes and installed over 3,000 injection-production holes in a 31 acre block. 
 
UCC attempted an ISR operation from 1977 through 1979 using a push/pull injection/recovery system. Ammonia 
was used as the lixiviate that later caused some environmental issues with groundwater. About 340,000lbs of U3O8 
were produced from portions of a 31 acre wellfield block. The production pounds indicate a 32% to 34% recovery 
rate.  The  push/pull  injection/recovery  system  was  later  proven  to  be  less  productive  than  well  configurations  or 
patterns of injection wells around a recovery well. Further, the wellfield was developed without any apparent regard 
to the geology of the deposit including disequilibrium. The UCC ISR work was basically conducted at a research 
level in contrast to the current level of knowledge. The historic production area lies on the western side of the dome. 
 
UCC placed the property leases up for sale in 1980. In 1981, Chevron Corporation (Chevron) acquired the UCC 
leases and conducted their own resource evaluation. After the price of uranium dropped to under US $10/lb, General 
Atomics acquired the property and dismantled the process plant in a property-wide restoration effort. Upon formal 
approval of the clean up by the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission and the United States Nuclear 
Regulatory  Commission,  the  property  was  returned  to  the  landowners  in  the  late  1990’s.  In  2005,  Everest 
Exploration Inc. (“EEI”) acquired the Palangana property and later joint ventured with Energy Metals Corp. through 
the formation of STMV. An independent consultant, Blackstone (2005) estimated inferred resources in an area now 
referred to as the Dome trend proximal to the dome on the west side north of the prior UCC leach field . In 2006 and 
2007, Energy Metals drilled approximately 200 additional confirmation and delineation holes. The PA-1 and PA-2 
areas were found during this drilling program. In 2008, Energy Metals was acquired by Uranium One. During 2008 
and  2009  the  remainder  of  the  holes  on  this  project  were  drilled  by  Uranium  One.  During  this  time  the  five 
exploration trends to the east of the dome were identified and partially delineated. In December 2009 we acquired 
100% ownership of STMV.

Geological Setting 
 
South Texas geology is characterized by an arcuate belt of Tertiary fluvial clastic units deposited along the passive 
North  American  plate.  These  units  strike  parallel  to  the  Gulf  Coast  between  the  Mexican  border  and  Louisiana 
within an area known as the Mississippi Embayment. The sedimentary units are primarily of fluvial origin and were 
deposited by southeasterly flowing streams and rivers. Uranium deposits are contained within fault-controlled roll-
fronts in the Pliocene-age Goliad Formation on the flank of the Palangana salt dome. The uranium mineralization in 
the Goliad Formation at Palangana occurs at a depth of approximately 220 to 600 feet below the surface. 
 
The  Pliocene  Goliad  Formation,  host  for  the  Palangana  and  other  uranium  deposits,  unconformably  overlies  the 
Fleming Formation and is composed of three units: a basal fine to coarse-grained to conglomeratic cross-bedded unit 
with  calcareous  clay;  a  middle  member  of  calcareous  clay;  and  an  upper  unit  of  sandstone  and  calcareous  clay. 
Caliche  is  common,  especially  in  the  muddy  sediments.  The  conglomerates  contain  a  variety  of  lithic  fragments 
from the Fleming and older formations. The Goliad is interpreted to be a braided meander belt fluvial deposit with 
muds as flood plain or over bank deposits. The sands, and gravels, composed mostly of quartz and chert, are very 
clean and associated with channels and point bars. Passive margin growth faulting along the South Texas Uranium 
Belt is common with “down-to-the-coast” normal faults predominating. 
 
The local geology at Palangana is characterized by the occurrence of a Gulf Coast piercement salt dome. This dome 
is approximately 2 miles in diameter and is overlain by Pliocene sediments of the Goliad Formation. The Palangana 
dome is marked at the surface by a shallow circular basin surrounded by low hills rising 50 to 80 feet above the 
basin  floor,  and  hence  its  Spanish  name,  Palangana,  which  translates  to  “washbasin”  in  English.  The  Palangana 
dome has an almost perfectly circular salt core with a remarkably flat top that is approximately 10,000 feet across 
and occurs from 800 to 850 feet below the topographic surface. Radial faulting is present in all Goliad sands on the 
flanks of the dome due to uplift during the intrusion of the dome. Faults and fractures also exist in a random nature 
in the sands above the caprock due to solution of the salt dome from groundwater. Once the salt was solubilized and 
removed, the overlying sediment collapsed, creating the basin and associated faults. 
 
The Goliad formation at Palangana is composed of fine- to medium-grained, often silty, channel sands interbedded 
with lenses of mudstone and siltstone. For the most part, the sand is very sparsely cemented although it varies from 
friable  to  indurate.  There  is  known  to  be  minor  faulting  on  the  north  end  of  the  PA-1  deposit.  The  Palangana 
stratigraphy is horizontal to sub-horizontal, with at most, a 2 to 3º southeasterly dip. 
 
Geological Model 
 
Uranium  mineralization  in  the  South  Texas  Uranium  Belt  occurs  as  sandstone-hosted  roll-front  deposits.  The 
deposits  are  strata-bound,  elongate,  and often, but  not necessarily,  occur  in  the  classic  “C”  or  truncated  “C” roll 
configuration. They can be associated with an oxidation front or can be found in a re-reduced condition where an 
overprint  of  later  reduction  from  hydrogen  sulfide  or  other  hydrocarbon  reductant  has  seeped  along  faults  and 
fractures. The uranium bearing sandstone units can themselves be separated into several horizons by discontinuous 
mudstone units, and separate roll-fronts and sub-rolls can occur in the stacked sandstone sequences. 
 
The  generally  accepted  origin  of  uranium  mineralization  in  the  Goliad  Formation  is  from  leaching  of 
intraformational tuffaceous material or erosion of older uranium-bearing strata. The leached uranium was carried by 
oxygenated  ground  water  in  a  hexavalent  state  and  deposited  where  a  suitable  reductant  was  encountered.  The 
oxidation/reduction (redox) fronts are often continuous for miles, although minable grade uranium mineralization is 
not nearly as continuous. The discontinuous nature of uranium mineralization is often characterized as “beads on a 
string” and is due to sinuous vertical and lateral fluvial facies changes in the permeable sandstone host horizons, 
coupled with ground water movements and the presence or absence of reducing material.
3962727.3
29
Figure 4.4 is a schematic view of a typical uranium roll-front wellfield configuration. 
 
The red area is the uranium mineralization deposited at the interface between the oxidized (up gradient) sand shown 
in yellow and the reduced (down gradient) sand shown in gray. The up gradient sand has been altered by oxidizing 
groundwater  that  carried  the  uranium  that  was  deposited  in  the  roll-front  at  the  oxidation/reduction  (Redox) 
interface. The uranium mineralization is hydrologically confined by an upper and lower confining layer of shale or 
mudstone. A production (pumping) well has been completed in the center of the roll-front and is fed lixiviate (leach 
solutions) by two injection wells on each side of the front. 
 
One  item,  in  particular  needs  to  be  emphasized  in  evaluating  the  Goliad  deposits  at  Palangana,  namely: 
disequilibrium of the roll front wings or limbs. These can carry uranium values although the thickness is usually too 
thin to chase independently. PFN logging has defensibly shown that often these zones carry significant chemical 
uranium. One other explanation may be related to the correlation of the mini-roll front data. In some instances what 
appear to be chemically stable wings or limbs may be other subordinate roll fronts. 
 
Mineralization 
 
All  known  Goliad  formation  deposits  at  Palangana  are  multiple-stage  roll-front-type  deposits  in  a  roughly 
“horseshoe shaped”. As uranium-bearing ground water moved from west to east through the region, a redox front 
was created around a subsurface high of reduced rock proximal to the dome. This reduced ground resulted from the 
introduction  of  hydrocarbons  or  their  derivatives,  mainly  H2S,  into  the  Goliad  aquifers  through  fractures  and 
formational seepage above the dome, providing the environment for uranium precipitation.  The Palangana uranium 
mineralization occurs in the Goliad sandstone unit at depths ranging from 200 to 650 feet below the surface. The 
favorable sandstone unit is as much as 400 feet thick and is bounded by mudstones. Within this unit are at least six 
separate sandstone horizons hosting roll-type uranium mineralization. These units are interbedded with mudstones
3962727.3
30
that served as constraining aquitards for uraniferous groundwater movement. Mineralization occurs as uraninite and 
is  fixed  at  positions  where  the  migrating  uranium-bearing  solutions  encountered  a  suitable  reductant.  Uranium 
values in mineralized strata grades from 0.001% to several percent eU3O8. Mineralized thicknesses range from less 
than 1foot to several tens of feet in multiple, stacked roll front zones. 
 
Identification of the uranium minerals has not been specifically determined for Palangana. Uraninite is commonly 
found coating quartz grains and within the interstices in most south Texas sand and sandstone tabular and roll-front 
deposits. Molybdenum commonly occurs as jordisite, a molybdenum sulfide. Molybdenum is a significant accessory 
to uranium mineralization, with an erratic distribution. 
 
Select  core  assay  reports  were  reviewed  by  SRK  Consultants,  with  assays  ranging  from  a  background  of 
approximately  50  ppm  to  as  high  as  0.23%  Mo.  More  typically,  assays  range  from  0.02%  to  0.04%  where 
molybdenum levels are elevated. 
 
Mineralized Zones 
 
As stated previously, mineralization does not occur in all of the Goliad sands nor does it persist in the same sand 
intervals  across  the  dome  area.  On  the  west  half  of  the  dome  near  what  is  referred  to  as  the  Dome  trend,  UCC 
developed the “C” sand zone. The NW Garcia and SE Garcia trends to the east of the dome also reside in the “C” 
sand zone. Also to the east of the dome, the PA-2 deposit, as well as the CC Brine, Jemison Fence and Jemison East 
trends all occur in the “E” sand, while the PA-1 deposit occurs in the “G” sand. Within these mineralized horizons, 
smaller  roll  fronts  are  evident  that  can  be  mapped  as  discrete  bodies.  Some  of  these  bodies  contain  economic 
mineralization  while  others  do  not.  The  mineralized  horizons  occur  as  stacked  intervals  often  separated  by 
claystones.  Generally  they  overlap  one  another  but  there  are  differences  making  a  concurrent,  multiple-horizon 
recovery scenario not uniformly effective. 
 
Type, Character and Distribution of Mineralization 
 
The  uranium  mineralization,  as  is  the  case  in  roll  fronts  elsewhere,  can  be  significantly  out  of  equilibrium. 
Consequently,  the  oxidized  portion  of  the  roll  front  while  elevated  in  gross  gamma  radiation  can  be  depleted  of 
chemical  uranium.  Hexavalent  uranium  in  solution  in  the  groundwater  ultimately  became  stabilized  in  uranium 
oxide minerals as a function of lower pH and EH (redox potential) that has been caused by a variety of factors but 
mostly the introduction of hydrogen sulfide and perhaps methane gas along fault traces around the Palangana dome. 
Closely associated with this mineralization, is generally the introduction of iron sulfide. 
 
Because of the differing mineral suites, the color of the sand and interbedded clays will vary on either side of the 
redox front from yellows and orange colors on the oxidized side of the system to greens, blue and dark grey on the 
reduced side. Accurate lithologic logging is important in order to understand where the drillhole is in relation to the 
redox interface. Great efforts were taken in the past by Uranium One and its predecessors to document this color 
change  through  the  use  of  field  photos  and  field  descriptions  of  drill  cuttings  that  have  been  archived  with  the 
drillhole records. 
 
The width of the reduced portion of the roll front systems at Palangana can vary from approximately 30-40 meters to 
only a few meters over a short strike distance. The reason for variation in the mineralized width is likely in part 
attributable  to  the  permeability  of  the  sand  system  in  a  particular  part  of  the  fluvial  channel  and  the  amount  of 
reductant  available  at  the  time  of  the  influx  of  uranium-bearing  fluids.  Multiple  surges  in  oxidation  fronts  are 
believed  to  have  formed  the  multiple  mini-roll  fronts  within  the  sands  although  in  many  instances  there  are 
intervening claystones that could have caused the separation of the roll fronts within a specifically mapped sand 
zone. 
 
The cross section shown in the following figure shows the nature of the mineralization along the strike of the roll 
front trend and across the roll front interface or redox zone

Exploration activities in the 1950’s noted radioactivity in shallow sediments between 200 to 400 feet around the 
Palangana salt dome. Follow-up drilling during the 1960’s was mostly wide spaced drilled holes several hundreds of 
feet apart. Upon a discovery in what has been called the “C” zone in the Goliad Sandstone, UCC attempted both 
underground  and  then  in-situ  development  on  the  west  flanks  of  the  dome.  The  water  filled  nature  of  these 
mineralized sands made it favorable for ISR. 
 
As an exploration target, the dome offered favorable attributes for roll-front deposits including a permeable, fluvial 
sand  system  that  was  subject  to  post  depositional  mineralization  by  uranium  migration  in  solution  from  a  likely 
volcanic source rock. Reductants around the dome area associated with faulting provided the requisite stabilization 
mechanism  for  the  uranium  rollfronts  to  form.  Several  other  mineralized  sand  zones  were  discovered  across  the 
dome area through the 1980's but the exploration methods were not sophisticated enough to map discrete roll-fronts 
in the stacked sand system. Extensive faulting, particularly around the dome and the lack of successful exploitation 
of one of the first in-situ production projects by UCC, slowed exploration efforts. This combined with the low cost 
of uranium during the late 1980’s and 1990’s essentially stopped exploration and development in the area. 
 
In  2006,  Energy  Metals  resumed  exploration  activities  at  Palangana.  They  began  exploration  by  drilling  a  wide 
spaced grid across the property in an attempt to identify areas of oxidation and reduction of the mineralized trends. 
During  this  phase  of  work,  the  PA-1  and  PA-2  deposits  were  identified  as  well  as  the  six  exploration  trends 
identified  in  this  report.  These  deposits  were  further  delineated  through  concentrated  drilling  and  were  assessed 
using the PFN probe. 
 
Drilling 
 
Rotary Drilling and Logging 
 
In general, common roll-front exploration practice was to drill widely-spaced rotary holes on a 400 to 600ft grid 
pattern,  examine  cuttings  for  evidence  of  alteration-bleaching-oxidation,  gamma  logs  for  evidence  of  uranium 
mineralization, and resistivity/self-potential logs for evidence of permeable sandstone horizons. The drill spacing 
was tightened further between areas of reduced and oxidized sandstone host horizons to target the uranium enriched 
redox  boundary.  Once  the  roll-front  mineralization  was  intersected  and  its  trend  established,  fences  were  drilled 
every  200ft  with  holes  within  fences  further  tightened  as  required  by  the  lateral  continuity  of  the  uranium 
mineralization. 
 
Nearly all rotary holes were drilled to pre-targeted depths with truck-mounted mud rigs capable of drill depths up to 
1,500ft. The holes were generally drilled to a 5-1/8 inch diameter and used a drilling fluid consisting of a polymer 
mud with various additives for fluid loss control. The drill orientation was vertical, and given the shallow depth of 
drilling (i.e., less than 400 ft) in relatively soft sedimentary units, there was minimal hole drift or deviation. As a 
result,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  holes  intersected  the  horizontal  to  subhorizontal  lenses  of  uranium 
mineralization at approximately a normal angle. Rotary cuttings were examined in the field and log data recorded. 
Upon completion of a drillhole, it was logged with gamma ray, self-potential, resistivity and continuous drift by 
either an in-house logging truck or contract unit. Drill hole collar locations were surveyed and recorded. 
 
UCC Drilling Program 
 
UCC  drilling  appears  to  have  followed  a  normal  exploration  and  development  approach,  but  somewhat 
inconsistently. The result is that the 1,117 holes are unevenly distributed over the Palangana property with only a 
few in the PA-1 and PA-2 project areas. The primary focus of the UCC development drilling was within a 3,500 x 
3,400ft area surrounding the ISR wellfield, an 800 x 1,700ft area on the southwest flank of the Palangana Dome 
depression. The remainder of the UCC drilling appears to have targeted mineralization around the periphery of the 
depression of the dome, as well as topographic highs in the center of the depression. The resulting drilling appears 
somewhat scattered, often occurring in clusters of 100 to 200ft centered patterns surrounding +0.50GT holes. There 
are isolated +0.50 GT holes in a number of locations on the property, some with no other hole within hundreds of 
feet.

Chevron Drilling Program 
 
Chevron's drill program was limited, totaling just 163 holes, but followed a much more consistent and methodical 
drilling strategy. Their exploration drilling focused on filling in areas of sparse UCC drilling west and northwest of 
the ISR wellfield. This region corresponds to much of the western margin of the salt dome depression. The resulting 
pattern stepping west from the ISR wellfield yielded a fairly regular delineation drill grid on nominal 100ft-centers. 
To the northwest, Chevron's drilling was clearly for exploration and not delineation, resulting in a nominal 200ft 
grid pattern. 
 
UCC and Chevron confined the great majority of their drilling to less than 200 acres comprising their wellfield and 
the  immediate  vicinity.  A  focus  on  production  issues  discouraged  UCC  from  an  aggressive  exploration  and 
delineation program. Chevron's focus was on filling in gaps in the UCC drilling necessary to evaluate the deposits 
for their open pit scenario. Significant mineralized intercepts were encountered outside of the production wellfield 
vicinity, but there was limited exploration follow-up. 
 
Uranium One Drilling Program 
 
While Uranium One and its predecessors have drilled over 2,500 rotary holes on the entire Palangana property, their 
efforts  have  been  focused  on  eight  discoveries,  PA-1,  PA-2,  and  six  trends  still  being  defined  (the  exploration 
trends), where more than 70% of the drill holes are located. The average depth of these holes is 450ft. All of these 
holes have all been logged by conventional gamma, SP, resistivity methods and the majority have also been probed 
using a Prompt Fission Neutron (PFN) probe that more closely estimates the chemical uranium. 
 
Core Drilling 
 
There were 296 core holes completed by UCC on the Palangana property. Assaying for these holes was conducted 
either at UCC's in-house laboratories in Grand Junction or Rifle, Colorado, and at independent Core Laboratories 
Inc. located in Corpus Christi, Texas. Thirty-three of the core holes were examined in detail. Core recovery was 
generally  between  80%  and  100%.  Where  the  loss  occurred  in  the  mineralized  interval,  which  unfortunately 
happened regularly, it rendered that interval useless for disequilibrium comparison (see discussion below) with the 
down hole gamma log results. 
 
From the available reports and records reviewed, there is no evidence that Chevron conducted core drilling on the 
Palangana  property.  Energy  Metals  and  Uranium  One  drilled  a  total  of  eight  core  holes  on  the  PA-1  property. 
However, the usage of PFN logging has largely reduced the need for coring for exploration purposes. 
 
Procedures 
 
Drilling  procedures  conducted  by  Energy  Metals  and  Uranium  One  are  acceptable  for  resource  and  reserve 
modeling. Field examination by Sean Muller confirmed that proper methods for sampling and logging were being 
conducted and the drilling and geophysical logging methods were at or above the industry standard. Core and rotary 
cutting recovery were well documented and of good quality for interpretation. 
 
Results 
 
Results compiled from the above described drilling activities were carefully compiled in a consistent and quality 
manner enabling easy retrieval and correlation for interpretive purposes. 
 
The mineralized zones at Palangana are oriented essentially horizontal along semi-linear fronts. The drill holes are 
all oriented vertical which intersect the mineralized zones at right angles. Therefore, the mineralized intercepts as 
recorded in the drill holes do represent true thickness of the mineralized zones.  
 
The table below summarizes the results of drilling at the Palangana Project.

Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 
 
Discussion  on  sample  preparation,  analyses  and  security  in  this  report  is  limited  to  the  samples  collected  by 
employees of Energy Metals and Uranium One. Core sample acquisition has been done using appropriate QA/QC 
methods  to  minimize  contamination  and  oxidization.  The  core  was  wrapped  and  frozen  immediately  after 
acquisition then shipped directly to Energy Laboratories in Casper, Wyoming. Although Energy Laboratories does 
have approximately 26 certifications from various federal and state agencies they are not an ISO certified laboratory. 
 
Energy  Laboratories  has  an  impeccable  reputation  for  uranium  assay  and  physio-chemical  testing  for  ISR 
amenability.  Being  located  amidst  the  Wyoming  uranium  belt  of  the  Powder  River  Basin  has  enabled  Energy 
Laboratories to continue with advances in technologies during the down cycle of uranium prices since production in 
the area continued during this period. Their QA/QC procedures have historically been overseen by uranium experts 
who understand the propensity for uranium disequilibrium in Texas deposits and the requisites for laboratory check 
samples, standards and blanks. Generally, two assays were typically run: a percent chemical U3O8 by one of several 
acceptable  methods  and  an  equivalent  percent  U3O8  based  on  a  “closed  can”  radiometric  assay  to  determine  a 
gamma equivalent assay to approximate the downhole gamma log. Although it was standard practice to insert QA 
control samples (i.e., blanks, standards, and duplicates) into the sample sequence, there are no records from the UCC 
sampling to verify that a QA/QC procedure was followed. 
 
Core Laboratories Inc. ran select samples for horizontal and vertical permeability and porosity from core plugs and 
density measurements. Core Laboratories Inc. is an industry leader in petroleum services but is not ISO certified. 
 
Horizontal permeability values ranged from practically zero to over eight darcies in the UCC production area which 
should  be  reasonably  applicable  to  all  Goliad  sand  units  within  the  Palangana  Project.  The  lower  values 
corresponded to mudstones and some very fine-grained zones described as “silty” and/or “limy”. Within mineralized 
zones,  horizontal  permeability  varies  from  a  few  hundred  millidarcies  to  the  upper  limit  of  over  eight  darcies. 
Sample descriptions between the two extremes are hardly different - both are most often described as very fine-
grained to fine-grained, silty sandstone. Absent any analytical data and more detailed descriptions, the conclusion is 
that the lower permeability samples are due to more clay or calcium carbonate cement. Vertical permeability ranged 
from 50% to 75% of horizontal. 
 
Porosity percentages from core plugs ranged from the low 20’s to the low 30’s with an average of about 28% in the 
core descriptions examined. UCC settled on a density factor of 17ft3/t for rock density. An average of 137 density 
values available for 15 cores studied averaged 16.8ft3/t.

Methodologies utilized by UEC are deemed acceptable to meet the CIM requirements for the industry. 
 
Interpretation
The  sampling  and  analysis  methods  employed  by  Uranium  One  and  previous  operators  meet  or  exceed  industry 
standards. The usage of PFN borehole logging is particularly useful in deposits that exhibit disequilibrium such as 
those at Palangana. 
 
Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
 
The Palangana uranium host rock consists of both sand and clay with about 20% calcium carbonate. The uranium 
content  can  vary  from  essentially  zero  to  over  1%  U3O8  within  a  few  feet.  Although  grades  and  analyses  are 
generally  given  in  terms  of  U3O8,  the  species  itself  has  not  been  identified.  The  uranium  phase  present  in  the 
mineralization  is  thought  to  be  UO2,  although  because  of  its  extreme  fineness,  no  mineral  has  been  positively 
identified.  The  Palangana uranium  is  considered  to be  a secondary  deposit,  in which the  uranium  was  originally 
transported from another deposit, probably in the soluble hexavalent form, and then was reprecipitated as UO2 by 
H2S  or  other  reducing  agents.  Iron  and  sulfur  contents  are  in  about  equal  proportions  at  around  1%.  The  FeS2 
minerals marcasite and pyrite have been identified, with marcasite predominating. Most of the sulfur is in the form 
of FeS2, although small amounts are apparently present as sulfate. The amount of iron exceeds that necessary to 
combine with sulfur and likely is a form of ferrous carbonate. Detailed mineralogical studies have not been found in 
the references and may not exist. 
 
Other  metal  constituents  are  molybdenum,  vanadium,  copper,  and  rhenium.  It  is  likely  that  these  metals,  except 
possibly vanadium, are present as sulfides. Of these four, molybdenum is the most abundant, being on the average 
about  10%  of  the  uranium  content  of  the  mineralization,  but  varying  widely  in  range,  Vanadium  is  not  always 
detectable by chemical methods, since its concentration is <0.01%. Copper generally ranges from 0.003 to 0.005%. 
The precious metal rhenium is present as a trace constituent, and can be found in concentrations ranging from 0.01- 
0.2% rhenium for every 100% MoS2. 
 
In  1970,  UCC  conducted  their  own  pilot  plant  leach  study  using  ammonia  and  hydrogen  peroxide  as  respective 
oxidants. These tests concluded that the Palangana ores were very easy to leach with carbonate solutions at ambient 
temperature.  The  ease  of  leaching  is  thought  to  result  from  the  extreme  fineness  of  the  uranium  species.  Some 
permeability reduction occurred as a result of montmorillonite swelling. 
 
Energy Metals submitted selected core samples to Energy Laboratories, Inc. in Casper, Wyoming in April 2008. 
These core samples from the Palangana Project were sent to the laboratory for leach amenability studies intended to 
demonstrate that uranium  mineralization at the property was capable of being leached using conventional in situ 
leach  chemistry.  The  tests  do  not  approximate  other  in-situ  variables  (permeability,  porosity,  and  pressure)  but 
provide an indication of a sample’s reaction rate and the potential chemical recovery. 
 
Permitting 
 
We have obtained all the permits required for the Palangana project to proceed with development and have fully and 
successfully completed the state permitting process at all levels.
Mineral Exploration Properties
We hold mineral properties in the States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming by way of 
mining claims and state and private mineral leases.  The mining claim properties were staked and claimed by us and 
registered with the US Bureau of Land Management ("BLM").  There are claim blocks acquired in this manner in 
Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.  We have surface access and complete mineral rights to an 
unlimited depth below surface.  The claims are in effect for an indefinite period provided the claims are kept in good 
standing with the BLM and the counties on an annual basis.  The claims were entered into between November 4, 
2004 and July 2008.
3962727.3
36
Annual maintenance fees to be paid to the BLM are relatively nominal.  We will also be required to remediate the 
land upon release of the claim - bringing the land back into the state it was originally in prior to the commencement 
of our exploration activities.  These costs are determined by the BLM and bonded accordingly.
In the States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Wyoming and Utah we are participating in our mineral 
properties by way of property leases directly from the owners of the land/mineral rights.  As of the date of this report 
we  have  executed  leases  in  Arizona,  Colorado,  New  Mexico,  Texas,  Wyoming  and  Utah.    These  leases  give  us 
similar access and privileges as described above, however with some important differences.  Although we will have 
access to the surface, the mineral rights below surface are restricted to uranium and associated fissionable minerals 
only, with any other minerals and hydro carbons, including, for example, petroleum, retained by the lessor.  The 
lease terms are for five years, and include five-year renewal periods.  After the expiration of the second five-year 
term the leases will be either held by production or the leases will be terminated.  Royalty payments must be made 
to the lessor in event that we extract uranium ore from the properties.  Royalty payments vary based on a sliding 
scale tied to the price of uranium.  All royalties are based on the gross sales revenue less certain charges and fees.
We have the following gross and net acre mineral property interests in states indicated below under lease:

Certain of our interests in our mineral properties in New Mexico and Texas are less than 100%.  Accordingly, we have presented the acreage of our 
mineral properties on a net acre basis.
We plan to conduct exploration programs on these properties with the objective of determining the existence of any 
economic concentrations of uranium.
Since inception we have not established any proven or probable reserves on our mineral property interests.
On October 11, 2005, we entered into a Mineral Asset Option Agreement (the "Option") with Brad A. Moore giving 
us  the  option  to  acquire  certain  uranium  leases  from  Mr.  Moore  in  the  State  of  Texas.    In  consideration  for  the 
Option we have paid Mr. Moore a cash payment of $50,000 and issued 1,000,000 shares of our restricted common 
stock.  The Option, which was exercised, required the further issuance of 2,000,000 restricted shares of common 
stock in varying share installments over the three, six month intervals following the effective date of the Option 
Agreement (October 11, 2005).  A further payment of $150,000 was paid under the Option on February 1, 2006.  
Title  to  the  properties  transferred  upon  payment  of  all  remaining  stock  required  under  the  Option.    During  the 
Option term we had the right as operator to conduct or otherwise direct all the exploration on the properties to be 
acquired.  As of this date all cash consideration and share issuances required pursuant to the terms of the Option 
have been completed.
On May 1, 2007, we entered into a joint venture with Neutron Energy Inc. ("NEI"), a Wyoming corporation, in 
connection with the exploration of a property covering approximately 6,700 acres located in Cibola County, New 
Mexico,  for  uranium  resources.    In  connection  with  the joint  venture,  Cibola  Resources  LLC,  a  limited  liability 
company under the laws of the State of Delaware, was formed to undertake the exploration activities contemplated 
by the parties. NEI acquired the mining lease to the property from La Merced del Pueblo de Cebolleta ("Cebolleta"),
3962727.3
37
a  private  entity  that  has  the  authority  over  the  natural  resources  of  the  property,  pursuant  to  a  letter  agreement 
between  Cebolleta  and  NEI  dated  January  27,  2007,  and  has  contributed  the  lease  to  Cibola  Resources.    In 
connection with the acquisition of the lease, NEI has made cash payments to Cebolleta of $5,000,000 to date.  The 
Company has reimbursed an aggregate of $2,450,000 to NEI to date.  As a result, NEI and the Company held a 51% 
and 49% interest, respectively, in Cibola Resources.
On April 12, 2010, the Company received a cash payment in the amount of $11,000,000 from NEI for the sale of our 
49% interest in the Cibola Resources LLC joint venture.
Arizona
All of our Arizona claims and state leases were previously the subject of exploration drilling for the incidence of 
uranium by companies such as Noranda, Inc., Uranerz Energy Corp., Homestake Mining Co., Occidental Minerals 
and  Oklahoma  Public  Services.    We  have  acquired  a  1979  Oklahoma  Public  Services  ("OPS")  geologic  report 
contiguous to our claims (Artillery Peak), as well as gamma-ray logs from Homestake, that indicates the possibility 
of incidence of uranium.  OPS drilling continued on to our claims as evidenced by drill holes verified on the ground, 
and such drill cuttings were found to be radioactive.  Close spaced developmental drilling is indicated on our claims 
located at Artillery Peak.
Other  claims  staked  by  us  (Dry  Mountain)  in  Arizona were  staked  on  known  uranium  occurrences  as  shown  on 
Arizona  State  publication,  "Occurrences  of  Uranium  in  Miscellaneous  Sedimentary  Formations,  Diatremes  and 
Pipes and Veins".  Additionally, these claims were previously drilled by companies including Homestake Mining 
Co., Uranerz Energy Corp. and Noranda, Inc. in the 1970's uranium boom.  Our management has confirmed prior 
claim ownership as verified with the US Department of Interior - BLM.  In addition, ground surveys completed by 
us have located various previous drill locations and radioactive anomalies as evidenced in ground and drill cuttings.
On November 1, 2007, we entered into a binding letter Agreement to Purchase Assets with Melvin O.  Stairs, Jr. 
("Mr.  Stairs"),  for  a  mineral  exploration  claim  and  related  database  information  located  in  Maricopa  County, 
Arizona.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will pay total consideration of $1,200,000 including i) a 
$10,000 deposit upon execution (paid), ii) installments of $95,000 cash on January 10, 2008 (paid) and August 15, 
2008, and iii) installments totaling $100,000 on January 10 and August 15 of each year for the period from January 
10,  2009  through  August  15,  2013.    Additionally,  the  Company  has  granted  the  seller  security  interest  on  the 
acquired assets until the agreement is paid in full.  On August 25, 2008, we entered into an amendment agreement 
pursuant to which the total consideration payable was reduced to $300,000 as follows:  i) a $10,000 deposit upon 
execution (paid), ii) installments of $95,000 cash on January 10, 2008 (paid) and $57,000 cash (paid) and $38,000 
by way of issuance of 19,000 restricted common shares of the Company at a deemed price of $2.00 per share on 
August 15, 2008.
On January 25, 2010, the Company and Mr. Stairs agreed to amend the August 25, 2008 Amending Agreement. We 
agreed  to  pay  Mr.  Stairs  a  further  and  final  non-refundable  Purchase  Price  Payment  in  the  aggregate  amount 
equivalent to $65,000 payable in the following manner; i) the initial $30,000 of the Purchase Price Payment by way 
of  cash (paid);  and  ii)  the  final  balance  of  U.S.  $35,000  of  this  Purchase  Price  Payment  by  way of  the  issuance 
10,448 fully paid and non-assessable restricted common shares at deemed issuance price of U.S. $3.35 per Share 
(issued).
We  confirm  that  as  of  this  date  our  Arizona  located  claims  and  leases  contain  no  uranium  reserves  and  require 
extensive exploration by us.

The West Ranch Project consists of approximately 7,000 acres made up of lode mining claims and private leases in 
northwestern New Mexico, on the northwest end of the historically uraniferous Ambrosia Lake trend of the Grants 
Uranium District.  The property was drilled by United Nuclear Corporation and, more recently, by Kerr McGee.  
Historical wide-spaced drilling across the property indicates the presence of several northwest-southeast trending 
uranium mineralized zones within the Morrison Formation at average depths of 800 feet.
Our Laguna Trend Project consists of approximately 800 acres of lode claims on Bureau of Land Management land 
in northwestern New Mexico.  The claim block is on-trend and several miles northeast of the historically-producing 
St. Anthony, Jackpile Paguate, and L-Bar uranium deposits, mined by Anaconda Minerals and Sohio.  Northeast of
3962727.3

the  Company's  claim  block  is  Kerr  McGee's  (now  Anadarko  Petroleum's)  uranium  deposit,  Rio  Puerco,  and 
Conoco's Bernabe uranium deposit.  Both of these deposits are yet to be developed.
Acquisition of the Laguna Trend claim block by Uranium Energy was driven by intense analysis of the Morrison 
Nuclear  database,  which  includes  drilling  data  indicating  significant  uranium  mineralization  in  the  Westwater 
Canyon Member of the Morrison Formation.  This property was most recently held by Kerr-McGee.
Red Basin consists of claims in the Datil Basin of Catron County.  The project area was previously staked by Kerr-
McGee with the Cretaceous de Baca Formation as the target.
Grants Ridge is a Todilto Formation target in the Grants Uranium District and is currently under option by Uran Ltd. 
of Perth, Australia.
We  confirm  that  at  the  current  date,  our  New  Mexico  located  claims  contain  no  uranium  reserves  and  require 
extensive exploration by us.

We currently own twelve lease plays located in the South Texas uranium trend.  The location and acquisition of

Our  Crain  Lease  was  the  subject  of  prior  exploration  drilling  conducted  by  Pioneer-Uravan,  Inc.  and  Truchas 
Limited in the 1970s to search for uranium indications.  We have acquired gamma drill log interpretation worksheets 
from work previously conducted by Pioneer-Uravan, Inc.  In addition, drill hole location maps have been obtained 
from work conducted for Pioneer-Uravan, Inc. and Truchas Limited.  Further assay reports on core samples from 
exploration  drilling  previously  conducted  by  Pioneer-Uravan,  Inc.,  as  verified  by  that  company's  commissioned 
assay report, have also been obtained, as well as certain drill indicated uranium findings that provide the basis for 
preliminary  mineralization  information  as  previously  conducted  and  defined  in  a  Truchas  Limited  summary  and 
report (1979).  The Montezuma Canyon leases are State of Utah leases on trend with known mineralization.  As at 
this  date  our  Utah  located  claims  contain  no  uranium  reserves  that  we  have  independently  verified,  and  require 
extensive exploration by us.

Our  five  Wyoming  uranium  mineral  property  areas  total  3,675.37  acres.    Wyoming  led  the  nation's  uranium 
production in 2006 with 4,100,000 pounds of U3O8.
The Granite Mountain Thrust ("GMT") property includes 610.80 acres of mining claims north of, and adjacent to, 
the Rio Tinto (Kennecott) uranium property, which has been drilled extensively since the 1960s by several entities.

Our GMT property geology host rock is 2,000 to 3,000 feet thick in the early Eocene Age Battle Springs Formation 
-  partly  equivalent  to  the  Wasatch  and  Wind  River  formations  in  other  Wyoming  Basins.    We  have  assessed 
previous seismic exploration shot line data and confirmed Battle Springs Formation projections to the GMT area. 
The property is situated approximately eight miles east of the Crooks Gap uranium mining district, which produced 
about 10,000,000 pounds of U3O8 from 1953 through 1982 by open pit mining.
The Burnt Wagon project, located 35 miles west of Casper, Wyoming, was acquired from NAMMCO (Kirkwood) in 
2006.  Previous operations defined shallow uranium mineralization in the Wind River formation of early Eocene 
age, at 50 to 200 foot depths, from 500 drill holes and 16,000 feet of electric logging data.
Situated in the Lower Eocene Wasatch formation of the southwest Powder River Basin is our Powder River Basin 
LO-Herma  uranium  property.    The  exploration  data  was  acquired  from  H.  Brenniman  as  a  part  of  the  Pioneer 
Nuclear, Inc., package in 2006.  The 29 mining claims total 591.57 acres and are contiguous to the Uranium One 
(formerly Energy Metals Corp.) property.
Our DL, 1,275.00 acre, property is being assessed by using Pioneer Nuclear, Inc., 1970 uranium exploration data 
from the H. Brenniman database.
We confirm that at the current date, our Wyoming located claims contain no uranium reserves and require extensive 
exploration by us.

Our  Vice  President  of  Exploration,  Clyde  Yancey,  a  Certified  Professional  Geologist,  based  on  historical  data 
previously outlined and our own work product, has developed exploration programs unique to each state and claim 
block with the intent of proving or disproving the existence of uranium on these prospects.  The exploration plans 
for Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming will be instituted once our Palangana property in Texas is 
placed  into  production  and  we  see  an  increase  in  the  price  of  uranium.    Therefore,  for  the  current  term,  these 
exploration properties  are  all  on hold.    Exploration  and land  acquisition  in  the  South  Texas  Uranium  Trend will 
continue in order to support our near term production facilities.
South Texas Leases
During  2009  and  2010,  our  exploration  group  has  focused  its  attention  on  regional  studies  within  the  trend, 
establishing  additional  mineralization  at  Palangana,  and  assessing  our  newly  acquired  leases  acquired  from  the 
South Texas Mining Venture acquisition.  The work at Palangana has focused on an extensive re-mapping of the 
entire geologic system responsible for the deposition of uranium mineralization at the project.  Based on some of the 
newly  interpreted  data,  a  limited  drilling  program  has  been  carried  out  down-dip  of  the  Palangana  Salt  Dome 
structure.  Also, we were able to acquire the data base that covers our Salvo project.  This data base is currently 
being evaluated, and it is expected that a drilling program will be developed as a result of this evaluation.
3962727.3

Our  operational  business  plan  calls  for  the  acquisition  of  further  uranium  exploration  properties  in  Texas  as 
exploration analyses dictate.
Competition
We  operate  in  a  highly  competitive  industry,  competing  with  other  mining  and  exploration  companies,  and 
institutional and individual investors, which are actively seeking uranium minerals exploration properties throughout 
the  world  together  with  the  equipment,  labor  and  materials  required  to  exploit  such  properties.    Many  of  our 
competitors  have  financial  resources,  staff  and  facilities  substantially  greater  than  ours.    The  principal  area  of 
competition is encountered in the financial ability to cost effectively acquire prime minerals exploration prospects 
and  then  exploit  such  prospects.    Competition  for  the  acquisition  of  uranium  minerals  exploration  properties  is 
intense,  with  many  properties  available  in  a  competitive  bidding  process  in  which  we  may  lack  technological 
information or expertise available to other bidders.  Therefore, we may not be successful in acquiring, exploring and 
developing profitable properties in the face of this competition.  No assurance can be given that a sufficient number 
of suitable uranium minerals exploration properties will be available for acquisition, exploration and development.
Minerals Exploration Regulation
Our minerals exploration activities are, or will be, subject to extensive laws and regulations governing prospecting, 
development,  production,  exports,  taxes,  labor  standards,  occupational  health,  waste  disposal,  protection  and 
remediation of the environment, protection of endangered and protected species, mine safety, toxic substances and 
other  matters.    Minerals  exploration  is  also  subject  to  risks  and  liabilities  associated  with  pollution  of  the 
environment and disposal of waste products occurring as a result of mineral exploration and production.
Compliance with these laws and regulations may impose substantial costs on us and will subject us to significant 
potential liabilities.  Changes in these regulations could require us to expend significant resources to comply with 
new laws or regulations or changes to current requirements and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
operations.
Exploration and production activities are subject to certain environmental regulations which may prevent or delay 
the  commencement  or  continuance  of  our  operations.    In  general,  our  exploration  and  production  activities  are 
subject  to  certain  federal,  state  and  local  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  environmental  quality  and  pollution 
control.    Such  laws  and  regulations  increase  the  costs  of  these  activities  and  may  prevent  or  delay  the 
commencement or continuance of a given operation.  Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a 
material effect on our operations or financial condition to date.  Specifically, we are subject to legislation regarding 
emissions  into  the  environment,  water  discharges  and  storage  and  disposition  of  hazardous  wastes.    In  addition, 
legislation has been enacted which requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction 
of state authorities.  However, such laws and regulations are frequently changed and we are unable to predict the 
ultimate cost of compliance.  Generally, environmental requirements do not appear to affect us any differently or to 
any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry and our current operations have not expanded to a 
point  where  either  compliance  or  cost  of  compliance  with  environmental  regulation  is  a  significant  issue  for  us.  
Costs  have  been  incurred  to  date  with  respect  to  compliance  with  environmental  laws,  primarily  relating  to  the 
posting  of  a  performance  bond,  and  costs  are  only  expected  to  increase  with  the  increasing  scale  and  scope  of 
exploration operations, especially with the advent of Phase II exploration costs.
Minerals  exploration  operations  are  subject  to  comprehensive  regulation  which  may  cause  substantial  delays  or 
require capital outlays in excess of those anticipated causing an adverse effect on our business operations.  Minerals 
exploration  operations  are  subject  to  federal,  state,  and  local  laws  relating  to  the  protection  of  the  environment, 
including  laws  regulating  removal  of  natural  resources  from  the  ground  and  the  discharge  of  materials  into  the 
environment.  Minerals exploration operations are also subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations which 
seek to maintain health and safety standards by regulating the design and use of drilling methods and equipment.  
Various permits from government bodies are required for drilling operations to be conducted; no assurance can be 
given that such permits will be received.  Environmental standards imposed by federal, state, or local authorities 
may be changed and any such changes may have material adverse effects on our activities.  Moreover, compliance 
with such laws may cause substantial delays or require capital outlays in excess of those anticipated, thus causing an 
adverse  effect on us.   Additionally,  we  may  be  subject to  liability  for pollution or other  environmental  damages
3962727.3
43
which we may elect not to insure against due to prohibitive premium costs and other reasons.  As of the date of this 
annual report, other than with respect to the posting of a performance bond, we have not been required to spend 
material amounts on compliance with environmental regulations.  However, we may be required to do so in future 
and  this  may  affect  our  ability  to  expand  or  maintain  our  operations.    Environmental  regulation  is  discussed  in 
further detail in the following section.
Environmental Regulation
Our  activities  will  be  subject  to  existing  federal,  state  and  local  laws  and  regulations  governing  environmental 
quality  and  pollution  control.    Our  operations  will  be  subject  to  stringent  environmental  regulation  by  state  and 
federal authorities including the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA").  Such regulation can increase the cost 
of such activities.  In most instances, the regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution control measures.
Waste Disposal
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), and comparable state statutes, affect minerals exploration 
and production activities by imposing regulations on the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and 
cleanup of "hazardous wastes" and on the disposal of non-hazardous wastes.  Under the auspices of the EPA, the 
individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more 
stringent requirements.
CERCLA
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") imposes joint 
and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to 
fault  or  the  legality  of  the  original  conduct,  on  certain  classes  of  persons  with  respect  to  the  release  into  the 
environment of substances designated under CERCLA as hazardous substances ("Hazardous Substances").  These 
classes of persons or potentially responsible parties include the current and certain past owners and operators of a 
facility or property where there is or has been a release or threat of release of a Hazardous Substance and persons 
who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the Hazardous Substances found at such a facility. CERCLA also 
authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the 
environment  and  to  seek  to  recover  the  costs  of  such  action.    We  may  also  in  the  future  become  an  owner  of 
facilities on which Hazardous Substances have been released by previous owners or operators.  We may in the future 
be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up facilities or property at which such substances 
have been released and for natural resource damages.
Air Emissions
Our operations are subject to local, state and federal regulations for the control of emissions of air pollution.  Major 
sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent, federally imposed permitting requirements.  Administrative 
enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air pollution regulations or permits are generally resolved by 
payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies.  Alternatively, regulatory agencies could 
require us to forego construction, modification or operation of certain air emission sources.
Clean Water Act
The Clean Water Act ("CWA") imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes, including 
mineral processing wastes, into waters of the United States, a term broadly defined.  Permits must be obtained to 
discharge  pollutants  into  federal  waters.    The  CWA  provides  for  civil,  criminal  and  administrative  penalties  for 
unauthorized discharges of hazardous substances and other pollutants.  It imposes substantial potential liability for 
the costs of removal or remediation associated with discharges of oil or hazardous substances.  State laws governing 
discharges to water also provide varying civil, criminal and administrative penalties and impose liabilities in the case 
of a discharge of petroleum or it derivatives, or other hazardous substances, into state waters.  In addition, the EPA 
has promulgated regulations that may require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff.  In the event of
3962727.3
44
an unauthorized discharge of wastes, we may be liable for penalties and costs.  Management believes that we are in 
substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Research and Development Activities
No research and development expenditures have been incurred, either on our account or sponsored by customers for 
the past three years.
Employees
Amir Adnani is our President and Chief Executive Officer, Harry Anthony is our Chief Operating Officer and Pat 
Obara is our Chief Financial Officer.  These individuals are primarily responsible for all our day-to-day operations.  
Other  services  are  provided  by  outsourcing  and  consultant  and  special  purpose  contracts.    We  currently  employ 
approximately 62 persons on a full time basis and contract with approximately 6 individuals on a full time basis for 
ongoing services provided to the Company.
ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS
An investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks.  You should carefully consider 
the  following risks and  uncertainties  in  addition  to other  information  in  this  annual  report  in evaluating our 
company and its business before purchasing shares of our common stock.  Our business, operating results and 
financial condition could be seriously harmed due to any of the following risks.  The risks described below may 
not  be  all  of  the  risks  facing  our  company.    Additional  risks  not  presently  known  to  us  or  that  we  currently 
consider immaterial may also impair our business operations.  You could lose all or part of your investment due 
to any of these risks.
Risks Related to Our Business
We  will  require  significant  additional  financing  in  order  to  continue  our  exploration  activities  and  our 
assessment of the commercial viability of our mineral properties.
We will need to raise additional financing to complete further exploration of our mineral properties.  Furthermore, if 
the costs of our planned exploration programs are greater than anticipated, we may have to seek additional funds 
through public or private share offerings or arrangements with corporate partners.  There can be no assurance that 
we  will  be  successful  in  our  efforts  to  raise  the  required  funds,  or  on  terms  satisfactory  to  us.    The  continued 
exploration of our mineral properties and the development of our business will depend upon our ability to establish 
the commercial viability of our mineral properties and to ultimately develop cash flow from operations and reach 
profitable operations.  We currently are in the exploration stage and we have no revenue from operations and we are 
experiencing significant negative cash flow.  Accordingly, the only other sources of funds presently available to us 
are through the sale of equity.  We presently believe that debt financing will not be an alternative to us as all of our 
properties are in the exploration stage.  Alternatively, we may finance our business by offering an interest in our 
mineral  properties  to  be  earned  by  another  party  or  parties  carrying  out  further  exploration  thereof  or  to  obtain 
project or operating financing from financial institutions, neither of which is presently intended.  Our future cash 
flows  and  the  availability  of  financing  will  be  subject  to  a  number  of  variables,  including  the  market  price  of 
uranium.  We may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all.  If we are unable to obtain 
this  additional  financing,  we  will  not  be  able  to  continue  our  exploration  activities  and  our  assessment  of  the 
commercial viability of our mineral properties.
As our mineral properties do not contain any reserves or any known body of economic mineralization, we may 
not discover commercially exploitable quantities of ore on our mineral properties that would enable us to enter 
into commercial production, achieve revenues and recover the money we spend on exploration.
Our  properties  do  not  contain  reserves  in  accordance  with  the  definitions  adopted  by  the  SEC  and  there  is  no 
assurance that any exploration programs that we carry out will establish reserves.  All of our mineral properties are 
in the exploration stage as opposed to the development stage and have no known body of economic mineralization.
3962727.3
45
The  known  mineralization  at  these  projects  has  not  yet  been  determined  to  be  economic  ore,  and  may  never  be 
determined  to  be  economic.    We  plan  to  conduct  further  exploration  activities  on  our  mineral  properties,  which 
future  exploration  may  include  the  completion  of  feasibility  studies  necessary  to  evaluate  whether  a  commercial 
mineable orebody exists on any of our mineral properties.  There is a substantial risk that these exploration activities 
will not result in discoveries of commercially recoverable quantities of ore.  Any determination that our properties 
contain  commercially  recoverable  quantities  of  ore  may  not  be  reached  until  such  time  that  final  comprehensive 
feasibility  studies  have  been  concluded  that  establish  that  a  potential  mine  is  likely  to  be  economic.    There  is  a 
substantial  risk  that  any  preliminary  or  final  feasibility  studies  carried  out  by  us  will  not  result  in  a  positive 
determination that our mineral properties can be commercially developed.
Our exploration activities on our mineral properties may not be successful, which could lead us to abandon our 
plans to develop the property and its investments in exploration.
We are an exploration stage company and have not as yet established any reserves on our properties.  Our long-term 
success depends on our ability to establish commercially recoverable quantities of ore on our mineral properties that 
can then be developed into commercially viable  mining operations.  Mineral exploration is highly speculative in 
nature, involves many risks and is frequently non-productive.  These risks include unusual or unexpected geologic 
formations, and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labor.  The success of uranium 
exploration is determined in part by the following factors:
•
•
•
•
identification of potential uranium mineralization based on superficial analysis;
availability of government-granted exploration permits;
the quality of management and geological and technical expertise; and
the capital available for exploration.
Substantial  expenditures  are  required  to  establish  proven  and  probable  reserves  through  drilling  and  analysis,  to 
develop  metallurgical  processes  to  extract  metal,  and  to  develop  the  mining  and  processing  facilities  and 
infrastructure  at  any  site  chosen  for  mining.    Whether  a  mineral  deposit  will  be  established  or  determined  to  be 
commercially viable depends on a number of factors, which include, without limitation, the particular attributes of 
the  deposit,  such  as  size,  grade  and  proximity  to  infrastructure;  metal  prices,  which  fluctuate  widely;  and 
government  regulations,  including,  without  limitation,  regulations  relating  to  prices,  taxes,  royalties,  land  tenure, 
land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection.  We may invest significant capital and 
resources  in  exploration  activities  and  abandon  such  investments  if  we  are  unable  to  identify  commercially 
exploitable mineral reserves.  The decision to abandon a project may reduce the trading price of our common stock 
and impair our ability to raise future financing.  We cannot provide any assurance to investors that we will discover 
any mineralized material in sufficient quantities on any of our properties to justify commercial operations.  Further, 
we will not be able to recover the funds that we spend on exploration if we are not able to establish commercially 
recoverable quantities of ore on our mineral properties.
We have a history of operating losses and there can be no assurances we will be profitable in the future.
We have a history of operating losses, expect to continue to incur losses, and may never be profitable, and we must 
be considered to be in the exploration stage.  Further, we have been dependent on sales of our equity securities and 
debt financing to meet our cash requirements.  We have incurred losses totaling $68,382,133 from May 16, 2003 
(inception)  to  July  31,  2010.    We  incurred  net  losses  totaling  $14,478,669  in  the  year  ended  July  31,  2010, 
$13,503,576 in the year ended July 31, 2009 and $19,236,124 in the year ended July 31, 2008.  Further, we do not 
expect positive cash flow from operations in the near term.  There is no assurance that actual cash requirements will 
not exceed our estimates.  In particular, additional capital may be required in the event that: (i) the costs to acquire 
additional  uranium  exploration  claims  are  more  than  we  currently  anticipate;  (ii)  exploration  costs  for  additional 
claims  increase  beyond  our  expectations;  or  (iii)  we  encounter  greater  costs  associated  with  general  and 
administrative expenses or offering costs.
3962727.3
46
Our participation in an increasingly larger number of uranium minerals exploration prospects has required and will 
continue to require substantial capital expenditures.  The uncertainty and factors described throughout this section 
may impede our ability to economically discover uranium prospects.  As a result, we may not be able to achieve or 
sustain profitability or positive cash flows from operating activities in the future.
We are a new entrant into the uranium mineral exploration industry with a limited and unprofitable operating 
history.
Since our inception on May 16, 2003, our activities have been limited to organizational efforts, obtaining working 
capital  and  acquiring  and  exploring  a  very  limited  number  of  properties.    As  a  result,  there  is  limited  historical 
financial and operating information available upon which to evaluate our future performance.
The business of minerals exploration is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including those described in this 
section, and if uranium is found in economic quantities, the profitability of future uranium mining ventures depends 
upon factors beyond our control.  The profitability of mining uranium properties if economic quantities of uranium 
are  found  is  dependent  upon  many  factors  and  risks  beyond  our  control,  including,  but  not  limited  to:  (i) 
unanticipated  ground  and  water  conditions  and  adverse  claims  to  water  rights;  (ii)  geological  problems;  (iii) 
metallurgical  and other processing problems;  (iv)  the  occurrence of  unusual  weather or  operating  conditions  and 
other force majeure events; (v) lower than expected ore grades; (vi) accidents; (vii) delays in the receipt of or failure 
to receive necessary government permits; (viii) delays in transportation; (ix) labor disputes; (x) government permit 
restrictions  and  regulation  restrictions;  (xi)  unavailability  of  materials  and  equipment;  and  (xii)  the  failure  of 
equipment or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations.
The  risks  associated  with  exploration  and,  if  applicable,  mining  could  cause  personal  injury  or  death, 
environmental damage, delays in mining, monetary losses and possible legal liability. 
 
We are not currently engaged in mining operations because we are in the exploration phase and have not yet any 
proved uranium reserves.  The Company’s exploration activities are subject to the risks normally inherent in the 
industry, including, but not limited, to environmental hazards, flooding, fire, periodic or seasonal hazardous climate 
and  weather  conditions,  unexpected  rock  formation,  industrial  accidents  and  metallurgical  and  other  processing 
problems. These risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties, production facilities or other 
properties; personal injury; environmental damage; delays in mining; increased production costs; monetary losses; 
and possible legal liability. The Company may become subject to liability which it cannot insure or against which it 
may  elect  not  to  insure  due  to  high  premium  costs  or  other  reasons.  Where  considered  practical  to  do  so  the 
Company maintains insurance against risks in the operation of its business in amounts which the Company believes 
to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage. The Company cannot 
provide any assurance that such insurance will continue to be available, will be available at economically acceptable 
premiums or will be adequate to cover any resulting liability. In some cases, coverage is not available or considered 
too expensive relative to the perceived risk.
The uranium exploration industry is highly competitive and there is no assurance that we will be successful in 
acquiring mineral exploration properties or leases.
The uranium exploration industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater 
resources.  Many of these companies not only explore for and produce uranium, but also market uranium and other 
products  on  a  regional,  national  or  worldwide  basis.    These  companies  may  be  able  to  pay  more  for  productive 
uranium  properties  and  exploratory  prospects  or  define,  evaluate,  bid  for  and  purchase  a  greater  number  of 
properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit.  In addition, these companies may have a 
greater  ability  to  continue  exploration  activities  during  periods  of  low  uranium  market  prices.    Our  larger 
competitors  may  be  able  to  absorb  the  burden  of  present  and  future  federal,  state,  local  and  other  laws  and 
regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position.  Our ability to acquire 
additional properties  and  to explore  them  in  the  future will  be  dependent  upon our  ability  to  evaluate  and  select 
suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.  In addition, because we 
have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in 
bidding for exploratory prospects.
3962727.3
47
If we are successful in acquiring additional properties, some or all of the properties may not produce positive results 
of  exploration,  or  we  may  not  complete  exploration  of  such  prospects  within  specified  time  periods  which  may 
cause the forfeiture of the lease in that prospect.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully 
integrate acquired properties, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or 
financial problems.  Further, acquisitions could disrupt ongoing business operations.  If any of these events occur, it 
would have a material adverse effect upon our operations and results from operations.
The marketability of natural resources will be affected by numerous factors beyond our control which may result 
in us not receiving an adequate return on invested capital to be profitable or viable.
The marketability of natural resources which may be acquired or discovered by us will be affected by numerous 
factors beyond our control.  These factors include macroeconomic factors, market fluctuations in commodity pricing 
and  demand,  the  proximity  and  capacity  of  natural  resource  markets  and  processing  equipment,  governmental 
regulations, land tenure, land use, regulation concerning the importing and exporting of uranium and environmental 
protection regulations.  The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these 
factors may result in us not receiving an adequate return on invested capital to be profitable or viable.
Uranium  mining  operations  are  subject  to  comprehensive  regulation,  which  may  cause  substantial  delays  or 
require capital outlays in excess of those anticipated, causing an adverse effect on our business operations.
If economic quantities of uranium are found on any lease owned by us in sufficient quantities to warrant uranium 
mining operations, such mining operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws relating to the protection of 
the  environment,  including  laws  regulating  removal  of  natural  resources  from  the  ground  and  the  discharge  of 
materials into the environment.  Uranium mining operations are also subject to federal, state, and local laws and 
regulations which seek to maintain health and safety standards by regulating the design and use of mining methods 
and equipment.  Various permits from government bodies are required for mining operations to be conducted; no 
assurance can be given that such permits will be received.  Environmental standards imposed by federal, provincial, 
or  local  authorities  may  be  changed  and  any  such  changes  may  have  material  adverse  effects  on  our  activities.  
Moreover,  compliance  with  such  laws  may  cause  substantial  delays  or  require  capital  outlays  in  excess  of  those 
anticipated, thus resulting in an adverse effect on us.  Additionally, we may be subject to liability for pollution or 
other environmental damages which we may elect not to insure against due to prohibitive premium costs and other 
reasons.    To  date,  we  have  not  been  required  to  spend  material  amounts  on  compliance  with  environmental 
regulations.    However,  we  may  be  required  to  do  so  in  the  future  and  this  may  affect  our  ability  to  expand  or 
maintain our operations.
Uranium  minerals  exploration  and  development  and  mining  activities  are  subject  to  certain  environmental 
regulations, which may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of our operations.
Uranium  minerals  exploration  and  development  and  future  potential  uranium  mining  operations  are  or  will  be 
subject to stringent federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining 
environmental  quality.    Environmental  laws  often  require  parties  to  pay  for  remedial  action  or  to  pay  damages 
regardless of fault.  Environmental laws also often impose liability with respect to divested or terminated operations, 
even if the operations were terminated or divested of many years ago.
Future potential uranium mining operations and current exploration activities are or will be subject to extensive laws 
and  regulations  governing  prospecting,  development,  production,  exports,  taxes,  labor  standards,  occupational 
health,  waste  disposal,  protection  and  remediation  of  the  environment,  protection  of  endangered  and  protected 
species,  mine  safety,  toxic  substances  and  other  matters.    Uranium  mining  is  also  subject  to  risks  and  liabilities 
associated  with  pollution  of  the  environment  and  disposal  of  waste  products  occurring  as  a  result  of  mineral 
exploration and production.  Compliance with these laws and regulations will impose substantial costs on us and 
will subject us to significant potential liabilities.
Costs associated with environmental liabilities and compliance are expected to increase with the increasing scale and 
scope of operations and we expect these costs may increase in the future.

We  believe  that  our  operations  comply,  in  all  material  respects,  with  all  applicable  environmental  regulations.  
However, we are not fully insured at the current date against possible environmental risks.
Any  change  in  government  regulation/administrative  practices  may  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  ability  to 
operate and our profitability.
The  laws,  regulations,  policies  or  current  administrative  practices  of  any  government  body,  organization  or 
regulatory agency in the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction, may be changed, applied or interpreted in 
a manner which will fundamentally alter our ability to carry on business.  The actions, policies or regulations, or 
changes  thereto,  of  any  government  body  or  regulatory  agency,  or  other  special  interest  groups,  may  have  a 
detrimental effect on us.  Any or all of these situations may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and/or 
our profitably.
We may be unable to retain key employees or consultants or recruit additional qualified personnel.
Our extremely limited personnel means that we would be required to spend significant sums of money to locate and 
train new employees in the event any of our employees resign or terminate their employment with us for any reason.  
Due to our limited operating history and financial resources, we are entirely dependent on the continued service of 
Amir  Adnani,  our  President,  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Principal  Executive  Officer  and  a  director,  and  Harry 
Anthony, our Chief Operating Officer and a director.  Further, we do not have key man life insurance on any of 
these individuals.  We may not have the financial resources to hire a replacement if any of our officers were to die.  
The loss of service of any of these employees could therefore significantly and adversely affect our operations.
Our officers and directors may be subject to conflicts of interest.
Some of our officers and directors serve only part time and may be subject to conflicts of interest.  Each may devote 
part of his working time to other business endeavors, including consulting relationships with other corporate entities, 
and may have responsibilities to these other entities.  Such conflicts may include deciding how much time to devote 
to our affairs, as well as what business opportunities should be presented to us.  Because of these relationships, some 
of our officers and directors may be subject to conflicts of interest.
Nevada law and our articles of incorporation may protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits.
Nevada  law  provides  that  our  officers  and  directors  will  not  be  liable  to  the  Company  or  its  stockholders  for 
monetary  damages  for  all  but  certain  types  of  conduct  as  officers  and  directors.    Our  Bylaws  permit  us  broad 
indemnification powers to all persons against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest 
extent provided or allowed by law.  The exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing stockholders from 
recovering  damages  against  our  officers  and  directors  caused  by  their  negligence,  poor  judgment  or  other 
circumstances.  The indemnification provisions may require us to use our limited assets to defend our officers and 
directors against claims, including claims arising out of their negligence, poor judgment, or other circumstances.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock into the public market by certain stockholders may 
result in significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock and could affect your ability to realize 
the current trading price of our common stock.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by certain stockholders could 
cause a reduction in the market price of our common stock.  As of the date of this annual report, we have 60,846,787 
shares of common stock issued and outstanding, of which 12,428,598 shares are restricted securities as that term is 
defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.  Although the Securities Act and Rule 144 place certain prohibitions 
on the sale of restricted securities, restricted securities may be sold into the public market under certain conditions.  
Further, as of the date of this annual report, there are an aggregate of 9,050,000 stock options outstanding and an 
aggregate of 5,231,882 share purchase warrants outstanding.
3962727.3
49
The sale of a substantial number of shares into the public market of previously restricted shares, or upon exercise of 
stock options or warrants, could place downward pressure on the price of our common stock.
The  trading  price  of  our  common  stock  on  the  NYSE  Amex  Equities  exchange  and  previously  on  the  OTC 
Bulletin  Board  has  been  and  may  continue  to  fluctuate  significantly  and  stockholders  may  have  difficulty 
reselling their shares.
Our common stock commenced trading on the NYSE Amex Equities exchange (formerly known as the American 
Stock Exchange) on September 28, 2007, and previously traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, and the trading price 
has fluctuated.  In addition to volatility associated with securities in general, the value of your investment could 
decline  due  to  the  impact  of  any  of  the  following  factors  upon  the  market  price  of  our  common  stock:  (i) 
disappointing results from our discovery or development efforts; (ii) failure to meet our revenue or profit goals or 
operating  budget;  (iii)  decline  in  demand  for  our  common  stock;  (iv)  downward  revisions  in  securities  analysts' 
estimates or changes in general  market conditions; (v) technological innovations by competitors or in competing 
technologies; (vi) lack of funding generated for operations; (vii) investor perception of our industry or our prospects; 
and (viii) general economic trends.
In addition, stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities have 
been highly volatile.  These fluctuations are often unrelated to operating performance and may adversely affect the 
market price of our common stock.  As a result, investors may be unable to sell their shares at a fair price and you 
may lose all or part of your investment.
Additional  issuances  of  equity  securities  may  result  in  dilution  to  our  existing  stockholders.    Our  Articles  of 
Incorporation authorize the issuance of 750,000,000 shares of common stock.
The  Board  of  Directors  has  the  authority  to  issue  additional  shares  of  our  capital  stock  to  provide  additional 
financing in the future and the issuance of any such shares may result in a reduction of the book value or market 
price of the outstanding shares of our common stock.  If we do issue any such additional shares, such issuance also 
will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other stockholders.  As a result of such 
dilution, if you acquire shares of our common stock, your proportionate ownership interest and voting power could 
be decreased.  Further, any such issuances could result in a change of control.
Our common stock is classified as a "penny stock" under SEC rules which limits the market for our common 
stock.
Because the market price of the common stock has fluctuated and may trade at times at less than $5 per share, the 
common stock may be classified as a "penny stock." SEC Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act imposes additional 
sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that recommend the purchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other 
than those who qualify as an "established customer" or an "accredited investor." This includes the requirement that a 
broker-dealer must make a determination that investments in penny stocks are suitable for the customer and must 
make  special  disclosures  to  the  customers  concerning  the  risk  of  penny  stocks.    Many  broker-dealers  decline  to 
participate  in  penny  stock  transactions  because  of  the  extra  requirements  imposed  on  penny  stock  transactions.  
Application of the penny stock rules to our common stock reduces the market liquidity of our shares, which in turn 
affects the ability of holders of our common stock to resell the shares they purchase, and they may not be able to 
resell at prices at or above the prices they paid.
A decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital and adversely 
impact our operations.
A decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a 
reduction  in  our  ability  to  raise  additional  capital  for  our  operations.    Because  our  operations  to  date  have  been 
principally financed through the sale of equity securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could have an 
adverse effect upon our liquidity and our continued operations. A reduction in our ability to raise equity capital in 
the  future  would  have  a  material  adverse  effect  upon  our  business  plan  and  operations,  including  our  ability  to
3962727.3
50
continue  our  current  operations.    If  our  stock  price  declines,  we  may  not  be  able  to  raise  additional  capital  or 
generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations.
A majority of our directors and officers are outside the United States, with the result that it may be difficult for 
investors  to  enforce  within  the  United  States  any  judgments  obtained  against  us  or  any  of  our  directors  or 
officers.
A majority of our directors and officers are nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, and 
all  or  a  substantial  portion  of  such  persons'  assets  are  located  outside  the  United  States.    As  a  result,  it  may  be 
difficult for investors to effect service of process on our directors or officers, or enforce within the United States or 
Canada any judgments obtained against us or our officers or directors, including judgments predicated upon the civil 
liability  provisions  of  the  securities  laws  of  the  United  States  or  any  state  thereof.    Consequently,  you  may  be 
effectively prevented from pursuing remedies under U.S. federal securities laws against them.  In addition, investors 
may not be able to commence an action in a Canadian court predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the 
securities laws of the United States.  The foregoing risks also apply to those experts identified in this annual report 
that are not residents of the United States.
Timing, estimated amount, capital and operating expenditures and economic returns of future production are 
based on estimates which may differ from actual results.
There are no assurances if and when a particular mineral property of the Company can enter into production. The 
amount of future production for all our projects, including Palangana, are based on the estimates prepared by or for 
the Company. The capital and operating costs to take the Company’s projects into production may be significantly 
higher  than  anticipated.  Capital  and  operating  costs  of  production  and  economic  returns  are  based  on  estimates 
prepared by or for the Company may differ significantly from their actual values. There can be no assurance that the 
Company’s actual capital and operating costs will not be higher than currently anticipated.
In  addition,  the  construction  and  development  of  mines  and  infrastructure  are  complex.  Resources  invested  in 
construction  and  development  may  yield  outcomes  that  may  differ  significantly  from  those  anticipated  by  the 
Company.

2006 Stock Incentive Plan
On December 19, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized and approved the adoption of the 2005 stock option plan 
effective December 19, 2005.  On October 10, 2006, we adopted the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan in place of the 2005 
Stock Option Plan, under which an aggregate of 10,000,000 of our shares may be issued.  All securities issued under 
the 2005 Stock Option Plan are covered by the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.  We have registered the shares underlying 
the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC.
The  purpose  of  the  2006  Stock  Incentive  Plan  is  to  enhance  our  long-term  stockholder  value  by  offering 
opportunities to our directors, officers, employees and eligible consultants to acquire and maintain stock ownership 
in order to give these persons the opportunity to participate in our growth and success, and to encourage them to 
remain in our service.
The 2006 Stock Incentive Plan is to be administered by our Board of Directors or a committee appointed by and 
consisting of two or more members of the Board of Directors, which shall determine, among other things, (i) the 
persons to be granted awards under the 2006 Plan; (ii) the number of shares or amount of other awards to be granted; 
and (iii) the terms and conditions of the awards granted.  The Company may issue restricted shares, options, stock 
appreciation  rights,  deferred  stock  rights,  dividend  equivalent  rights,  among  others,  under  the  2006  Plan.    An 
aggregate of 10,000,000 of our shares may be issued pursuant to the grant of awards under the 2006 Plan.
An  award  may  not  be  exercised  after  the  termination  date  of  the  award  and  may  be  exercised  following  the 
termination of an eligible participant's continuous service only to the extent provided by the administrator under the 
2006 Stock Incentive Plan.  If the administrator under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan permits a participant to exercise 
an award following the termination of continuous service for a specified period, the award terminates to the extent 
not exercised on the last day of the specified period or the last day of the original term of the award, whichever 
occurs  first.    In  the  event  an  eligible  participant's  service  has  been  terminated  for  "cause",  he  or  she  shall 
immediately forfeit all rights to any of the awards outstanding.
The foregoing summary of the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference

2009 Stock Incentive Plan

Incentive Plan in the amount of 5,000,000 shares.
Effective May 25, 2010, our Board of Directors amended the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan to increase the number of

5,000,000 to 7,000,000.
The  purpose  of  the  2009  Stock  Incentive  Plan  is  to  enhance  our  long-term  stockholder  value  by  offering 
opportunities to our directors, officers, employees and eligible consultants to acquire and maintain stock ownership 
in order to give these persons the opportunity to participate in our growth and success, and to encourage them to 
remain in our service.
The 2009 Stock Incentive Plan is to be administered by our Board of Directors or a committee appointed by and

persons to be granted awards under the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan; (ii) the number of shares or amount of other 
awards to be granted; and (iii) the terms and conditions of the awards granted.  The Company may issue shares, 
options, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock rights, dividend equivalent rights, among others, under the 2009 
Stock Incentive Plan.  An aggregate of 7,000,000 of our shares may be issued pursuant to the grant of awards under

termination of an Eligible Participant’s continuous service only to the extent provided by the administrator under the 
2009 Stock Incentive Plan.  If the administrator under the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan permits an Eligible Participant 
to exercise an award following the termination of continuous service for a specified period, the award terminates to 
the extent not exercised on the last day of the specified period or the last day of the original term of the award, 
whichever occurs first.  In the event an Eligible Participant’s service has been terminated for “cause,” he or she shall 
immediately forfeit all rights to any of the awards outstanding.

On June 29, 2007, our board of directors approved the change of our fiscal year end from December 31 to July 31.  
On October 29, 2007, we filed a Transition Report on Form 10-KSB for the fiscal period ended July 31, 2007, as 
subsequently amended, with the SEC and commenced a new reporting period.
We  were  incorporated  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of  Nevada  on  May  16,  2003.    During  2004,  we  changed  our 
business operations focus from precious metals exploration in the State of Nevada to the exploration for economic 
reserves of uranium throughout the United States.  Since then, we have been acquiring mineral property interests in 
the United States.  In addition, we restated our audited financial statements for the fiscal period ended July 31, 2007 
to include the re-evaluation of impairment analysis performed at each respective period.  Accordingly, the financial 
information presented below may not be comparable from period to period.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The  following  discussion  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  (i)  our  audited  financial  statements  as  at  the  years 
ended July 31, 2010 and 2009, and for each of the years in the three year period ended July 31, 2010 and the related 
notes; and (ii) the section of this annual report entitled "Business" that appear elsewhere in this annual report.  The 
following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs.  Our actual 
results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements.  Factors that could cause or 
contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual
3962727.3
57
report,  particularly  in  the  section  entitled  "Risk  Factors".    Our  financial  statements  are  stated  in  United  States 
Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
Plan of Operations
Our  plan  of  operations  for  the  next  twelve  months  is  to  continue  with  the  exploration  and  development  of  our 
mineral properties.  Our planned geological exploration programs are described in detail in this annual report under 
"Business".  As well, the reclamation activities at Mt. Lucas are expected to be complete within the next twelve 
months.  The minor reclamation activities at Hobson, which will be placed in a disposal well, are also expected to be 
complete within fiscal 2011.  Mining activities at our Palangana site are expected to commence by the end of 2010 
with the ore being transported to and processed at our Hobson processing facility.
Our planned exploration expenditures for the next twelve months on our mineral properties, together with amounts 
due to maintain our interest in these claims, are summarized as follows:

*An  amount  of  approximately  $250,000  has  been  budgeted  for  additional  surveys  and  studies  as  may  be  required  by  the 
respective approval authorities.  At this time it has not been determined whether or not the Company will be required to draw 
upon the budgeted funds.

$5,491,039
In addition, we will incur general and administrative expenses throughout the year that we anticipate will consist 
primarily of professional fees for the audit and legal work relating to our regulatory filings throughout the year, as 
well as transfer agent fees, management fees, investor relations and general office expenses.
We had cash in the amount of $21,067,662 and a working capital surplus in the amount of $16,243,838 as of July 
31, 2010.  We anticipate that existing cash resources will be sufficient to carry out our exploration programs and 
current plan of operations for the next twelve months.  In the event we require additional financing to pursue our 
plan of operations for the next 12 months, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms 
favorable to us or at all.
Beyond the next twelve months, we may be required to obtain additional financing in order to continue our plan of 
operations  as  we  may  not  earn  any  positive  cash  flow  revenues  in  the  foreseeable  future.    We  believe  that  debt 
financing will not be an alternative for funding additional phases of exploration as we do not wish to encumber any 
of our tangible assets to secure any debt financing.  We anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of 
equity financing from the sale of our common stock.  We do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide 
investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to 
fund our exploration programs.  In the absence of such financing, we will not be able to continue exploration of our 
mineral claims.  Even if we are successful in obtaining equity financing to fund our exploration programs, there is 
no assurance that we will obtain the funding necessary to pursue any advanced exploration of our mineral claims 
following the completion of preliminary exploration.  If we do not continue to obtain additional financing, we may 
be forced to abandon our properties and our plan of operations.
We may consider entering into a joint venture arrangement to provide the required funding to pursue drilling and 
advanced exploration of our mineral claims.  Even if we determined to pursue a joint venture partner, there is no 
assurance that any third party would enter into a joint venture agreement with us in order to fund exploration of our 
mineral claims.  If we entered into a joint venture arrangement, we would likely have to assign a percentage of our 
interest in our mineral claims to the joint venture partner.
3962727.3
58
Our  exploration  plans  will  be  continually  evaluated  and  modified  as  exploration  results  become  available.  
Modifications  to  our  plans  will  be  based  on  many  factors,  including:  results  of  exploration,  assessment  of  data, 
weather  conditions,  exploration  costs,  the  price  of  uranium  and  available  capital.    Further,  the  extent  of  our 
exploration programs that we undertake will be dependent upon the amount of financing available to us.

We have been funding our initial operations by way of private placements.  We expect we will require additional 
capital to meet our long term operating requirements.  We expect to raise additional capital primarily through the 
sale of equity securities.
Year Ended July 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended July 31, 2009 
 
We are an exploration stage company and net production revenues during the years ended July 31, 2010 and 2009 
were $Nil.  Our net loss for the year ended July 31, 2010 was $14,478,669 compared to a net loss of $13,503,576 
during the year ended July 31, 2009.
Operating expenses incurred during the year ended July 31, 2010 increased to $22,431,147 from $12,948,327 over 
the year ended July 31, 2009. The increase is primarily due to the expansion of our operations as market conditions 
improved and the acquisition of the STMV Joint Venture which resulted in an additional $5,752,588 in operating 
expenses  during  the  year  ended  July  31,  2010  compared  to  Nil  for  the  prior  year.  Significant  expenditures  and 
changes are outlined as follows:
•
Consulting  fees  increased  to  $635,243  during  the  year  ended  July  31,  2010  from  $220,332  during  the  year 
ended July 31, 2009. Consultants are engaged for administrative functions, investor relations and technical and 
geological work relating to permitting, exploration and development of our near-term production projects.  All 
areas of the aforementioned experienced increased activity due to improved market conditions.
•  Depreciation,  amortization  and  accretion  increased  to  $794,504  during  the  year  ended  July  31,  20010  from 
$526,251  during  the  year  ended  July  31,  2009  due  primarily  to  additional  charges  on  assets  relating  to  the 
STMV acquisition including accretion of asset retirement obligations.
3962727.3
59
•  General and administrative costs increased to $5,087,238 during the year ended July 31, 2010 from $3,768,042 
during the year ended July 31, 2009. The increases are due to the expansion of our operations as a result of the 
acquisition of the STMV Joint Venture, specifically with respect to investor relations, office administration, 
travel and insurance.
•
•
Impairment  loss  on  mineral  properties  decreased  to  $43,600  during  the  year  ended  July  31,  2010  from 
$1,223,038 during the year ended July 31, 2009.  During the year, the Company did not renew three property 
leases due to results received during our exploration of these properties.
Interest and finance charges increased to $517,273 during the year ended July 31, 20010 from $Nil during the 
year ended July 31, 2009.  During the year ended July 31, 2010, we realized an expense of the fair value on the 
issuance of warrants as penalties pursuant to private placement agreements.
•  Management fees increased to $1,251,853 during the year ended July 31, 2010 from $744,684 during the year 
ended July 31, 2009. The increase resulted from the reinstatement of director’s and officer’s fees which were 
curtailed during fiscal 2009 and management bonuses.
•  Mineral property expenditures increased to $6,438,714 during the year ended July 31, 2010 from $4,046,265 
during  the  year  ended  July  31,  2009  due  to  the  commencement  of  exploration  and  development  of  the 
Palangana  project  which  includes  consultants  relating  to  technical  and  geological  work  in  addition  to 
professional fees for ongoing permitting of the Goliad project.
•
•
Professional fees nominally decreased to $633,332 during the year ended July 31, 2010 from $680,111 during 
the year ended July 31, 2009, which reflects a general decrease in the reliance of external professionals.  The 
purpose  of  the  external  professionals  relates  to  legal  fees,  audit  fees,  tax  preparation  fees  and  SOX 
documentation fees.
Stock  based  compensation  increased  to  $7,029,390  during  the  year  ended  July  31,  2010  from  $1,739,604 
during the year ended July 31, 2009.  The current and prior year expense consists of the fair value of option 
grants earned during the period to consultants, management and employees.
Interest and other income decreased to $54,472 during the year ended July 31, 2010 from $64,758 during the year 
ended July 31, 2009 due to lower investment rates during the current period. 
We incurred $636,075 in transaction costs relating to the STMV Acquisition during the year ended July 31, 2010 
compared to $Nil during the same period ended July 31, 2009. On December 18, 2009, we completed the acquisition 
of a 100% ownership interest in STMV. 
Our  loss  before  continuing  operations  during  the  year  ended  July  31,  2010  was  $23,012,750  or  $0.39  per  share 
compared to $12,883,569 or $0.27 per share during the same period ended July 31, 2009. 
We  realized  an  $8,534,081  gain  on  the  sale  of  assets  during  the  year  ended  July  31,  2010,  which  is  reported  as 
income  from  discontinued  operations.    During  the  year  ended  July  31,  2009,  we  incurred  $620,007  in  mineral 
property  expenditures  relating  to  the  assets  sold  during  the  current  period,  which  is  reported  as  loss  from 
discontinued  operations.    Effective  March  30,  2010,  Neutron  exercised  its  option  to  acquire  our  49%  interest  in 
Cibola Resources, LLC, and on April 12, 2010, completed the acquisition for a cash payment of $11,000,000.  Our 
income  from  discontinued  operations  during  the  year  ended  July  31,  2010  was  $8,534,081  or  $0.14  per  share 
compared to a loss of $620,007 or $0.01 per share during the same period ended July 31, 2009. 
Our net loss during the year ended July 31, 2010 was $14,478,669 or $0.39 per share compared to a net loss of 
$13,503,576  or  $0.29  per  share  during  the  same  period  ended  July  31,  2009.    The  weighted  average  number  of 
shares outstanding was 59,017,166 for the year ended July 31, 2010 compared to 47,358,056 for the same period 
ended July 31, 2009.
3962727.3
60
Year Ended July 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended July 31, 2008
We are an exploration stage company and net production revenues during the years ended July 31, 2009 and 2008 
were $Nil.  Our net loss for the year ended July 31, 2009 was $13,503,576 compared to a net loss of $19,236,124 
during the year ended July 31, 2008.
Operating expenses incurred during the year ended July 31, 2009 decreased to $12,948,327 from $18,840,129 over 
the year ended July 31, 2008.  The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in some of our exploration activities, 
operations  and  personnel,  including  salary  reductions,  over  the  prior  period  as  we  implemented  a  cost  reduction 
program during difficult economic conditions.  Significant expenditures and changes are outlined as follows:
•
Consulting fees decreased to $220,332 during the year ended July 31, 2009 from $522,718 during the year 
ended July 31, 2008 due primarily to a reduction in the reliance on third party service providers as we reduced 
some of our operations during difficult economic conditions.
•  Depreciation  and  amortization  increased  to  $526,251  during  the  year  ended  July  31,  2009  from  $372,886 
during the year ended July 31, 2008 due to significant investments in property and equipment and databases 
during prior periods that were not subject to amortization throughout the comparable period.
•  General and administrative costs decreased to $3,768,042 during the year ended July 31, 2009 from $5,726,145 
during the year ended July 31, 2008 due to the general reduction in some of our operations and personnel, 
including salary reductions, in the current period as compared to the prior period.
•
•
Impairment  loss  on  mineral  properties  increased  to  $1,223,038  during  the  year  ended  July  31,  2009  from 
$247,830 during the year ended July 31, 2008.  During the year, we opted not to renew certain mineral claims 
and  leases  in  the  States  of  Arizona,  New  Mexico  and  Texas,  and  decided  to  terminate  the  Holley  Option.  
Accordingly, an impairment loss was recorded to reflect the changes in valuation.
Interest and finance charges decreased to $Nil during the year ended July 31, 2009 from $55,334 during the 
year ended July 31, 2008.  Interest and finance charges consist of the fair value of warrant issuances, resulting 
from delays in S-1 Registration Statements becoming effective during the prior period.
•  Management fees decreased to $744,684 during the year ended July 31, 2009 from $791,695 during the year 
ended July 31, 2008 due to a 20% reduction in executive compensation applicable to all officers and directors 
during a portion of the current period.
•  Mineral property expenditures decreased to $4,046,265 during the year ended July 31, 2009 from $6,574,898 
during the year ended July 31, 2008 due to the reduction in some of our exploration activities over the prior 
period during difficult economic conditions.
•
•
Professional fees decreased to $680,111 during the year ended July 31, 2009 from $739,853 during the year 
ended July 31, 2008 due primarily to variations in audit, review and counsel fees over the prior period based on 
the volume of business operations and development.
Stock  based  compensation  decreased  to  $1,739,604  during  the  year  ended  July  31,  2009  from  $3,808,770 
during the year ended July 31, 2008.  The current and prior year expense consists of the fair value of option 
grants earned during the period.  Additionally, the current period expense includes the incremental expense 
incurred from option grants that were repriced during the year.
Interest and other income decreased to $64,758 during the year ended July 31, 2009 from $227,715 during the year 
ended July 31, 2008 due to significantly lower investment rates during the current period.  A $47,548 gain on the 
sale of marketable securities was realized during the year ended July 31, 2008 from the sale of investments.  There 
were no investment related transactions during the current period.  A $14,370 loss on sale of assets was recorded 
during 2009 from a charge realized on the disposal of property and equipment.
3962727.3
61
Deferred tax expense decreased to $Nil during the year ended July 31, 2009 from $195,171 during the fiscal year 
ended July 31, 2008.  The deferred tax expense was calculated on the estimated unrealized gain on available-for-sale 
securities in prior fiscal periods which was reflected in other comprehensive income.
Our net loss during the year ended July 31, 2009 was $13,503,576 or ($0.29) per share, compared to a net loss of 
$19,236,124 or ($0.49) per share during the year ended July 31, 2008.  The weighted average number of shares 
outstanding was 47,358,056 for the year ended July 31, 2009 compared to 39,397,704 for the year ended July 31, 
2008.
Year Ended July 31, 2008 Compared to Seven Months Ended July 31, 2007
We are an exploration stage company and net production revenues during the year ended July 31, 2008 and seven 
months ended July 31, 2007 were $Nil.  Our net loss for the year ended July 31, 2008 was $19,236,124 compared to 
a net loss of $8,044,743 during the seven months ended July 31, 2007.
Operating expenses incurred during the year ended July 31, 2008 increased to $18,840,129 from $8,489,901 over the 
seven months ended July 31, 2007.  The increase is primarily due to the expansion of current operations and the 
corresponding  change  in  administration  and  exploration  costs  associated  with  the  increased  acquisition  and 
development of our uranium properties and related infrastructure.  Significant expenditures and changes are outlined 
as follows:
•
•
Consulting fees increased to $522,718 during the year ended July 31, 2008 from $253,026 during the seven 
months ended July 31, 2007 due primarily to the longer reporting period, and an increased reliance on third 
party service providers as we expand our operations.
Consulting fees - stock based decreased to $463,125 during the year ended July 31, 2008 from $704,058 during 
the  seven  months  ended  July  31,  2007.    The  current  and  prior  period  expense  consists  of  the  fair  value  of 
option and stock grants earned during the period.
•  Depreciation and amortization increased to $372,886 during the year ended July 31, 2008 from $84,140 during 
the  seven  months  ended  July  31,  2007  due  to  the  longer  reporting  period,  and  significant  investments  in 
property and equipment and databases during the current and prior periods.
•  General and administrative costs increased to $5,726,145 during the year ended July 31, 2008 from $2,246,054 
during the seven months ended July 31, 2007 due to the longer reporting period, and a general expansion of 
operations and personnel in the current period as compared to the prior period, and more significant marketing 
activities in the current period.
•
•
Impairment loss on mineral properties increased to $247,830 during the year ended July 31, 2008 from $51,390 
during the seven months ended July 31, 2007.  In August 2008 we opted not to renew certain mineral claims 
with  the  Bureau  of  Land  Management  in  the  States  of  New  Mexico  and  Wyoming.    Accordingly,  an 
impairment  loss  was  recorded  as  of  July  31,  2008  to  reflect  the  change  in  valuation  based  on  subsequent 
events.    In  the  prior  fiscal  period,  an  impairment  loss  was  recorded  on  the  Jebsen  AB  project  following 
unfavorable results from the exploration.
Interest and finance charges decreased to $55,334 during the year ended July 31, 2008 from $116,396 during 
the  seven  months  ended  July  31,  2007.    Interest  and  finance  charges  consist  of  the  fair  value  of  warrant 
issuances, resulting from delays in S-1 Registration Statements becoming effective.
•  Management fees increased to $791,695 during the year ended July 31, 2008 from $302,697 during the seven 
months  ended  July  31,  2007  due  primarily  to  the  longer  reporting  period,  and  increases  in  executive 
compensation over the prior year.

•  Management fees - stock based increased to $2,019,250 during the year ended July 31, 2008 from $1,774,500 
during the seven months ended July 31, 2007.  The current and prior period expense consists of the fair value 
of option grants earned during the period.
•  Mineral property expenditures increased to $6,574,898 during the year ended July 31, 2008 from $2,404,202 
during  the  seven  months  ended  July  31,  2007  due  to  the  longer  reporting  period,  and  the  expansion  of 
exploration activities over the prior period, primarily in the Goliad project.
•
Professional fees increased to $739,853 during the year ended July 31, 2008 from $317,225 during the seven 
months ended July 31, 2007 due primarily to the longer reporting period, and increases in audit and review 
costs in addition to increases in counsel fees associated with the growth in our operations.
•  Wages and benefits - stock based increased to $1,326,395 during the year ended July 31, 2008 from $236,213 
during the seven months ended July 31, 2007.  The current and prior year expense consists of the fair value of 
option grants earned during the period.
Interest  and other  income  decreased  to $169,812 during  the  year  ended  July  31,  2008  from  $319,824 during  the 
seven months ended July 31, 2007 due to higher cash balances maintained during the prior period.  A $47,548 gain 
on the sale of marketable securities was realized during the year ended July 31, 2008 from the sale of investments.  
There were no investment related transactions during the prior period.
Deferred  tax  expense  increased  to  $195,171  during  the  year  ended  July  31,  2008  from  a  deferred  tax  benefit  of 
$195,171 during the seven months ended July 31, 2007.  The deferred tax benefit was calculated on the estimated 
unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities in the prior fiscal period which was reflected in other comprehensive 
income.
Our net loss during the year ended July 31, 2008 was $19,236,124 or ($0.49) per share, compared to a net loss of 
$8,044,743 or ($0.22) per share during the seven months ended July 31, 2007.  The weighted average number of 
shares outstanding was 39,397,704 for the year ended July 31, 2008 compared to 36,389,384 for the seven months 
ended July 31, 2007.

$21,637,396 primarily from the sale of our common stock pursuant to private placements.
We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds 
and  further  issuances  of  securities.    Our  working  capital  requirements  are  expected  to  increase  in  line  with  the 
growth of our business.

Stock Options and Warrants 
As  at  July  31,  2010,  we  had  6,986,250  stock  options  and  5,231,882  share  purchase  warrants  outstanding.    The 
outstanding stock options have a weighted average exercise price of $1.41 per share and the outstanding warrants 
have a weighted average exercise price of $2.90 per share.  Accordingly, as at July 31, 2010, the outstanding options 
and warrants represented a total of 12,218,132 shares issuable for proceeds of approximately $25,023,000 if these 
options and warrants were exercised in full.  The exercise of these options and warrants is at the discretion of the 
holders and, accordingly, there is no assurance that any of these options or warrants will be exercised.
Plan of Operation and Funding
Our existing working capital is expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months.  We 
have  no  lines  of  credit  or  other  bank  financing  arrangements.    Generally,  we  have  financed  operations  to  date 
through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments.  In connection with our business plan, 
management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) uranium 
exploration  operating  activities;  (ii)  possible  future  reserve  definition;  (iii)  possible  future  mining  initiatives  on 
current and future properties; and (iv) possible future property acquisitions.  We intend to finance these expenses 
with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances.  We expect we will need to raise additional capital to meet 
long-term  operating  requirements.    Additional  issuances  of  equity  or  convertible  debt  securities  will  result  in 
dilution to our current shareholders.  Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to 
our common stock.  Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all.  If adequate funds 
are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new 
business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.
Going Concern
We commenced operations on May 16, 2003 and have not realized any significant revenues since inception.  As at 
July  31,  2010  we  have  working  capital  of  $16,243,838  and  an  accumulated  deficit  of  $68,382,133.    Although 
existing cash resources are currently expected to provide sufficient funds through the upcoming year, the capital 
expenditures  required  to  achieve  planned  principal  operations  may  be  substantial.    Our  continuation  as  a  going 
concern for a period of longer than the upcoming year is dependent upon our ability to obtain necessary financing.  
We are in the exploration stage of our mineral property development and to date have not yet established any proven 
mineral reserves on our existing properties.  Our continued operations and the recoverability of the carrying value of 
our assets are ultimately dependent upon our ability to achieve profitable operations.  To date, we have completed 
private placements and received funding through the exercise of stock options and share purchase warrants for net 
proceeds of $68,622,731 from the issuance of shares of our common stock.
Material Commitments
We are committed to pay our key executives a total of approximately $639,000 per year for management services.
The Company is currently leasing office premises in New Mexico, Texas and Vancouver, B.C., Canada with total 
monthly payments of $16,500.  All office lease agreements are on a month to month basis with the exception of the 
Corpus Christi office lease which expires in August 2012.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future 
effect  on  our  financial  condition,  changes  in  financial  condition,  revenues  or  expenses,  results  of  operations, 
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally 
accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with  US  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of 
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
We  regularly  evaluate  the  accounting  policies  and  estimates  that  we  use  to  prepare  our  financial  statements.    In 
general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, 
and  on  various  other  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  facts  and  circumstances.    Actual 
results could differ from those estimates made by management.
Mineral Property Costs
We are primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties.
Mineral  property  acquisition  costs  are  initially  capitalized  when  incurred.  At  the  end  of  each  fiscal  quarter,  the 
Company assesses the carrying costs for impairment under ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. If proven and 
probable  reserves  are  established  for  a  property  and  it  has  been  determined  that  a  mineral  property  can  be 
economically developed, costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the 
reserve.
Mineral  property  exploration  and  development  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  until  the  establishment  of 
economically viable reserves.
As of the date of this annual report, we have yet to establish proven or probable reserves on any of our mineral 
properties.
3962727.3
66
Databases
Costs  related  to  internally  developed  databases  are  expensed  as  incurred.    Costs  of  acquired  mineral  property 
databases are capitalized upon acquisition.  Mineral property data bases are tested for impairment whenever events 
or changes indicate the carrying value amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is recognized if it is 
determined  that  the  carrying  amount  is  not  recoverable  and  exceeds  fair  value.    Mineral  property  databases  are 
amortized over five years using the straight-line method, which is the period over which management believes the 
asset will contribute to the Company’s cash flows.
Restoration and Remediation Costs (Asset Retirement Obligations)
Various  federal  and  state  mining  laws  and  regulations  require  us  to  reclaim  the  surface  areas  and  restore 
underground water quality for its mine projects to the pre-existing mine area average quality after the completion of 
mining.
Future  reclamation  and  remediation  costs,  which  include  production  equipment  removal  and  environmental 
remediation, are accrued based on management's best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be 
incurred at each project.  Such estimates would be determined by our engineering studies calculating the cost of 
future  of  surface  and  groundwater  activities,  current  regulations,  actual  expenses  incurred,  and  technology  and 
industry standards.
In  accordance  with  ASC  410,  Asset  Retirement  and  Environmental  Obligations,  we  capitalize  the  measured  fair 
value of asset retirement obligations to mineral rights and properties.  The asset retirement obligation is accreted to 
an undiscounted value until the time at which it they are expected to be settled.  Actual retirement costs will be 
recorded  against  the  asset  retirement  obligations  when  incurred.    Any  difference  between  the  recorded  asset 
retirement obligations and the actual retirement costs incurred will be recorded as a gain or loss in the period of 
settlement. 
On  a  quarterly  basis  we  update  cost  estimates,  and  other  assumptions  used  in  the  valuation  of  asset  retirement 
obligations  at  each  of  our  mineral  properties  to  reflect  new  events,  changes  in  circumstances  and  any  new 
information  that  is  available.    Changes  in  these  costs  have  a  corresponding  impact  on  the  asset  retirement 
obligations.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited 
to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal 
factors;  accumulation  of  costs  significantly  in  excess  of  the  amount  originally  expected  for  the  acquisition  or 
construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast 
of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than 
not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life.  Recoverability of these assets is 
measured  by  comparison  of  its  carrying  amount  to  future  undiscounted  cash  flows  the  assets  are  expected  to 
generate.  An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.
Financial Instruments
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, other current monetary assets, accounts payable and 
accrued liabilities were estimated to approximate their carrying values due to the immediate or short-term maturity 
of  these  financial  instruments.    Our  operations  and  financing  activities  are  conducted  primarily  in  United  States 
dollars, and as a result we are not subject to significant exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency 
rates.  Management has determined that we are not exposed to significant credit risk.
3962727.3
67
Stock-Based Compensation
We  follow  ASC  718,  Compensation  –  Stock  Compensation,  which  addresses  the  accounting  for  stock-based 
payment  transactions,  requiring  such  transactions  to  be  accounted  for  using  the  fair  value  method.    We  use  the 
Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the grant date fair-value of stock-based awards under ASC 718.  
The  fair  value  is  recorded  in  income  depending  on  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  award  and  the  nature  of  the 
relationship of the recipient of the award to us.  We record the grant date fair value in income in line with the period 
over which it was earned.  For employees and management this is typically considered to be the vesting period of 
the award.  For consultants the fair value of the award is recorded in income over the term of the service period, and 
unvested  amounts  are  revalued  at  each  reporting  period  over  the  service  period.    We  estimate  the  expected 
forfeitures and update the valuation accordingly.
Recently Adopted Accounting Policies 
Effective August 1, 2009, we adopted ASC 805, Business Combinations.  Under ASC 805, an acquiring entity will 
be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair 
value with limited exceptions.  ASC 805 changes the accounting treatment and disclosure for certain specific items 
in a business combination.  Under the new guidance, business acquisitions are accounted for under the “acquisition 
method”,  compared  to  the  “purchase  method”  mandated  previously.    ASC  805  applies  prospectively  to  business 
combinations  for  which  the  acquisition  date  is  on  or  after  the  beginning  of  the  first  annual  reporting  period 
beginning  on  or  after  December  15,  2008.    The  more  significant  changes  to  our  accounting  for  business 
combinations  that  will  result  from  applying  the  acquisition  method  include:  (i)  the  definition  of  a  business  is 
broadened  to  include  some  development  stage  entities,  and  therefore  more  acquisitions  may  be  accounted  for  as 
business  combinations  rather  than  asset  acquisitions;  (ii)  the  measurement  date  for  equity  interests  issued  by  the 
acquirer is the acquisition date instead of a few days before and after terms are agreed to and announced which may 
significantly change the amount recorded for the acquired business if share prices differ from the agreement and 
announcement date to the acquisition date; (iii) all future adjustments to income tax estimates will be recorded to 
income  tax  expense,  whereas  under  the  previous  requirements,  certain  changes  in  income  tax  estimates  were 
recorded to goodwill; (iv) acquisition related costs of the acquirer, including investment banking fees, legal fees, 
accounting fees, valuation fees and other professional or consulting fees will be expensed as incurred, whereas under 
the previous guidance these costs were capitalized as part of the business combination; (v) the assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed as part of a business combination, whether full, partial or step acquisition, result in all assets and 
liabilities recorded at 100% of fair value, whereas under the previous requirements only the controlling interest’s 
portion is recorded at fair value; (vi) recognition of a bargain purchase gain when the fair value of the identifiable 
assets exceeds the purchase price, whereas under the previous guidance, the net book value of the identifiable assets 
would have been adjusted downward; and (vii) the non-controlling interest will be recorded at its share of fair value 
of net assets acquired, including its share of goodwill, whereas under previous guidance the non-controlling interest 
is recorded at its share of the carrying value of net assets acquired with no goodwill being allocated.  The adoption 
of ASC 805 resulted in certain differences to the recording of the purchase equation compared to how it would have 
been recorded under previous guidance.  Transaction costs of $636,075 have been expensed rather than capitalized 
into  the  purchase  equation.    In  addition,  the  assessment  of  the  measurement  date  may  have  been  different  and 
therefore have caused a different valuation of the consideration. 
Effective August 1, 2009, we adopted ASC 810, Consolidation.  ASC 810 establishes new accounting and reporting 
standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.  ASC 810 is 
effective  for  fiscal  years  beginning  on  or  after  December  15,  2008.    The  adoption  of  ASC  810  did  not  have  a 
material impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
Effective August 1, 2009, we adopted ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.  ASC 815 requires qualitative disclosures 
about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and 
losses on derivative instruments, disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements, 
disclosures  by  sellers  of  credit  derivatives,  including  credit  derivatives  embedded  in  a  hybrid  instrument,  and 
additional  disclosure  about  the  current  status  of  the  payment/performance  risk of  a guarantee.    This  statement  is 
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008.  The adoption of ASC 
815 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
3962727.3

Effective August 1, 2009, we adopted ASC 350-30, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, General Intangibles Other 
than Goodwill (formerly FAS 142-3).  ASC 350-30 amends the factors that should be considered in developing the 
renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under ASC 350, 
Intangibles – Goodwill and Other.  ASC 350-30 also requires expanded disclosure regarding the determination of 
intangible asset useful lives.  ASC 350-30 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.  Earlier 
adoption was not permitted.  The adoption of ASC 350-30 did not a material impact on the consolidated financial 
position, results of operations or cash flows. 
Effective August 1, 2009, we adopted ASC 470-20, Debt, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (formerly APB 
Opinion  No.  14-1).    ASC  470-20  requires  cash  settled  convertible  debt  to  be  separated  into  debt  and  equity 
components  at  issuance  and  a  value  to  be  assigned  to  each.    The  value  assigned  to  the  debt  component  is  the 
estimated  fair  value,  as  of  the  issuance  date,  of  a  similar  bond  without  the  conversion  feature.    The  difference 
between the bond cash proceeds and this estimated fair value is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest 
expense over the life of the bond.  ASC 470-20 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.  The 
adoption of ASC 470-20 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations 
or cash flows. 
Effective August 1, 2009, we adopted ASC 260-10, Earnings per Share, General (formerly EITF 03-6-1).  ASC 
260-10 addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior 
to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the 
two-class  method  as  described  in  ASC  260,  Earnings  per  Share.    Under  the  guidance  in  ASC  260-10,  unvested 
share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid 
or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the 
two-class method.  ASC 260-10 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods 
within those fiscal years.  All prior-period earnings per share amounts presented are adjusted retrospectively.  The 
adoption of ASC 260-10 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations 
or cash flows. 
Effective August  1,  2009,  we  adopted  ASC  815-40, Derivatives  and Hedging,  Contracts  in  Entity’s  Own  Equity 
(formerly  EITF  07-5).    ASC  815-40  provides  guidance  for  determining  whether  an  equity-linked  financial 
instrument  (or  embedded  feature)  is  indexed  to  an  entity’s  own  stock.    ASC  815-40  applies  to  any  freestanding 
financial instrument or embedded feature that has all of the characteristics of a derivative or freestanding instrument 
that is potentially settled in an entity’s own stock (with the exception of share-based payment awards within the 
scope  of  ASC  718).    To  meet  the  definition  of  “indexed  to  own  stock,”  an  instrument’s  contingent  exercise 
provisions must not be based on (a) an observable market, other than the market for the issuer’s stock (if applicable), 
or  (b)  an  observable  index,  other  than  an  index  calculated  or  measured  solely  by  reference  to  the  issuer’s  own 
operations, and the variables that could affect the settlement amount must be inputs to the fair value of a “fixed-for-
fixed” forward or option on equity shares.  ASC 815-40 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 
2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The adoption of ASC 815-40 did not have a material impact on 
the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
Effective  August  1,  2009,  we  adopted  ASC  855,  Subsequent  Events.    ASC  855  establishes  general  standards  of 
accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are 
issued or are available to be issued.  It requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated 
subsequent events and the basis for that date.  ASC 855 is effective for interim financial periods ending after June 
15, 2009.  The adoption of ASC 855 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-09, which amends ASC 855 to remove the requirement for an SEC 
filer to disclose a date in both issued and revised financial statements.  Revised financial statements include financial 
statements  revised  as  a  result  of  either  correction  of  an  error  or  retrospective  application  of  GAAP.    All  of  the 
amendments in ASU 2010-09 are effective upon issuance of the final ASU, except for the use of the issued date for 
conduit debt obligors.  That amendment is effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2010.  The 
adoption of ASU 2010-09 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
On  January  21,  2010,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2010-06,  which  amends  ASC  820  to  add  new  requirements  for 
disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, 
and settlements relating to Level 3 measurements.  The ASU also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the 
level  of  disaggregation  and  about  inputs  and  valuation  techniques  used  to  measure  fair  value.    Further  the  ASU 
amends guidance on employers’ disclosures about post-retirement benefit plan assets under ASC 715 to require that 
disclosures be provided by classes of assets instead of by major categories of assets.  The ASU is effective for the 
first reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to 
provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which will be effective 
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company 
does not expect the adoption of ASU 2009-06 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In June 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-17 which amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the 
issuance of FASB Statement No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R).  The amendments in this 
Accounting Standards Update replace the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which 
reporting entity, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on 
identifying  which  reporting  entity  has  the  power  to  direct  the  activities  of  a  variable  interest  entity  that  most 
significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and (1) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or (2) the 
right  to  receive  benefits  from  the  entity.    An  approach  that  is  expected  to  be  primarily  qualitative  will  be  more 
effective for identifying which reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity.  The 
amendments  in  this  Update  also  require  additional  disclosures  about  a  reporting  entity’s  involvement  in  variable 
interest entities, which will enhance the information provided to users of financial statements.  The standard will be 
effective for the years beginning after November 19, 2009 and for interim periods within those fiscal years.  The 
Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2009-17 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial 
statements.
In September 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.  
This guidance addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate consideration to one or more 
units of accounting.  Specifically, the guidance requires that consideration be allocated among multiple deliverables 
based on relative selling prices.  The guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy of (1) vendor-specific objective 
evidence,  (2)  third-party  evidence  and  (3)  estimated  selling  price.    This  guidance  is  effective  for  annual  periods 
beginning after June 15, 2010 but may be early adopted as of the beginning of an annual period.  The Company does 
not expect that this guidance will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT 
MARKET RISK
We  are  subject  to  risks  related  to  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations.    However,  they  have  not  had  a 
material impact on our results of operations to date.
Our functional currency is the United States dollar.  However, a significant portion of our business is transacted in 
other currencies (the Canadian dollar).  As a result, we are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency 
exchange rates.  We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge 
our foreign currency exposure to manage our foreign currency fluctuation risk.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Uranium Energy Corp.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Uranium Energy Corp. as of July 31, 2010 and 2009, and 
the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2010, July 31, 2009 and 
July 31, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits 
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial 
position of Uranium Energy Corp. as at July 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the 
years ended July 31, 2010, July 31, 2009 and July 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the guidance issued in Financial 
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Statement No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" (codified in FASB Accounting 
Standards Codification Topic 805, "Business Combinations") on August 1, 2009.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), 
the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report 
dated October 12, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Uranium Energy Corp.
We have audited Uranium Energy Corp.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2010, based on criteria 
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Uranium Energy Corp.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective 
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective 
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an 
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other 
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our 
opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Uranium Energy Corp. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting 
as of July 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), 
the consolidated balance sheets of Uranium Energy Corp. as of July 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related statements of 
operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2010, July 31, 2009 and July 31, 2008 and our 
report dated October 12, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Columbia, Canada on December 21, 2007.  On December 18, 2009, the Company purchased all of the outstanding securities 
of  URN  Texas  GP,  LLC  and  URN  South  Texas  Project,  Ltd.,  the  99%  joint  venture  partner  of  the  South  Texas  Mining 
Venture, L.L.P., a Texas limited liability partnership in the exploration stage of its mineral property development which has 
not established any proven mineral reserves on its existing properties.  Additionally, on December 18, 2009 the Company 
contemporaneously acquired certain assets and liabilities from a third party including the remaining 1% interest in STMV. 
Since November 1, 2004, the Company has acquired mineral leases or entered into joint venture agreements, directly or by 
way  of  option,  for  the  purposes  of  exploring  for  economic  deposits  of  uranium  in  the  States  of  Arizona,  Colorado,  New 
Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming.  As at July 31, 2010, the Company has interests in approximately 43,960 net acres of 
mineral properties which have been purchased, staked or leased. 
The Company commenced operations on May 16, 2003 and has not realized any significant revenues since inception.  As at 
July  31,  2010,  the  Company  has  working  capital  of  $16,243,838  and  an  accumulated  deficit  of  $68,382,133.    Although 
existing cash resources are currently expected to provide sufficient funds through the upcoming year, the capital expenditures 
required to achieve planned principal operations may be substantial.  The continuation of the Company as a going concern for 
a period of longer than the upcoming year is dependent upon the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to 
continue operations.  The Company is in the exploration stage of its mineral property development and to date has not yet 
established  any  proven  mineral  reserves  on  its  existing  properties.    The  continued  operations  of  the  Company  and  the 
recoverability  of  the  carrying  value  of  its  assets  are  ultimately  dependent  upon  the  ability  of  the  Company  to  achieve 
profitable operations.  To date, the Company has completed private placements and received funding through the exercise of 
stock options and share purchase warrants for net proceeds of $68,622,731 from the issuance of shares of the Company’s 
common stock. 
 
NOTE 2: 
 
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
These consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Uranium Energy Corp. and its wholly-owned 
subsidiaries, UEC Resources Ltd., URN Texas GP, LLC, URN South Texas Project, Ltd. and South Texas Mining Venture, 
L.L.P. (“STMV”).  All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. 
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance 
to be cash equivalents. 
 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported.  By their nature, these estimates are subject to 
measurement uncertainty and the effect on the financial statements of changes in such estimates in future periods could be 
significant.    Significant  areas  requiring  management's  estimates  and  assumptions  are  determining  the  fair  value  of 
transactions  involving  common  stock,  valuation  and  impairment  losses  on  mineral  property  interests,  valuation  of  stock-
based  compensation,  valuation  of  available-for-sale  securities  and  valuation  of  asset  retirement  obligations.    Other  areas 
requiring estimates include allocations of expenditures to mineral property interests, depreciation of property and equipment, 
and amortization of databases.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

JULY 31, 2010
Fair Value Measurements 
In September 2006, the FASB issued ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.  The objective of ASC 820 is to 
increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and to expand disclosures about fair value measurements.  
ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, 
and  expands  disclosures  about  fair  value  measurements.    ASC  820  applies  under  other  accounting  pronouncements  that 
require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. 
 
Mineral Property Costs 
The Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. 
 
Mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized as tangible assets when purchased.  The Company assesses the 
carrying  costs  for  impairment  when  indicators  of  impairment  exist.  If  proven  and  probable  reserves  are  established  for  a 
property and it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed, costs will be amortized using the 
units-of-production method over the estimated life of the reserve. 
 
Mineral property exploration and development costs are expensed as incurred until the establishment of economically viable 
reserves. 
 
As  of  the  date  of  these  financial  statements,  the  Company  has  yet  to  establish  proven  or  probable  reserves  on  any  of  its 
mineral properties. 
 
Databases 
Costs related to internally developed databases are expensed as incurred.  Costs of acquired mineral property databases are 
capitalized upon acquisition.  Mineral property databases are tested for impairment whenever events or changes indicate the 
carrying value amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss is recognized if it is determined that the carrying amount 
is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.  Mineral property databases are amortized over five years using the straight-line 
method,  which  is  the  period  over  which  management  believes  the  asset  will  contribute  to  the  Company’s  cash  flows. 
Databases have been reclassified within Mineral Rights and Properties on the balance sheet. 
 
Restoration and Remediation Costs (Asset Retirement Obligations) 
Various  federal  and  state  mining  laws  and  regulations  require  the  Company  to  reclaim  the  surface  areas  and  restore 
underground water quality for its mine projects to the pre-existing mine area average quality after the completion of mining.   
 
Future reclamation and remediation costs, which include production equipment removal and environmental remediation, are 
accrued based on management's best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred at each project.  
Such estimates are determined by the Company's engineering studies calculating the cost of future surface and groundwater 
activities, current regulations, actual expenses incurred, and technology and industry standards. 
 
In accordance with ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, the Company capitalizes the measured fair 
value of asset retirement obligations to mineral rights and properties.  The asset retirement obligations are accreted to an 
undiscounted value until the time at which they are expected to be settled.  Actual retirement costs are recorded against the 
asset retirement obligations when incurred.  Any difference between the recorded asset retirement obligations and the actual 
retirement costs incurred will be recorded as a gain or loss in the period of settlement 
On a quarterly basis the Company updates cost estimates, and other assumptions used in the valuation of asset retirement 
obligations at each of its mineral properties to reflect new events, changes in circumstances and any new information that is 
available.  Changes in these costs have a corresponding impact on the asset retirement obligations.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of 
an asset may  not be recoverable.  Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant 
decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation 
of  costs  significantly  in  excess  of  the  amount  originally  expected  for  the  acquisition  or  construction  of  the  asset;  current 
period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the 
use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the 
end of its estimated useful life.  Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future 
undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate.  An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is 
not recoverable and exceeds fair value. 
 
Financial Instruments 
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, other current monetary assets, accounts payable and accrued 
liabilities were estimated to approximate their carrying values due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial 
instruments.  The Company's operations and financing activities are conducted primarily in United States dollars, and as a 
result  the  Company  is  not  subject  to  significant  exposure  to  market  risks  from  changes  in  foreign  currency  rates.  
Management has determined that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk. 
 
Earnings (Loss) per Common Share 
Basic earnings (loss) per share includes no potential dilution and is computed by dividing the earnings (loss) attributable to 
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted earnings (loss) 
per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings (loss) of the Company.  The common 
shares  potentially  issuable  on  conversion  of  outstanding  convertible  debentures  and  exercise  of  stock  options  were  not 
included in the calculation of weighted average number of shares outstanding because the effect is anti-dilutive. 
 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The  functional  currency  of  the  Company,  including  its  subsidiaries,  is  the  United  States  dollar.    UEC  Resources  Ltd. 
maintains its accounting records in its local currency (Canadian dollar).  In accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency 
Matters,  the  financial  statements  of  the  Company's  subsidiary  is  translated  into  United  States  dollars  using  period  end 
exchange rates as to monetary assets and liabilities and average exchange rates as to revenues and expenses.  Non-monetary 
assets are translated at their historical exchange rates.  Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange translations and 
foreign  currency  exchange  gains  and  losses  on  transactions  occurring  in  a  currency  other  than  the  Company's  functional 
currency are included in the determination of net income in the period. 
 
Income Taxes 
The  Company  follows  the  liability  method  of  accounting  for  income  taxes.    Under  this  method,  deferred  tax  assets  and 
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying 
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured 
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be 
recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the 
period that includes the date of enactment.  The Company recognizes deferred taxes on unrealized gains directly within other 
comprehensive  income,  and  concurrently  releases  part  of  the  valuation  allowance  resulting  in  nil  impact  within  other 
comprehensive income or on the balance sheet.  As at July 31, 2010, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards; 
however, due to the uncertainty of realization, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance for the potential deferred 
tax assets resulting from these losses carry forwards.
3962727.3

Stock-Based Compensation 
The  Company  follows  ASC  718,  Compensation  –  Stock  Compensation,  which  addresses  the  accounting  for  stock-based 
payment  transactions, requiring  such  transactions  to be  accounted for using  the  fair value  method.   Awards  of  shares  for 
property or services are recorded at the more readily measurable of the fair value of the stock and the fair value of the service.  
The  Company  uses  the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model  to  determine  the  grant  date  fair-value  of  stock-based  awards 
under ASC 718.  The fair value is recorded in income depending on the terms and conditions of the award, and the nature of 
the relationship of the recipient of the award to the Company.  The Company records the grant date fair value in income in 
line with the period over which it was earned.  For employees and management this is typically considered to be the vesting 
period of the award.  For consultants the fair value of the award is recorded in income over the term of the service period, and 
unvested  amounts  are  revalued  at  each  reporting  period  over  the  service  period.    The  Company  estimates  the  expected 
forfeitures and updates the valuation accordingly. 
 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives 
at the following rates:
Computer equipment 
Exploration equipment 
Furniture and fixtures 
Leasehold improvements 
Vehicles
3 years 
5 years 
5 years 
Term of lease

(An Exploration Stage Company)
The  Hobson  uranium  processing  facility  acquired  pursuant  to  the  STMV  Acquisition  is  being  prepared  for  use  with  the 
Company’s Goliad and Palangana projects, and therefore not currently subject to amortization (refer to Note 4). 
 
Recently Adopted Accounting Policies 
Effective August 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC 805, Business Combinations (formerly SFAS No. 141R, “Business 
Combinations”).    Under ASC  805,  an  acquiring  entity  will  be  required  to recognize  all  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities 
assumed  in  a  transaction  at  the  acquisition-date  fair  value  with  limited  exceptions.    ASC  805  changes  the  accounting 
treatment and disclosure for certain specific items in a business combination.  Under the new guidance, business acquisitions 
are  accounted  for  under  the  “acquisition  method”,  compared  to  the  “purchase  method”  mandated  previously.    ASC  805 
applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual 
reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.  The more significant changes to the Company’s accounting for 
business  combinations  that  will  result  from  applying  the  acquisition  method  include:  (i)  the  definition  of  a  business  is 
broadened to include some development stage entities, and therefore more acquisitions may be accounted for as business 
combinations  rather  than  asset  acquisitions;  (ii)  the  measurement  date  for  equity  interests  issued  by  the  acquirer  is  the 
acquisition date instead of a few days before and after terms are agreed to and announced which may significantly change the 
amount recorded for the acquired business if share prices differ from the agreement and announcement date to the acquisition 
date; (iii) all future adjustments to income tax estimates will be recorded to income tax expense, whereas under the previous 
requirements,  certain  changes  in  income  tax  estimates  were  recorded  to  goodwill;  (iv)  acquisition  related  costs  of  the 
acquirer, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, valuation fees and other professional or consulting 
fees will be expensed as incurred, whereas under the previous guidance these costs were capitalized as part of the business 
combination; (v) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of a business combination, whether full, partial or step 
acquisition, result in all assets and liabilities recorded at 100% of fair value, whereas under the previous requirements only 
the controlling interest’s portion is recorded at fair value; (vi) recognition of a bargain purchase gain when the fair value of 
the identifiable assets exceeds the purchase price, whereas under the previous guidance, the net book value of the identifiable 
assets would have been adjusted downward; and (vii) the non-controlling interest will be recorded at its share of fair value of 
net assets acquired, including its share of goodwill, whereas under previous guidance the non-controlling interest is recorded 
at its share of the carrying value of net assets acquired with no goodwill being allocated.  The adoption of ASC 805 resulted 
in certain differences to the recording of the purchase equation compared to how it would have been recorded under previous 
guidance.  Transaction costs of $636,075 have been expensed rather than capitalized into the purchase equation.  In addition, 
the  assessment  of  the  measurement  date  may  have  been  different  and  therefore  have  caused  a  different  valuation  of  the 
consideration.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JULY 31, 2010
Effective  August  1,  2009,  the  Company  adopted  ASC  810,  Consolidation  (formerly  SFAS  No.  160,  “Non-controlling 
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – An Amendment of ARB No. 51”).  ASC 810 establishes new accounting and 
reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.  The adoption 
of ASC 810 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
Effective August 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures 
about  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities”).    ASC  815  requires  qualitative  disclosures  about  objectives  and 
strategies  for  using  derivatives,  quantitative  disclosures  about  fair  value  amounts  of  gains  and  losses  on  derivative 
instruments, disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements, disclosures by sellers of credit 
derivatives, including credit derivatives embedded in a hybrid instrument, and additional disclosure about the current status 
of  the  payment/performance  risk  of  a  guarantee.    The  adoption  of  ASC  815  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the 
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
Effective August 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC 350-30, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, General Intangibles Other 
than Goodwill (formerly FAS 142-3, “Determination of Useful Life of Intangible Assets”).  ASC 350-30 amends the factors 
that  should  be  considered  in  developing  the  renewal  or  extension  assumptions  used  to  determine  the  useful  life  of  a 
recognized  intangible  asset  under  ASC  350,  Intangibles  –  Goodwill  and  Other.    ASC  350-30  also  requires  expanded 
disclosure  regarding  the  determination  of  intangible  asset  useful  lives.    The  adoption  of  ASC  350-30  did  not  a  material 
impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
Effective August 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC 470-20, Debt, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (formerly APB 
Opinion No. 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments that may be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including 
Partial  Cash  Settlement)”).    ASC  470-20  requires  cash  settled  convertible  debt  to  be  separated  into  debt  and  equity 
components at issuance and a value to be assigned to each.  The value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair 
value,  as  of  the  issuance  date,  of  a  similar  bond  without  the  conversion  feature.    The  difference  between  the  bond  cash 
proceeds and this estimated fair value is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the 
bond.    The  adoption  of  ASC  470-20  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the  consolidated  financial  position,  results  of 
operations or cash flows. 
 
Effective  August  1,  2009,  the  Company  adopted  ASC  260-10,  Earnings  per  Share,  General  (formerly  EITF  03-6-1, 
“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities”).  ASC 260-
10 addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting 
and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two-class method as 
described in ASC 260, Earnings per Share.  Under the guidance in ASC 260-10, unvested share-based payment awards that 
contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and 
shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.  The adoption of ASC 260-10 
did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
Effective August 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging, Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity 
(formerly EITF 07-5, “Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock”).  
ASC  815-40  provides  guidance  for  determining  whether  an  equity-linked  financial  instrument  (or  embedded  feature)  is 
indexed to an entity’s own stock.  ASC 815-40 applies to any freestanding financial instrument or embedded feature that has 
all of the characteristics of a derivative or freestanding instrument that is potentially settled in an entity’s own stock (with the 
exception of share-based payment awards within the scope of ASC 718).  To meet the definition of “indexed to own stock,” 
an instrument’s contingent exercise provisions must not be based on (a) an observable market, other than the market for the 
issuer’s stock (if applicable), or (b) an observable index, other than an index calculated or measured solely by reference to the 
issuer’s own operations, and the variables that could affect the settlement amount must be inputs to the fair value of a “fixed-
for-fixed”  forward  or  option  on  equity  shares.    The  adoption  of  ASC  815-40  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the 
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JULY 31, 2010
Effective August 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC 855, Subsequent Events.  ASC 855 establishes general standards of 
accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or 
are available to be issued.  It requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and 
the basis for that date.  ASC 855 is effective for interim financial periods ending after June 15, 2009.  The adoption of ASC 
855 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-09, which amends ASC 855 to remove the requirement for and SEC filer to 
disclose  a date  in both  issued  and  revised financial  statements.    Revised financial  statements  include  financial  statements 
revised as a result of either correction of an error or retrospective application of GAAP.  All of the amendments in ASU 
2010-09 are effective upon issuance of the final ASU, except for the use of the issued date for conduit debt obligors.  That 
amendment is effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2010.  The adoption of ASU 2010-09 did not have 
a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
On January 21, 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, which amends ASC 820 to add new requirements for disclosures about 
transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements relating to 
Level 3 measurements.  The ASU also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about 
inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value.  Further the ASU amends guidance on employers’ disclosures 
about post-retirement benefit plan assets under ASC 715 to require that disclosures be provided by classes of assets instead of 
by major categories of assets.  The ASU is effective for the first reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after 
December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements 
on a gross basis, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those 
fiscal years.  The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2009-06 to have a material impact on the consolidated 
financial statements.
In June 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-17 which amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the issuance 
of FASB Statement No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R).  The amendments in this Accounting Standards 
Update  replace  the  quantitative-based  risks  and  rewards  calculation  for  determining  which  reporting  entity,  if  any,  has  a 
controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has 
the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance 
and (1) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or (2) the right to receive benefits from the entity.  An approach that is 
expected to be primarily qualitative will be more effective for identifying which reporting entity has a controlling financial 
interest in a variable interest entity.  The amendments in this Update also require additional disclosures about a reporting 
entity’s  involvement  in  variable  interest  entities,  which  will  enhance  the  information  provided  to  users  of  financial 
statements.  The standard is effective for the years beginning after November 19, 2009 and for interim periods within those 
fiscal years.  The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2009-17 to have a material impact on the consolidated 
financial statements.
In  September  2009,  the  FASB  issued  authoritative  guidance  regarding  multiple-deliverable  revenue  arrangements.    This 
guidance  addresses  how  to  separate  deliverables  and  how  to  measure  and  allocate  consideration  to  one  or  more  units  of 
accounting.  Specifically, the guidance requires that consideration be allocated among multiple deliverables based on relative 
selling prices.  The guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy of (1) vendor-specific objective evidence, (2) third-party 
evidence and (3) estimated selling price.  This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2010 but may 
be  early  adopted  as  of  the  beginning  of  an  annual  period.    The  Company  does  not  expect  that  this  guidance  will  have  a 
material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

RECLAMATION DEPOSITS
NOTE 3: 
 
Reclamation deposits includes interest and non-interest bearing deposits issued in the States of Arizona, Texas and Wyoming 
pursuant to exploration, production and reclamation activities in the respective states.  During the year ended July 31, 2010 
the  Company  deposited  $233,275  to  be  held  in  trust  for  the  Texas  Commission  on  Environmental  Quality  (“TCEQ”)  in 
conjunction with the STMV Acquisition.  Additionally, an amount of $2,497,000 held in trust for the TCEQ was assigned to 
the Company as a component of the STMV Acquisition (refer to Note 4).  Reclamation deposits totaling $11,034 are held in 
trust for the States of Arizona and Wyoming collectively. 
 
 
NOTE 4: 
 
On December 18, 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of a 100% ownership interest in STMV, from each of URN 
Resources Inc. (“URN”), a subsidiary of Uranium One Inc., and Everest Exploration, Inc. (“Everest”). 
 
The Company purchased from URN, all of the outstanding securities of URN Texas GP, LLC and URN South Texas Project, 
Ltd., the 99% joint venture partner of STMV, in exchange for 2,500,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company.  
The shares issued to URN are subject to a registration rights agreement which restricts the number of shares that can be sold 
over a 240-day period following the closing date.  Under the terms of the registration rights agreement, URN may sell up to 
1/6 of the registerable securities during the first 90 days following the closing date, and an additional 1/6 each subsequent 30 
day period. 
 
The Company contemporaneously acquired certain assets and liabilities of Everest including Everest’s 1% interest in STMV, 
Everest’s agreement to cancel its prior royalty interest applicable to STMV and Everest’s agreement to allow the Company to 
continue to rent or lease certain equipment being used in connection with the same.  The liabilities assumed as part of the 
Everest  transaction  consisted  of  reclamation  obligations  for  the  Tex-1  and  Mount  Lucas  Uranium  Projects,  which  are 
depleted past producing mining sites located in Texas.  The consideration for the Everest net assets was:
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii)
(iv)
200,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company; 
a cash payment of $1,000,000; 
a further cash payment of any funds remaining from the proposed $2,200,000 of reclamation funds devoted to 
the reclamation of the Tex-1 and Mount Lucas Uranium Projects, subsequent to the successful completion of 
the reclamation work; and 
the entering into of two agreements with Everest principals providing for cash payments aggregating $80,000 
and stock issuances for an aggregate of 110,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock valued at 
$389,400, of which 55,000 have been issued to date and 55,000 ($194,700) has been recorded as share issuance

The  Company  measures  its  available-for-sale  securities  at  fair  value  in  accordance  with  ASC  820.    ASC  820  specifies  a 
valuation hierarchy based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable.  Observable 
inputs  reflect  market  data  obtained  from  independent  sources,  while  unobservable  inputs  reflect  the  Company’s  own 
assumptions.  These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES
• 
•
•
Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; 
Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active  markets, quoted prices for identical or similar 
instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and 
significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 
Level  3  –  Valuations  derived  from  valuation  techniques  in  which  one  or  more  significant  inputs  or 
significant value drivers are unobservable.
This  hierarchy  requires  the  Company  to  minimize  the  use  of  unobservable  inputs  and  to  use  observable  market  data,  if 
available,  when  estimating  fair  value.    Based  on  the following  inputs at  July  31, 2010,  the  fair  values  of  the  Company’s

MINERAL RIGHTS AND PROPERTIES
NOTE 6: 
 
Uranium Exploration 
Since November 1, 2004, the Company has been acquiring mineral leases for the purpose of exploring for economic deposits 
of uranium in the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. 
 
As of July 31, 2010, a total of 50,253 gross acres (43,960 net mineral acres) of mineral properties have been staked, leased or 
optioned  pursuant  to  agreements  by  the  Company  in  the  States  of  Arizona,  Colorado,  New  Mexico,  Texas,  Utah,  and 
Wyoming for the purposes of uranium exploration for a net total cost of $13,674,400 including $8,249,750 representing the 
fair value of non-cash compensation and $3,911,800 representing the fair value allocation of Palangana as a component of the 
STMV Acquisition.  These leases are subject to varying royalty interests, some of which are indexed to the sale price of 
uranium.    As  of  July  31,  2010,  total  yearly  recurring  maintenance  payments  of  approximately  $612,000  are  required  to 
maintain existing mineral leases. 
 
Hobson Processing Facility 
On  December  18,  2009,  the  Company  completed  the  STMV  Acquisition  which  included  the  Hobson  Processing  Facility 
(“Hobson”).    Hobson  is  located  about  100  miles  northwest  of  Corpus  Christi  in  Karnes  County,  Texas.    Hobson  was 
originally  licensed  and  constructed  in  1978,  and  was  subsequently  refurbished  and  expanded  to  a  drying  and  packaging 
capacity of 2,500,000 pounds of U3O8 per year in Q3 2008.  Hobson’s capacity can be doubled with the installation of a 
second and larger vacuum dryer. 
 
The  facility  at  Hobson  is  designed  to  process  uranium-loaded  resins  from  satellite  facilities  to  a  final  product  commonly 
known as yellowcake or U3O8.  By utilizing the Hobson facility as a central processing site, the Company’s near-term plan is 
to have Goliad, and potentially Nichols and Palangana, in-situ recovery (“ISR”) production processed at Hobson rather than 
to construct a new processing plant at Goliad.  The Company’s Goliad and Nichols projects are located 40 miles east and 5 
miles southwest of Hobson, respectively. 
 
Palangana Project 
On December 18, 2009, the Company acquired Palangana through its acquisition of STMV (refer to Note 4).  Palangana had 
an estimated fair value of $3,911,800 at the time of acquisition.  The Palangana Project is a prior-producing, ISR project 
located in the South Texas uranium belt.  The 2,500 hectare (6,200 acre) property is located approximately 100 miles south of 
the Hobson processing facility. 
 
Goliad Project 
On  October  11,  2005,  the  Company  entered  into  a  mineral  asset  option  agreement  (the  "Moore  Option")  granting  the 
Company the option to acquire certain mineral property leases in the State of Texas for total consideration of $200,000 and 
3,000,000 post-split restricted common shares at a fair value of $0.33 per share.  In consideration for the Moore Option and 
its partial exercise over the option term, the Company has made cash payments totaling $200,000 and issued 3,000,000 post-
split  shares  of  restricted  common  stock.    Upon  completion  of  the  terms  of  the  Moore  Option,  title  to  the  leases  were 
transferred to the Company.

INCOME TAXES
NOTE 13: 
 
As of July 31, 2010, the Company had United States and Canadian net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $29.2 
million  and  CDN  $3.3  million,  respectively,  that  may  be  available  to  reduce  future  years'  taxable  income.    These  carry 
forwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, commencing in 2023.  Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these 
losses  have  not  been  recognized  in  these  financial  statements,  as  their  realization  is  determined  not  likely  to  occur  and 
accordingly,  the  Company  has  recorded  a  valuation  allowance  for  the  deferred  tax  asset  relating  to  these  tax  loss  carry 
forwards. 
 
The Company’s policy is to accrue any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income 
taxes.  Additionally, FIN 48 requires that a company recognize in its financial statements the impact of a tax position that is 
more  likely  than  not  to  be  sustained  upon  examination  based  on  the  technical  merits  of  the  position.    The  Company  has 
incurred taxable losses for all tax years since inception and accordingly, no provision for taxes has been recorded for the 
current or any prior fiscal year. 
 
The Company reviews its valuation allowance requirements on an annual basis based on projected future operations.  When 
circumstances change and this causes a change in management's judgment about the recoverability of future tax assets, the 
impact of the change on the valuation allowance is generally reflected in current income. 
 
A reconciliation of income tax computed at the federal and state statutory tax rates and the Company's effective tax rate is as 
follows:
Federal income tax provision 
States income tax provision, 
  net of federal income tax effect

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our  management,  with  the  participation  of  our  Principal  Executive  Officer  and  Principal  Financial  Officer,  has 
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on such evaluation, our 
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered 
by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
It  should  be  noted  that  any  system  of  controls  is  based  in  part  upon  certain  assumptions  designed  to  obtain 
reasonable (and not absolute) assurance as to its effectiveness, and there can be no assurance that any design will 
succeed in achieving its stated goals.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The  management  of  the  company  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over 
financial  reporting,  as  required  by  Sarbanes-Oxley  (SOX)  Section  404  A.    The  Company's  internal  control  over 
financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company's Principal Executive Officer and 
Principal Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of the Company's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally 
accepted accounting principles ("US GAAP").
As  of  July  31,  2010,  management  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  the  Company's  internal  control  over  financial 
reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control -
Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission 
("COSO") and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments.  Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, as at 
July 31, 2010 such internal controls and procedures were effective.
The  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm  that  audited  the  financial  statements  has  issued  an  attestation 
report internal control over financial reporting which has been included in the financial statements.
We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures over financial 
reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action by implementing additional enhancements 
or improvements, or deploying additional human resources as may be deemed necessary.
Changes in Internal Controls
There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter for the fiscal year ended July 31, 
2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial 
reporting.

ITEM 11.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The  Compensation  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  is  responsible  for  establishing  and 
administering the Company's executive and director compensation.
The  Compensation  Committee's  compensation objective  is  designed  to attract  and  retain  the best  available  talent 
while  efficiently  utilizing  available  resources.    The  committee  compensates  executive  management  primarily 
through base salary and equity compensation designed to be competitive with comparable companies, and to align 
management's  compensation  with  the  long-term  interests  of  shareholders.    In  determining  an  executive 
management's compensation, the Compensation Committee also takes into consideration the financial condition of 
the Company and discussions with the executive.
3962727.3
105
In determining the compensation for Messrs. Adnani, Anthony and Obara, the Compensation Committee considered 
compensation paid to other executive officers of other companies within the industry, the executive's performance in 
meeting goals, and the complexity of the management position and the experience of the person.  Of the amount of 
the compensation paid to the executive officer, the majority of the compensation was in the form of options.  The 
number  of  options  granted  was  determined  in  large  part  due  to  the  financial  condition  of  the  Company  which 
currently has no revenues.  The Compensation Committee did not have a specific formula to determine the amount 
of  the  executive  compensation  and  what  portion  of  such  compensation  would be  in  the  form  of  cash  and  equity 
securities.  Therefore, the determination of an executive salary including the amount of cash and equity securities 
may be considered arbitrary taking into account the foregoing factors.
Similarly, directors receive cash compensation for their service as such, as well as options.  The number of options 
granted  to  each  director  is  based  on  the  experience  of  the  director,  time  spent  on  Company  matters  and  the 
compensation paid to other directors of companies in the industry.
The following table sets forth the compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer and those executive officers that earned in excess of $100,000 during the years ended July 31, 
2010,  2009, and 2008  (the "Named Executive Officers"):

(1)  Under Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, 
arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or 
to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of 
shares.  Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the 
power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares).  In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if 
the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of 
which the information is provided.  In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding 
is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these 
acquisition  rights.   As  a  result,  the  percentage  of  outstanding  shares  of  any  person  as  shown  in  this  table  does  not 
necessarily reflect the person's actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock 
actually outstanding as of the date of this annual report.  As of October 12, 2010, there were 60,846,787 shares issued and 
outstanding.

Stairs Agreement
Effective November 1, 2007, we entered into a binding letter Agreement to Purchase Assets (the "Agreement") with 
Melvin O.  Stairs, Jr. ("Mr. Stairs"), whereby we acquired from Mr. Stairs an undivided 100% legal, beneficial and 
registered interest in and to a certain mineral exploration claim represented by permit number 08-111678, which is 
located  at  T7N  R3E,  Section  32,  in  Maricopa  County,  Arizona  (the  "Mineral  Claim"),  together  with  a  certain 
database containing various material information respecting the subject Mineral Claim (the Mineral Claim and its 
database, collectively, the "Assets").  As consideration for acquisition of the Assets, we have agreed to make the 
following  payments  (each  a  "Purchase  Price  Payment")  and  the  following  Mineral  Claim  maintenance  payments 
(each a "Purchase Price Maintenance Payment") to Mr. Stairs in the following manner at the following times after 
November 1, 2007 (the "Acceptance Date"):
(a)
Purchase  Price  Payments:  pay  to  the  order  and  direction  of  Mr. Stairs  the  following  Purchase  Price

permitting costs, transfer fees and any reclamation costs associated in any manner with the Mineral Claim 
interests comprising the Assets.
3962727.3
114
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, in order to secure the complete and timely payment of our purchase price 
obligations to Mr. Stairs under the Agreement, we granted a security interest in and to, a lien upon and a right of set-
off against our right, title and interest in and to the Assets.
In addition, and pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, at any time prior to the earlier of the payment of the entire 
Purchase Price by us to Mr. Stairs or the termination of the Agreement for any reason, we have a right of first refusal 
to acquire all or any portion of any interest in the Agreement or to any mineral property interest which Mr. Stairs 
may  have  an  interest  in  at  anytime  and  which  Mr. Stairs  desires  to  dispose  of  (collectively,  the  "Holding").    If 
Mr. Stairs receives a bona fide offer to purchase from, or where a sale is solicited by Mr. Stairs, then upon settling 
the proposed terms thereof with a third party for the purchase or sale of the Holding, Mr. Stairs shall offer to sell the 
Holding to us.  The offer to sell to us shall be on the same terms and conditions and of equivalent dollar value as 
those contained in the offer to the third party; provided, however, that should Mr. Stairs and us fail to agree upon a 
determination of the equivalent dollar value for any such offer, such equivalent dollar value shall be determined by 
arbitration under the provisions of the Agreement.  We shall be entitled to elect, by notice to Mr. Stairs within 30 
calendar days from the date of receipt of the offer to sell, to acquire the Holding, on the same terms and conditions 
as those set forth in the offer to the third party.  If we do not exercise its right to acquire the Holding, Mr. Stairs may, 
for a period of 60 calendar days following the last date upon which we could have made the election, dispose of the 
Holding, but only on the same terms and conditions as set forth in that offer.
On August 25, 2008 we entered into an amendment agreement pursuant to which the total consideration payable was 
reduced  to  $300,000  as  follows:  i)  a  $10,000  deposit  upon  execution  (paid),  ii)  installments  of  $95,000  cash  on 
January  10,  2008  (paid)  and  $57,000  cash  (paid)  and  $38,000  by  way  of  issuance  of  19,000  restricted  common 
shares  of  the  Company  at  a  deemed  price  of  $2.00  per  share  (pending  regulatory  approval)  on  August  15,  2008 
(issued), and a final payment of $50,000 by way of cash, plus $50,000 by way of restricted common shares of the 
Company at a deemed price based on the average closing price of the shares on the 5 previous days preceding the 
payment due date of October 31, 2009. 
On January 25, 2010, the Company agreed to amend the August 25, 2008 Amending Agreement.  The Company 
agreed  to  pay  a  further  and  final  non-refundable  Purchase  Price  Payment  in  the  aggregate  amount  equivalent  to 
$65,000  payable  in  the  following  manner;  i)  the  initial  $30,000  of  the  Purchase  Price  Payment  by  way  of  cash 
(paid); and ii) the final balance of $35,000 of this Purchase Price Payment by way of the issuance 10,448 fully paid 
and non-assessable restricted common shares at deemed issuance price of U.S. $3.35 per Share (issued).

31, 2008 (paid), December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2009.  On December 12, 2008 we entered into an agreement
