</p>
<p>and 68/178 of 18 December 2013, and welcoming the efforts of all relevant stakeholders to 
</p>
<p>implement them, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that any measure taken to counter terrorism 
</p>
<p>complies with international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Expresses serious concern</i> at the violations of human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms, as well as of refugee and international humanitarian law, in the context of 
</p>
<p>countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Reaffirms</i> its strong and unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods, 
</p>
<p>practices and financing of terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by 
</p>

<p>whomsoever committed, regardless of their motivation, as criminal and unjustifiable, and 
</p>
<p>renews its commitment to strengthen international cooperation to prevent and combat 
</p>
<p>terrorism, and in that regard, calls upon States and other relevant actors, including regional 
</p>
<p>and subregional organizations, as appropriate, to continue to implement the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and its four pillars, which reaffirm, inter alia, respect 
</p>
<p>for human rights for all and the rule of law as being the fundamental basis of the fight 
</p>
<p>against terrorism; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Stresses </i>the responsibility of States to protect persons in their territory 
</p>
<p>against such acts, in full compliance with their international law obligations and in 
</p>
<p>particular with international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Reaffirms </i>the importance of ensuring that the protection of human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism is an essential component of the work 
</p>
<p>and strategies of the United Nations for supporting Member States in the context of the 
</p>
<p>fight against terrorism; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Deeply deplores</i> the suffering caused by terrorism to the victims and their 
</p>
<p>families, expresses its profound solidarity with them, and stresses the importance of 
</p>
<p>providing them with proper support and assistance; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Urges</i> States, while countering terrorism, to respect and protect all human 
</p>
<p>rights, including economic, social and cultural rights, bearing in mind that certain counter- 
</p>
<p>terrorism measures may have an impact on the enjoyment of those rights; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Reaffirms</i> that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any 
</p>
<p>religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Urges</i> States to ensure that measures taken to counter terrorism are not 
</p>
<p>discriminatory, and not to resort to profiling based on stereotypes founded on ethnic, racial 
</p>
<p>or religious grounds or any other ground of discrimination prohibited by international law; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Recognizes</i> the work carried out by the special procedures of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
</p>
<p>while countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Acknowledges</i> that the active participation of civil society can reinforce 
</p>
<p>ongoing governmental efforts to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms while 
</p>
<p>countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that measures to combat terrorism and preserve 
</p>
<p>national security are in compliance with their obligations under international law, in 
</p>
<p>particular under international human rights law, and do not hinder the work and safety of 
</p>
<p>individuals, groups and organs of society engaged in promoting and defending human 
</p>
<p>rights; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Urges</i> States to ensure that gender equality and non-discrimination are taken 
</p>
<p>into account when shaping, reviewing and implementing all counter-terrorism measures; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Calls upon</i> States, while countering terrorism, to ensure that any person who 
</p>
<p>alleges that his or her human rights or fundamental freedoms have been violated has access 
</p>
<p>to an effective remedy and that victims of human rights violations receive adequate, 
</p>
<p>effective and prompt reparations, which should include, as appropriate, restitution, 
</p>
<p>compensation, rehabilitation and guarantees of non-recurrence; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Also calls upon</i> States, while countering terrorism, to review their 
</p>
<p>procedures, practices and legislation regarding the surveillance of communications, their 
</p>
<p>interception and the collection of personal data, including mass surveillance, interception 
</p>
<p>and collection, with a view to upholding the right to privacy by ensuring the full and </p>


<p>effective implementation of all their obligations under international human rights law, and 
</p>
<p>urges them to take measures to ensure that interference with the right to privacy is regulated 
</p>
<p>by law, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non-
</p>
<p>discriminatory, and that such interference is not arbitrary or unlawful, bearing in mind what 
</p>
<p>is reasonable to the pursuance of legitimate aims; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Urges</i> States to ensure that any measure taken or means employed to counter 
</p>
<p>terrorism, including the use of remotely piloted aircraft, complies with their obligations 
</p>
<p>under international law, including international human rights law and international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Also urges </i>States to undertake prompt, independent and impartial fact-finding 
</p>
<p>inquiries whenever there are plausible indications of breaches of their obligations under 
</p>
<p>international human rights law as a result of any measures taken or means employed to 
</p>
<p>counter terrorism, and to ensure accountability for those responsible for violations that 
</p>
<p>amount to crimes under national or international law; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Notes with concern</i> measures that can undermine human rights and the rule of 
</p>
<p>law, such as the detention of persons suspected of acts of terrorism in the absence of a legal 
</p>
<p>basis for detention and due process guarantees, the unlawful deprivation of the right to life, 
</p>
<p>and other fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of assembly and association, the 
</p>
<p>deprivation of liberty that amounts to placing a detained person outside the protection of the 
</p>
<p>law, the trial of suspects without fundamental judicial guarantees, the illegal deprivation of 
</p>
<p>liberty and transfer of individuals suspected of terrorist activities, the return of suspects to 
</p>
<p>countries without individual assessment of the risk of there being substantial grounds for 
</p>
<p>believing that they would be in danger of subjection to torture, and limitations to effective 
</p>
<p>scrutiny of counter-terrorism measures; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Stresses </i>that all measures used in the fight against terrorism, including the 
</p>
<p>profiling of individuals and the use of diplomatic assurances, memorandums of 
</p>
<p>understanding and other transfer agreements or arrangements, must be in compliance with 
</p>
<p>the obligations of States under international law, including international human rights, 
</p>
<p>refugee and humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Urges</i> States, while countering terrorism, to respect the rights to be equal 
</p>
<p>before the courts and tribunals and to a fair trial, as provided for by international law, 
</p>
<p>including international human rights law, such as article 14 of the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights and, as applicable, international humanitarian law and refugee 
</p>
<p>law; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Also urges</i> States to take measures to ensure that counter-terrorism laws and 
</p>
<p>implementing measures are consistent with and are applied in a manner that fully respects 
</p>
<p>the rights compliant with articles 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>and further codified in articles 14 and 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, in particular to ensure respect of the principle of certainty of the law by 
</p>
<p>clear and precise provisions; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Reiterates its concern<b></b></i><b> </b>with regard to measures that can undermine human 
</p>
<p>rights and the rule of law, and urges all States to take all necessary steps to ensure that 
</p>
<p>persons deprived of their liberty, regardless of the place of arrest or detention, enjoy the 
</p>
<p>guarantees to which they are entitled under international law, including review of their 
</p>
<p>detention and other fundamental judicial guarantees; </p>


<p>23. <i>Takes note</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism;1 
</p>

</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights on the protection of human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms while countering terrorism;<footnote name="2">A/HRC/28/28. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>25. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur, in accordance with his mandate, to continue 
</p>
<p>to gather, request, receive and exchange information on alleged violations of human rights 
</p>
<p>and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, and to report regularly to the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>26. <i>Requests</i> all States to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur in the 
</p>
<p>performance of the tasks and duties mandated, including by reacting promptly to urgent 
</p>
<p>appeals and providing the information requested, and to give serious consideration to 
</p>
<p>responding favourably to requests by the Special Rapporteur to visit their countries; 
</p>
<p>27. <i>Encourages</i> United Nations bodies, agencies, funds and programmes 
</p>
<p>involved in supporting counter-terrorism efforts to continue to facilitate the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as due process and the rule 
</p>
<p>of law, while countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p>28. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner and the Special Rapporteur to contribute 
</p>
<p>further, appropriately, to the ongoing discussion regarding the efforts of States Members of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations to put in place adequate human rights guarantees to ensure fair and clear 
</p>
<p>procedures, in particular with regard to placing individuals and entities on, and removing 
</p>
<p>them from, terrorism-related sanctions lists; 
</p>
<p>29. <i>Recalls</i> that the General Assembly, in its resolution 66/171, recognized the 
</p>
<p>need to continue ensuring that fair and clear procedures under the United Nations terrorism- 
</p>
<p>related sanctions regime are strengthened in order to enhance their efficiency and 
</p>
<p>transparency, and welcomed and encouraged the ongoing efforts of the Security Council in 
</p>
<p>support of those objectives, including by supporting the enhanced role of the office of the 
</p>
<p>ombudsperson and continuing to review all the names of individuals and entities in the 
</p>
<p>regime, while emphasizing the importance of sanctions in countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p>30. <i>Stresses</i> the importance that relevant United Nations bodies and entities and 
</p>
<p>international, regional and subregional organizations, in particular those that are 
</p>
<p>participating in the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, that provide technical 
</p>
<p>assistance relating to the prevention and suppression of terrorism to consenting States, 
</p>
<p>include, as appropriate and where consistent with their mandates, respect of international 
</p>
<p>human rights law and, as applicable, international humanitarian law and refugee law, as 
</p>
<p>well as the rule of law, as an important element of the technical assistance that they offer to 
</p>
<p>States in the area of counter-terrorism, including by drawing on the advice of, and 
</p>
<p>otherwise ensuring ongoing dialogue with, the special procedures of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council within their mandates and the Office of the High Commissioner and relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders; 
</p>
<p>31. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner and the Special Rapporteur to present their
