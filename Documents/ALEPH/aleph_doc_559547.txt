Non-GAAP Reconciliation
(in thousands)
(unaudited)
LRR Energy defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus or minus income tax expense; interest expense-net,
including loss (gain) on interest rate derivative instruments, net; depletion and depreciation; accretion of asset
retirement obligations; amortization of equity awards; loss (gain) on settlement of asset retirement obligations; loss
(gain) on commodity derivative instruments, net; commodity derivative instrument net cash settlements; impairment
of oil and natural gas properties; and other non-recurring items that LRR Energy deems appropriate.
Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by LRR Energy’s management and by external users
of its financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others, to assess LRR
Energy’s financial performance as compared to that of other companies and partnerships in the industry, without
regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis.
Distributable Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less cash income tax expense; cash interest expense; and
estimated maintenance capital. Distribution Coverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of Distributable Cash Flow to the
total quarterly distribution payable on all of LRR Energy’s outstanding common, subordinated and general partner
units.
Distributable Cash Flow and the Distribution Coverage Ratio are used as supplemental financial measures by LRR
Energy’s management and by external users of its financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks,
research analysts and others to compare basic cash flows generated by LRR Energy (prior to the establishment of
any retained cash reserve by its general partner) to the cash distributions it expects to pay its unitholders.
Distributable Cash Flow and the Distribution Coverage Ratio are also important financial measures for LRR Energy’s
unitholders as they serve as indicators of its success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, these
metrics indicate to investors whether or not LRR Energy is generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support
an increase in its quarterly distribution rates. Distributable Cash Flow and the Distribution Coverage Ratio are
quantitative standards used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships and
limited liability companies because the yield is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a
unitholder compared to the unit price.
LRR Energy’s management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and the Distribution Coverage
Ratio are useful to investors because these measures are used by many partnerships in the industry as measures of
operating and financial performance and are commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate its
operating and financial performance from period to period and to compare it with the performance of other publicly
traded partnerships within the industry. Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and the Distribution Coverage
Ratio should not be considered alternatives to net income, operating income or any other measures of financial
performance presented in accordance with GAAP. LRR Energy’s Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and
Distribution Coverage Ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because all
companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow or the Distribution Coverage Ratio in the
same manner. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and
Distribution Coverage Ratio to net income (loss), LRR Energy’s most directly comparable GAAP financial performance
measure, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014.
