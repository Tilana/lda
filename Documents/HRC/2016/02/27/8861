<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report contains the findings and recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief on her mission to the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia, from 26 to 29 April 2009. The Special Rapporteur gives an 
overview of the international human rights standards, domestic legal framework on 
freedom of religion or belief and religious demography in the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia. Subsequently, she highlights issues of concern for her mandate with regard to 
religious instruction in primary schools, religious symbols, places of worship, incitement to 
religious hatred and the application of the 2007 Law on the Legal Status of a Church, a 
Religious Community and a Religious Group.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur concludes that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
is a multi-ethnic, multicultural and multi-religious society. She welcomes the regular 
interfaith meetings held at the domestic level as well as the Government&#8217;s initiative in 
organizing the 2007 World Conference on Dialogue among Religions and Civilizations. 
However, some issues of concern remain to be addressed and the recent domestic debate on 
contentious issues, such as religious instruction in primary schools, shows the risk that 
these issues may be used to divide and polarize the different communities. The Special 
Rapporteur reminds those religious leaders and politicians who publicly voiced their 
outrage of the judgement of the Constitutional Court of 15 April 2009 concerning religious 
instruction in public schools that an independent judiciary was crucial to safeguard freedom 
of religion or belief and, ultimately, as a foundation for democratic governance. To foster a 
climate of religious tolerance, political and religious leaders should take a human rights-
based approach and clearly affirm the importance of the right to freedom of religion or 
belief in all its dimensions. In addition to legislation, States have several tools at their 
disposal to counter religious intolerance, for example by giving space for dialogue, 
encouraging public figures to make statements denouncing acts of intolerance and 
providing quality education. The Special Rapporteur stresses that the rule of law and the 
functioning of democratic institutions are prerequisites for the effectiveness of these 
strategies, which seek to encourage real dialogue and understanding.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Following an invitation by the Government, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief carried out a mission to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.1 
From 26 to 29 April 2009, the Special Rapporteur visited the cities of Skopje, Tetovo and 
Prilep pursuant to her mandate to identify existing and emerging obstacles to the enjoyment 
of the right to freedom of religion or belief and present recommendations on ways and 
means to overcome such obstacles.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that, since October 2004, the Government 
of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has extended an open invitation to all 
thematic special procedures. She is grateful for the positive cooperation during her visit in 
April 2009. During her mission, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to speak with 
several Government officials, including the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for 
Foreign Affairs, the Deputy Minister for Justice, the Deputy Minister for the Interior, the 
Deputy Minister for Education and Science as well as the Secretary General of the National 
Commission for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The 
Special Rapporteur also met with the Speaker of the Parliament and the Presidents of the 
Constitutional Court, of the Supreme Court and of the Basic Court Skopje II. She also held 
talks with the Ombudsman and the Deputy Director of the State Commission for religious 
communities and groups. 
</p>
<p>3. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur was able to collect first-hand information and 
documents on the state of freedom of religion or belief in the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur spoke with representatives of various 
religious or belief communities, including from the Bectash Community, the Evangelical 
Church, the Hare Krishna community, the Islamic religious community, the Jehovah&#8217;s 
Witnesses, the Jewish community, the Macedonian Orthodox Church, the New Apostolic 
Church, the Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid, the Roman Catholic Church, the Seventh-
Day Adventist Church and the United Methodist Church. 
</p>
<p>4. Additional civil society meetings were held with academics, journalists, human 
rights defenders and lawyers. In addition, the Special Rapporteur met with a number of 
representatives of international and regional organizations, including from the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Population 
Fund (UNFPA), the European Union (EU) and the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur thanks all her interlocutors for the information and opinions 
they shared with her. She sincerely appreciates the excellent logistical support provided 
before, during and after her visit by the office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator, 
and in particular by the National Human Rights Adviser. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 In Security Council resolution 817 (1993) of 7 April 1993, para. 2, the Council recommended to the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly that the State whose application was contained in document S/25147 be admitted 
to membership in the United Nations, this State being provisionally referred to for all purposes within 
the United Nations as &#8220;the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#8221; pending settlement of the 
difference that had arisen over the name of the State. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> II. International human rights standards 
</b></p>
<p>6. The right to freedom of religion or belief is enshrined in various international human 
rights instruments.2 These include articles 2, 18-20 and 26-27 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights; article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights; article 2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women; article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; articles 2, 14 and 30 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child; and article 12 of the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Apart from the latter 
convention, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has ratified all of the other above-
mentioned human rights treaties.  
</p>
<p>7. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is guided in her mandate by other relevant 
declarations, resolutions and guidelines of various United Nations bodies, including those 
issued by the Human Rights Committee, the General Assembly, the former Commission on 
Human Rights and the Human Rights Council. Of these instruments, of particular relevance 
for the mandate are articles 2, 18 and 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as 
well as the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of 
Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. The Special Rapporteur also takes into account 
human rights instruments adopted at the regional level containing provisions relating to the 
freedom of religion or belief, for example articles 9 and 14 of the Convention for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as related jurisprudence of 
the European Court of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Domestic legal framework on freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>8. Article 19 of the Constitution guarantees the right to express one&#8217;s faith freely and 
publicly, individually or with others. Amendment VII to the Constitution provides that the 
Macedonian Orthodox Church, the Islamic Religious Community in Macedonia, the 
Catholic Church, the Evangelical Methodist Church, the Jewish Community, as well as 
other religious communities and religious groups are separate from the State, equal before 
the law and free to establish religious schools as well as other social and charitable 
institutions under the procedure determined by law. Article 48 of the Constitution, 
according to amendment VIII, emphasizes that members of communities have a right to 
freely express, foster and develop their identity and community attributes, and to use their 
community symbols. Furthermore, the State guarantees the protection of the ethnic, 
cultural, linguistic and religious identity of all communities.  
</p>
<p>9. According to article 20 of the Constitution, the programmes and activities of 
political parties and other associations of citizens may not be directed at the encouragement 
or incitement of ethnic, racial or religious hatred or intolerance. Article 54 emphasizes that 
the freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen can be restricted only in cases 
determined by the Constitution and that such restrictions cannot discriminate on grounds of, 
inter alia, religion. Pursuant to article 118, the international agreements ratified in 
accordance with the Constitution are part of the internal legal order and cannot be changed 
by law. The Constitutional Court decides on the conformity of laws with the Constitution 
and protects the freedoms and rights of the individual and citizen relating to the freedom of 
</p>
<p>  
 2 For an overview of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s legal framework, see her reports to the Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights (E/CN.4/2005/61, paras. 15-20 and E/CN.4/2006/5, annex) as well as the online digest 
of her framework for communications (www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/religion/standards.htm). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.2

</p>
<p>religion, conscience and thought. In addition, amendment XI to the Constitution provides 
that the Ombudsman shall give particular attention to safeguarding the principles of non-
discrimination and equitable representation of communities in public bodies at all levels 
and in other areas of public life. 
</p>
<p>10. Furthermore, the 2007 Law on the Legal Status of a Church, a Religious Community 
and a Religious Group, which entered into force on 1 May 2008, regulates the 
establishment and legal status of churches, religious communities and religious groups, and 
the performance of religious service, prayer, rites, religious instruction, educational 
activities and revenues. Churches, religious communities and religious groups acquire legal 
personality when they are entered into a public register, which is kept by the Basic Court 
Skopje II. The name and official insignia of a church, religious community and a religious 
group must be different from the names and official insignia of already registered entities. 
All churches, religious communities and religious groups registered until 1998 by the body 
competent for relations between the State and religious communities maintain their existing 
legal personality and status. 
</p>
<p>11. According to article 21 of the 2007 law, churches, religious communities and 
religious groups may conduct religious instruction. This may be carried out at premises at 
which religious rites and other forms of public manifestation of religion are performed, as 
well as in other public and private premises and places, provided that the conduct of 
religious instruction does not violate public peace and order. Churches, religious 
communities and religious groups also have the right to establish religious schools of all 
degrees of education, except for primary education, for purposes of educating priests and 
religious attendants. Religious schools are equal to other educational institutions, and their 
students enjoy the same rights and obligations. Curricula and programmes of religious 
schools must not run contrary to the Constitution or domestic laws. The State 
administration body competent for education may inspect the curricula and programs of 
religious schools. 
</p>
<p>12. Article 26 of the 2008 Law on Primary Education allowed for religious instruction 
to be conducted as an elective subject in primary schools. Further details relating to the 
organization of religious instruction as well as content, activities and methods of 
performing a religious curriculum were within the domain of the teaching plan for primary 
education, as enacted and assessed by the Minister of Education. However, the 
Constitutional Court recently decided to repeal article 26 of the 2008 Law on Primary 
Education because this form of religious instruction in primary schools transgressed the 
academic and neutral nature of the curriculum and engaged the State in organizing such a 
religious curriculum in direct opposition to the principle of separation of church and State.3 
At the same time, the Constitutional Court, in its judgement of 15 April 2009, emphasized 
the unrestricted opportunity for religious communities to institute religious schools. 
</p>
<p>13. The 2000 Law on Denationalization defines the terms and procedures for the return 
or compensation for property that was confiscated after 2 August 1944 for the benefit of the 
State. Return or compensation may be granted to physical persons or for religious temples 
(churches, mosques and synagogues), monasteries and religious <i>vakav</i> (inalienable property 
intended for religious and human goals). Also subject to denationalization are the properties 
of &#8220;Jews from Macedonia&#8221; who left their properties following the forceful deportation to 
fascist camps and who have not survived the pogrom and do not have successors. Such 
property is compensated or returned to the Fund of Holocaust of Macedonian Jews, which 
is managed by an equal number of representatives appointed respectively by the 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Government and the Jewish Community pursuant to articles 66 to 69 of the 2000 Law on 
Denationalization. 
</p>
<p>14. According to article 319 of the Criminal Code, a person who by force, maltreatment, 
threatening the safety, derision of the national, ethnic or religious symbols, by desecrating 
monuments, graves or in any other manner that causes or incites to national, racial or 
religious hatred, discord and intolerance, is punishable with imprisonment of one to five 
years.4 Anybody who commits this crime by misusing his position or if riots, violence or 
large property damage were caused, may be punished with imprisonment of one to 10 
years. The prevention of incitement to national, racial or religious hatred and intolerance 
falls within the mandate of the Ministry of the Interior. The Government informed the 
Special Rapporteur that the Criminal Code was amended in September 2009. According to 
the new article 394 (d), a person who publicly spreads racist or xenophobic written material 
or other representations of an idea or theory which facilitates, promotes or encourages 
hatred, discrimination or violence, against any other person or groups on the grounds of 
race, colour, national or ethnic origin and religious conviction, shall be punished with 
imprisonment of one to five years. Article 39, paragraph 5, of the amended Criminal Code 
requires the court to take into consideration, when meting out the sentence, whether the 
crime has been perpetrated against a person or against a group of persons or property, 
directly or indirectly, on the grounds of national and social origin, political and religious 
convictions, social status, gender, race or colour. 
</p>
<p>15. The 2005 Law on Personal Data Protection prohibits the processing of personal data 
revealing the religious, philosophical or other beliefs, unless the processing is carried out in 
the framework of the activities of institutions, associations or any non-profit organizations 
for political, philosophical, religious, trade union or other purposes, if data processing 
refers exclusively to their members and such data are not disclosed to third parties without 
the consent of the data subject. In addition, article 67 of the 2006 Law on Police provides 
that personal data that are exclusively related to religious belief may not be collected by the 
police unless exceptionally necessary for a specific investigation. 
</p>
<p>16. The 2007 Public Holidays Act provides that the religious festivals of Orthodox 
Christmas and Easter as well as the Islamic Ramazan Bayram shall be public holidays for 
all citizens of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and that a number of other 
religious festivals5 are holidays for a particular group of believers only. Similarly, the 
previous law on public holidays, dating back to 1998, stipulated that Ramazan Bayram and 
Kurban Bayram were holidays only for citizens of the Muslim faith. In a related judgement, 
the European Court of Human Rights emphasized that &#8220;while the notion of the State sitting 
in judgement on the state of a citizen&#8217;s inner and personal beliefs is abhorrent and may 
smack unhappily of past infamous persecutions, the Court observes that this is a case where 
the applicant sought to enjoy a special right bestowed by Macedonian law which provided 
that Muslims could take holiday on particular days&#8221;.6 Since the applicant in the case of 
<i>Kosteski v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</i> was not prepared to produce any 
evidence that could substantiate his claim to be a Muslim, the European Court of Human 
Rights concluded unanimously that there had been no violation of articles 9 and 14 of the 
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 
</p>
<p>  
 4 See also below the chapter on incitement to religious hatred, paras. 46-48. 
 5 The additional religious holidays are stipulated in article 2 of the 2007 Public Holidays Act, 
</p>
<p>indicating the religious festivals for Macedonian Orthodox Christians (five additional holidays), 
Muslims (one), Jews (one) and Catholics (three). 
</p>
<p> 6 See judgement of the European Court of Human Rights of 13 April 2006, <i>Kosteski v. the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</i>, application no. 55170/00, para. 39. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Religious demography 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that, as of May 2008, 11 
churches7, 7 religious communities8 and 2 religious groups9 had been put on the public 
register in accordance with article 9 of the 2007 Law on the Legal Status of a Church, a 
Religious Community and a Religious Group.  
</p>
<p>18. In terms of religious demography, the 2002 official census indicates that the 
Macedonian Orthodox Church has around 1,300,000 believers, which amounts to 65 per 
cent of the country&#8217;s population. Less than 2 per cent of the total population are from other 
Christian communities, including from the Catholic Church (around 7,000 believers), the 
United Methodist Church (around 1,300 believers) and the Seventh Day Adventist Church 
(around 500 believers). 
</p>
<p>19. The second biggest community is the Islamic Religious Community of the Republic 
of Macedonia with around 674,000 believers. Consequently, Muslims amount to 
approximately one third of the total population. In addition, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed of pending applications for separate registration as a religious community by the 
Bectash community.10  
</p>
<p>20. Members of the Jewish Community in Skopje told the Special Rapporteur about the 
terrible fate their believers had to suffer during the Nazi occupation from 1941 to 1944. 
Almost the entire Jewish Community, 7,148 people (98 per cent) of the local Jewish 
population, was deported to Treblinka and killed there in 1943. The Jewish community was 
restored in December 1944 from almost 50 survivors. According to the 2000 Law on 
Denationalization, the properties of Jews who were victims of the holocaust and were 
without legal heirs are transferred to the Fund of Holocaust of Macedonian Jews. At 
present, more than 70 Jews live in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, virtually 
all in Skopje. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur would like to underscore that higher figures of the number 
of believers are sometimes indicated by the religious communities themselves, also taking 
into account believers currently not living or residing in the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia.11 Moreover, according to the 2002 official census, around 0.5 per cent of the 
population is atheist or has not declared any religious affiliation. 
</p>
<p>22. Many of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors also pointed to the perceived 
correlation between ethnicity and religious affiliation, since the majority of Orthodox 
believers are ethnic Macedonian and the majority of Muslim believers are ethnic Albanian. 
In addition, they referred to lessons learned following the regional instability, which in

<p>2001 contributed to the emergence of an internal armed conflict in the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia, with Government forces combating ethnic Albanian opposition 
groups. The conflict ended with the signing of the Ohrid Framework Agreement on 13 
August 2001, providing a framework for addressing the problems that had prompted the 
armed conflict. This 2001 Agreement was brokered by the international community, which 
also assisted in post-conflict verification and disarmament.12 
</p>
<p><b> V. Issues of concern for the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur would like to highlight some aspects of the status of 
freedom of religion or belief in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In this 
chapter, she will focus on the following five issues of concern for her mandate: (a) religious 
instruction in primary schools; (b) religious symbols; (c) the application of the 2007 Law 
on the Legal Status of a Church, a Religious Community and a Religious Group; (d) places 
of worship; and (e) incitement to religious hatred. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Religious instruction in primary schools 
</b></p>
<p>24. Following the enactment of the 2008 Law on Primary Education, an elective subject 
on religious instruction designed to study substantive tenets of a particular religion was 
introduced to public primary schools for the school year 2008/09. Alternatively, the pupils 
could choose a subject about history of religions. However, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed that pressure was exerted on teachers to have their pupils choose religious 
instruction rather than the subject on history of religions. Proceedings for the introduction 
and development of the curriculum on religious instruction as well as the hiring of teaching 
staff were criticized as non-transparent. In addition, some religious instruction classes 
reportedly started with prayers and tuition was readily offered for Orthodox Christians and 
Muslims, but not necessarily for other believers. Furthermore, there were complaints that 
religious instruction at the primary education level breached the principle of secularity of 
the State, according to which religious instruction can be organized on a voluntary basis 
outside the public schools but not in the framework of compulsory primary education. 
</p>
<p>25. In its judgement of 15 April 2009, the Constitutional Court struck down article 26 of 
the 2008 Law on Primary Education and thus abolished the possibility of having a subject 
on religious instruction in primary schools. In its judgement, the Constitutional Court took 
into consideration the way in which article 26 of the 2008 Law on Primary Education had 
been implemented since September 2008 and the fact that religious instruction classes were 
designed to educate pupils about the rules according to which an adherent to that religion 
should behave. The Constitutional Court emphasized that the State must maintain its 
neutrality and may not interfere in issues of faith or religious communities or confessional 
groups, may not motivate adherence to a certain faith, nor may it obstruct the expression of 
faith and impose religious conformity or demand the practice of religious activities as 
socially desirable conduct. 
</p>
<p>26. While this judgement of 15 April 2009 has raised considerable public debate in the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Special Rapporteur would like to highlight 
that it does not in any way impinge upon the freedom to receive religious instruction 
outside of primary school teachings. The Constitutional Court explicitly referred in its 
judgement to constitutional amendment VII, which delegated the issue of religious 
</p>
<p>  
 12 See the reports by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders (E/CN.4/2004/94/Add.2, para. 7 and A/HRC/7/28/Add.4, para. 10). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>instruction to the scope of religious communities and confessional groups, within the limits 
of the freedom to establish religious schools for that end. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
meeting with the President of the Constitutional Court, the latter also confirmed that the 
judgement of 15 April 2009 only referred to religious instruction at the primary school 
level, and he emphasized that the content of history of religions could be taught as part of 
history classes. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that numerous models are being 
followed throughout the world regarding the teaching of history of religions as well as 
religious instruction. The Human Rights Committee noted that article 18, paragraph 4, of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights permits public school instruction in 
subjects, such as the general history of religions and ethics if it is given in a neutral and 
objective way.13 The Committee also emphasized that public education, which includes 
instruction in a particular religion or belief, would be inconsistent with international human 
rights standards unless provision is made for non-discriminatory exemptions or alternatives 
accommodating the wishes of parents and legal guardians. Consequently, the judgement of 
the Constitutional Court of 15 April 2009 is in line with international human rights 
standards and seeks to protect parents&#8217; and children&#8217;s rights to freedom of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>28. Against this background, the Special Rapporteur was astonished by the outrage 
expressed publicly by certain religious leaders and politicians against the judgement of the 
Constitutional Court of 15 April 2009. One political party, for example, in a public 
announcement accused the judges of the Court of delivering verdicts only to the detriment 
of the government and of acting as &#8220;law-makers in the shade&#8221;, allegedly &#8220;abolishing all the 
laws that they dislike for ideological, political or other reasons&#8221;. Furthermore, some judges 
of the Court were described in that announcement as &#8220;puppets, who are anonymous for the 
wider public and who have never appeared before the citizens to get their trust&#8221;. The 
Special Rapporteur would like to stress the importance of fully respecting the judiciary&#8217;s 
independence and of providing accurate information, especially about contentious 
judgements regarding religious issues through the media to the public. 
</p>
<p>29. Several of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors confirmed that the Constitutional 
Court has had an important impact throughout the past decade on the interpretation of 
freedom of religion or belief and equal treatment of all believers. In 2000, the Court 
concluded that the State could not interfere in religious matters, whether to stimulate 
religious affiliation or to prevent the expression of a religious conviction.14  In another 
judgement, it emphasized that the State and its bodies, without any exception, must remain 
neutral in order to allow a citizen to choose freely whether or not to accept a certain 
religion, to profess it and to take part in religious rituals.15 The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes such clarifying decisions from bodies which are tasked to protect the 
constitutionality and legality at the domestic level. In the same line, the Human Rights 
Committee also emphasized, in its general comment no. 22, that freedom of religion or 
belief is not limited to traditional religions or to religions and beliefs with institutional 
characteristics or practices analogous to those of traditional religions. Furthermore, the 
Committee stressed that article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights did not permit any limitations whatsoever on the freedom to have or adopt a religion 
or belief of one&#8217;s choice and that no one could be compelled to reveal his thoughts or 
adherence to a religion or belief.

<p><b> B. Religious symbols 
</b></p>
<p>30. The issue of wearing religious symbols, especially headscarves, at schools is another 
contentious issue in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The recent public debate 
was triggered by the decision of the mayor of Tetovo to dismiss the director of a secondary 
school of economy, because the director had not allowed a first-year female student to wear 
a headscarf at school. Subsequently, the State Education Inspectorate assessed that the 
mayor had no right to dismiss the school director and that the latter should be reinstated as 
soon as possible. The Inspectorate emphasized that it was not disputing the girl&#8217;s right to 
wear a headscarf, however, it referred to the school&#8217;s rules adopted by the parents&#8217; council, 
according to which students are forbidden to wear religious symbols at the school. Reacting 
to this decision, the Islamic Religious Community argued that the pupils&#8217; rights to religious 
freedom should be observed and that the school rules should be amended accordingly. The 
use of religious symbols is reportedly becoming more obvious at schools and it is estimated 
that up to 3 per cent of female students wear Islamic apparel at high schools and 
universities. 
</p>
<p>31. For an analysis of the applicable legal framework and international case law with 
regard to religious symbols, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to her report 
submitted to the Commission on Human Rights at its 62nd session (E/CN.4/2006/5, paras. 
36-60). She would like to reiterate that freedom of religion or belief may be invoked both in 
terms of the positive freedom of persons who wish to wear or display a religious symbol 
and in terms of the negative freedom of persons who do not want to be confronted with or 
coerced into it. On the one hand, the right to education of pupils who have been expelled 
for wearing religious symbols and also the rights of parents or legal guardians to organize 
life within the family in accordance with their religion or belief may be at stake. On the 
other hand, the State may invoke the denominational neutrality of the school system and the 
desire to preserve religious harmony in schools. However, any limitation must be based on 
the grounds of public safety, order, health, or morals, or the fundamental rights and 
freedoms of others, it must respond to a pressing public or social need, it must pursue a 
legitimate aim, and it must be proportionate to that aim. 
</p>
<p>32. The perceived vulnerability of the persons involved should be taken into account 
and in all actions concerning children, the best interests of the child should be a primary 
consideration, in accordance with article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
There may also be peculiarities of certain institutional settings, as already pointed out by 
the then Special Rapporteur of the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and 
Protection of Minorities, Arcot Krishnaswami, in his 1959 study of discrimination in the 
matter of religious rights and practices (E/CN.4/Sub.2/200/Rev.1, p. 33): &#8220;A prohibition of 
the wearing of religious apparel in certain institutions, such as public schools, may be 
motivated by the desire to preserve the non-denominational character of these institutions. 
It would therefore be difficult to formulate a rule of general application as to the right to 
wear religious apparel, even though it is desirable that persons whose faith prescribes such 
apparel should not be unreasonably prevented from wearing it.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>33. If a policy decision has been taken at the national level to interfere with the freedom 
to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief with regard to wearing religious symbols, issues of 
proportionality and religious tolerance need to be thoroughly respected. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that the following questions should be answered 
in the affirmative: Was the interference, which must be capable of protecting the legitimate 
interest that has been put at risk, appropriate? Is the chosen measure the least restrictive of 
the right or freedom concerned? Was the measure proportionate, i.e. balancing of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/40/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>competing interests? Would the chosen measure be likely to promote religious tolerance?  
Does the outcome of the measure avoid stigmatizing any particular religious community?16 
</p>
<p><b> C. Application of the 2007 Law on the Legal Status of a Church,  
a Religious Community and a Religious Group 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by the reforms made in the 2007 Law on 
the Legal Status of a Church, a Religious Community and a Religious Group. It is a 
significant improvement on the 1997 Law on Religious Communities and Religious 
Groups, even in comparison to the legal situation after the Constitutional Court had 
removed in 1998 and 1999 the previous law&#8217;s most restrictive provisions owing to their 
unconstitutionality. The 2007 law itself is fairly liberal, and experts from the Advisory 
Council on Freedom of Religion or Belief of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions 
and Human Rights (ODIHR)17 and from the European Commission for Democracy through 
Law (Venice Commission)18 provided several useful comments during its elaboration.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that the 2007 law is in line with 
international human rights standards. However, its implementation has so far not been 
streamlined, for example with regard to registration issues and reportedly small religious 
communities face obstacles in practice when applying for building permits for their places 
of worship. During the universal periodic review of the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia by the Human Rights Council in May 2009, one of the recommendations made 
was for the Government to monitor the implementation of the legislation concerning 
freedom of religion with a view to ensuring full enjoyment of the freedom to practice one&#8217;s 
religion by all religious communities and groups in the country (A/HRC/12/15, para. 77). 
This recommendation was also accepted by the Government of the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia in September 2009 (see A/HRC/12/15, para. 1). 
</p>
<p>36. With regard to the terminology of the 2007 law, the Special Rapporteur asked her 
interlocutors whether there would be a legal or de facto distinction between a church, a 
religious community and a religious group. During her meeting at the Ministry of Justice, 
the Special Rapporteur was informed that churches, religious communities and religious 
groups were all equal before the law and that the different terms used in the 2007 law gave 
the various entities a liberty to choose between these categories. Article 2 of the 2007 law 
gives a common definition for churches, religious communities and religious groups to be 
&#8220;voluntary communities of natural persons who on the basis of their religious conviction 
and sources of their teaching exercise the freedom of religion, united by the religion and 
identity manifested in the same conduct of religious service, prayer, rites and other forms of 
manifestation of one&#8217;s religion&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>37. However, according to article 35 of the 2007 law, all churches, religious 
communities and religious groups registered by the body competent for relations between 
the State and religious communities until 1998 shall maintain their existent legal 
personality and status. In this regard, members of civil society raised their concerns that the 
1997 Law on Religious Communities and Religious Groups used to differentiate between 
registered religious communities and other religious groups, which in practice might still

<p>lead to discriminatory differentiation between &#8220;established churches&#8221;, &#8220;religious 
communities&#8221; and minority &#8220;religious groups&#8221;. Consequently, only 18 of 24 communities 
were reregistered automatically. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the 1998 cut-off 
date for maintaining existent legal personality pursuant to article 35 of the 2007 Law on the 
Legal Status of a Church, a Religious Community and a Religious Group seems to be 
arbitrary. In addition, while the Constitution also refers to &#8220;other religious communities and 
religious groups&#8221;, it explicitly names only five communities in its amendment VII, thus 
establishing an implicit hierarchy. 
</p>
<p>38. By letter of 18 December 2009, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur 
that 4 applications for registration of churches,19 4 applications for registration of religious 
communities20 and 16 applications for registration of religious groups21 have been filed 
since 1 May 2008, of which five applications have been granted so far. Several 
interlocutors informed the Special Rapporteur during her mission about implementation 
problems with regard to the new registration procedures under the 2007 Law on the Legal 
Status of a Church, a Religious Community and a Religious Group. These problems refer to 
the lack of resources and attention being devoted to registration applications, despite the 
tight deadlines provided for in articles 12 to 14 of the law. In addition, the law has allegedly 
been interpreted widely to include a possibility for the judge to study outside materials to 
ensure that the sources of teaching and liturgy for any new applicant are different than for 
any existing registered church. However, its article 10 only requires that the name and 
official insignia of a church, religious community and a religious group shall be different 
from the names and official insignia of already registered churches, religious communities 
and religious groups.  
</p>
<p>39. Intra-religious frictions between different streams have led to practical problems, 
especially for smaller or schismatic religious communities when they seek a separate 
registration with the competent State authorities. In 2004, for example, the Commission for 
Relations with Religious Communities and Religious Groups denied as ill-founded the 
application for registration of the &#8220;Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid&#8221;. In reasoning its 
decision, the Commission stated that the request for registration of the religious group 
&#8220;Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid&#8221; was only formal cover for the organization and activity 
of a parallel religious community. The Commission argued that the name &#8220;Orthodox 
Archbishopric of Ohrid&#8221; contained the name of the existing religious community 
&#8220;Macedonian Orthodox Church&#8221; and was therefore contrary to the statutory provision 
applicable at that time which stipulated that the name of a new religious group should differ 
from the names of already registered religious communities.22 Following an appeal, the 
Second Instance Government Commission confirmed the decision of the first instance 
body. This registration practice has been criticized by civil society organizations as undue 
interference by the State, ultimately protecting church monism and thus providing 
exclusivity of Orthodoxy on the territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
The case is currently pending at the level of the European Court of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>  
 19 Two applications for registration of churches were rejected due to the lack of complete 
</p>
<p>documentation, one application was granted and one application was withdrawn. 
 20 One application for registration of religious communities was rejected and three applications were

Group. </p>

<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>40. There are also reports about friction between different Muslim groups in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. On the one hand, the Special Rapporteur was informed 
that the Islamic religious community &#8220;regards the Bectash Dervish Order as its integral part 
and the registration of the Bectash religious community as invalid and legally 
unsubstantiated&#8221;.23 On the other hand, the Bectash community indicated that it was a 
separate religious group which had been operating since the 15th century when the 
foundations of the Dervish Bectash monastery &#8220;Harabati Baba Teke&#8221; were laid. In 2000, it 
was allegedly registered by the Commission for Relations with Religious Communities and 
Religious Groups. However, since it had not already been registered in 1998, the Bectash 
community does not automatically maintain its legal personality and status pursuant to 
article 35 of the 2007 Law on the Legal Status of a Church, a Religious Community and a 
Religious Group. The recent requests for registration of the Bectash community were 
reportedly rejected in 2009. 
</p>
<p>41. In general terms, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to the reasoning by the 
European Court of Human Rights in the case of <i>Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and 
Others v. Moldova</i>.24 The Court emphasized that the State had a duty to remain neutral and 
impartial in exercising its regulatory power and in its relations with the various religions, 
denominations and beliefs. Furthermore, State measures favouring a particular leader or 
specific organs of a divided religious community or seeking to compel the community or 
part of it to place itself, against its will, under a single leadership, would constitute an 
infringement of the freedom of religion. The Court also stressed that the right of believers 
to freedom of religion, which includes the right to manifest one&#8217;s religion in community 
with others, encompassed the expectation that believers would be allowed to associate 
freely, without arbitrary State intervention. In the recent case of <i>Mirolubovs and others 
v. Latvia</i>,25 the European Court of Human Rights reaffirmed that the autonomy of religious 
communities was an essential component of pluralism in a democratic society, where 
several religions or denominations of the same religion coexisted. While some regulation 
by the authorities was necessary in order to protect individuals&#8217; interests and beliefs, the 
State had a duty of neutrality and impartiality which barred it from pronouncing itself on 
the legitimacy of beliefs and their means of expression. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Places of worship 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about reports she received of sectarian violence 
and incidents of damage to some places of worship. Such acts are usually perpetuated by 
non-State actors and target the properties of religious minorities, both of registered and 
unregistered communities. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors also presented cases in 
which the local police had allegedly been reluctant to intervene and stop attacks against 
properties of religious minorities. Their believers also encountered problems in seeking 
compensation for the related loss and consequently had to meet for several years in a rented 
place which was not necessarily suitable for purposes of worship. 
</p>
<p>43. Representatives of religious minorities also shared their concerns about 
administrative problems and de facto obstruction they faced in seeking official permission 
for building new places of worship. When applying for such building permits, they

<p>allegedly underwent numerous bureaucratic procedures, which resulted in long waiting 
periods for the necessary documentation, and intervention from the local community which 
is against such projects. The relevant authorities often reject applications for building 
permits by religious minorities arguing that the development plan does not foresee a 
religious building on this piece of land. However, the small religious communities claim 
that the development plans often do not provide any such designated areas at all, which 
obviously adversely affects their possibility to manifest their religion or belief in worship, 
observance, practice and teaching. 
</p>
<p>44. Some members of religious minorities reportedly also face discrimination when they 
wish to bury family members. This problem is aggravated if the deceased previously 
belonged to a different religious community, whose leadership then objects to a burial in a 
particular part of a municipal cemetery. Although the local authorities have to take care of 
the cemeteries in a non-discriminatory manner, the Special Rapporteur was informed that 
the two biggest religious communities in practice behave as if they were the sole owners of 
the cemeteries even if the members of the religious minority have their family graves in this 
area and have paid for burial places there. 
</p>
<p>45. On a more positive note, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the policy of 
denationalization of assets belonging to religious communities. A number of religious 
communities have already benefited from the 2000 Law on Denationalization. For instance, 
the religious properties that belonged to the Jewish community were restituted in 2002 and, 
through an agreement concluded in December 2007, the Government also restituted heirless 
Jewish property in the country. However, the claims of some other religious communities 
remain pending to this day. The Special Rapporteur would like to stress that religious sites 
and places of worship have an emotional and spiritual significance for the believers. It is 
therefore important to resolve these issues in a sensitive and transparent manner. In this 
regard, the controversy concerning the reconstruction of the Carshiya mosque in Prilep, 
which was built in the 15th century and destroyed in 2001 during the internal armed 
conflict, is one example that needs to be looked into. In addition, the above-mentioned 
intra-religious tensions often also relate to places of worship and related ownership issues, 
which requires a careful and neutral assessment by all relevant authorities and courts. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Incitement to religious hatred 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the number of reports she has received 
regarding expressions of incitement to racial or religious hatred, which contribute to 
creating a climate of intolerance and threaten the security of individuals. According to the 
information received by the Special Rapporteur, reports that were filed by members of 
religious minorities concerning concrete cases of incitement to violence against them were 
not followed up by the local authorities. Impunity in cases of incitement to religious hatred 
unfortunately emboldens forces of bigotry. In an otherwise tolerant society, the Special 
Rapporteur was saddened to learn that there have been some cases of mob violence, threats 
and extreme forms of pressure against members of religious minorities. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur also received information that the vague formulation of 
article 319 of the Criminal Code to combat incitement of national, racial or religious hatred, 
discord and intolerance was allegedly misused against a particular religious leader, Bishop 
Jovan (Zoran Vraniskovski).26 In 2004, the domestic courts of first and second instance held 
</p>
<p>  
 26 See the related allegation letters sent by the Special Rapporteur on 13 October 2003 and 15 March 
</p>
<p>2004 (E/CN.4/2004/63, para. 48 and E/CN.4/2005/61/Add.1, para. 241) as well as the Government&#8217;s 
reply of 26 January 2004 (E/CN.4/2005/61/Add.1, paras. 242-257). </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>that, in leaving the Macedonian Orthodox Church and establishing the &#8220;Orthodox 
Archbishopric of Ohrid&#8221;, the accused had created a schism causing religious hatred, discord 
and intolerance. Consequently, they sentenced Bishop Jovan to 18 months of imprisonment 
for undermining the position of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, conducting a service of 
worship in a private flat and distributing a calendar that offended the religious sentiments of 
the citizens. An opinion by the OSCE/ODIHR Panel of Experts on Freedom of Religion or 
Belief expressed concerns about the judgement&#8217;s approach which seemed to suggest that 
any form of religious activity that has the effect of challenging the legitimacy and 
supremacy of the Macedonian Orthodox Church as the dominant religion was to be 
considered as causing religious hatred.27 In addition, according to the ODIHR opinion, the 
fact that Bishop Jovan had conducted religious services that prompted a hostile response by 
opposing believers could not amount to the commission of the criminal offence of 
incitement to religious hatred. Subsequently, the Supreme Court partially accepted Bishop 
Jovan&#8217;s appeal with regard to his freedom to perform religious rites, and reduced his prison 
sentence to eight months. 
</p>
<p>48. The risk that legal provisions prohibiting hate speech are interpreted loosely and 
applied selectively by the authorities underlines the importance of having unambiguous 
language and of devising effective safeguards against abuses of the law. With regard to the 
formulation of article 319 of the Criminal Code, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that 
this offence can be committed, inter alia, &#8220;in any other manner that causes or incites to 
national, racial or religious hatred, discord and intolerance&#8221;. The loose wording of article 
319 of the Criminal Code throws the net too wide; for example, &#8220;any other manner&#8221; could 
possibly include scholarly remarks, genuine dissent or grievance against specific religious 
tenets. The legal uncertainty triggered by the formulation of article 319 of the Criminal 
Code may have a chilling effect on the willingness of individuals to exercise their freedom 
of expression as well as their freedom of religion or belief, for example by changing their 
religion or manifesting religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching. In 
addition, an overreaction against the utterances of a person by any individual or group 
cannot constitute justification for penalizing such an expression unless the threshold of 
article 20, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is 
crossed. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that the ultimate goal is to find 
the most effective ways for the State to protect individuals against advocacy of religious 
hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>49. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a multi-ethnic, multicultural 
and multi-religious society. During her country visit, the Special Rapporteur noted 
that there is by and large a high level of tolerance in its society and that the 
Government has shown respect for religious diversity and freedom of religion or 
belief.  
</b></p>
<p><b>50. The Special Rapporteur is mindful of the fact that this country is a young 
democracy which has gone through a number of challenges, including the internal 
armed conflict in 2001. While that conflict was mainly fought along ethnic lines, she 
was repeatedly told by her interlocutors that there was also a certain element of 
religious tension involved. Ethnicity and religion are separate identities, yet they do

</b></p>
<p><b>often overlap and the situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is 
another case in point. 
</b></p>
<p><b>51. The country&#8217;s diversity is one of its strengths and the Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the fact that interfaith meetings are held regularly at the domestic level. 
Furthermore, the Government&#8217;s initiative in organizing the October 2007 World 
Conference on Dialogue among Religions and Civilizations is another indication of its 
commitment to enhance freedom of religion or belief. At the conference, spiritual 
leaders and representatives of the religious communities and denominations from 50 
different countries adopted a final declaration on the contribution of religion and 
culture to peace, mutual respect and cooperation.28</b> <b>The participants stated that the 
creation of broad inter-civilization cooperation, based on the principles of mutual 
respect and esteem, may contribute to the creation of preconditions for understanding 
other religions. They strongly condemned all forms of religious violence and its 
justification. Dialogue, mutual understanding and respect pointed to the need to 
mobilize political and spiritual leaders, intellectuals and all other social actors. 
Therefore, the commitment to dialogue among different civilizations and religions was 
at the same time a commitment against terrorism and instability. Finally, the 
participants stressed the high importance of the empowerment of women. 
</b></p>
<p><b>52. However, some issues of concern remain to be addressed in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (see paras. 23-48 above). Shortly before the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit in April 2009, several contentious issues arose in the domestic 
public debate, for example concerning religious instruction in primary schools, the 
wearing of religious symbols and the construction of places of worship. There is a risk 
that these issues may be used to divide and polarize the different communities. The 
Special Rapporteur wishes to remind all actors that religion should not be used to 
separate the country&#8217;s society. 
</b></p>
<p><b>53. In addition, the Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that, according to 
the Constitution, religious communities are separate from the State and equal before 
the law. In view of these constitutional provisions and related obligations under 
international human rights law, the Government has a delicate role to play: it must 
ensure that the principles of equality and non-discrimination are upheld and, at the 
same time, it must allow autonomy to religious communities. It must also have an 
even-handed approach when granting official status to all communities and yet 
protect the rights of all individuals, whether they are theistic, atheistic or non-theistic 
believers. A number of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors pointed to the 
perception that the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Islamic community wield 
considerable political influence, and that these two largest registered religious 
communities in the country were able to make inroads to the constitutional concept of 
separation of State and religion. They also voiced their concern that the links between 
religion, politics and nationalism were increasingly being stressed in public debate.  
</b></p>
<p><b>54. Governments have a primary obligation to protect individuals from acts of 
religious intolerance and discrimination. An informed public opinion needs to be 
created through monitoring as well as advocacy of human rights. Civil society can also 
contribute to create awareness on human rights issues, including those concerning 
freedom of religion or belief. According to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s experience 
throughout her mandate, legislation alone cannot create an atmosphere of social 
harmony and mutual trust. On the contrary, hasty legislation on matters of freedom 
of religion or belief may even lead to polarizing society along religious lines.

<p><b>55. The Special Rapporteur is conscious of the fact that religious instruction at 
public schools may raise all forms of controversy in many societies. In this regard, she 
would like to make a distinction between religious instruction and the teaching of 
history of religions. From a human rights perspective, the latter is less problematic 
provided that classes on history of religions are given in a neutral and objective way. 
The Toledo Guiding Principles on Teaching about Religions and Beliefs in Public 
Schools29 provide practical guidance for preparing curricula for teaching about 
religions and beliefs, as well as preferred procedures for assuring fairness in the 
development of such curricula. However, public education, which includes instruction 
in a particular religion or belief, is only consistent with article 18, paragraph 4, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights if provision is made for non-
discriminatory exemptions or alternatives accommodating the wishes of parents and 
legal guardians. 
</b></p>
<p><b>56. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that it is vital that the 
independence of the judiciary be fully respected and that courts be able to adjudicate 
upon religious matters without fear or favour. In this regard, she wishes to remind 
those religious leaders and politicians who publicly voiced their outrage about the 
recent judgement of the Constitutional Court concerning religious instruction in 
public schools that an independent judiciary is crucial to safeguard freedom of 
religion or belief and ultimately as a foundation for democratic governance. The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s affirmation during the universal 
periodic review session held in September 2009 that the promotion of the judiciary&#8217;s 
independence and efficiency remain its major priorities (A/HRC/12/15/Add.1, para. 
36). 
</b></p>
<p><b>57. With regard to the issue of wearing religious symbols, especially in public 
schools, the Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that each case has to be 
decided according to its own circumstances. In general, however, restrictions on the 
wearing of religious symbols should not be applied in a discriminatory manner. 
Limitations must be directly related and proportionate to the specific need on which 
they are predicated. The burden of justifying a limitation upon the freedom to 
manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief lies with the State. The chosen measures should 
promote religious tolerance and avoid stigmatizing any particular religious 
community. Furthermore, the principles of appropriateness and proportionality need 
to be thoroughly respected both by the administration and during possible legal 
review. 
</b></p>
<p><b>58. With regard to intra-religious tensions both within the Orthodox Church and 
within the Islamic community, the Special Rapporteur would like to remind the 
Government of its obligations to remain neutral and non-discriminatory, especially 
concerning the registration procedure. As outlined in her report submitted to the 
Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2005/61, para. 58), registration should not be 
a precondition for practising one&#8217;s religion, but only for the acquisition of a legal 
personality and related benefits. In the latter case, registration procedures should be 
easy and quick, and not depend on extensive formal requirements in terms of the 
number of members or the time a particular religious group has existed. Registration 
should not depend on reviews of the substantive content of the belief, the structure or 
the clergy. In addition, no religious group should be empowered to decide about the 
registration of another religious group.

<p><b>59. Concerning places of worship, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to 
General Assembly resolution 55/254, in which the Assembly calls upon States to exert 
their utmost efforts to ensure that religious sites are fully respected and protected in 
conformity with international standards and in accordance with their national 
legislation, and to adopt adequate measures aimed at preventing such acts or threats 
of violence. Furthermore, States, relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations and the media are encouraged to promote, inter alia, through education, 
a culture of tolerance and respect for the diversity of religions and for religious sites, 
which represent an important aspect of the collective heritage of humankind. 
</b></p>
<p><b>60. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned at reports received regarding 
sectarian violence and incitement to religious hatred. In this regard, she would like to 
distinguish between the expression of opinions even when they are deemed offensive 
by some believers, and advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence. While freedom of expression has to be respected, 
hate speech must be prohibited by law if it reaches the threshold of incitement to 
religious hatred described in article 20, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. In order to protect the integrity of individuals, hate speech 
must not be tolerated. However, each case has to be examined on its own merits so 
that freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief are not undermined. In 
this regard, the judiciary plays a vital role in striking a delicate balance on a case-by-
case basis. In view of the vague formulation of article 319 of the Criminal Code, the 
Special Rapporteur would urge the Government to review this provision with a view 
to prevent any arbitrary interpretation and application by the authorities. Legislation 
or policies designed to combat religious discrimination should be all-inclusive, 
carefully crafted and implemented in a non-biased manner to achieve their objectives 
(A/HRC/10/31/Add.3, para. 24). 
</b></p>
<p><b>61. Despite the above-mentioned concerns, the Special Rapporteur remains 
optimistic that a continuing debate on freedom of religion or belief in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will contribute to a higher level of understanding 
and mutual respect between different religious communities and individuals, 
including non-theistic and atheistic believers.  
</b></p>
<p><b>62. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize the importance of confidence-
building measures in order to address the concerns of the different communities. To 
foster a climate of religious tolerance, political and religious leaders should take a 
human rights-based approach and clearly affirm</b> <b>the importance of the right to 
freedom of religion or belief in all its dimensions. In addition to legislation, States have 
several tools at their disposal to counter religious intolerance, for example by giving 
space for dialogue, encouraging public figures to make statements denouncing acts of 
intolerance and providing quality education. These approaches need to be inclusive 
also in terms of the religions or beliefs covered. Above all, the rule of law and the 
functioning of democratic institutions are prerequisites for the effectiveness of these 
strategies, which seek to encourage real dialogue and understanding.
