<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 25/4, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to organize an expert 
</p>
<p>consultation for an exchange of views on human rights considerations relating to the issues 
</p>
<p>of administration of justice through military tribunals and the role of the integral judicial 
</p>
<p>system in combating human rights violations, and to present a summary of the discussions 
</p>
<p>to the Council at its twenty-eighth session. The expert consultation was held in Geneva on 
</p>
<p>24 November 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Statement of the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p><b>for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>2. The United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights opened the 
</p>
<p>expert consultation by pointing out that the wide variety of military justice systems made 
</p>
<p>generalizations about such institutions difficult, if not impossible. These systems had 
</p>
<p>developed over time as a result of each country&#8217;s unique history, legal tradition and 
</p>
<p>choices. 
</p>
<p>3. In a significant number of States, military tribunals were perceived as credible 
</p>
<p>judicial institutions and subject to civilian judicial oversight. In other States, however, 
</p>
<p>Governments had used military justice to persecute opposition figures and to shield military 
</p>
<p>personnel who committed serious human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>4 International human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights, did not refer specifically to military courts. Nevertheless, human rights 
</p>
<p>treaties, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, were of 
</p>
<p>great relevance to the issue of the administration of justice through military tribunals. The 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 32, stated that the Covenant did not 
</p>
<p>prohibit trials by military courts. It also stated, however, that the guarantees of the 
</p>
<p>Covenant could not be altered by the military character of a court. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of panel presentations and discussions 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Independence, impartiality and competence of the judiciary, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>military courts 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Gabriela Knaul, 
</p>
<p>pointed out that military tribunals had to be an integral part of the general justice system 
</p>
<p>and administer justice in a manner that was fully compliant with international human rights 
</p>
<p>standards, including articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights. She noted that, in its general comment No. 32, the Human Rights Committee stated 
</p>
<p>that the requirement of independence referred, in particular, to the procedure and 
</p>
<p>qualifications for the appointment of judges, and to guarantees concerning their security of 
</p>
<p>tenure, the conditions governing promotion, transfer, suspension and cessation of their 
</p>
<p>functions and the actual independence of the judiciary from political interference by the 
</p>
<p>executive branch and legislature.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur recommended that the independence of military tribunals 
</p>
<p>and their inclusion within the general administration of justice system of the State should be 
</p>
<p>legally guaranteed at the highest possible level; domestic legislation should include specific </p>


<p>guarantees to protect the statutory independence of military judges vis-&#224;-vis the executive 
</p>
<p>branch and the military hierarchy and to enhance the confidence of the public, the legal 
</p>
<p>profession and litigants in the impartiality of the judge and of the judiciary; and the status 
</p>
<p>of military judges, including their security of tenure, adequate remuneration, conditions of 
</p>
<p>service, pensions and age of retirement, should be determined by law, and military judges 
</p>
<p>have guaranteed tenure until a mandatory retirement age or the expiry of their term of 
</p>
<p>office, and be dismissed only on serious grounds of misconduct or incompetence, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with fair procedures set out in the law. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur also recommended that the role and functions of convening 
</p>
<p>officers should be clearly defined by legislation so that they could act independently of 
</p>
<p>external pressure and be prevented from acting in ways that might hinder the independent 
</p>
<p>and impartial administration of justice, and that domestic law should identify objective 
</p>
<p>criteria for the selection of military judges on the basis oftheir integrity, ability, 
</p>
<p>qualifications and training. Lastly, she reiterated her position that States should consider 
</p>
<p>adopting the draft principles governing the administration of justice through military 
</p>
<p>tribunals.<footnote name="1">3 CCPR/C/104/D/1914, annex, appendix. </footnote>  
</p>
<p>8. The former Attorney General for the Armed Forces in Norway, Arne Willy Dahl, 
</p>
<p>stated that there had been significant changes in national military justice systems in recent 
</p>
<p>years. The systems could be divided broadly into &#8220;Anglo-American&#8221; systems based on 
</p>
<p>courts martial convened for the individual case, and &#8220;European continental&#8221; systems based 
</p>
<p>on standing courts; some States had even dispensed with military courts altogether, having 
</p>
<p>military penal cases heard before civilian courts. This might be a civilian court with 
</p>
<p>specialized military expertise, or a fully civilian non-specialized court. The systems could 
</p>
<p>also be different in peacetime and in wartime. 
</p>
<p>9. Mr. Dahl concluded that the various military justice systems could be arranged along 
</p>
<p>an axis, with the traditional fully military courts martial system at the one end, and the fully 
</p>
<p>&#8220;civilianized&#8221; system at the other. The general trend for changes in military justice systems 
</p>
<p>was to move from the left to the right of the table below.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>10. Mr. Dahl observed, however, that what might be relevant in a peacetime perspective 
</p>
<p>could prove dysfunctional when troops were deployed abroad. When soldiers committed 
</p>
<p>crimes against local civilians whom they were supposed to protect, putting the accused on 
</p>
<p>an airplane for prosecution at home did not make a good impression. Affected civilians 
</p>
<p>needed to see that justice was done, and this was best demonstrated by having deployable 
</p>
<p>courts. Status of Forces Agreements typically allowed for exercise of jurisdiction by 
</p>
<p>military courts of the sending State, while the exercise by civilian courts of jurisdiction on 
</p>
<p>foreign territory was an anomaly.  
</p>
<p>11. According to Mr. Dahl, issues relating to the convening authority system and for the 
</p>
<p>imposition of punishment by summary procedures raised human rights concerns. He 
</p>
<p>concluded by highlighting the clear trends in military justice with regard to the rights of the 
</p>
<p>accused: more independence of judges; increased use of standing courts; increased rights to 
</p>
<p>elect trial instead of summary procedures; and increased right to legal representation.

<p>12. Umesh Chandra Jha, a retired Wing Commander in the Indian Air Force, gave an 
</p>
<p>overview of military justice in South Asian States, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, 
</p>
<p>Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, where 2.4 million military personnel and 1.<footnote name="6">CCPR/C/89/D/1172/2003. 
</footnote> 
</p>
<p>para-military personnel were subject to military justice. The British Indian military law of 
</p>
<p>1911 was the progenitor of military legal systems in South Asia. The types of trials were, 
</p>
<p>broadly speaking, summary court martial; summary/field general court martial; district 
</p>
<p>court martial; and general court martial.  
</p>
<p>13. With regard to summary trials, Mr. Jha noted that, for officers up to the rank of 
</p>
<p>major and lower ranks, the accused was not entitled to legal assistance, the rules of 
</p>
<p>evidence were not applicable, proceedings were not open to the public, and there was no 
</p>
<p>right to appeal. Summary punishments for officers and junior commissioned officers could 
</p>
<p>include forfeiture of service/seniority up to 12 months, stoppage of pay and allowances, and 
</p>
<p>reprimand. For personnel below the rank of junior commissioned officer, summary 
</p>
<p>punishment could include detention up to 28 (and in some cases 42 days), field punishment, 
</p>
<p>extra duties, a fine, deprivation of rank, and reprimand.  
</p>
<p>14. The other types of court martial were based on the convening authority system. Mr. 
</p>
<p>Jha explained that the power of the convening officer included the persons to tried; the 
</p>
<p>charges to be brought; the composition of the court; command over the prosecutor and the 
</p>
<p>officer for the defence, as well as the Judge Advocate General, whose role is to provide 
</p>
<p>advice on legal questions but who does not function as an advocate or a judge; confirmation 
</p>
<p>of the findings and sentence or sending back the proceeding for revision; and deciding on 
</p>
<p>post-confirmation petitions. There was no right to appeal against the decision of the 
</p>
<p>convening authority, although in India, an armed forces tribunal had appellate jurisdiction 
</p>
<p>over courts martial. 
</p>
<p>15. Mr. Jha pointed out that the armed forces in many South Asian countries, such as 
</p>
<p>Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, had been mandated by security and anti-
</p>
<p>terrorism laws to aid the civilian authorities to address terrorism and militancy. In this 
</p>
<p>context, members of the armed forces in a number of the said States had been accused of 
</p>
<p>serious human rights violations, such as enforced disappearances, extrajudicial executions, 
</p>
<p>rape, arbitrary detention and torture. To summarize, military law in South Asian countries 
</p>
<p>did not include war crimes as defined under the Rome Statue; the concept of command 
</p>
<p>responsibility had not been incorporated into military law; the right to fair trial as defined in 
</p>
<p>article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was not observed; 
</p>
<p>there was a need for manuals on the laws of war; and that civil society doubted the fairness 
</p>
<p>of military trials. Mr. Jha recommended, inter alia, the abolition of summary courts; 
</p>
<p>rationalizing the powers of the convening authority; insulating the Judge Advocate General 
</p>
<p>from the military chain of command; the abolition of degrading or humiliating forms of 
</p>
<p>punishment; legal aid for accused persons during trial and appeal; the establishment of 
</p>
<p>courts of appeals; and updating military legal systems by including the crimes contained in 
</p>
<p>the Rome Statute and the concept of command responsibility. 
</p>
<p>16. During the discussion, the representative of Belarus stated that, to better ensure fair 
</p>
<p>trial guarantees, States should not use closed or specialized tribunals for suspected 
</p>
<p>terrorists. The representative of Mexico explained that the State had undertaken a reform in 
</p>
<p>2014 to transfer jurisdiction over alleged human rights violations by military persons to 
</p>
<p>civilian courts. The representative of the Centre for Legal Studies stated that military justice 
</p>
<p>had been used in Argentina and other Latin America countries to secure impunity for 
</p>
<p>military personnel who had committed serious human rights violations. </p>


<p><b> B. Right to fair trial before courts, including  military   
</b></p>
<p><b>  courts, and other procedural protections 
</b></p>
<p>17. According to Alexander Nikitin, Professor and Director of the Centre for Euro-
</p>
<p>Atlantic Security at the Moscow State Institution for International Relations, many judicial 
</p>
<p>systems were characterized by an absence of integrity and jurisdiction was too fragmented. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Nikitin highlighted at the international level the fragmented nature of the international 
</p>
<p>criminal justice system, and pointed out that ad hoc international criminal tribunals could 
</p>
<p>be created by the Security Council; hybrid courts could be established on the basis of a 
</p>
<p>treaty between a State and the United Nations, or by the United Nations in areas or States 
</p>
<p>subject to peacekeeping operations; and that cases could also be brought before the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court.  
</p>
<p>18. Mr. Nikitin stated that the United States of America was a case of a lack of juridical 
</p>
<p>integrity at the national level. Military courts used the convening authority system for the 
</p>
<p>ad hoc nomination of officers, who might not have legal education, and could be biased, 
</p>
<p>particularly if they came from the same contingent as the accused. Military justice in the 
</p>
<p>United States was fragmented, such as in the case of the creation of military commissions 
</p>
<p>for adversarial combatants. Mr. Nikitin observed that few prisoners in Guantanamo had 
</p>
<p>been sentenced. Foreign suspects tried by military commissions did not have the same 
</p>
<p>constitutional rights as other persons in the United States. He stressed the need to guarantee 
</p>
<p>that military commissions do not use evidence gathered through torture or other cruel, 
</p>
<p>inhuman or degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>19. Mr. Nikitin argued that the United States of America had brought a disproportionate 
</p>
<p>number of prosecutions against persons for terrorist-related offences when compared with 
</p>
<p>other States, and that a large majority of these prosecutions had been brought against 
</p>
<p>foreigners or foreign organizations.  
</p>
<p>20. Mr. Nikitin recommended that, in order to ensure the right to a fair trial, there should 
</p>
<p>be a higher level of integrity in judicial systems, and that the principle of equal 
</p>
<p>(comparable) prosecution should be applied for equal (comparable) crimes. It would be 
</p>
<p>necessary to eliminate non-standard and non-transparent elements of judicial systems, such 
</p>
<p>as courts martial not subordinated to the general principles of civilian justice or 
</p>
<p>extraordinary military commissions. He advocated for the regulation of private military and 
</p>
<p>security companies and the adoption of the draft convention thereon. Mr. Nikitin concluded 
</p>
<p>that it was necessary to fill gaps in the law, and argued that there should be a coordinated 
</p>
<p>approach to justice issues, particularly in non-recognized and failed States. 
</p>
<p>21. Dheerujlall Seetulsingh, a member of the Human Rights Committee, referred to the 
</p>
<p>procedural protections set out in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights. The Human Rights Committee stated in its general comment No. 32 that 
</p>
<p>the provisions of article 14 applied to all court and tribunals, whether civilian or military, 
</p>
<p>and that article 14 did not prohibit military courts from trying civilians. It also stated that 
</p>
<p>such trials should be exceptional, that is, limited to cases where the State party could show 
</p>
<p>that resorting to such trials was necessary and justified by objective and serious reasons, 
</p>
<p>and where, with regard to the specific class of individuals and offences at issue, regular 
</p>
<p>civilian courts were unable to undertake the trials. 
</p>
<p>22. Mr. Seetulsingh pointed out that, in 1999, the Human Rights Committee had 
</p>
<p>recommended that Chile amend the law so as to restrict the jurisdiction of military courts to 
</p>
<p>try military personnel only for offences of an exclusively military nature.<footnote name="2">CCPR/C/79/Add.104. </footnote> Also in 1999, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>again regarding Chile, the Committee had recommended that human rights violations by 
</p>
<p>members of security forces should not fall within the purview of military tribunals. Mr. 
</p>
<p>Seetulsingh added that similar recommendations had been made for other states, including 
</p>
<p>the Central African Republic, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and the Russian Federation.  
</p>
<p>23. In <i>Estrella </i>v.<i> Uruguay</i> (communication No. 74/1980), the Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>found violations of article 14 because the accused was tried in camera, did not have the 
</p>
<p>assistance of counsel, and attempts were made to compel him to testify against himself.3 In 
</p>
<p><i>Mansaraj </i>v.<i> Sierra Leone</i> (communication No. 839/1998),4 the Committee stressed that 
</p>
<p>there should be the right to appeal to a higher tribunal from a military court. In <i>Kurbanova 
</i></p>
<p>v.<i> Tajikistan</i> (No. 1096/2002),<footnote name="5">CCPR/C/79/D/1096/2002. 
</footnote> the Committee found a violation of article 14 because the 
</p>
<p>State had not provided any information to justify the trial of a civilian before the Military 
</p>
<p>Chamber of the Supreme Court. In <i>Madani </i>v.<i> Algeria</i> (communication No. 1172/2003),6 
</p>
<p>the Committee found a violation of article 14 because the State party had not justified the 
</p>
<p>trial of a civilian before a military court. Two members of the Committee disagreed with 
</p>
<p>the views expressed in <i>Madani</i>, pointing out that article 14 was not concerned with the 
</p>
<p>nature of a tribunal as long as it was competent, independent and impartial. They argued 
</p>
<p>that the Covenant did not prohibit the use of military tribunals; in Algeria, military courts 
</p>
<p>had assigned jurisdiction established by law; the Committee could not replace the State to 
</p>
<p>adjudicate on the merits of alternatives to military courts, nor could it adjudicate on 
</p>
<p>exceptional circumstances to determine whether or not there was a public emergency. Mr. 
</p>
<p>Seetulsingh added, that in <i>Akwanga </i>v.<i> Cameroon</i> (No. 1813/2008),<footnote name="7">CCPR/C/101/D/1813/2008. </footnote> the Committee had 
</p>
<p>found a violation of article 14 when the State party did not justify why a civilian was tried 
</p>
<p>by a military court, and concluded that it did not need to examine whether the military 
</p>
<p>court, as a matter of fact, had afforded the full guarantees of article 14.  
</p>
<p>24. In concluding, Mr. Seetulsingh asked whether there was a danger that the 
</p>
<p>uncompromising approach by the Committee might lead to a situation where the views of 
</p>
<p>the Committee were more honoured in the breach than inobservance. He pointed out that 
</p>
<p>the grounds of the dissent in <i>Madani</i> were worth considering, since many States parties to 
</p>
<p>the Covenant remained unwilling to comply with the views of the Committee. 
</p>
<p>25. Seong-Phil Hong, a member of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
</p>
<p>explained that the Working Group had found that military tribunals were often used to deal 
</p>
<p>with political opposition groups, journalists and human rights defenders, and that placing of 
</p>
<p>civilians in preventive detention and the trial of civilians by military courts constituted a 
</p>
<p>violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>26. A military judge who is neither professionally nor culturally independent was likely 
</p>
<p>to produce an effect contrary to that afforded by guarantees of a fair trial. The Working 
</p>
<p>Group had determined that a court composed of military personnel could not be considered 
</p>
<p>&#8220;a competent, independent and impartial tribunal&#8221; under human rights law. 
</p>
<p>27. The Working Group had determined that military tribunals should only be 
</p>
<p>competent to try military personnel for military offences; if civilians and military personnel 
</p>
<p>had been indicted in a case, military tribunals should not try the military personnel 
</p>
<p>separately; military courts should not try military personnel if any of the victims are 
</p>
<p>civilians; military tribunals should not be competent to consider cases of rebellion, sedition 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 See Official Records of the General Assembly, Thirty-eighth Session, Supplement No. 40 (A/38/40), 
</p>
<p>annex XII. 
</p>

<p>or attacks against a democratic regime; and military tribunals should never be competent to 
</p>
<p>impose the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>28. The Working Group had found that justice by military courts often fell into the five 
</p>
<p>categories of arbitrariness identified in its methods of work: military forces often stop and 
</p>
<p>detain persons for a long time, and military judges often order continuing detention in the 
</p>
<p>absence of any legal basis; many detainees brought before military courts have been 
</p>
<p>detained simply for exercising a fundamental freedom, such as the freedom of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression, association, assembly or religion; military judges and prosecutors often do not 
</p>
<p>meet the fundamental requirements of independence and impartiality; procedures applied 
</p>
<p>by military courts often do not respect the basic guarantees for a fair trial; and individuals 
</p>
<p>brought before military courts are often foreign nationals, including migrants in an irregular 
</p>
<p>situation, asylum seekers and refugees captured by military forces at borders, at sea and in 
</p>
<p>airports.  
</p>
<p>29. Ronald Naluwairo, Senior Lecturer at the School of Law of Makerere University in 
</p>
<p>Uganda pointed out that the Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal 
</p>
<p>Assistance in Africa, adopted by the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights in 
</p>
<p>May 2003, addressed military courts. According to section L of the Principles and 
</p>
<p>Guidelines, the only purpose of military courts was to determine offences of a purely 
</p>
<p>military nature committed by military personnel; military courts were required to respect 
</p>
<p>the fair trial standards specified in the African Charter and in other parts of the Principles 
</p>
<p>and Guidelines; and military courts should not have jurisdiction over civilians.  
</p>
<p>30. Mr. Naluwairo discussed military justice in Uganda. Section 119 of the Uganda 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; Defence Force Act, 2005 gave wide jurisdiction over many categories of civilians. 
</p>
<p>These categories included civilians who served in the position of an officer or militant in 
</p>
<p>any force raised and maintained outside Uganda and commanded by an officer of the 
</p>
<p>Uganda Defence Forces; civilians who voluntarily accompanied any unit or other element 
</p>
<p>of the defence forces on service; civilians who served in the defence forces under 
</p>
<p>engagements by which they agreed to be subject to military law; civilians who aided or 
</p>
<p>abetted a person subject to military law in commission of a service offence; civilians found 
</p>
<p>in unlawful possession of arms, ammunition or equipment ordinarily being the monopoly of 
</p>
<p>the defence forces; and persons not subject to military law who had committed offences 
</p>
<p>while subject to military law.  
</p>
<p>31. Mr. Naluwairo noted that, in its concluding observations on the third periodic report 
</p>
<p>of Uganda, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights had recommended that 
</p>
<p>the State introduce legal measures that prohibited the trial of civilians by military courts. He 
</p>
<p>added that the Uganda Peoples&#8217; Defence Force Act, 2005 did not provide adequate 
</p>
<p>safeguards to guarantee the independence and impartiality of military courts; judge 
</p>
<p>advocates, prosecutors and members of the military courts were all appointed by the same 
</p>
<p>authority and serving military personnel. Mr. Naluwairo stated that there were no known 
</p>
<p>objective criteria for appointing, re-appointing, suspending or dismissing judge advocates 
</p>
<p>and members of the military courts; the law was silent on the security of tenure of judge 
</p>
<p>advocates, although, in practice, they were appointed to serve for a period of one year and 
</p>
<p>were eligible for re-appointment. He added that in <i>Uganda Law Society and Jackson 
</i></p>
<p><i>Karugaba v. Attorney General</i>, the Constitutional Court held that &#8220;it is not possible for 
</p>
<p>Uganda&#8217;s military courts to be independent and impartial given the current laws under 
</p>
<p>which they are constituted and the military structure within which they operate.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>32. With regard to the right to a public hearing, Mr. Naluwairo stated that the trials 
</p>
<p>conducted by the Division Courts Martial in barracks were difficult for members of the 
</p>
<p>public to attend. In addition, members of the public had been increasingly excluded from 
</p>
<p>attending hearings of General Courts Martial or at the Court Martial Appeals Court on 
</p>
<p>grounds of national security.  </p>


<p>33. Mr. Naluwairo explained that there was no general right to appeal decisions of 
</p>
<p>military courts to civilian courts. No appeal could be made from the Court Martial Appeals 
</p>
<p>Court to any other court, except in cases against convictions involving the death penal and 
</p>
<p>life imprisonment that had been upheld by the Court Martial Appeals Court.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Personal jurisdiction of military courts 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Vice-Chairperson of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
</p>
<p>Disappearances, Jasminka Dzumhur, referred to the Declaration on the Protection of All 
</p>
<p>Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and in particular to article 16, paragraph 2, which 
</p>
<p>stated that persons alleged to have committed any act of enforced disappearance were to be 
</p>
<p>tried &#8220;only by the competent ordinary courts in each State, and not by any other special 
</p>
<p>tribunal, in particular military courts.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>35. In its country visit reports, the Working Group had consistently recommended that<b> 
</b></p>
<p>the jurisdiction of civilian courts should be guaranteed in all matters relating to enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances and violations of human rights, regardless of whether the perpetrator was a 
</p>
<p>member of the military.8 
</p>
<p>36. In December 2010, the Working Group published a report on best practices on 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances in domestic criminal legislation, which highlighted best practices 
</p>
<p>in the area of legislation and provided that enforced disappearances could never be 
</p>
<p>considered an in-service offence and that military or other special courts had no jurisdiction 
</p>
<p>on enforced disappearances.9 
</p>
<p>37. Article 3 of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
</p>
<p>Disappearance required the adoption of preventative measures, which included not 
</p>
<p>establishing military jurisdiction over crimes of enforced disappearance. In its country 
</p>
<p>visits, the Working Group had found situations in which national legislation prohibited 
</p>
<p>military personnel from being subjected to the jurisdiction of ordinary courts.10 In these 
</p>
<p>cases, the Working Group had consistently emphasized how military jurisdiction could be a 
</p>
<p>factor of impunity for human rights violations, given that military courts lacked the 
</p>
<p>necessary independence and impartiality to address human rights violations.11  
</p>
<p>38. Ms. Dzumhur stated that the exclusion of the competence of military jurisdiction 
</p>
<p>was also essential during the investigation phase<b>. </b>In one country visit report, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group had recommended that the State should ensure that civilian prosecution services 
</p>
<p>conduct serious and prompt investigations into all complaints of human rights violations, 
</p>
<p>including enforced disappearances by military personnel.12  
</p>
<p>39. Ms. Dzumhur pointed out that article 16 (1) of the Declaration on the Protection of 
</p>
<p>All Persons from Enforced Disappearance provided that persons alleged to have committed 
</p>
<p>an enforced disappearance should be suspended from any official duties during the 
</p>
<p>investigation. 
</p>
<p>40. Eugene Fidell, Professor at Yale University Law School, stated that the goals of 
</p>
<p>military justice should be to advance national security by ensuring discipline in the military; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8 See for example A/HRC/19/58/Add.2, para. 98.  
</p>
<p> 9 A/HRC/16/48/Add.3, para. 62 (l). 
</p>
<p> 10 A/HRC/22/45/Add.2, para. 74. 
</p>
<p> 11 Ibid, paras. 37 and 74. See also A/HRC/19/58/Add.2, para. 38.  
</p>
<p> 12 A/HRC/19/58/Add.2, para. 98. Mexico subsequently abolished the military jurisdiction for the crime 
</p>
<p>of enforced disappearance. </p>


<p>to punish and deter crime fairly; to respect human rights; to support democratic institutions; 
</p>
<p>to minimize friction between the military and civilians; to engage and maintain public 
</p>
<p>confidence; and to encourage recruitment and the retention of personnel. In terms of public 
</p>
<p>confidence in military justice, he suggested that the &#8220;public&#8221; included voters, military 
</p>
<p>personnel, parents of conscripts or potential volunteers, the legal profession and scholarly 
</p>
<p>community, the legislature, the executive branch, civilian courts, the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>and the Human Rights Committee, regional human rights courts and bodies, and foreign 
</p>
<p>Governments and citizens.  
</p>
<p>41. According to Mr. Fidell, questions could arise with regard to who was subject to 
</p>
<p>military jurisdiction This would normally include active duty personnel, although it raised 
</p>
<p>the question of whether this included persons to be integrated into the armed forces prior to 
</p>
<p>enlistment. He also asked whether this would cover reservists or soldiers who had retired or 
</p>
<p>been recently discharged. He subsequently raised the issues of civilians in general, 
</p>
<p>explaining that questions had arisen, for example, about persons who had resisted 
</p>
<p>conscription and refused to join the military, government employees and contractors 
</p>
<p>working for the military, military dependents, and a wide range of persons with no specific 
</p>
<p>relation to the military.  
</p>
<p>42. While noting that the Human Rights Committee in its general comment No. 32 
</p>
<p>stated that civilians could, in exceptional situations, be tried in military courts, Mr. Fidell 
</p>
<p>made reference to a concurring opinion in <i>Musaev </i>v.<i> Uzbekistan</i> (communications Nos. 
</p>
<p>1914-16/2009), where two members of the Committee stated that &#8220;civilians or retired 
</p>
<p>military personnel&#8221; should never be tried before military courts and that the Committee 
</p>
<p>needed &#8220;to review the current position of the Committee, which considers the trial of 
</p>
<p>civilians in military courts to be compatible with the Covenant.13 
</p>
<p>43. According to Mr. Fidell, there were two basic approaches to determine whether 
</p>
<p>civilians should be tried in military courts: a statutory approach, which specified clear 
</p>
<p>dividing lines concerning who could and could not be tried by military courts; and an ad 
</p>
<p>hoc case-specific approach. The potential tests that could be applied in the latter approach 
</p>
<p>could include considerations of whether there would be an abuse of process in military 
</p>
<p>courts; whether the proportional loss of benefits of a civilian process would be outweighed 
</p>
<p>by the benefit of a military trial in certain circumstances; and whether a civilian forum was 
</p>
<p>available to try the civilian in a given case.  
</p>
<p>44. Mr. Fidell referred to <i>Martin </i>v.<i> United Kingdom</i>, in which the European Court of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights stated that: &#8220; 
</p>
<p> While it cannot be contended that the Convention [for the Protection of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and Fundamental Freedoms] absolutely excludes the jurisdiction of military 
</p>
<p>courts to try cases in which civilians are implicated, the existence of such 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction should be subjected to particularly careful scrutiny, since only in very 
</p>
<p>exceptional circumstances could the determination of criminal charges against 
</p>
<p>civilians in such courts be held to be compatible with Article 6&#8230; The power of 
</p>
<p>military criminal justice should not extend to civilians unless there are compelling 
</p>
<p>reasons justifying such a situation, and if so only on a clear and foreseeable legal 
</p>
<p>basis. The existence of such reasons must be substantiated in each specific case...  
</p>
<p>45. In <i>The Queen v.</i> <i>Wehmeier</i>, the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada articulated a 
</p>
<p>test for exercising military jurisdiction over civilians, stating:  
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>The issue is not whether the respondent should be prosecuted at all, but whether the 
</p>
<p>interest in having him tried in the military justice system is proportional to his loss 
</p>
<p>of rights when tried in that system. &#8230;. In the absence of such a justification, we can 
</p>
<p>only conclude that the effects of prosecuting the respondent in the military justice 
</p>
<p>system are disproportionate. As a result, the respondent&#8217;s prosecution is a breach of 
</p>
<p>the respondent&#8217;s right not to be deprived of his liberty, except in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>principles of fundamental justice contrary to section 7 of the Charter.  
</p>
<p>46. The Court went on to say that:  
</p>
<p>We should not be taken as saying that all prosecutions of civilians before the 
</p>
<p>military courts necessarily result in a breach of their rights under s. 7 of the Charter. 
</p>
<p>Each case stands to be decided on its own facts. We would say however that where a 
</p>
<p>civilian makes a s. 7 argument based on the loss of procedural rights before the 
</p>
<p>military courts, the onus shifts to the prosecution to justify proceeding before the 
</p>
<p>military courts as opposed to the civilian criminal courts. 
</p>
<p>47. Mr. Fidell questioned whether negative experiences in some States with trials of 
</p>
<p>civilians in military courts should preclude the trial of civilians in military courts under 
</p>
<p>special circumstances. If a State required a nexus or service connection for military 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction, he asked how it should apply to the prosecution of civilians in military courts. 
</p>
<p>He also asked whether jury membership and the right to counsel should be different when a 
</p>
<p>civilian is tried in military courts. 
</p>
<p>48. Said Benarbia, Director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the 
</p>
<p>International Commissioner of Jurists, addressed the use of military courts in the Middle 
</p>
<p>East and North Africa region. He stated that, in a number of States, military courts had 
</p>
<p>broad jurisdiction to try civilians as well as to try allegations of human rights violations by 
</p>
<p>military and security-related personnel. Military courts had often been a source of impunity 
</p>
<p>because they had been used to shield military and security personnel from accountability 
</p>
<p>for human rights violations. He referred to examples from Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco. In 
</p>
<p>Egypt<b>,</b> under article 5 of the Military Justice Law No. 25 of 1966, military courts had 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction over all crimes where one party, whether the victim or the defendant, was a 
</p>
<p>member of the military. Juveniles could also be tried before military courts under article 8. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, article 6 of the Military Justice Law authorized the President during a state of 
</p>
<p>emergency to refer any case to a military court.  
</p>
<p>49. The Constitutions of 2012 and 2014 both perpetuated military jurisdiction. The 2014 
</p>
<p>Constitution permitted the trial of civilians before military courts for crimes &#8220;that represent 
</p>
<p>a direct assault against military facilities, military barracks, or whatever falls under their 
</p>
<p>authority; stipulated military or border zones; its equipment, vehicles, weapons, 
</p>
<p>ammunition, documents, military secrets, public funds or military factories; crimes related 
</p>
<p>to conscription; or crimes that represent a direct assault against its officers or personnel 
</p>
<p>because of the performance of their duties&#8221;. A new decree by the President of Egypt, Law 
</p>
<p>No. 136 of 27 October 2014 &#8220;on securing and protecting public and vital facilities&#8221;, further 
</p>
<p>extended the jurisdiction of military courts to try civilians. The law placed all cases 
</p>
<p>involving attacks against &#8220;public and vital facilities&#8221; under military jurisdiction for the next 
</p>
<p>two years. 
</p>
<p>50. In Tunisia, following the toppling of President Ben Ali, Law No. 2011-69 amending 
</p>
<p>the Code of Military Justice significantly expanded the scope of the jurisdiction of military 
</p>
<p>tribunals. Article 8 of the Code provides that military tribunals have jurisdiction over 
</p>
<p>military personnel, students at military schools, retired officers when they are called to 
</p>
<p>serve, civilian employees of the army in times of war or during a state of war or when the 
</p>
<p>army or armed force is in an area where a state of emergency is declared, prisoners of war 
</p>
<p>and civilians as authors or co-authors of offences.  </p>


<p>51. Article 5 of the Code further provides that military courts have jurisdiction over both 
</p>
<p>ordinary crimes committed by military personnel and ordinary crimes committed against 
</p>
<p>military personnel. In addition, article 6 of the Code provides that &#8220;in the case of 
</p>
<p>prosecution for offences under ordinary law committed by military personnel while off-
</p>
<p>duty and where one party does not belong to the army, the prosecutor or the investigating 
</p>
<p>judge of ordinary courts should defer the charges against the member of the army to the 
</p>
<p>competent military court of first instance&#8221;. Mr. Benarbia added that military tribunals tried 
</p>
<p>the majority of cases involving human rights violations committed by security and military 
</p>
<p>personnel in Tunisia, including cases of unlawful killings and torture and other ill-treatment 
</p>
<p>committed before and in the context of the uprising from December 2010 to January 2011.  
</p>
<p>52. Mr. Benarbia explained that,<b> </b>in Morocco<b>, </b>the military courts of the armed forces, in 
</p>
<p>times of peace, had jurisdiction over all crimes and infractions concerning all members of 
</p>
<p>the military, including persons defined by Royal Decree No.1-56-270 as in &#8220;active service&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Jurisdiction also extended to all persons who, regardless of whether they are members of 
</p>
<p>the military, commit a crime against a member of the armed forces or equivalent bodies, or 
</p>
<p>who commit a crime involving one or more members of the armed forces as their 
</p>
<p>conspirators or accomplices.  
</p>
<p>53. Mr. Benarbia concluded by drawing attention to the recent positive developments in 
</p>
<p>Tunisia and Morocco. In Tunisia, the 2014 Constitution restricted the jurisdiction of 
</p>
<p>military courts to military offences. In Morocco, draft law No. 108-13 limiting the 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction of military courts to military personnel for military offences had been approved 
</p>
<p>by the first chamber of the Parliament. 
</p>
<p>54. In the discussion that followed, the representative of Canada stated that, in his 
</p>
<p>country, military courts had jurisdiction of over civilians only in limited circumstances, 
</p>
<p>where it was in the best interests of the individual. The representative of Egypt 
</p>
<p>acknowledged that the issue of trial of civilians had been problematic prior to 2011, but that 
</p>
<p>the situation had since improved. The representative of Cuba explained that military courts 
</p>
<p>were an integral part of the judicial system in Cuba, and that there had been human rights 
</p>
<p>violations at the Guantanamo military base. The delegate of Morocco explained that 
</p>
<p>Morocco had recently adopted a draft law that excluded civilians from military courts. 
</p>
<p>Professor Nikitin stated that the next step that needed to be taken was to integrate common 
</p>
<p>principles into the judicial systems of all States.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Subject matter jurisdiction of military courts 
</b></p>
<p>55. Christina Cerna, a former Principal Human Rights Specialist at the Inter-American 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights, stated that issues of military jurisdiction generally involved 
</p>
<p>two situations: questions relating to the treatment or trial of civilians by military courts; and 
</p>
<p>military court proceedings, or the lack thereof, against military officials charged with 
</p>
<p>serious violations of human rights.  
</p>
<p>56. Concerning the trial of civilians in military courts, she referred to the judgement of 
</p>
<p>25 November 2004 of the case <i>Lori Berenson </i>v.<i> Peru</i>, where the Inter-American Court of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights stated that military courts should not try civilians labelled as &#8220;terrorists&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>notwithstanding article 173 of the 1993 Constitution of Peru, which provided that military 
</p>
<p>courts could not try civilians except in cases of terrorism or treason. In the judgement of 30 
</p>
<p>May 1999 of the case <i>Castillo Petruzzi </i>v.<i> Peru</i>, the Court had held that &#8220;domestic laws that 
</p>
<p>place civilians under the jurisdiction of the military courts are a violation of the principles 
</p>
<p>of the American Convention&#8221;. In the judgements of 29 September 1999 of <i>Cesti Hurtado </i>v. </p>
<p><i>Peru</i>, and of 22 November 2005 of <i>Palamara Iribarne </i>v.<i> Chile, </i>the Court held that retired 
</p>
<p>military officials were civilians and could not be tried in military courts. On 30 December </p>


<p>2010, Chile published Law No. 20.477, which explicitly excluded civilians and minors 
</p>
<p>from the jurisdiction of military tribunals. 
</p>
<p>57. With regard to impunity for military personnel by either the action or inaction or 
</p>
<p>military courts, Ms. Cerna pointed out that, in the judgement of 14 March 2001 of <i>Barrios 
</i></p>
<p><i>Alto </i>v.<i> Peru</i>,14 the Inter-American Court of Human Rights held that all amnesty provisions 
</p>
<p>were incompatible with the American Convention on Human Rights because they were 
</p>
<p>intended to prevent the investigation and punishment of those responsible for serious 
</p>
<p>human rights violations such as torture, extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary execution and 
</p>
<p>forced disappearance. They were prohibited because they violated non-derogable rights 
</p>
<p>recognized by international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>58. Ms. Cerna also referred to a series of cases involving Mexico where the Inter-
</p>
<p>American Court of Human Rights had held that enforced disappearance, rape and other 
</p>
<p>serious violations of human rights should not be subject to military jurisdiction but rather 
</p>
<p>the jurisdiction of civilian courts.
15
</p>
<p> She explained that military jurisdiction had been 
</p>
<p>abolished in Argentina following the friendly settlement of 14 August 2006 of the case of 
</p>
<p><i>Rodolfo Correa Belisle </i>v.<i> Argentina</i>; the general trend in Latin America was indeed to 
</p>
<p>restrict or to abolish military jurisdiction, although some countries, such as Peru and 
</p>
<p>Colombia, were not moving in that direction. 
</p>
<p>59. The Chairperson of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances, Emmanuel Decaux, 
</p>
<p>stated that, in the eight years since the submission by the Subcommission on the Promotion 
</p>
<p>and Protection of Human Rights of its report to the Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>containing the draft principles governing the administration of justice through military 
</p>
<p>tribunals,16 there had been a number of developments. The European Court of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights had referred to the draft principles in its jurisprudence,17 the Committee had 
</p>
<p>undertaken work on military justice, and the death penalty debate has evolved.  
</p>
<p>60. Observing that the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
</p>
<p>Enforced Disappearance did not make reference to the subject of military justice, Mr. 
</p>
<p>Decaux stated that the Committee on Enforced Disappearances was preparing a statement 
</p>
<p>on this issue. In its concluding observations on Belgium, the Committee had recommended 
</p>
<p>that the State take the necessary legislative measures so that the crime of enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearance was not subject to military jurisdiction in a time of war.18 Mr. Decaux stated 
</p>
<p>that a number of States, such as France, had eliminated military jurisdiction in peacetime 
</p>
<p>but maintain it during a period of war. He emphasized that it was important to review 
</p>
<p>military codes of justice periodically, even if they were applicable only in time of war. 
</p>
<p>61. Regarding the trial of civilians by military courts, Mr. Decaux referred to draft 
</p>
<p>principle 5 and to the judgement of 31 May 2011 of the European Court of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>on <i>I&#231;en v. Turkey.</i> In this case, the Court affirmed that a tribunal composed exclusively of 
</p>
<p>military magistrates should only try civilians in exceptional circumstances. The Court 
</p>
<p>emphasized that military jurisdiction should not be used to try civilians unless there existed 
</p>
<p>a compelling reason to justify such a situation, and when there was a clear and predictable 
</p>
<p>legal basis for such action.  
</p>

</p>

<p>62. With regard to draft principle 9, which stated that serious violations of human rights 
</p>
<p>should not be judged by military courts, Mr. Decaux stated that this prohibition should 
</p>
<p>extend to the investigation of such crimes, with civilian authorities having this 
</p>
<p>responsibility. The Committee on Enforced Disappearances had recommended that the 
</p>
<p>investigation of the crime of enforced disappearance be undertaken by the competent 
</p>
<p>civilian authorities; and that a State party should adopt measures to ensure that the accused 
</p>
<p>is suspended from his functions during the proceedings.19 Mr. Decaux noted that there 
</p>
<p>could be exceptions to this during a foreign military operation where it is not possible for 
</p>
<p>an investigation to be undertaken by a civilian authority to gather evidence and identify 
</p>
<p>witnesses. In such circumstances, the military police, the gendarmerie or other military 
</p>
<p>authorities would have to undertake the investigation. Nevertheless, such an investigation 
</p>
<p>should be subject to an independent judicial authority to have credibility. 
</p>
<p>63. Mr. Decaux pointed out that draft principle 8 stated the jurisdiction of military 
</p>
<p>courts should be limited to offences of a strictly military nature committed by military 
</p>
<p>personnel. He explained that military jurisdiction should remain exceptional and apply only 
</p>
<p>to the requirements of military service. Such an exception could arise in a situation of 
</p>
<p>foreign deployment where the national court is prevented from exercising its jurisdiction 
</p>
<p>for practical reasons arising from the remoteness of the action, while the local court that 
</p>
<p>would be territorially competent was confronted with the issue of jurisdictional immunities. 
</p>
<p>He also noted that international humanitarian law also addressed the role of military 
</p>
<p>justice.
20
</p>
<p> While there may be justification for the trial of military personnel for military 
</p>
<p>offences by military courts, the same did not apply to appellate jurisdictions, which should 
</p>
<p>be civilian and integrated into the overall civilian judicial system, in accordance with draft 
</p>
<p>principle 17. 
</p>
<p>64. Colonel Patrick Gleeson (retired), Office of the Judge Advocate General of the 
</p>
<p>Canadian Armed Forces, addressed the issue of subject matter jurisdiction, and in particular 
</p>
<p>draft principles 8 and 9, which he stated reflected an unwarranted bias against military 
</p>
<p>courts in favour of civilian courts, and should therefore be either re-drafted or removed. He 
</p>
<p>argued that this bias was troubling and internally inconsistent with goals and objectives of 
</p>
<p>the draft principles.  
</p>
<p>65. Colonel Gleeson referred to the two core purposes of military justice codified in 
</p>
<p>Canadian Military Justice Legislation: (a) to promote the operational effectiveness of the 
</p>
<p>Canadian Forces by contributing to the maintenance of discipline, efficiency and morale; 
</p>
<p>and (b) to contribute to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe 
</p>
<p>society. He argued that this dual function made sense in a framework where the military 
</p>
<p>was intended to serve broader society and reflect societal values. It was with these dual 
</p>
<p>purposes in mind that draft principle 8 should be examined. Draft principle 8 concluded 
</p>
<p>implicitly that only uniquely military offences have an impact on military discipline, and 
</p>
<p>ultimately morale and operational effectiveness. Colonel Gleeson argued that this was 
</p>
<p>simply not the case. Acts of theft, assault or fraud, the use of or trafficking in illicit drugs, 
</p>
<p>for example, were all offences under civilian law. The fact that they happened to be civilian 
</p>
<p>offences, however, in no way diminished their impact on discipline. An assault on a peer in 
</p>
<p>a military unit had no less a corrosive effect on discipline and morale than an act of 
</p>
<p>insubordination. Colonel Gleeson argued that to allow a military justice system to deal with 
</p>
<p>insubordination but not the assault did not promote or advance the purposes of military 
</p>
<p>justice; it rather undermined it. In addition, military interests and more broadly national 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 19 CED/C/NLD/CO/1, para. 19; CED/C/PRY/CO1, para. 16. 
</p>
<p> 20 See Geneva Conventions relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, , arts. 84 and 102, and relative 
</p>
<p>to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, art. 66. 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>interests often required that military justice systems be in a position to demonstrate an 
</p>
<p>ability to prosecute offences, regardless of their nature, in a foreign State. This was 
</p>
<p>particularly true when discussing the substance of Status of Forces Agreements entered into 
</p>
<p>between sending and receiving States. 
</p>
<p>66. Colonel Gleeson further noted that the purpose and function of a military court, the 
</p>
<p>unique requirements of military discipline, the impact that civilian criminal offences had on 
</p>
<p>discipline and the practical requirements of nations deploying their forces on expeditionary 
</p>
<p>operations all highlighted the appropriateness of military justice systems being in a position 
</p>
<p>to exercise jurisdiction over civilian offences. 
</p>
<p>67. The extension of jurisdiction over civilian offences to military justice systems was 
</p>
<p>not an &#8220;either/or&#8221; proposition. According to Colonel Gleeson, the Canadian justice system 
</p>
<p>created a concurrent jurisdiction model between the military justice system and the civilian 
</p>
<p>justice system. This model essentially provided that military personnel were liable to be 
</p>
<p>charged and tried in either system for most civilian offences. There was no displacement of 
</p>
<p>civilian jurisdiction; rather, there was a layering on of an additional option when an 
</p>
<p>individual&#8217;s status brought them within the jurisdiction of the military justice system. This 
</p>
<p>concurrent jurisdiction had an extraterritorial effect, as defence legislation provided civilian 
</p>
<p>courts with jurisdiction over any person subject to military jurisdiction who commits an 
</p>
<p>offence outside the country.  
</p>
<p>68. With regard to draft principle 9, which provided that military courts should never 
</p>
<p>exercise jurisdiction in response to allegations of serious human rights violations, Colonel 
</p>
<p>Gleeson noted that two reasons for this position were advanced in the commentary on the 
</p>
<p>draft principles. The first was that the commission of serious human rights violations was 
</p>
<p>outside the scope of the duties performed by military personnel; and second, military 
</p>
<p>authorities might be tempted to cover up such cases. He pointed out that, while it was true 
</p>
<p>that the commission of serious human rights violations did not properly fall within the 
</p>
<p>scope of the duties of military personnel, neither did the commission of &#8220;ordinary&#8221;, crimes 
</p>
<p>such as murder, rape, fraud or theft.21  
</p>
<p>69. Colonel Gleeson also argued that, where a court, military or otherwise, was properly 
</p>
<p>constituted as described in draft principles 1, 2 and 12 to 15, there was no basis for a 
</p>
<p>universally applicable rule, which would deny military jurisdiction over serious human 
</p>
<p>rights violations. He maintained that the conclusion implied by draft principle 9, that 
</p>
<p>military justice systems worldwide could not be trusted to deal with these offences, ignored 
</p>
<p>the objective facts. He emphasized that such offences struck at the very core of military 
</p>
<p>discipline and operational effectiveness. Armed forces had a significant interest in seeing 
</p>
<p>that such breaches were dealt with fairly and expeditiously. It was important to recognize 
</p>
<p>that the failure of military commanders to respond quickly and effectively to allegations of 
</p>
<p>serious human rights violations raised potential questions of personal liability through the 
</p>
<p>doctrine of command responsibility.  
</p>
<p>70. The second reason advanced in the commentary to support draft principle 9 was that 
</p>
<p>military authorities might be tempted to cover up such cases. Draft principle 9 presumed 
</p>
<p>that any military justice process would be inherently sympathetic to members of the 
</p>
<p>military committing serious violations of human rights and be inclined to mitigate 
</p>
<p>punishment imposed on the accused. Colonel Gleeson maintained that such an approach in 
</p>
<p>a disciplined military force subject to appropriate civilian oversight was contrary to the 
</p>
<p>ethos of a professional military. He noted, however, that should military justice systems fail 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 21 See Michael Gibson, &#8220;International human rights law and the administration of justice through 
</p>
<p>military tribunals: preserving utility while precluding impunity&#8221;, <i>Journal of International</i> <i>Law and 
</i></p>
<p><i>International Relations</i>, vol. 4, No. 1 (2008), pp. 1-48. </p>


<p>in this regard and impunity concerns arise, a model of concurrent jurisdiction, which 
</p>
<p>existed in Canada, provided an important safeguard by ensuring recourse to the nation&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>civilian justice system.  
</p>
<p>71. Colonel Gleeson pointed out that these offences often arose in post-conflict States. 
</p>
<p>In such situations, military forces were frequently one of the few institutions operating that 
</p>
<p>had the resources and the organizational ability to effectively gather evidence and to bring 
</p>
<p>alleged perpetrators to justice. Adopting an international standard that provided no 
</p>
<p>circumstance in which military justice systems would be allowed to have jurisdiction over 
</p>
<p>allegations of serious human rights violations could have the unintended effect of 
</p>
<p>promoting impunity.  
</p>
<p>72. In the discussion, Mr. Seetulsingh stated that the focus should be on integrating 
</p>
<p>military justice into the overall justice system. Mr. Benarbia found it difficult to understand 
</p>
<p>why some ordinary offences, such as assault or rape, should be tried by military tribunals. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Cerna agreed that the draft principles were an important part of the discussion. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Main observations and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The importance of the independence, impartiality and competence of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>judiciary in military justice was recognized by all experts and participants. In a 
</b></p>
<p><b>number of presentations, it was noted that, in some States, issues of command 
</b></p>
<p><b>interference and lack of institutional independence were still a source of concern. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>States where these issues were present, appropriate legislative and institutional 
</b></p>
<p><b>reform should be undertaken.</b>  
</p>
<p>74. The experts&#8217; presentations showed that<b>, in some States, there were significant 
</b></p>
<p><b>gaps in implementing the right to a fair trial. Questions were raised concerning the 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice of summary proceedings for lesser offences, which in some States did not 
</b></p>
<p><b>allow for the presence of legal counsel or the right of appeal. States were invited to 
</b></p>
<p><b>take appropriate measures to ensure that the right to fair trial in military tribunals 
</b></p>
<p><b>was in full conformity with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Concerning personal jurisdiction of military tribunals, the Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Committee had addressed this subject in its general comment No. 32, in which it 
</b></p>
<p><b>stated that civilians should not be subject to the jurisdiction of military courts except 
</b></p>
<p><b>in exceptional circumstances. The European Court of Human Rights had taken a 
</b></p>
<p><b>similar position. It was also noted that international humanitarian law also provided 
</b></p>
<p><b>limited circumstances for the trial of civilians in military courts. In some 
</b></p>
<p><b>presentations, it was noted that some States tried civilians accompanying the military 
</b></p>
<p><b>on overseas deployments, although it often depended on the specific situation.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>With regard to subject matter jurisdiction, there was a difference of views 
</b></p>
<p><b>among the experts. Some argued that military jurisdiction should be set aside in 
</b></p>
<p><b>favour of civilian courts in cases where allegations of serious human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p><b>were made against military personnel and that military jurisdiction should be limited 
</b></p>
<p><b>to military offences, citing recommendations made by the Human Rights Committee 
</b></p>
<p><b>and some special procedures. This view was, however, challenged by others at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>expert consultation, who argued that, if a military tribunal was independent, 
</b></p>
<p><b>impartial and competent, such crimes could be judged.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Given the detailed nature of the subject of military justice, and how human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights concerns could arise relative to many aspects of military jurisdiction, States 
</b></p>
<p><b>were invited to request technical assistance and advisory services from OHCHR. 
</b></p>
<p><b>    </b></p>
