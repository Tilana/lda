<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The Government of the United Kingdom welcomes this opportunity to respond to 
the report of the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, following their 
visit to this country in October 2012.    
</p>
<p>2. Britain is a diverse and tolerant country.  We have long been a country of inward 
and outward migration, but the post-war immigration of people, particularly from the 
Caribbean, Africa and Asia, and also more recently from other parts of the European Union, 
means that we are now a highly diverse society.  According to the 2011 census, some 14% 
of the population of England and Wales identify as belonging to an ethnic minority, but, as 
the Working Group&#8217;s report notes, the pattern varies widely across the country. London has 
the most diverse population, with some 18.5% identifying as Asian or Asian British and 
13.3% as Black African, Black Caribbean or Black British, compared to 2.3 % and 0.6% 
respectively in Wales.  
</p>
<p>3. Evidence shows that the vast majority of people in the UK believe that people from 
different backgrounds get along well with each other in their local area, and this is 
consistent across all major ethnic groups. In the months immediately before the Working 
Group&#8217;s visit to the UK, three great celebrations took place in our country &#8211; the Diamond 
Jubilee of HM the Queen, the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games. These provided 
an extraordinary opportunity for people across the UK to come together, underlining the 
fact that the UK is a place where people from all backgrounds have built a shared identity 
based on shared values. The Working Group&#8217;s report rightly notes the contribution and 
</p>
<p>sacrifice of thousands of men and women from across the Commonwealth, including from 
Africa and the Caribbean, in the two world wars.   In 2014, we will mark the centenary of 
the start of the First World War, and our commemorations will include the role of soldiers 
and civilians from across the Commonwealth.  Members of the UK&#8217;s minority 
</p>
<p>communities, including the many different communities of African descent, have made an 
enormous contribution to the UK&#8217;s social, economic and cultural life. There are many 
</p>
<p>examples of people from ethnic minorities in the UK pursuing highly successful business 
careers.   
</p>
<p>4. We therefore have many cohesive and successful communities, but we know that 
this is not the case everywhere and there are still enduring problems in many 
neighbourhoods. We are determined to give everyone the opportunity to prosper, breaking 
down barriers to social mobility. This will benefit all members of our communities, 
including ethnic minorities, but we must also recognise that every local community is 
different and so we need local leadership, not central prescription, if we are to promote 
strong and prosperous communities.   
</p>
<p>5. Our approach to tackling the challenges posed by racial inequality and 
discrimination in England is therefore not based on singling out individual ethnic groups, 
but instead on promoting social and economic Integration with support from our Equality 
Strategy and Social Mobility Strategy. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales 
and Northern Ireland are pursuing analogous policies appropriate to their own 
circumstances. 
</p>
<p>6. In February 2012, the UK Government published a paper setting out its approach to 
integration: Creating the Conditions for Integration.1 In this paper, the Government makes 
clear that it sees integration as the process by which millions of individuals come together 
</p>
<p>  
 1 www.gov.uk/government/publications/creating-the-conditions-for-a-more-integrated-society </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>around common values, aspirations and interests. It is these shared legal and social norms, 
such as respect and equality, which provide the foundation for society. The Government is 
clear that integration means everyone playing a full part in local and national life, and this 
requires a society which is fair, open and equal to all; one which challenges all forms of 
extremism and intolerance; and one which widens access to jobs and training and 
encourages educational aspiration and enterprise. There is therefore a clear link to our aim 
of improving social mobility and race equality.  
</p>
<p>7. While we make clear that integration is predominantly a local issue, we also set out 
actions for Government, including initiatives to celebrate shared values, promote a strong 
sense of personal and social responsibility, improve social mobility, encourage 
participation, and challenge all forms of extremism and intolerance. Examples of 
Government action include support for Youth United&#8217;s Supporting Inclusion Programme2 
and the Near Neighbours Programme3. 
</p>
<p>8. The Government has also further developed thinking on the relationship between 
race and socio-economic disadvantage.  We believe it is a mistake to see inequalities only 
in terms of race and ethnic origin, since socio-economic status and poverty affect people&#8217;s 
chances in life, regardless of racial or ethnic background.  We have therefore made a 
deliberate shift away from interventions specifically on the basis of race or ethnicity, and 
towards increasing the impact of mainstream policies and programmes for disadvantaged 
communities, in disadvantaged areas.  That also means that the Working Group&#8217;s approach 
and its recommendations, focusing on people whose ancestors came from one particular 
geographical area, are of limited relevance to the challenges facing the UK.  
</p>
<p>9. Our responses in some of the areas covered in the Working Group report are set out 
below.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Employment 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Government&#8217;s strategy for increasing ethnic minority employment and 
participation in the labour market is based around mainstreaming opportunity through 
locally delivered flexible provision.  The help and services we deliver, through Jobcentre 
Plus and through Work Programme providers, are designed to allow flexibility to support 
each individual jobseeker, rather than treat people according to their ethnic origin.  The 
Government does not dictate from the centre what provision is required in each area or for 
each provider or customer group.  Local autonomy and flexibility has replaced the &#8220;one-
size-fits-all&#8221; approach that has dogged previous employment schemes.   
</p>
<p>11. We are pleased to note that the Working Group welcomes the contributions of the 
Department for Work and Pensions&#8217; Ethnic Minority Employment Stakeholder Group, 
</p>
<p>which shares its insight, advice and expertise with policy-makers to help the Government in 
developing and implementing policies to tackle some of the persistent challenges that 
remain.   
</p>
<p>12. However, we regret that some of the statistical information contained in the report is 
out of date, inaccurate or misleading.  The rate of unemployment for ethnic minorities in 
general is in fact 5.9% pts above the national average (rather than 11.7% as stated in the 
Working Group&#8217;s report).  The report&#8217;s use of percentages of black or black British people 
</p>
<p>not in full-time education who are out of work is particularly misleading, because of the 
</p>
<p>  
 2 www.gov.uk/government/news/volunteer-push-will-create-10-000-youth-group-places-for-young-
</p>
<p>people 
 3 www.gov.uk/government/news/launch-of-near-neighbours-programme   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>relatively high proportion of ethnic minorities who are in full-time education. The UK 
authorities normally refer to the proportion of the population who are not in full-time 
education or employment.  According to latest available figures for Quarter 4 2012, 23.3% 
of black or black British young people and 16.2% of mixed ethnic background young 
people are not in full-time education or employment.   In February 2013, of the total 
number of people claiming job-seekers allowance, 0.91% were mixed white and black 
Caribbean, 0.26% were mixed white and black African, 2.84% were black 
British/Caribbean, 2.94% were black British/African and 0.74% were black British other, 
totalling 7.69% of the total job-seekers allowance claimants.   
</p>
<p>13. The Department for Work and Pensions is also leading across Government on a 
number of initiatives to promote equality and increase diversity at all levels of the Civil 
Service.  For example, we have developed a new Positive Action Pathway development 
programme which aims to take positive action to 'level the playing field' for disabled, 
minority ethnic and female employees.  It aims to equip participants with the skills and 
confidence to achieve career progression and to realise their potential.  
</p>
<p>14. Ethnic minority businesses in the UK are highly successful and contribute up to &#163;25 
billion to the economy, and there are particularly high aspirations to start-up in business 
among black African and black Caribbean groups. However, a Government-commissioned 
report on access to finance by ethnic minority business, which was launched by the Deputy 
Prime Minister in July 2013, shows that, although the banking industry is working hard to 
ensure ethnic minority businesses have access to finance, there is more to be done to help 
under-represented groups reach their goals.4 The Government has therefore encouraged the 
banking industry to take steps to support ethnic minority entrepreneurs. The British 
Bankers&#8217; Association has agreed to support a range of initiatives in this area to improve the 
access to finance for ethnic minority business groups.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Education 
</b></p>
<p>15. Educational attainment gaps for ethnic minority pupils have narrowed over the past 
ten years. Although the data on educational attainment quoted in the Working Group report 
are from 2010/11, more recent figures from 2011/12 show a similar trend. This is a 
complex issue and the under-performance of a specific ethnic group may be due to a 
combination of factors including socio-economic factors, parents&#8217; education, behaviour and 
attendance. Particular combinations of pupil characteristics can indicate that a child is 
especially vulnerable.  As already outlined, the Government&#8217;s approach is therefore to 
</p>
<p>move away from treating pupils based on ethnicity or &#8216;equality strands&#8217; who get special 
treatment. Instead we have developed frameworks that help create fairness and 
opportunities for all pupils.  This includes measures to improve literacy and numeracy, and 
the quality of teaching; targeting resource (some &#163;2.5 billion a year by 2014/15) through the 
Pupil Premium to raise disadvantaged pupils&#8217; attainment and help break the link between 
</p>
<p>family background and educational achievement; and overhauling the Special Educational 
Needs system so that children&#8217;s needs are identified and addressed early. The Government 
is also introducing radical reforms to improve the quality of alternative provision for 
excluded pupils. 
</p>
<p>16. Our approach to bullying, including racist bullying which is comparable to all other 
forms of bullying, provides a balance of legal requirements; reforms to give teachers 
greater powers to tackle disruptive behaviour and bullying, and a clear remit for the Office 
for Standards in Education (Ofsted) to hold schools to account. All schools, including 
</p>
<p>  
 4 www.gov.uk/government/publications/ethnic-minority-businesses-and-access-to-finance </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>academies, are required to have a behaviour policy, which must include measures to 
prevent all forms of bullying among pupils. The behaviour policy should make it clear what 
disciplinary sanctions will be used if a pupil misbehaves. Teachers can search pupils for 
banned items, delete inappropriate images or files on electronic devices, including mobile 
phones, issue same-day detentions and use reasonable force when necessary. Ofsted now 
clearly holds schools to account on how well they deal with behaviour and bullying. Since 
2012, inspectors have had to consider pupils&#8217; freedom from bullying, harassment and 
discrimination. We are also providing over &#163;4 million of funding over two years from 2013 
to four anti-bullying organisations through the Voluntary Sector Community Enterprise 
awards. 
</p>
<p>17. The Government believes that good behaviour in the classroom is essential so that 
teachers can teach effectively and all pupils can achieve to the best of their abilities.  
Headteachers must be able to set and enforce behaviour policies, and this includes having 
the option of excluding pupils where this is warranted.   
</p>
<p>18. New statutory guidance on exclusion, issued by the Department for Education in 
September 2012, emphasises the need for all exclusions to be legal, reasonable and fair; the 
importance of schools adhering to their responsibilities under equalities legislation; and the 
value of early intervention to address behavioural issues before they escalate to the point 
that exclusion becomes necessary.  The Government has also refocused school inspection 
arrangements so that stronger emphasis is given to the evaluation of behaviour in schools, 
including schools&#8217; use of exclusion and differential rates of exclusion for groups of pupils. 
</p>
<p>19. The issues that underlie the disparities seen in exclusion rates for different groups of 
pupils, including those of Black African and Black Caribbean origin, are complex, 
longstanding and often inseparable from those that lead to other educational inequalities, 
including academic achievement.  The Government believes that removing the barriers to 
children engaging with education is fundamental to improving behaviour, attendance and 
academic attainment.  It is introducing wide ranging reforms to improve the quality of 
education that all pupils receive; strengthen support for children with additional needs; and 
address the causes of exclusion.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Health 
</b></p>
<p>20. Tackling health inequalities is a Government priority, part of a wider focus on 
fairness and social justice. Everyone should have the same opportunities to lead a healthy 
life, no matter where they live or who they are. As well as helping people live longer, 
healthier and more fulfilling lives, we aim to improve the health of the poorest fastest. 
</p>
<p>21. Within a broad strategy to tackle health inequalities across the country, we are 
addressing the health needs of the most vulnerable people through the Inclusion Health 
programme, which will focus on improving access and outcomes for vulnerable groups. 
The early focus of work is on groups such as the homeless who have the poorest health 
outcomes.  We are committed to reducing health inequalities by tackling the differences in 
access to, and outcomes of, National Health Service treatment; addressing the wider, social 
causes of ill health and early death; and improving individual healthy lifestyles. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Employment in the criminal justice system 
</b></p>
<p>22. Equality and diversity are vitally important in the context of policing our ever more 
diverse communities.  These are not secondary issues; improved diversity in the police is 
vital in the fight against crime. The Government recognises that the police have made </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>significant progress on equality and diversity, but it is essential that more and faster 
progress is made in these areas. 
</p>
<p>23. Change is being driven locally. Each police force manages its own recruitment 
process, deciding when and how many officers to recruit.  All candidates to join the police 
are judged according to a nationally standardised recruitment and selection process. 
National standards are used when forces carry out the initial sift of applicants and when 
candidates attend a standardised entrance assessment. The local accountability provided by 
Police and Crime Commissioners will ensure that public priorities around crime and 
community safety are acted upon, victims are consulted, and the needs of the most 
vulnerable groups and individuals are heard and understood. 
</p>
<p>24. As at 31 March 2013, there were 6,537 minority ethnic police officers in England 
and Wales, down 127 from 6,664 at 31 March 2012. The proportion of black and minority 
ethnic officers has remained constant at 5%. This is in the context of an overall decrease of 
full-time equivalent police officers in the 43 police forces of England and Wales as at 31 
March 2013 to 129,956, a decrease of 3.1% or 4,145 officers compared to a year earlier. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Stop and search 
</b></p>
<p>25. In March 2011, the Government removed the national requirement for police forces 
in England and Wales to record all &#8216;stops&#8217;.  Since then, police forces and police authorities 
</p>
<p>(and, since January 2012, the Mayor of London&#8217;s Office for Policing and Crime) have been 
free to decide, in consultation with their local communities, whether to continue monitoring 
these encounters locally, where community concerns exist around disproportionality.  
These local decisions will help the police strike the right balance between the necessary 
paperwork that allows appropriate public accountability, and wasteful bureaucracy.  We 
expect individual forces to monitor the situation in their areas and keep this under review. 
</p>
<p>26. Statistical data on stop and search powers are released in two main documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) the &#8216;Police Powers and Procedures&#8217; annual statistical bulletin, last published 
in April 2012,  which includes some data on the ethnic breakdown of all stop and searches 
</p>
<p> (b) the biennial publication &#8216;Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System&#8217;, 
last published on 20 October 2011, which includes more detailed information on the 
number and rates of stop and search by ethnic group and police force area, and also on the 
number of resultant arrests. 
</p>
<p>27. While the data contained in the above publication do highlight areas in which there 
are differences, we do not believe that these should automatically be ascribed to 
discrimination, as there are other factors which may play a part in accounting for them. 
</p>
<p>28. The Government is clear that the powers of stop and search are a vital tool to fight 
crime and protect the public. However, while this remains the position, we are aware of 
concerns as to whether these powers are being used both effectively and fairly. As a result, 
the Government is currently reviewing stop and search and has launched a 12 week a public 
consultation on the use of these powers, which will close on 24 September 2013. We will 
consider the responses to the consultation and will also take into account other recently 
published reports on these powers.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Hate crime 
</b></p>
<p>29. The United Kingdom has one of the strongest legislative frameworks in the world to 
protect individuals and communities from hostility, violence and bigotry, and this </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>framework is kept under review to ensure it remains effective and appropriate in the face of 
new challenges. 
</p>
<p>30. To reflect the seriousness of hate crime there is specific legislation to protect people 
from racist abuse and other forms of hate crime including: 
</p>
<p>(a) stirring up hatred on the grounds of race and religion  
</p>
<p>(b) racially and religiously aggravated offences, which carry higher maximum 
sentence penalties 
</p>
<p>(c) enhanced sentencing for offences where a court is satisfied that any offence 
was motivated by hostility towards the victim 
</p>
<p>(d) sentence starting points of 30 years imprisonment for murders that are 
racially or religiously aggravated (and other hate crimes) where the court is considering the 
seriousness of an offence 
</p>
<p>(e) racist or indecent chanting at a designated football match. 
</p>
<p>31. Whilst the United Kingdom has a relatively high level of hate crime reporting, the 
Government recognises that many people still do not report such offences to authorities. It 
is committed to developing a better understanding of hate crime by improving the evidence 
base, including on victims and criminal justice system outcomes. The Government has 
published findings from the combined 2009/10 and 2010/11 British Crime Survey (now the 
Crime Survey for England and Wales5 ), which estimates that on average there are 260,000 
incidents of hate crime each year, with racist hate crime as the most commonly committed 
crime accounting for an estimated 136,000 incidents on average each year. These findings 
highlight the importance of continuing our work to build victim confidence to report 
incidents to the police and to challenge attitudes.  
</p>
<p>32. The Government made a commitment to increase the recording of hate crimes and as 
of April 2011, police forces started formal collection of data on hate crimes6. Figures from 
this collection will be published annually, as Official Statistics, and will help Police and 
Crime Commissioners, police forces and local areas to focus resources where they are 
needed most. 
</p>
<p>33. The Government has also supported the work of the Association of Chief Police 
Officers to develop the online reporting and information tool, True Vision7. True Vision 
offers a range of facilities for victims, support groups and professionals, including printable 
materials and policy documents. It provides the ability to report hate crime online, 
including anonymously when the victim is unwilling to give details to the police. 
</p>
<p>34. In March 2012, the UK Government published Challenge it, Report it, Stop it setting 
out its plan to tackle hate crime over three years, until 2015.8 The plan brings together the 
work of a wide range of departments and agencies to: prevent hate crime happening in the 
first place; increase reporting and victims&#8217; access to support; and improve the operational 
</p>
<p>response to hate crimes. The plan includes specific actions to address racial hatred and 
promotes early intervention as a key part of our approach to challenge attitudes. 
</p>
<p>35. As part of its objectives to increase reporting and reduce the incidence of hate crime, 
the UK Government has also allocated around &#163;2.1 million of funding over three years to a 
range of local level initiatives which are designed to increase victim confidence, encourage

</b></p>
<p>reporting and improve the services offered to victims. Good practice from these projects 
will be disseminated more widely.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Media 
</b></p>
<p>36. As the Working Group&#8217;s report notes, the United Kingdom has a Press Complaints 
Commission which receives complaints about press coverage and looks at these in light of 
the Editors Code of Practice.  In light of the Leveson Report, the Government is currently 
considering reform of this system of press regulation, with the intention of making changes 
to improve standards, as well as enforcement of those standards.  The Editors Code of 
Practice is an ethical code for the press to follow in the gathering and reporting of the news. 
However, importantly, it does not extend to the regulation of press content itself.  This is 
because the UK values the contribution a free press makes to the democratic functioning of 
the nation. 
</p>
<p>37. The Government is committed to ensuring that equality is promoted in the media 
and creative industries in line with duties set out in legislation including the Equality Act 
and Communications Act. The Creative Diversity Network facilitates members to work 
together to promote, celebrate and share good practice across the industry.  Members 
include BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky and Pact. Promoting diversity is also a key priority for 
Pact, which represents independent television producers, supporting training and skills in 
the independent sector.  Through Pact&#8217;s diversity department, advice is offered to 
independent production companies on developing their approach to diversity, ranging from 
recruitment of staff casting, improving diversity in content (on-screen) and developing 
company diversity policies and training. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Liverpool 
</b></p>
<p>38. We are pleased that some members of the Working Group visited the city of 
Liverpool to see how integration and equality policies work at the local level.  As they will 
have seen, Liverpool has many examples of positive working and initiatives with its black 
communities. We are pleased to note that a number of these are mentioned by the Working 
Group, but there are others that were not fully reflected in their report.   
</p>
<p>39. Liverpool has worked hard to raise awareness and understanding around historical 
and contemporary issues affecting people of African descent.  The International Slavery 
Museum in Liverpool opened in August 2007, when the UK commemorated the 
bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade in the British Empire, and by March 2010 had 
welcomed its millionth visitor. The museum is the only one of its kind look at aspects of 
historical and contemporary slavery as well as being an international hub for resources on 
human rights issues. The abolition of the slave trade was a key part of Liverpool&#8217;s 2008 
Capital of Culture Programme and a range of projects were funded under the World in One 
City programme.  As part of its cultural investment programme, the City Council continues 
to fund a wide range of community groups which have focussed on the slave trade and/or 
celebrated diversity.  
</p>
<p>40. In addition to Black History Month, Liverpool City Council supports the annual 
Black Achievers Awards to celebrate positive role models and also has given Freedom of 
The City to notable members of the black community.  Over a long period, Liverpool City 
Council&#8217;s community resource funding programme has supported a number of 
</p>
<p>organisations working within the black community. Around 20% of organisations funded 
under the &#8216;Stronger Communities&#8217; theme have a specific ethnic minority focus, and a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>September 2012 survey showed that over 41% of service users were from non-white/non-
British communities. 
</p>
<p>41. In addition, Liverpool City Council provides grant funding and support for Africa 
Oy&#233;, the UK's largest free celebration of African music and culture, which counters 
negative stereotypes of Africa by highlighting the continent&#8217;s great range of cultures, foods, 
</p>
<p>music and artists.

<p><b> II. Conclusion  
</b></p>
<p>43. The Government of the United Kingdom values its dialogue with the United Nations 
on human rights issues through its various mechanisms. In particular, a number of the 
issues raised by the Working Group are similar to those addressed by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination in their 2011 Concluding Observations on the UK. 
The UK Government submitted an interim report to CERD earlier this year and is due to 
submit its next full report under the International Convention for the Elimination of all 
forms of Racial Discrimination in 2014. The Government of the United Kingdom looks 
forward to continuing its dialogue with CERD and other UN bodies in the coming years.
