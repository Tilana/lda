<p> The consultation was organized to solicit views of leading scholars and practitioners 
in this field in preparation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s annual thematic report to the 
seventeenth session of the Human Rights Council in June 2011. At this meeting, the experts 
from a variety of sectors discussed ways and means to realize the right to an effective 
remedy for trafficked persons, focusing on the normative framework, content and scope of 
this right, as well as States&#8217; responses and concrete strategies to implement it at the national 
level. The participants agreed, inter alia, that access to information, legal assistance 
including free legal aid, and regularization of their residence status while seeking remedies, 
were preconditions for trafficked persons to exercise their right to an effective remedy. 
Furthermore, regularization of trafficked persons&#8217; residence status may in itself be a form 
of remedy in some circumstances. The participants also stressed the importance of properly 
identifying trafficked persons as such from the moment they suffered harms and applying 
the principle of non-criminalization and non-prosecution of trafficked persons as the 
fundamental first step in providing remedies to trafficked persons.

</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 22 and 23 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur convened a consultation1 on 
the right to an effective remedy for trafficked persons with leading scholars and 
practitioners in this field to solicit their views and experiences in preparation of her report 
to the Human Rights Council in June 2011 on the same theme. 
</p>
<p>2. The consultation brought together 20 anti-trafficking experts from academia, civil 
society, regional and international organizations and United Nations agencies2 to: build 
thematic expertise on issues related to the right to an effective remedy for trafficked 
persons; identify key concerns, protection gaps, good practices and lessons learned from 
experiences and case studies; and formulate recommendations to States and other actors 
aimed at full implementation of this right. 
</p>
<p>3. This initiative of the Special Rapporteur was well-received by the participants, who 
agreed that enhanced efforts to realize the right to an effective remedy were of crucial 
importance to the protection and promotion of the human rights of trafficked persons. In 
addition, participants qualified it as necessary and timely in so far as there had to date been 
limited research and discussion on the right to an effective remedy as it pertained to 
trafficked persons in theory and practice. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p>4. In the exercise of her mandate, the Special Rapporteur has found that, despite the 
fundamental nature of the right to an effective remedy, in practice there remains a large gap 
between legal provisions and their implementation in relation to trafficked persons. She has 
received reports that trafficked persons are frequently left without either substantive 
remedies or the support necessary to access such remedies and, as a result, are often 
exposed to further human rights violations and the risk of being re-trafficked. 
</p>
<p>5. In response, the Special Rapporteur intends to focus her subsequent report to the 
Human Rights Council in 2011 on the right to an effective remedy for trafficked persons &#8211; 
an issue on which she considers further conceptual clarification and recommendations 
could be of added value to States in implementing their response to trafficking in persons. It 
is further her hope that the report will also be able to provide support and guidance to non-
State practitioners working on issues related to effective remedies in the context of 
trafficking in persons, including lawyers, human rights defenders, academics and 
representatives of organizations implementing programmes and projects in this field. 
</p>
<p>6. To maximize the range of inputs and provide a solid basis for formulating practical 
recommendations, invited experts were drawn from a range of organizations, regions and 
subsectors within the anti-trafficking movement. Two background papers were circulated 
among participants ahead of the consultation: the first paper consisted of an overview and 
analysis of international law relating to the right to an effective remedy for victims of 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>rights in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme Regional Centre for Europe 
and the Commonwealth of Independent States in Bratislava.

</p>
<p>trafficking in persons;3 the second background paper was designed to complement the first 
by providing an overview of States&#8217; responses aimed at implementing this right, as well as 
information on concrete strategies and interventions that have demonstrated or promise to 
demonstrate measurable results. The participants were also asked to comment on a set of 
draft basic principles on the right to a remedy for victims of trafficking annexed to the first 
background paper. All the background documents for the consultation, including the draft 
basic principles which reflect the participants&#8217; comments received at the consultation, are 
available at: 
http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/trafficking/Bratislava_consultation_nov2010.htm. 
</p>
<p>7. On a terminological note, the term &#8220;trafficked person(s)&#8221; is used throughout this 
report to reflect the fact that the right to an effective remedy is held inherently by all such 
persons regardless of whether they have been identified/formally recognized as such. When 
referring to criminal proceedings, however, the term &#8220;victim(s) of trafficking in persons&#8221; is 
used to reflect that, when involved in such proceedings, the definition and principles 
relating to victims of crime4 apply alongside those relating to victims of human rights 
violations. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of discussions 
</b></p>
<p>8. The consultation was officially opened by the Deputy Director of the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) Regional Centre for Europe and the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, Annie Demirjan, who provided an overview of UNDP efforts to 
address trafficking in persons within the region, notably with regard to root causes related 
to social exclusion. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, then delivered an opening remark focused on the objectives, structure 
and modalities of the consultation. 
</p>
<p>10. The agenda5 of the consultation was divided into three main sessions, namely: (1) 
framework, content and scope; (2) State responses; and (3) Concrete strategies and 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>11. As set out in the background paper, the right to an effective remedy entails both 
substantive and procedural obligations for States. International human rights standards 
make clear that the substantive obligations to provide for an effective remedy to victims of 
gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law include ensuring equal and effective access to justice and prompt and 
adequate reparation for harm suffered. According to these standards, reparation covers: 
restitution, including rehabilitation; compensation; satisfaction and guarantees of non-

</p>
<p> 4 The 1985 Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power defines 
&#8220;victims of crime&#8221; as &#8220;persons who, individually or collectively, have suffered harm, including 
physical or mental injury, emotional suffering, economic loss or substantial impairment of their 
fundamental rights, through acts or omissions that are in violation of criminal laws operative within 
Member States &#8230; regardless of whether the perpetrator is identified, apprehended, prosecuted or 
convicted&#8221;.

<p>repetition.6 The procedural obligations on States may be conceived as the range of measures 
needed to guarantee access to an effective remedy. For practical purposes, meanwhile, the 
agenda was structured so as to address the identified issues in each of the main sessions 
under the following subheadings: Restitution; rehabilitation/recovery; compensation; and 
cross-cutting issues, including access to information, legal and other assistance and 
possibilities of residence. 
</p>
<p><b> A.  Session 1: Framework, content and scope 
</b></p>
<p>12. At this session, presentations were made on: the normative framework of the right to 
an effective remedy under international law; what this right entails as it pertains to 
trafficking in persons in particular; and cross-cutting issues in this regard.7 
</p>
<p>13. The first presentation provided an overview of the normative framework under 
international human rights treaties and soft law instruments. The second presentation 
sought to identify the integral components of the right to an effective remedy as it pertains 
to trafficked persons, by addressing the following three overarching questions: when and 
how does the right to a remedy arise; who is responsible for providing remedies; and what 
should be provided by way of remedy. The third presentation explored a number of issues 
arising out of the procedural obligations to guarantee access to an effective remedy, 
including: access to information; access to legal and other assistance; and possibilities of 
residence. 
</p>
<p>14. The participants were then asked to share their views regarding the content and 
scope of this right in the context of trafficking in persons, with a particular focus on its 
application in practice and the respective responsibilities and roles of duty bearers and other 
stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>15. It emerged from these discussions that there has been, and continues to be, a lack of 
clarity regarding the content and scope of the right to an effective remedy in the context of 
trafficking in persons. This appeared to be related to a number of factors, including wide 
differences in legal frameworks both within and across regions and confusion over the 
terminology. It was noted that the concept of restitution, for example, had been interpreted 
in some domestic legal systems as pertaining specifically and exclusively to &#8220;offender-
based compensation&#8221;. Whereas, in some municipal legal systems and in international law, it 
refers to all measures aimed at restoring the situation that existed prior to the violation, as 
far as this is possible, and includes the concept of rehabilitation in so far as it seeks to 
restore the status and position of a person who has suffered a violation of human rights. It 
was also noted that the latter conceptualization of &#8220;restitution&#8221; was somewhat problematic 
when applied to trafficked persons. For many, if not most, trafficked persons, the status quo 
ante was itself characterized by serious human rights violations and &#8220;restitution&#8221; might put 
them at risk of being re-trafficked. A strong need was therefore expressed for further 
analysis of how that concept had been translated and applied in different legal systems, and 
for further clarification on how it could be invoked in domestic contexts to strengthen the 
implementation of effective remedies for trafficked persons.

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>16. Discussing the content of the right to an effective remedy, a number of participants 
expressed the view that focusing on the &#8220;compensation&#8221; aspect of the right could have a 
number of practical advantages, including the fact that this aspect appeared to be the one 
that was the least contentious and enjoyed the greatest degree of recognition by States. 
Other participants argued that compensation should rather be seen as an ancillary form of 
remedy, designed to provide redress for damages suffered where such damages could not 
be remedied by restitution. 
</p>
<p>17. Another conceptual issue that was seen as contributing to the lack of clarity was the 
relationship between remedies and access to justice, with some participants arguing that the 
former was subsumed into the latter. By comparison, there were views that access to justice 
was one of key elements of the right to an effective remedy, along with fair court 
proceedings, compensation and enforcement.8 It was noted in that regard that, while the two 
concepts clearly overlapped in some respects (for example, common procedural obligations 
to enable access to both justice and remedies), the promotion of justice through redress of 
human rights violations should rather be seen as the purpose of reparation,9 which in turn 
constitutes the substantive content of an effective remedy. 
</p>
<p>18. Some participants also highlighted a number of limitations in approaching the right 
to an effective remedy solely from the point of view of access to justice, particularly with 
reference to specific categories such as children. These limitations included both 
weaknesses in existing legal frameworks (such as statutes of limitations and prescriptions) 
and a series of practical obstacles such as: the unavailability of free legal aid provided by 
professionals trained both in trafficking-related law and in working with children; the 
absence of procedural provisions &#8211; such as in camera testimony or dedicated case workers &#8211; 
enabling children to obtain remedies through judicial or non-judicial/administrative 
proceedings. It was noted that these obstacles were commonly experienced by trafficked 
persons in general. In some cases, certain measures such as in camera testimony are only 
available to children, although they may be equally important for adult victims of 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Session 2: State responses 
</b></p>
<p>19. In this session, panellists analysed the practical implementation at the national level 
of the right to an effective remedy for trafficked persons, using illustrative examples from 
different contexts. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Restitution 
</b></p>
<p>20. In the area of restitution, the case of the repatriation in 2005 of 1,000 former child 
camel jockeys originally trafficked to the United Arab Emirates from Pakistan was 
presented. In this case, the political will of the countries of destination and origin to address 
the demand, facilitate and cooperate with each other in the reintegration of the children was 
qualified as a good practice. Yet, several challenges were highlighted in terms of the 
practical implementation of the rehabilitation and reintegration of the children in a way that 
was sustainable and respected their human rights. The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF), which coordinated measures taken by the numerous actors involved in this

Law, art. 15. </p>

</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>programme, identified a number of lessons learned. These included that implementing the 
comprehensive measures of restitution for these children was extremely complex, firstly in 
terms of the factors to be taken into account at the level of the individual children, their 
families and communities and of society. This had required continuous research, 
monitoring and adjustment of the programme, including widening its scope to reinforce 
social safety nets for children more generally. Secondly, the programme was found to be 
extremely intricate and resource-intensive in terms of coordination between the numerous 
institutions involved in providing the services needed to meet the needs of the children. 
Thirdly, it was noted that in some cases, resettlement to a third country had been found to 
be in the best interests of the child and the most viable avenue to restitution of a given 
trafficked child.  
</p>
<p>21. The question of sustainability was also identified as a crucial one in the context of 
the youngest of the children concerned not being due to reach majority until the year 2023. 
While the monetary grant component of the programme had been addressed through the 
creation of a fund managed by provincial governments and transferred into an endowment 
fund for each child, other aspects such as training and assistance to set up businesses were 
likely to prove more challenging in terms of sustainability. Serious challenges had also 
been encountered in terms of disbursing the compensation due to the trafficked children as 
per the Memorandum of Understanding between the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan. 
As a result of various factors including a lack of inter-ministerial coordination, the majority 
of the children had been unable to access the compensation to which they were entitled. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Rehabilitation 
</b></p>
<p>22. In the area of rehabilitation, the case of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was presented and revealed similar challenges in terms of delivery of 
services to meet the needs of trafficked persons in the absence of adequate resource 
allocation and coordination structures. The case of the United Kingdom was also said to be 
illustrative of the trend among States to set up structures and mechanisms to assist 
identified victims of trafficking in persons but to pay insufficient attention to ensuring their 
effective operation in practice. 
</p>
<p>23. Inadequate procedures for correctly identifying victims of trafficking in persons in 
the first place were highlighted as a fundamental obstacle preventing many trafficked 
persons from receiving any assistance to enable them to recover and seek remedies. One 
particular challenge raised in that regard was that, in the United Kingdom, the responsibility 
for identifying a trafficked person and assessing any asylum claim that this person might 
have lay with the border agency. 
</p>
<p>24. While measures taken with regard to persons trafficked for domestic servitude had 
proven fairly comprehensive and effective, decentralized service provision and the 
inadequate allocation of funds and resources by the Central Government to actors charged 
with service provision had left many trafficked persons without the support they needed. By 
way of illustration, it was noted that funding for non-governmental organizations&#8217; (NGO) 
services to trafficked persons was limited to cases of women trafficked for sexual 
exploitation or domestic servitude, and that no specific arrangements had been put in place 
for trafficked men. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Compensation 
</b></p>
<p>25. In the area of compensation, it was noted that State Parties to the Protocol to 
Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, are 
required under article 6, paragraph 6, to make measures available that offer victims of 
trafficking in persons the possibility of obtaining compensation. The Protocol does not </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>specify any potential source, which means that compensation may be provided through one 
or more of the following three means: civil proceedings, criminal proceedings and a State-
administered fund or scheme. As noted in the background paper to this consultation,10 
States had a range of different procedures in place through which trafficked persons could 
in principle seek compensation, but cases of compensation actually being obtained through 
these procedures were extremely rare in practice. It was noted that, at the level of the 
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime, increased attention had been given recently to the possibilities of 
strengthening provisions and practices, including compensation funds. The cautious 
language surrounding this issue in the Protocol had begun to be somewhat strengthened 
within the open-ended interim working group on trafficking in persons set up by the 
Conference of the State Parties. At its second meeting in January 2010, the group had 
adopted a recommendation stating that States parties should also &#8220;endeavour to ensure the 
availability of a compensation fund or similar mechanism for victims of crimes, including 
trafficking in persons&#8221;.11 At its third meeting in October 2010, the open-ended interim 
working group had discussed the topic of national approaches to compensation of victims 
of trafficking, although time constraints did not allow for adoption of recommendations.12 
The work and the recommendations of the open-ended interim working group were 
welcomed, although not explicitly endorsed by the Conference of the Parties at its fifth 
session in October 2010.  
</p>
<p>26. A presentation was also made looking at the case of Belarus which, it was noted, had 
given increased attention to compensation in its new action plan and whose courts had 
made compensation awards which, though small in monetary terms, had been relatively 
numerous. These small awards highlighted the challenges posed in compensation cases in 
many countries whereby the majority of those being prosecuted for trafficking tend to be 
lower-level agents such as recruiters or transporters who have limited assets against which 
to claim. The experience of Belarus also exemplified other trends found in some countries, 
such as the large proportion of compensation cases brought through criminal proceedings 
and the difficulty for civil society groups to obtain disaggregated trafficking-related data 
and statistics for use in advocating for more effective remedies. This was a trend that 
appeared common in several countries, as indicated, for example, by the findings of an 
evaluation of the implementation of a legal instrument on compensation adopted by the 
European Union in 2004. An exception noted in that regard was the case of the 
Netherlands, where an independent national rapporteur was endowed with statutory powers 
to request information from authorities and other actors, and published yearly and 
disaggregated statistics, including on compensation awarded. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Discussion 
</b></p>
<p>27. Presentations were followed by a discussion focused on good practices and possible 
ways in which these could be replicated, as well as on gaps and challenges in realizing the 
right to an effective remedy for trafficked persons at the national level.

</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p>28. Regarding good practices, the Act to Strengthen the Position of Victims of Crimes in 
the Netherlands, which came into force in December 2010, allows victims of violent crimes 
and sexual offences, including trafficking, to seek an advance payment from the State, if the 
offender: (a) was convicted and ordered to pay damages to the victim as part of the criminal 
sentence; and (b) fails to pay these damages for a period of eight months after the 
sentencing. This was noted as a good practice, as it was often difficult for victims of 
trafficking to receive compensation even if the offender was convicted and ordered to pay 
damages. This approach shifted the onus of enforcing the compensation order from the 
victim of trafficking to the State. Under this law, victims of violent crimes and sexual 
offences, including victims of trafficking, were also entitled to free legal aid. It was also 
noted that the State-administered compensation fund set up in the United Kingdom had 
been fairly effective in awarding compensation (of between GBP 18&#8211;30,000), although the 
administrative barriers had proved insurmountable for most trafficked persons. In 
particular, the absence of free legal aid effectively precludes trafficked persons from 
accessing compensation funds, as legal aid was crucial in seeking to regularize the victims&#8217; 
residency status, one of the prerequisites to claiming from the compensation funds. In that 
regard, it was noted as a promising development that funding for legal aid as well as other 
assistance could be awarded by the State funds, such as the one set up in Argentina in 2008 
(out of 10 cases processed to date, one had resulted in an award being granted). As regarded 
trafficked children, mention was made of the cases of Cyprus, where child victims of 
trafficking had an unconditional right to legal and other assistance, and of South Africa, 
where all children had a right to legal aid. In response to the absence of financial assets of 
offenders from which to award monetary compensation to victims, it was also noted that an 
Argentinean court had ordered the offender&#8217;s material assets (in this case, sewing 
machines) to be put at the disposal of victims for the purposes of starting a business.  
</p>
<p>29. It was also noted that, in the Netherlands, victims of trafficking could submit a civil 
claim attached to criminal proceedings for lost earnings, provided that calculation of claims 
was not complicated. This had been successfully applied in practice by victims of 
trafficking in the sex industry. In addition, the Act on Migrant Labour allowed the awarding 
of lost earnings to irregular migrant workers through a formula based on the minimum 
salary and a presumed period of six months worked, although it was noted that the 
provision had not been used in practice yet. Similarly, courts in the United States of 
America had on several occasions awarded compensation to sex workers despite the legal 
prohibition to engage in such work. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Challenges 
</b></p>
<p>30. A number of challenges were also noted with regard to State practices. It was noted, 
for example, that in which the way many States had translated their international 
obligations into domestic legal frameworks had had the effect of impairing many trafficked 
persons&#8217; right to an effective remedy, including by excluding entire categories of trafficked 
persons from even the possibility of being recognized as such. This was the case, for 
example, for victims of internal trafficking in the United Kingdom and for trafficked infants 
in the United States. 
</p>
<p>31. Aside from any such weaknesses that might exist in legal frameworks, it was noted 
that countless trafficked persons were prevented from the possibility of claiming any type 
of remedy by the policies and procedures adopted by many States. In that regard, it was 
noted that many States seemed to have conflated the obligation to provide assistance to 
trafficked persons with the need to issue residence permits, which appeared to have 
contributed to the introduction of increasingly restrictive criteria both for identification and 
the provision of assistance. As an illustrative example of this, the need in the United States </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>to prove a &#8220;severe form of trafficking&#8221; to qualify for a T-visa13 was raised. Also highlighted 
as problematic were policies that gave priority to certain categories of trafficked persons, 
while in the case of other categories there was virtually no detection, investigation or 
prosecution. In the case of the United Kingdom, it was noted that such categories included 
trafficked men and children trafficked for begging. It was further noted that the sheer 
intricacies of procedures for claiming remedies operated (in the great majority of cases) to 
effectively deter trafficked persons from their pursuit due to the perception that procedures 
would be exceedingly lengthy and cumbersome and unlikely to yield a positive outcome. 
The above-mentioned obstacles, it was emphasized, were severely aggravated in cases 
where the victim was a stateless person, a child or both. 
</p>
<p>32. It was further noted that, even where adequate policies and procedures existed on 
paper, they were often not implemented in practice as intended. Failure to correctly identify 
victims of trafficking was noted as a fundamental challenge, as was the widespread practice 
of misidentifying them as irregular migrants. Illustrative cases of how a lack of adequate 
information flows and training could lead to implementation errors were raised and 
included those of Sweden and Norway. In the former&#8217;s case, it was noted that responsibility 
for identification rested with officers of municipal police forces, none of whom had been 
provided with any training on the characteristics and specificities of trafficked persons. In 
the latter&#8217;s case, it was noted that, although the national action plan included extensive 
provisions for protection and assistance for victims of trafficking, law enforcement officials 
were not familiar with this plan and reportedly often misidentified trafficked persons as 
irregular migrants. Such lack of specialized knowledge and training, it was noted, was not 
limited to law enforcement officials but was often found in all institutions responsible for 
dealing with trafficked persons. 
</p>
<p>33. Lack of coordination among those institutions was highlighted as another common 
challenge. While system-wide responses might exist on paper, it was noted that they were 
rarely implemented effectively in practice. Even where provisions existed for the 
involvement of multiple stakeholders, many relevant stakeholders were in practice left out 
and those who were included were not sufficiently informed (or even aware) of their 
intended role. In many cases, inadequate resources and/or their inadequate allocation 
exacerbated these challenges. In that context, it was noted that, even where adequate 
resources were available, the mechanisms for effective access to such resources did not 
exist or were inadequate. For instance, even where proceeds of organized crime were 
seized, compensation orders in criminal proceedings based on the proceeds were rare and 
the enforcement of such orders was extremely difficult. Failings in coordination often 
meant that resources, including those for compensation, ended up being lost or diverted, 
thus never reaching trafficked persons. In that connection, the provision of psychological 
therapy consistent with rehabilitative needs was identified as a specific gap that had had a 
particularly detrimental effect on trafficked persons&#8217; ability to seek and obtain remedies. 
</p>
<p>34. In addition to training of State actors, it was noted that effective implementation of 
the right to a remedy for trafficked persons required a reinforcement of the capacities of 
other actors to understand and respond to their particular needs. It was noted, in that regard, 
that very few institutions for the training of lawyers included specialized training on law 
and practice in relation to trafficking in persons. Legal aid clinics, including those attached 
to universities, were identified as other relevant actors in that regard. At the wider level of 
society, the need for nuanced sensitization to the situation and needs of trafficked persons

<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>was noted, if programmes such as those aimed at rehabilitation and reintegration were to be 
effective. 
</p>
<p>35. Another challenge highlighted was that, while compensation was a form of remedy 
for which many States had opted and one or more avenues for obtaining compensation 
existed in many systems, experiences around the world demonstrated that it was extremely 
rare for trafficked persons to actually receive compensation through any of these means. A 
variety of related challenges identified from State practices in that regard were raised, 
including: the absence of State funding for legal aid; inadequate relevant training of the 
judiciary; the practice of tying compensation to conviction; failures to enforce judgments 
and awards, immunity enjoyed by certain categories of perpetrators such as diplomats. It 
was also noted that the use of the proceeds of the crime of trafficking for compensation and 
assistance to trafficked persons was an available option in principle, but it was almost never 
implemented in practice. A study by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe (OSCE)14 had found, for example, that, in addition to a lack of inter-State 
cooperation in the confiscation of assets, it was the practice of many States to put the 
confiscated proceeds back into State coffers and allocate them to law enforcement, rather 
than to use them to compensate or assist trafficked persons. This was the case, for example, 
in the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It was noted that this practice tended 
to further frustrate the ability of trafficked persons to claim compensation, for example, 
through civil lawsuits. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Session 3: Concrete strategies and implementation 
</b></p>
<p>36. At this session, presentations and discussions focused on concrete strategies and 
interventions that had yielded measurable results, with a view to distilling lessons learned 
from past and ongoing experiences in the implementation of the right to an effective 
remedy for trafficked persons. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Restitution 
</b></p>
<p>37. In the area of restitution, the experience of a human rights organization seeking 
remedies on behalf of a Kenyan woman who had been trafficked to Rwanda at the age of 10 
for domestic work was presented, demonstrating the complexities of translating restitution 
into practice in cases where the trafficking experience had been ongoing for decades and 
the trafficked person had literally lost his or her identity. It also demonstrated the 
importance of regularizing residence status, not only for the purpose of seeking remedies, 
but in some cases as a remedy in itself. The regularization of the woman&#8217;s Rwandan 
citizenship and/or return of her Kenyan citizenship had been identified by the organization 
as an essential precondition for her ability to regain control of her life and be able to access 
any form of remedy. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Rehabilitation 
</b></p>
<p>38. In the area of rehabilitation, a pilot project aimed at the economic rehabilitation of 
trafficked persons15 implemented by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in 
India and subsequently replicated in Bangladesh was presented as a model whose flexibility 
and relatively low resource-intensiveness made it one that held promise for successful 
replication in several contexts. The model was built on the three pillars of: a multi-

</p>
<p>stakeholder approach including public-private partnerships; flexible business models; and 
sustainability. It had been implemented, for example, through the establishment in Goa of a 
laundry service employing former trafficked women. For that project, the local authority 
provided premises free of charge and a hotel chain provided extensive training and a 
commitment to giving the project an increasing percentage of its laundry business. 
Sustainability was ensured as beneficiaries gradually took over the running of the business, 
and stigma reportedly faded gradually as the women were recognized as income-earning 
members of the community. Buy-in and involvement of community actors, including a 
competing laundry service, were considered vital factors to the success of the project. 
</p>
<p>39. In addition, the findings of a study conducted by the London School of Hygiene and 
Tropical Medicine in collaboration with IOM and others and involving interviews with over 
200 trafficked women16 was presented. The findings indicated that the psychological effects 
of trafficking made it impossible for the vast majority of trafficked persons to make rational 
decisions within 90 days and that, even after 90 days, 20 per cent had still not recovered 
sufficiently to do so. The study had therefore recommended that 90 days should be the 
absolute minimum length for a reflection period. 
</p>
<p>40. A presentation on rehabilitation work conducted by Save the Children involving 
trafficked children in the Greater Mekong region17 demonstrated the importance of child 
participation, and understanding child psychology and the particular vulnerabilities and 
needs of former trafficked children. Echoing the experiences with former child camel 
jockeys in Pakistan, work in this subregion confirmed the need to develop holistic and 
integrated child protection systems to achieve sustainable solutions for trafficked children. 
By the same token, it was noted that wider interventions involving migrant communities 
had in many cases proved more effective than narrowly trafficking-focused interventions. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Compensation 
</b></p>
<p>41. In the area of compensation, a presentation was made on a pan-European campaign 
the European Action for Compensation for Trafficked Persons (COMP.ACT),18 based on a 
two-pronged approach aimed at the identification through research of practices and 
obstacles encountered in seeking compensation while at the same time testing the system by 
identifying or bringing test cases. Such cases were currently under way in several countries, 
including Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland. 
</p>
<p>42. A presentation on using labour tribunals and promoting collective action through 
labour unions in the OSCE subregion showed that such a strategy had proved relatively 
effective both in obtaining compensation and protecting trafficked persons from being 
exposed or re-victimized through the ordeal of criminal proceedings. It was also pointed out 
that bringing a case to an employment tribunal did not exclude subsequent instigation of 
criminal proceedings, and in that regard it was noted that a successful judgment or award, 
even if not enforced, could have a significant psychologically rehabilitative effect on 
trafficked persons, which could contribute to empowering them to seek further remedies.  
The participants also noted that, while the general inability of labour tribunals to award 
compensation for non-material damages such as pain and suffering could be seen as a 
disadvantage, there had been several cases where trafficked persons had successfully 
obtained compensation for lost earnings.

</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Cross-cutting issues 
</b></p>
<p>43. Finally, under cross-cutting issues, a presentation was made on a tool developed by 
the NGO AIM for Human Rights for use by civil society organizations in exposing the gap 
between the theory and practice in addressing trafficking in persons by conducting step-by-
step human rights impact assessments.19 The tool aimed to enable such organizations to 
better understand the human rights implications of State measures and practices and to 
work together from a common platform to advocate for more effective human rights-based 
responses. Examples of negative human rights impacts of anti-trafficking policies and 
practices that could be exposed by the tool included: measures used to justify limiting the 
freedoms of specific groups such as women; detention and deportation of trafficked 
persons; and arbitrary arrests of trafficked sex workers. The tool, which focuses on 
trafficked persons but is also intended to contribute to better protection of other groups, also 
included 15 fact sheets outlining human rights standards that should be met by States in 
their anti-trafficking responses, which meant that it could be used to measure compliance as 
well as impact. During the ensuing discussion, it was noted that in the absence of State-
funded legal aid schemes to enable trafficked persons to seek remedies, civil society 
organizations had often taken action to fill this crucial gap.  
</p>
<p>44. Save the Children in Thailand, for example, had recently shifted its focus to invest in 
legal aid in response to the realization that this was a vital component that had been missing 
in its response to trafficking in persons and had undermined the effectiveness of 
programmes aimed at prevention and rehabilitation. In the United States where no law 
school could be accredited unless it had an attached law clinic, it was noted that Clarke 
University had set up a law clinic dedicated to assisting trafficked persons. 
</p>
<p>45. The participants also mentioned a number of cases in which legal aid groups had 
successfully challenged practices and decisions denying trafficked persons the right to an 
effective remedy. In South Africa, for example, the Women&#8217;s Legal Centre had 
successfully appealed a decision by a labour tribunal which denied redress to a former sex 
worker on the basis that her work was illegal under national law. The Appeal Court had 
found that it was the very nature of the work that made labour laws necessary to protect 
them from being exploited by traffickers.20 In Japan, a lawyer&#8217;s group had successfully 
obtained compensation for lost wages for trafficked workers even after they had been 
returned to their country of origin. Even without going to court, the intervention of 
specialized lawyers had in some cases led to trafficked persons obtaining compensation 
through negotiation with employers. An example involving workers exploited by a 
transport company in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan was mentioned as having been 
successful not only in terms of obtaining compensation, but also in terms of avoiding re-
traumatization through the by-passing of court proceedings and reliance on the testimony of 
volunteers acting on behalf of the wider group. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Cooperation between different stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>46. <i>Access to Justice for Trafficked Persons in Nigeria &#8211; A Handbook for Legal Actors 
and Service Providers</i>21 was raised as an interesting example of cooperation between 
different stakeholders to obtain concrete results through partnerships. The handbook was 
the result of collaboration between the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women 
(GAATW), the Nigerian National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons and the

</p>
<p>United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). Its development built on a 
series of national consultations held by GAATW in 2005 and 2006 and there were plans to 
replicate good practices emerging from its use in Nigeria in the wider West Africa region. 
</p>
<p>47. COMP.ACT had also experienced some progress in developing partnerships with 
trade unions, which reportedly had tended to be somewhat sceptical of addressing 
trafficking issues in general but appeared more open to cooperation on a concrete issue 
such as compensation. A key element in obtaining the buy-in of trade unions on this issue 
was that they recognized its potential to benefit their members through the maintenance of 
high labour standards. Such partnerships, it was hoped, could have more generalized 
benefits on workers including migrant workers and represented a concrete way to deter 
employers from exploitative practices. A number of high-profile cases had been brought in 
this regard, notably against companies providing services to governments as subcontractors. 
</p>
<p>48. In addition, several organizations (for example GAATW, Interights, Save the 
Children and COMP.ACT) have entered into partnerships with private law firms to promote 
strategic litigation and test cases. The above-mentioned handbook on access to justice in 
Nigeria, for example, included the involvement of a private law firm that had committed to 
take the handbook forward in its work. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Challenges and lessons learned 
</b></p>
<p>49. The discussion also raised a number of challenges and lessons learned identified 
from experiences in implementing the right to an effective remedy for trafficked persons, 
including the following. 
</p>
<p>50. Providing information to trafficked persons that is appropriate both in terms of 
content, form and timing continued to prove challenging in many contexts. The practice to 
simply print and distribute laws and procedures verbatim among populations with low 
literacy levels or who only speak minority languages persist, indicating a need for 
concerted efforts to &#8220;demystify&#8221; the remedies available and how to access them in different 
contexts. It also stresses the importance of informing victims at repeated moments over a 
longer period, both orally and in print in a language they understand. 
</p>
<p>51. Interpreters have a crucial role to play in the provision of remedies to trafficked 
persons, as it has been observed that they often have significant (positive or negative) 
impacts on outcomes for trafficked persons. To overcome certain challenges observed in 
this regard, Save the Children in Thailand has introduced a programme to train interpreters 
in issues relating to trafficking in persons and more general migration issues. 
</p>
<p>52. It was also pointed out that in order to successfully claim compensation, it is 
important that from the outset the police obtain information from the victim with respect to 
material and non-material damages suffered and includes this information in subsequent 
proceedings. This rarely happens in practice, as the police tend to focus on the prosecution 
of the perpetrator, which makes it difficult for the victim to claim compensation at a later 
stage. 
</p>
<p>53. Monitoring progress and impact of rehabilitation projects is often difficult to 
reconcile with respect for privacy and free consent as it is frequently the wish of many 
former trafficked persons to simply get on with their lives and not to be visited by 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>54. The content and length of assistance required for an individual trafficked person to 
be considered sufficiently rehabilitated varies considerably from case to case. While 
difficult enough to determine retroactively, it is impossible to predict in advance and rigid 
limitations in terms of reflection periods or temporary residence permits and the duration of 
interventions have therefore proven highly problematic in practice. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>55. In case of foreign victims, they may be deported before they can make a claim, the 
criminal case is completed, or they can actually recover a claim awarded. Moreover, in 
most countries which allow for a temporary residence permit, this permit is tied to the 
criminal case and does not allow the victim to stay in the country during any proceedings 
for compensation before civil or labour courts. 
</p>
<p>56. A particular challenge faced in implementing human rights-based rehabilitation and 
reintegration projects in contexts of generalized poverty is the issue of child labour and 
whether concepts such as &#8220;decent work for youth&#8221; could be either promoted or avoided. 
</p>
<p>57. Severe challenges in the enforcement of remedies risk having a demoralizing effect 
on both trafficked persons and practitioners, to the extent that it is sometimes considered 
that informing trafficked persons of available remedies amounts to instilling a false hope. 
</p>
<p>58. Delivery of compensation can be challenging where compensation awarded to a 
trafficked child is provided to family members who may have been implicated in the 
trafficking and/or have no intention of using the award for the child&#8217;s rehabilitation.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> Regularization of trafficked persons&#8217; residence status is not only a precondition 
for accessing remedies in many cases, but in some cases constitutes the remedy itself 
when it is the only viable and sustainable form of restitution. There is clearly a need 
for refinement of State responses in this regard, particularly in view of the tendency to 
conflate trafficking and irregular migration in a way that results in restricted access 
to remedies for trafficked persons, rather than provision of the protection to which 
they are entitled. 
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> While legal aid and litigation by civil society groups had led to positive 
outcomes for a limited number of trafficked persons, this is not a sustainable solution 
that should be seen as an alternative to effective and comprehensive State responses. 
From a human rights perspective, States are not only responsible for investigating and 
prosecuting trafficking cases, but also to provide victims with an adequate remedy. In 
addition, progress should not be measured only in terms of the number of convictions 
and amounts of awards, and it is necessary to consider how certain decisions of courts 
in different jurisdictions tend to either support or undermine human rights standards. 
It was observed, for example, that the judgment in a case brought against Niger at the 
Community Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African States</b>22<b> 
resulted in the swift awarding of compensation, but at the same disavowed human 
rights standards by negating any State responsibility in the violation. The practice by 
many judges in Nigeria to award small compensatory amounts sometimes not 
exceeding US$ 100 was also mentioned as the risk of trivializing the gravity of the 
violation. 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> The use of labour courts to obtain remedies for trafficked persons has yielded 
concrete and promising results in many cases. In addition to non-material damages, 
however, the most common forms of exploitation, such as prostitution, are not 
recognized by labour courts in many countries. Similarly, enlisting the assistance of 
trade unions in most countries requires being a member, which is often not the case 
and may not even be a possibility, for trafficked persons.

</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>62.<b> The creation of dedicated mechanisms to cater for trafficked persons could in 
some cases be problematic by having a limiting effect on remedies for other human 
rights abuses and creating a distinct and hierarchical category of rights-holders. This 
may mean that advocacy should aim to enable victims of trafficking to obtain 
compensation within the existing schemes and, where they do not exist or are 
inadequate, to advocate for such schemes which allow all victims of human rights 
violations to claim compensation. Contexts exist in which there are no adequate 
structures or mechanisms capable of providing any form of remedy to trafficked 
persons, and in such cases specialized services may be the only option for meeting 
their particular needs. 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> Experience has shown that effective rehabilitation of trafficked persons 
requires system-wide approaches including close case management support and 
multidisciplinary teams in countries of both destination and origin. A multi-
stakeholder approach that is truly responsive to the specific and individual needs of 
trafficked persons is also essential to ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability of 
interventions. Another risk involved is wastage of limited resources through 
duplication and the contribution to stigmatisation of trafficked persons.  
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> States should adopt adequate legal frameworks which recognize trafficking in 
persons as a violation of human rights and a serious crime, and provide for the 
fulfilment of trafficked persons&#8217; human rights, including that of an effective remedy. 
In this regard, there is a need to recognize the integral nature of the elements 
constituting the right to an effective remedy in the specific context of trafficking in 
persons. There is also a need to refine the concept of restitution in relation to 
trafficking in persons, notably to reduce the risk of the concept being applied in a way 
that exposes trafficked persons to further human rights violations. 
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> In accordance with international law, a person should be recognized as a victim 
of a human rights violation from the moment he or she suffers harm as a result of 
such violation, and not on the basis of the application of prohibitively high criteria for 
having such status &#8220;conferred&#8221; onto him or her. States also have related obligations 
to: exercise due diligence in the identification of trafficked persons; apply the 
principle of non-criminalization and non-prosecution of trafficked persons; and 
explicitly recognize that neither a trafficked person&#8217;s immigration status nor their 
decision on whether or not to participate in criminal proceedings against alleged 
perpetrators may be seen as in any way limiting their claim to human rights, 
including that of an effective remedy. 
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> Legal provisions should include remedies that are comprehensive and tailored 
to meet the specific vulnerabilities of trafficked persons. In the case of trafficked 
children, provision should be made for obtaining remedies out of court, and for 
unconditional legal aid to be provided as a matter of course for all proceedings, 
whether criminal, civil or administrative. Consideration should also be given to 
abolishing statutes of limitations and prescriptions in cases involving child victims of 
trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> Statutes governing any State-administered funds set up for trafficked persons 
should explicitly indicate that funding will be used to provide remedies, including 
compensation, to trafficked persons. Explicit provision should also be made for seized 
proceeds of trafficking and confiscated assets of traffickers to be used to compensate 
trafficked persons and for general provision of remedies to trafficked persons. 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> In recognition of the numerous practical obstacles facing trafficked persons in 
seeking and accessing compensation, States should make available as many options for 
claiming compensation as possible. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> All types of trafficking in persons should be investigated with due diligence. 
Concerning prosecutions, measures should be taken to reduce the dependency on 
victim testimony, and the granting of remedies should not be made conditional on 
convictions. 
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> Wherever available, measures to provide effective remedies to trafficked 
persons should, in the first instance, be integrated within existing structures without 
losing sight of the specificities and individual needs of trafficked persons. This may 
require enhanced efforts at effective coordination, the reinforcement of capacities and 
the allocation of dedicated case-workers. 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> Rehabilitation efforts should recognize experiences of individual trafficked 
persons and should avoid classifications or generalizations that ignore individual 
traumas to which a trafficked person may have been exposed. Particular attention 
should be given to the need for age and gender-appropriate provisions in this regard. 
The period allocated to trafficked persons during which to decide on a course of 
action, including the pursuit of remedies, should not be less than 90 days in the light of 
empirical evidence that few, if any, trafficked persons are in a position to make a 
rational decision before then. Trafficked persons should be allowed regular residence 
status during any procedures for compensation, be it for a criminal, civil or labour 
court. 
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> Wherever possible, compensation should be granted directly to the trafficked 
person, failing which it should be extended to a member of his or her family. 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> Procedures for effective provision to trafficked persons of comprehensive and 
appropriate information, including that on how to obtain remedies, should be put in 
place and implemented as a matter of priority. The right to information in this regard 
may be seen as a vital gateway to claiming other rights including that to an effective 
remedy for human rights violations. 
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> Timely and adequate legal aid should be recognized as a precondition for all 
trafficked persons to exercise their right to an effective remedy, and procedures in this 
regard should be formulated and applied accordingly. 
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> Procedures for consulting trafficked persons should respect their right to free 
and informed consent, and empower them through assistance and information to 
make choices, rather than pressure or intimidate them into choosing one course of 
action or another. 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> Particular attention should be paid in legal proceedings involving trafficked 
persons to procedural guarantees such as the right to privacy, safety and witness 
protection. 
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> Mechanisms (for example, adhesion procedures) should be put in place 
allowing for a third party (such as a prosecutor) to claim and enforce compensation 
on behalf of trafficked persons, in recognition of the low likelihood of victims 
initiating and undertaking complicated proceedings of their own accord and without 
advice or assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> Increased efforts should be made to train key stakeholders, in particular 
prosecutors and judges, on laws and issues pertaining to trafficking in persons. 
Training, education and sensitization aimed at other actors, and society at large, could 
also make a crucial contribution to the effective implementation of the right to an 
effective remedy for trafficked persons, including through the promotion of a victims&#8217; 
rights culture and measures to counter stigma. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>79.<b> Regional mechanisms should gather information on and systematically monitor 
member States&#8217; anti-trafficking policies and the implementation of the obligation to 
provide an effective remedy to trafficked persons. 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> Civil society organizations should implement evidence-based action, starting 
with systematic and coordinated efforts to seek data and information from State 
institutions on the measures they are taking to protect and assist trafficked persons. 
Such information, if collated, could contribute to more effective access to remedies by 
allowing for a full picture to be formed and strategies and interventions to be 
advocated on an informed basis. </b></p>
