<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
has come a long way since 1993, when the post of High Commissioner was created at the 
World Conference on Human Rights to ensure that an independent, authoritative voice 
would speak out at the global level against human rights violations, wherever they 
occurred. The twentieth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action 
and of the establishment of the mandate of the High Commissioner provided an opportunity 
to reaffirm the principles of the Vienna Declaration, not least the universality, indivisibility 
and interdependence of all human rights, including the right to development, and the duty 
of the State, regardless of its political, economic and cultural system, to promote and 
protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms. This anniversary also provided the 
opportunity to assess progress made in the promotion and protection of human rights and 
the evolution of OHCHR and its achievements. Throughout my term, OHCHR has 
forthrightly confronted a multitude of pressing and challenging human rights issues in an 
increasingly complex and ever-changing world. 
</p>
<p>2. One of the most notable developments during my term has been the remarkable 
recognition of the importance of human rights within the United Nations system and as one 
of the three pillars of the Organization, together with peace and security, and development. 
Most recently, the report of the Secretary-General&#8217;s Internal Review Panel on United 
Nations action in Sri Lanka,1 together with the subsequent &#8220;Rights Up Front&#8221; plan of 
action, reaffirmed the centrality of human rights to the work of the United Nations, and 
provides critical recommendations for the whole system to be more responsive and 
responsible in preventing and addressing promptly human rights issues. OHCHR is 
committed to playing a leading role in ensuring follow-up to this landmark document, 
which, if effectively and collectively implemented, will contribute significantly to peace 
and security and to development.  
</p>
<p>3. In November 2013, the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for 
Coordination, under the leadership of the Secretary-General, endorsed a significant 
statement on human rights, reaffirming the system&#8217;s commitment to the human rights 
principles of the United Nations, recognizing the responsibility of the entire system to 
uphold human rights norms and standards and pledging support for the &#8220;Rights Up Front&#8221; 
plan of action. We will continue to build on this achievement, and I trust that OHCHR will 
continue to pioneer the way forward, together with its partners worldwide. 
</p>
<p>4. The Office has continued to respond to a steadily growing number of requests for 
engagement and assistance. As at December 2013, OHCHR supported 59 field presences: 
13 country/stand-alone offices, 15 human rights components of peacekeeping and special 
political missions, 12 regional offices and centres, and 19 human rights advisers with 
United Nations Resident Coordinators and country teams. These presences are critical to 
providing national counterparts with direct and targeted assistance in addressing human 
rights issues. During the period under review, the United Nations Development Group 
human rights mainstreaming mechanism agreed to the deployment of 13 new human rights 
advisers.  
</p>
<p>5. In September 2013, the interim Government of Egypt notified OHCHR of its 
willingness to host an OHCHR regional office for North Africa in Cairo, a process that was

<p>still ongoing during the period under review. Negotiations with the Government of 
Myanmar to establish an OHCHR country office have also been ongoing.  
</p>
<p>6. Between December 2012 and November 2013, I undertook visits to (in 
chronological order) Angola, Denmark, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Serbia and 
Kosovo,2 Austria, Cameroon, Colombia, Sri Lanka, Slovenia, Poland, Afghanistan, the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Ireland and France, in addition to 
regular visits to Headquarters to brief the Security Council and the General Assembly. The 
Deputy High Commissioner visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Yemen. The 
Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights conducted missions to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Guinea-Bissau and the Central African 
Republic. 
</p>
<p>7. The constant increase in demands placed on OHCHR, including new mandated 
activities, has tested the limits of the Office&#8217;s already limited resources. I am grateful to my 
staff for their hard work and dedication, and count on Member States to increase overall 
financial support for OHCHR to enable it to undertake effectively our ever-expanding 
work, not least in the light of the &#8220;Rights Up Front&#8221; plan of action.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Thematic priorities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Racial discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>8. OHCHR worked on supporting a substantive approach to the work of the Durban 
follow-up mechanisms, which now also serve as a forum for the exchange of good practices 
against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. OHCHR 
continues to experience difficulties in securing a meeting of the independent eminent 
experts, who, despite the efforts of the Office, were once again unable to meet during the 
year under review. 
</p>
<p>9. Together with the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) and the 
Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), OHCHR initiated a campaign to 
sensitize the public on the eradication of racism in sport consistent with the discussions 
held during the eleventh session of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective 
Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p>10. A database on practical means to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance was launched by the Office in September 2013 to increase the 
capacity of Member States and other stakeholders in this field. This tool contains more than 
1,500 documents and information from more than 90 countries. 
</p>
<p>11. OHCHR provided Governments with advice on policies and programmes to 
eradicate racial discrimination and to promote equality, and in the review of anti-
discrimination legislation. It organized national and regional meetings and supported 
various national institutions in, inter alia, Belarus, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Costa 
Rica, Guinea, Mauritania, Mexico, Nigeria, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian 
Federation and Ukraine. In the past year, seven young individuals were empowered through

<p>Council resolution 1244 (1999), without prejudice to the status of Kosovo. </p>


<p>their participation in the third Annual Fellowship Programme for People of African 
Descent. 
</p>
<p>12. The Rabat plan of action on the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or 
religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence was 
launched by my Office in February 2013, and is now an important platform for our work in 
the field.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Discrimination on the basis of indigenous or minority background 
</b></p>
<p>13. The leadership of OHCHR in the United Nations Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Partnership 
was complemented by dialogue with indigenous peoples in, inter alia, Bolivia (Plurinational 
State of), Indonesia and the Congo. The Office published, with the Asia Pacific Forum of 
National Human Rights Institutions, a manual on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. Its support for 
the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples facilitated the adoption of a 
new study on the access of indigenous peoples to justice. OHCHR contributed to the 
preparation of the 2014 World Conference on Indigenous Peoples by supporting the 
capacity of indigenous peoples to contribute to the process through the United Nations 
Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations. The indigenous fellowship programme 
included 26 fellows from 20 countries. OHCHR also endeavoured to advance respect for 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in the context of business operations, including through the 
operationalization of the principle of free, prior and informed consent in Latin America and 
elsewhere. In Colombia, the role of OHCHR in promoting dialogue contributed to a historic 
agreement on territorial units, enhanced protection for ancestral lands, and a plan of action 
concerning isolated indigenous peoples, reached between the Government and indigenous 
peoples, providing concrete steps for the exercise of their rights.  
</p>
<p>14. The efforts made by OHCHR to promote and protect minority rights included its 
leadership in the new United Nations network on racial discrimination and minorities. In 
March, the Secretary-General endorsed a guidance note on racial discrimination and 
protection of minorities, in which he called on the United Nations to focus on the most 
marginalized minorities, whose rights are particularly at risk. In many countries, this 
translates into a focus on religious minorities, whose rights were the focus of the Forum on 
Minority Issues in November 2013.  
</p>
<p>15. In various European countries, the human rights of Roma continued to be at serious 
risk. In the Republic of Moldova, the Office supported efforts aimed at setting up an 
equality body as envisaged in the 2012 Equality Law, and assisted the national human 
rights institution in challenging discriminatory laws in court, and in pressing for 
desegregation in localities practising separate schooling for Roma. In Serbia, assistance was 
provided to the authorities in the integration of human rights standards in Roma housing 
programmes and on the consultation and participation of affected communities in their 
implementation.  
</p>
<p>16. Other areas of concern ranged from participation of minorities in decision-making to 
the promotion of the right to use minority languages. In April 2013, the Government of 
Kyrgyzstan adopted a policy to promote minority representation in State bodies and to 
protect minority languages, with advice provided by OHCHR. In Libya, support was 
provided through the human rights component of the United Nations Support Mission in 
Libya for the adoption in July of a law on the rights of cultural and linguistic components.  
</p>
<p>17. OHCHR also initiated an Arabic and English language minority fellowship 
programme and issued a practical guide for minority rights advocates. </p>


<p><b> 3. Gender equality and women&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p>18. OHCHR worked with partners to promote the implementation of recommendations 
contained in the report of my Office on creating and/or strengthening synergies against 
violence against women.3 In July, I signed a letter of agreement with the United Nations 
Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) to systematize 
collaboration in advancing women&#8217;s rights and gender equality.  
</p>
<p>19. In collaboration with UN-Women and the United Nations Development Programme, 
OHCHR developed a global programme to ensure women&#8217;s access to justice through 
comprehensive and coordinated law and justice reforms at the national level. OHCHR, 
together with UN-Women, convened three validation workshops on the model protocol for 
the investigation of femicide in Latin America, which aimed at increasing the integration of 
gender aspects throughout such investigations. As one of the lead entities of the Team of 
Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict,4 OHCHR conducted 
assessment missions to the Central African Republic, Colombia, the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo and Somalia, and made recommendations to the relevant Governments on 
strengthening their legal and institutional frameworks to respond to conflict-related sexual 
violence.  
</p>
<p>20. In follow-up to Human Rights Council resolution 23/25, in October, OHCHR 
convened a lessons learned meeting of commissions of inquiry and fact-finding mission 
staff and experts on the investigation of sexual and gender-based violence. In the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Joint Human Rights Office supported mobile courts 
dealing with cases of sexual violence and provided through joint investigation teams 
military prosecutors with technical support to investigate allegations of sexual violence, and 
other serious violations, in remote areas of the country. Furthermore, the Joint Human 
Rights Office supported the establishment of legal clinics to provide free legal advice to 
victims of sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>21. OHCHR supported efforts in Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Sierra Leone to 
enhance national capacity to address sexual and gender-based violence. In Guinea-Bissau, 
advocacy by the human rights component of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding 
Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS) contributed to the adoption in July of laws to combat 
female genital mutilation and to prevent human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>22. In partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations 
Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, 
OHCHR promoted the implementation of a technical guidance on a rights-based approach 
to the reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity, including by building capacity in 
Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. In July, together with 
UNFPA and the Government of the Netherlands, OHCHR co-organized an international 
conference on human rights in the context of the review of the International Conference on 
Population and Development: beyond 2014, in which participants urged that human rights 
be placed at the centre of efforts to deliver on implementation of the agenda of the 
International Conference. 
</p>
<p>23. OHCHR published jointly with UN-Women a handbook entitled &#8220;Realizing 
women&#8217;s rights to land and other productive resources&#8221;.

<p><b> 4. Discrimination on the basis of disability 
</b></p>
<p>24. OHCHR, in cooperation with the Human Rights Council task force on accessibility, 
endeavoured to ensure the use of international sign language interpretation and captioning 
during certain meetings of the Council and the Committee on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, and improved the accessibility of buildings to persons with disabilities. 
OHCHR also finalized a training package on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, which was piloted in Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa. 
</p>
<p>25. As a result of advocacy by OHCHR, the human rights of persons with disabilities 
were recognized as an important factor in the outcome document of the high-level meeting 
of the General Assembly on disability and development5 and in the conclusions of the 
round table dedicated to the post-2015 development agenda. 
</p>
<p>26. As an example, in July, following advocacy by the UNIOGBIS human rights 
component, the Parliament of Guinea-Bissau approved the ratification of the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The human rights component of the United Nations 
Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone supported the establishment and 
operationalization of the National Commission for Persons with Disabilities in Sierra 
Leone.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Discrimination on the basis of age 
</b></p>
<p>27. Rapidly changing demographics are presenting new human rights challenges. Older 
persons represent a large and growing constituency, often subjected to discrimination, 
exclusion, marginalization and abuse, and yet for whom no dedicated international 
protection regime yet exists. The human rights of older persons are expected to advance 
following the establishment of a special procedures mandate on this specific issue. 
</p>
<p>28. Jointly with the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, OHCHR supported the 
fourth session of the Open-ended Working Group on Ageing for the purpose of 
strengthening the protection of the human rights of older persons, held in New York,6 and 
organized a public consultation on the human rights of older persons in Geneva, pursuant to 
Human Rights Council resolution 21/23. In May 2013, OHCHR, jointly with the European 
Commission, organized a seminar on preventing abuse and neglect of older persons in 
Europe. In July, it organized an expert meeting to identify and address protection gaps for 
the human rights of youth.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity  
</b></p>
<p>29. In the past five years, there has been a growing awareness of the extent and gravity 
of human rights violations against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender 
identity or expression.  
</p>
<p>30. In July 2013, OHCHR launched Free &amp; Equal, a global campaign designed to raise 
awareness of homophobic and transphobic discrimination and violence, and to promote 
respect for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons. With 
support from United Nations partners, the campaign has created opportunities for more than 
10 million people around the world to have access to and share materials via social media. 
News of the campaign was featured in media outlets with a global readership around the 
world. In March and April, OHCHR participated in a series of regional meetings and in a

<p>global conference in Oslo to examine the most pressing human rights challenges faced by 
LGBT persons in various parts of the world. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Discrimination on the basis of health and harmful traditional beliefs 
</b></p>
<p>31. OHCHR worked to address stigma and discrimination against people living with 
HIV, including by promoting access to justice and legal assistance, for example in Benin, 
Ecuador and the Republic of Moldova. The Office also partnered with the Global Fund to 
Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to integrate human rights into its operations and 
fund management. 
</p>
<p>32. In September 2013, OHCHR submitted a report to the Human Rights Council on 
attacks and discrimination against persons affected by albinism,7 and, throughout the year, 
promoted greater awareness of their situation of human.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Impunity, rule of law and democratic society 
</b></p>
<p>33. Supporting efforts to strengthen the administration of justice remains a priority for 
OHCHR, with a focus on such fundamental issues as the independence of the judiciary and 
the protection of the rights of persons deprived of their liberty. OHCHR assisted in the 
preparation of a report of the Secretary-General containing an analysis of the institutional 
framework for the protection of all persons deprived of their liberty.8 OHCHR participated 
in the ongoing review process of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of 
Prisoners, and, in November, organized a training workshop for field presences in Africa on 
traditional justice systems and human rights. 
</p><p>34. OHCHR continued its advocacy work with States retaining the death penalty, 
notably for the establishment of a moratorium pursuant to General Assembly resolution 
67/176, and for the implementation of international standards guaranteeing the protection of 
the rights of those facing the death penalty. In June, at the fifth World Congress against the 
Death Penalty, I urged all States that had resumed executions or continued to impose the 
death penalty to immediately stop this regression in human rights protection and to impose 
a moratorium. In June, in New York, OHCHR held a high-level event to discuss the 
increasing number of wrongful convictions in death penalty cases.  
</p>
<p>35. OHCHR continued to support a comprehensive approach to combating impunity, 
strengthening accountability and addressing past violations of human rights through advice 
and support on transitional justice processes and mechanisms. This included supporting the 
drafting of transitional justice laws, in particular in Libya, Tunisia and Yemen. It also 
included support for inclusive and participatory approaches to transitional justice processes, 
for instance to support the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
in the organization of national consultations, and the planning of such consultations in 
Guinea. OHCHR continued to support the work of the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission of Thailand, and encouraged the Government to implement the Commission&#8217;s 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. In April 2013, in partnership with France and Switzerland, OHCHR co-organized in 
Yaound&#233; the third regional conference on transitional justice for francophone Africa. In 
November, OHCHR supported the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, 
reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence in organizing, in Kampala, regional 
consultations on transitional justice in Africa.

</p>
<p>7
 A/HRC/24/57. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8
 A/68/261. </p>


<p>37. In June, OHCHR launched a study on the theme, &#8220;Healing the spirit: reparations for 
survivors of sexual violence related to the armed conflict in Kosovo&#8221;, and supported the 
implementation of the recommendations made in it. In South Kivu in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, the Joint Human Rights Office implemented a project on access to 
justice and reparations through which 450 beneficiaries were reintegrated and given access 
to medical and psychosocial assistance. 
</p>
<p>38. OHCHR supported domestic and regional capacity-building efforts to enhance 
protection of human rights in the context of counter-terrorism. In my address to the 
Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council in October, I raised concerns about 
broadly formulated national counter-terrorism legislation and the abusive use of counter-
terrorism legislation by authorities to curb legitimate activity.  
</p>
<p>39. I also reiterated concerns over allegations received by my Office of serious 
violations of human rights in the context of counter-terrorism, with attention to the failure 
to close the Guantanamo Bay detention centre as one example. The failure of many States 
to undertake public and independent investigations of past involvement in renditions also 
remains an issue of concern.  
</p>
<p>40. OHCHR continued to address other complex legal and policy challenges, including 
issues relating to mass surveillance and the right to privacy in the digital age. While modern 
communications technology provides a powerful tool for democracy, it has also contributed 
to a blurring of lines between the public and the private spheres, and has generated 
unprecedented levels of interference with the right to privacy. 
</p>
<p>41. I highlighted my deep concern over the lack of transparency surrounding drone 
strikes and their impact on, in particular, accountability and the ability of victims to seek 
redress. Member States should be transparent with regard to criteria for deploying drone 
strikes and ensure that the use of drones complies fully with international law. Where there 
are plausible indications of a breach of international law, States should conduct 
independent, impartial, prompt and effective investigations, and provide victims with an 
effective remedy. 
</p>
<p>42. As Chair of the Working Group on Protecting Human Rights while Countering 
Terrorism of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, OHCHR, together with 
the Task Force Office, launched a major training and capacity-building project for law 
enforcement officials on human rights, the rule of law and prevention of terrorism, which in 
2013 covered the Middle East, the North and West Africa regions, and the Sahel. 
</p>
<p>43. OHCHR contributed to strengthening national capacities to protect victims and 
witnesses of international crimes and serious violations of human rights. In December 
2012, OHCHR organized in Uganda a consultative workshop on technical and practical 
aspects of establishment of a national witness protection programme that contributed to the 
finalization of a bill on this issue. In 2013, the Joint Human Rights Office of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo continued to provide judicial authorities with advice on 
appropriate measures to protect victims and witnesses, including in high-profile court cases.  
</p>
<p>44. OHCHR supported the strengthening of democratic society in, for example, 
Cameroon, Guinea, Kenya, Madagascar and Togo, where it monitored the human rights 
situation in the context of elections. In Mexico, OHCHR actively supported the mechanism 
for the protection of human rights defenders and journalists, following up on individual 
cases, providing expert assistance and supporting a permanent dialogue between non-
governmental organizations and relevant authorities. In December, as part of its efforts to 
support the strengthening of democratic society, and as requested by the Human Rights 
Council in its resolution 22/10, OHCHR organized an expert seminar on effective measures 
and best practices to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of 
peaceful protests. </p>


<p>45. OHCHR supported long-standing efforts to establish or strengthen independent 
human rights institutions in Iraq, Liberia, Mozambique, Myanmar, Samoa, South Sudan, 
Uruguay and many other States. Furthermore, following advocacy and advice from 
OHCHR, laws were adopted in Kazakhstan and Tunisia for the establishment of a national 
preventive mechanism. Such a mechanism became operational in Kyrgyzstan following 
support from my Office.  
</p>
<p>46. As we move towards the third phase of the World Programme for Human Rights 
Education initiated in 2005, I invite all relevant actors, and in particular Governments, to 
focus their efforts on comprehensive, effective and sustainable human rights education and 
training programmes, in particular in the light of the proven effectiveness of human rights 
education in fostering democratic space. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Poverty and economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Human rights and development 
</b></p>
<p>47. The right to development is at the centre of the advocacy of OHCHR for a human 
rights-based approach to development, for human rights-based policy coherence and a post-
2015 sustainable development agenda respectful of all human rights. In December, 
OHCHR launched a landmark publication, <i>Realizing the Right to Development</i>, which 
reiterates the need for all persons to participate in their own economic, social, cultural and 
political development and for all human rights and fundamental freedoms to be fully 
realized. 
</p>
<p>48. In May 2013, OHCHR launched a guide to human rights measurement and 
implementation. National stakeholders in more than 20 States drew on the guide and 
engaged in pioneering work for improving the measurement of the impact of their human 
rights policies and development programmes. In Mexico, for instance, OHCHR promoted 
the adoption of human rights indicators for the measurement of the right to a fair trial. The 
Public Attorney of the Federal District adopted indicators on the rights to life, liberty, 
security and fair trial. In Ecuador, the Office supported efforts to integrate human rights 
into national development planning and to develop an inequalities atlas, produced by the 
National Secretariat for Planning and Development. 
</p>
<p>49. Since the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, OHCHR has 
advocated for human rights, including the right to development, to be fully integrated into 
the debates on and processes of the post-2015 development agenda. The Office has pursued 
this objective through research, expert meetings, consultations, advocacy and public events 
with Member States, civil society and other partners. Consequently, in 2013, the human 
rights component was recognized in key reports and at high-level events, such as the report 
of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda9 and 
the global thematic and national consultations reports of the United Nations Development 
Group. During the high-level panel discussion on human rights mainstreaming held by the 
Human Rights Council at its twenty-second session, the Secretary-General endorsed the 
recommendation made by the United Nations System Task Team on the Post-2015 
Development Agenda that human rights, equality and sustainability should be the three 
fundamental principles of the post-2015 development agenda.  
</p>
<p>50. In May 2013, I launched a publication entitled &#8220;Who Will Be Accountable? Human 
Rights and the Post-2015 Development Agenda&#8221;.10 The Office worked on developing

<p>51. In June, to promote human rights further in inter-governmental discussions on the 
post-2015 agenda, I addressed an open letter to all Member States in which I called for a 
new universal and balanced development framework that addressed both freedom from fear 
and freedom from want, without discrimination, and for the post-2015 development 
framework to be based upon and aligned with international human rights standards and 
principles.  
</p>
<p>52. OHCHR strengthened its cooperation with the Directorate General for Development 
and Cooperation of the European Commission with a view to raising awareness and 
understanding of the human rights-based approach to development. The Office also worked 
closely with the authorities in Ecuador, Palestine and Sierra Leone to mainstream human 
rights in national development plans. In Mauritania, OHCHR initiated and organized the 
first ever national consultations on human rights in the context of the post-2015 
development agenda. 
</p>
<p>53. The mainstreaming of human rights into United Nations development policies, 
operations and programming is a core element of the High Commissioner&#8217;s mandate. As 
the Chair of the United Nations Development Group human rights mainstreaming 
mechanism, OHCHR leads inter-agency efforts to integrate human rights more solidly and 
consistently in development policy and practice.  
</p>
<p>54. OHCHR published good practices from the field, supported eight in-country 
mainstreaming projects, provided inputs to the review of the Resident Coordinator's terms 
of reference and to the One Programme guidance of the United Nations Development 
Group, initiated work on updating the United Nations system&#8217;s guidance for Resident 
Coordinators on human rights, began supporting the leadership of Resident Coordinators on 
human rights, and contributed to the United Nations system&#8217;s advocacy for human rights in 
the post-2015 development agenda. The United Nations Development Group human rights 
mainstreaming mechanism has generated considerable interest in the mainstreaming efforts 
of the United Nations and heightened the visibility of human rights at the global, regional 
and local levels. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>55. OHCHR remains committed to redressing the relative neglect of economic, social 
and cultural rights. The Office has developed basic tools and guidance on these rights and 
has sharpened its focus on their monitoring and technical support. It has actively supported 
the mainstreaming of economic, social and cultural rights into the United Nations system in 
close cooperation with the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, WHO and UN-Water, as well as through 
inter-agency mechanisms such as the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the Secretary-
General&#8217;s High-level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis. 
</p>
<p>56. Greater efforts to protect and promote economic, social and cultural rights are 
essential, particularly in the light of the challenges posed to their enjoyment, such as the raft 
of austerity measures imposed in many countries as the preferred response to the financial 
and economic crises, climate change and the increasing pressure on scarce resources. In 
July 2013, I submitted to the Economic and Social Council a report on the impact of </p>


<p>austerity measures on economic and social rights, particularly on the rights to work and 
social security.11  
</p>
<p>57. In July and August, OHCHR organized two major expert consultations to discuss 
emerging issues with regard to economic and social rights: on the right to health in armed 
conflict, and on the right to social security. 
</p>
<p>58. OHCHR provided support regarding the right to adequate housing and land-related 
rights in various States, including Cambodia, Colombia, Fiji, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Papua New Guinea, Serbia, Tajikistan and Turkey. In Haiti, the human rights component of 
the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti is raising awareness on protection issues 
in camps hosting internally displaced persons and on illegal forced evictions. The Office 
also provided support on the rights to health and to water in the Republic of Moldova, and 
on the right to food in Guatemala and in southern African countries. OHCHR supported 
capacity-building in the monitoring of economic, social and cultural rights in Haiti, 
Palestine, Slovenia and Tunisia and for the judicial protection of economic, social and 
cultural rights in Chile and Guatemala. It also supported the inclusion of economic and 
social rights in the development planning process in Uganda and the development of human 
rights indicators, including for economic, social and cultural rights, in Albania, Bolivia 
(Plurinational State of), Kazakhstan, Mexico, Paraguay and Serbia. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Migration 
</b></p>
<p>59. Over the past four years, OHCHR has significantly stepped up its work on human 
rights issues related to migration. In the period under review, the Office continued to 
promote the integration of human rights norms and standards in all aspects of migration 
policy at the national, regional and international level. Through its field presences, OHCHR 
also increasingly engaged in migration-related work by promoting relevant international 
human rights instruments, including the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, as well as training 
activities, advocacy, technical assistance, monitoring and protection. 
</p>
<p>60. In September, at the request of the Secretary-General, OHCHR issued an analytical 
report entitled &#8220;Migration and Human Rights: Improving human rights-based governance 
of international migration&#8221;,12 in which it identified important elements of a forward-looking 
global agenda on migration and human rights.  
</p>
<p>61. In September, OHCHR held in Geneva a high-level meeting on migration and 
human rights with the aim of drawing attention to the human rights of migrants within the 
context of the forthcoming international discussions on migration.  
</p>
<p>62. I welcome the adoption by the General Assembly, in October, of the Declaration of 
the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development,13 in which the 
Assembly reaffirmed the need to promote and protect effectively the human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of all migrants, regardless of their status. During the Dialogue, I 
called for a paradigm shift on migration, highlighting the need for the international 
community to put in place human rights-based responses to migration, including a 
presumption against immigration detention and ensuring that all border governance 
measures comply with human rights standards and principles.

 General Assembly resolution 68/4. </p>


<p>63. OHCHR has remained an active member of the Global Migration Group, including 
in the context of the Group&#8217;s internal review process. Through its input, OHCHR sought to 
enhance and strengthen inter-agency coordination of migration and to bolster the Group&#8217;s 
mandate to promote the wider application of all relevant instruments and norms relating to 
migration. OHCHR is currently the chair of the working group on migration, human rights 
and gender recently established by the Group, and leads a number of activities within the 
&#8220;human rights and gender equality&#8221; stream of the Group&#8217;s multi-annual work plan. 
OHCHR also continued its efforts to heighten attention to human rights within the work 
programme of the Global Forum on Migration and Development.  
</p>
<p>64. OHCHR advocated for the inclusion of the human rights of migrants within the 
post-2015 development agenda, including in the context of the thematic consultations on 
population dynamics and on inequalities, and relevant technical briefs submitted to the open 
working group. The Office&#8217;s input highlighted that migrants should be visibly integrated 
into the new agenda as full and equal subjects of development.  
</p><p>65. OHCHR provided technical assistance to States and regional and subregional 
organizations on the application of a rights-based approach to addressing trafficking. In 
Ukraine, in March 2013, OHCHR officially launched the Recommended Principles and 
Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking. In May, four training courses on 
countering trafficking were held in Belarus, which brought together law enforcement 
officials from 13 Member States. OHCHR also engaged with the Inter-agency Coordination 
Group against Trafficking in Persons to promote the United Nations Global Plan of Action 
to Combat Trafficking in Persons.14 
</p>
<p><b> E. Violence and insecurity 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Human rights, peace and security 
</b></p>
<p>66. Progress was achieved in making human rights issues and considerations a guiding 
element of United Nations peacekeeping operations. I have appreciated the continued 
opportunity to brief the Security Council on human rights protection in armed conflict and 
on specific country situations. This critical interaction seems to confirm the growing 
recognition by the Council of the centrality of human rights to the peace and security 
agenda.  
</p><p>67. OHCHR worked further to ensure the strengthening of human rights mandates of 
peace operations in the resolutions adopted by the Security Council. It contributed to 
system-wide country-specific task forces, and undertook advocacy with States for the firm 
integration of human rights into efforts to restore peace and security. We encouraged 
greater efforts to prevent the exposure of men, women and children to serious human rights 
violations in situations of violence and conflict, including more sustained efforts to pursue 
accountability of perpetrators and redress for victims. 
</p>
<p>68. OHCHR continued to monitor situations of human rights and to investigate human 
rights violations in often challenging conditions. In March 2013, owing to lack of access to 
the Syrian Arab Republic, OHCHR deployed a team to neighbouring countries to collect 
information on human rights violations committed in the context of the conflict. In January 
and June, OHCHR released two casualty figure analyses, which were part of a unique effort 
to obtain an estimation of the number of casualties in the conflict since March 2011. 
</p>
<p>

 General Assembly resolution 64/293, annex. </p>


<p>69. In February 2013, I deployed a fact-finding mission to Mali to investigate gross 
human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>70. In July 2013, I deployed a fact-finding mission to the Central African Republic to 
look into human rights violations committed since December 2012. In September, I 
presented the findings in a report to the Human Rights Council.15 In the light of the 
deteriorating situation, an OHCHR monitoring team conducted a mission to the country in 
December to support the work of the human rights component of the United Nations 
Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic.  
</p>
<p>71. In 2013, OHCHR human rights teams were also deployed to Rakhine, Myanmar to 
monitor the situation and to advise the United Nations country team with regard to inter-
communal violence and the treatment of internally displaced persons. In July, at the request 
of the United Nations Resident Coordinator, a human rights officer was temporarily 
deployed to Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>72. My Office supported international commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions 
mandated by the Human Rights Council in the Syrian Arab Republic and the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, and provided them with advice on investigation methodology 
and tools for recording, analysing and archiving information. 
</p>
<p>73. Building on 20 years of experience in supporting almost 40 commissions of inquiry 
and fact-finding missions, including those mandated by the High Commissioner, OHCHR 
issued a publication containing guidance on and practice in international commissions of 
inquiry and fact-finding missions to support the work of States, commissions of inquiry and 
fact-finding missions and other relevant actors. In November, in cooperation with the 
Government of Switzerland, OHCHR brought together former members and staff of 
commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions, Member States, non-governmental 
organizations and academic institutions to share their experiences and lessons learned with 
the aim of increasing the effectiveness and impact of such bodies. 
</p>
<p>74. A new version of the internal OHCHR human rights case database was developed; it 
is a case management system designed to systematize, harmonize and improve the 
collection, documentation, analysis and reporting of violations of human rights and 
international humanitarian law. In 2013, it was rolled out in the United Nations Mission in 
South Sudan, the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo and the United Nations Operation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, and is thus now 
used by 14 OHCHR human rights field presences.  
</p>
<p>75. OHCHR continued to support the development of national capacity on human rights 
monitoring by means of training for civil society organizations, for instance from Maldives 
and Sri Lanka.  
</p>
<p>76. In Guatemala, OHCHR provided technical assistance in building a methodology to 
map social conflicts, in particular those related to the protection of indigenous lands rights, 
including by analysing root causes, common patterns and the responsibility of the State.  
</p>
<p>77. In 2013, as part of its responsibilities to develop human rights policy and training for 
United Nations peacekeeping operations and political missions, OHCHR collaborated with 
the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Political Affairs and the 
Department of Field Support to develop guidance and training on integrating human rights 
into all aspects of mission work and to contribute to the conceptualization, planning and 
staffing of the human rights components of new peace missions in Mali and Somalia, and to 
the strengthening of the human rights capacity in the Central African Republic. 
</p>
<p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>15
 A/HRC/24/59 and Corr.1. </p>


<p>78. OHCHR contributed to the implementation of the policy on human rights screening 
of United Nations personnel, endorsed by the Secretary-General to ensure that the 
Secretariat does not recruit or deploy any senior staff member who has violated 
international human rights or humanitarian law. OHCHR co-chairs, jointly with Office of 
Human Resources Management, the Secretariat-wide working group on screening of United 
Nations personnel, and actively participated in the review process of the policy by 
accumulating lessons learned, including challenges and initial results. 
</p>
<p>79. Two years after its adoption, the human rights due diligence policy on United 
Nations support to non-United Nations security forces has proved its value as a tool to 
assist principled and effective engagement in situations where risks of serious human rights 
violations by regional and national security forces with which the United Nations is 
partnering are high. The policy has garnered strong support from Member States and civil 
society actors, and has been frequently referred to by the Security Council. OHCHR 
supported the implementation of this critical policy by developing additional guidelines, 
advising United Nations peace missions, United Nations country teams and individual 
United Nations entities on the development of procedures and risk assessments, and by 
facilitating lessons learning.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Engagement in humanitarian action 
</b></p>
<p>80. In May, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and I presented a joint 
paper to the Inter-Agency Standing Committee on the protection of human rights in 
humanitarian crises, bearing in mind the conclusions made in the report of the Secretary-
General&#8217;s Internal Review Panel on United Nations action in Sri Lanka. The Committee 
consequently included human rights protection as one of its five priorities for the period 
2013-2015. Furthermore, human rights protection has been included as a standing item of 
the agenda of the Committee Working Group for 2014-2015.  
</p>
<p>81.  OHCHR also contributed to the Transformative Agenda protocols, and committed a 
number of staff to the inter-agency rapid response mechanisms. OHCHR staff members are 
applying the new arrangements for the humanitarian programme cycle to the 2014 strategic 
planning for humanitarian responses to a number of crises.  
</p>
<p>82. OHCHR field presences continued to lead protection clusters in Haiti, Mauritania 
and Palestine, and to co-lead in the Pacific. They also actively engaged in supporting 
humanitarian coordinators and country teams, as well as protection clusters or protection 
forums, through the work of human rights field presences (in Mali and Yemen) or rapid 
response teams (in the Central African Republic, Mali and Myanmar). In November, 
OHCHR sent a team to the Philippines to support the United Nations Resident Coordinator 
and the country team in the aftermath of typhoon Yolanda.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Human rights mechanisms and development of international law 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Treaty bodies  
</b></p>
<p>83. Following the extension of the intergovernmental process for strengthening the 
human rights treaty body system, ultimately until February 2014, OHCHR continued to 
provide support to the co-facilitators of the process. In addition to facilitating informal 
consultations with all treaty bodies, civil society and the Human Rights Council, OHCHR 
organized, in April 2013, a workshop on developing the capacity of States to report to 
treaty bodies and to follow-up on concluding observations. In order to foster synergy 
between the treaty bodies and the intergovernmental process, the annual meeting of the 
chairpersons of treaty bodies was organized in New York, in May. Furthermore, my Office 
finalized a comprehensive cost assessment of the treaty body system as requested by the </p>


<p>General Assembly. It constitutes an unprecedented effort to detail the complexity, workload 
and full cost of this principal axis of the United Nations human rights system. 
</p>
<p>84. In 2013, OHCHR facilitated the review of 130 State party reports by the various 
treaty bodies, the adoption of views and decisions of more than 100 individual 
communications, and six country visits by the Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture. 
OHCHR continued to provide technical assistance to support reporting, ratification, 
institution-building and follow-up to recommendations of treaty bodies, both at 
headquarters and through field presences.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Humanitarian funds  
</b></p>
<p>85. As of April 2013, the Special Fund established by the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture is administered by the joint secretariat of the United Nations 
Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture and the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on 
Contemporary Forms of Slavery with a view to increasing cost-effectiveness, pooling 
expertise and sharing best practices. In 2013, 332 grants were awarded through these funds 
in almost 90 countries. While there is tangible impact on beneficiaries as a result of support 
from these funds, I am concerned at the decreasing level of contributions made to them. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Human Rights Council  
</b></p>
<p>86. In 2013, the Human Rights Council continued to address various urgent and chronic 
human rights situations. It extended further the mandate of the commission of inquiry on 
the Syrian Arab Republic and, following an urgent debate, requested in its resolution 23/1 
the commission to urgently inquire into the events in Al Qusayr and to report to the Council 
at its twenty-fourth session. At its twenty-second session, the Council established a 
commission of inquiry on the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to investigate the 
systematic, widespread and grave human rights violations committed in the country. I 
regret to report that neither of these missions has been granted access to the countries 
concerned.  
</p>
<p>87. OHCHR continued to organize a large number of panel discussions on a broad array 
of issues, significantly enriching the Council&#8217;s deliberations. In addition to the regular 
annual panel discussions, the Council held panel discussions on the impact of corruption, 
the contribution of parliaments to the work of the Council and its universal periodic review 
mechanism, business and human rights, democracy and the rule of law, the human rights of 
children of parents sentenced to the death penalty or executed, and the twentieth 
anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Universal periodic review  
</b></p>
<p>88. By November, all 42 States to be reviewed in 2013 in the second cycle of the 
universal periodic review had undergone the process. This full participation highlighted the 
importance attached to the universality of the process, with a welcomed continuation of 
high-level participation and interest commensurate to the opportunities that the review 
mechanism offers. 
</p>
<p>89. The second cycle demonstrated a strong engagement of Member States, most of 
which sent high-level delegations to present and discuss their record before the Human 
Rights Council. A growing number of States initiated consultations, including with civil 
society, to monitor progress in the implementation of their commitments, and a number of 
States established permanent mechanisms to lead and coordinate the review process. The 
reports under review provided a description of human rights issues and developments, the 
progress achieved in the implementation of recommendations made during the first cycle, </p>


<p>and constraints and challenges. Several States also reported on recommendations that they 
had not initially supported during the previous review, a practice that should be encouraged.  
</p>
<p>90. Furthermore, the universality of coverage of the review mechanism has enabled or 
even strengthened the interaction with the United Nations human rights machinery of States 
that had relatively little experience in that regard. Pacific Island States addressing the 
Human Rights Council, shared their concerns and priorities, and contributed to raising 
awareness on issues that are not systematically part of the human rights debate, such as the 
impact of climate change on the enjoyment of human rights.  
</p><p>91. These various developments have confirmed and consolidated the universality of the 
universal periodic review process, which remains one of the main features of the United 
Nations and the establishment of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>92. OHCHR continued to prepare the documentation that informs the review debates 
and to support parties involved in the review. Requests to OHCHR to provide information, 
advice, technical cooperation and other forms of assistance in follow up on the review grew 
steadily, emanating from all regions. The two universal periodic review trust funds enabling 
States to prepare for and participate in the review, and to implement review outcomes,16 
have been increasingly supported by donors and used by States and other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>93. With the support of all Member States, the universal periodic review mechanism 
must face the challenge of following up on an increasing number of recommendations and 
ensure impact on the human rights situation on the ground. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Special procedures  
</b></p>
<p>94. As at November, 51 special procedures mandates were supported by OHCHR, 
including new mandates on the rights of older persons, the situation of human rights in 
Mali, and the Central African Republic. During the period under review, special procedures 
mandate holders conducted 75 country visits. The number of States that had issued standing 
invitations for special procedures rose to 94, although, regrettably they were not always 
honoured. As at November 2013, special procedures had issued 497 communications to 115 
States, 81.9 per cent jointly by two or more mandates. The response rate to communications 
remained low, at 42.9 per cent. 
</p>
<p>95. Throughout the year, the special procedures continued their efforts to give a voice to 
victims and to ensure that civil society concerns are heard within the United Nations and by 
the broader public. The thematic and country expertise of the special procedures system 
helps to shed light on a wide range of human rights issues arising from new developments 
against a backdrop of international human rights law. Through that work, they complement 
my Office&#8217;s efforts under the various thematic priorities. I reiterate my call to all Member 
States to cooperate with the special procedures and to protect those cooperating with the 
United Nations system from an unacceptable exposure to acts of reprisal.  
</p>
<p>96. OHCHR continued to lend full support to special procedures mandate holders, 
including by contributing to research and reports, and visits and consultations. It also 
continued to encourage and support greater coordination and harmonization of working 
methods among special procedures mandates, including through the Coordinating 
Committee. 
</p>
<p>97. A total of 27 special procedures mandate holders will be appointed in 2014; it is 
critical to ensure the quality of the selected candidates in accordance with the procedures 
and criteria established by the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16
 See A/HRC/24/56. </p>


<p><b> 6. Progressive development of international law 
</b></p>
<p>98. During my term as High Commissioner, substantial progress has been registered in 
the normative development of economic, social and cultural rights. The Optional Protocol 
to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights entered into force in 
May, constituting a historical development that reaffirmed the justiciability of economic, 
social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>99. In 2013, several treaty bodies supported by OHCHR adopted general comments and 
recommendations addressing economic, social and cultural rights. The Committee on the 
Rights of the Child adopted a general comment on the right of the child to health, while the 
Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families adopted a general comment on the rights of migrant workers in an irregular 
situation. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women adopted 
general recommendations on the economic consequences of marriage, family relations and 
their dissolution, and on women in conflict prevention, conflict and post-conflict situations. 
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination adopted a general 
recommendation on combating racist hate speech. 
</p>
<p>100. In collaboration with the Working Group on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises, OHCHR convened the second 
annual Forum on Business and Human Rights in December, which gathered more than 
1,700 participants. In August, in Medellin, Colombia, it supported the organization of the 
first Regional Forum on Business and Human Rights. OHCHR advocated for the promotion 
of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights within the United Nations, 
following the recommendations of the Secretary-General,17 and provided interpretive 
guidance on the application of the Guiding Principles to stakeholders.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions  
</b>101. <b>OHCHR has continued to build in significant and vital ways on the advances 
made since it was established more than 20 years ago. In the exercise of its mandate, 
OHCHR has further ensured that the centrality of human rights to the work of the 
United Nations system as a whole is recognized as it significantly contributed to the 
promotion of the full realization of all human rights for all.  
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>My Office has provided strong substantive support to the United Nations 
human rights mechanisms with a view to maximising their efficiency and 
responsiveness to all human rights violations. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>OHCHR has become an increasingly authoritative advocate for victims of 
human rights violations across the globe. It is a voice for the voiceless, reminding 
States of their commitments under international human rights law.  
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>In an increasingly complex world, we need to do our utmost to revive the spirit 
of the Vienna Declaration, which articulated with unequivocal clarity the inherent 
nature of the dignity and human rights that belong to all human beings, regardless of 
their differences, and the universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated 
nature of all human rights. We also need to fulfil the promises made in the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action and the Durban Review outcome document, 
and advance in the global struggle against racism and xenophobia.

<p>105. <b>We must recall the imperative of dignity set forth in the Declaration on the 
Right to Development, and return to the vision of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, mandating, as it did, a solid and international order in which all the rights and 
freedoms in the Declaration can be fully realized.
