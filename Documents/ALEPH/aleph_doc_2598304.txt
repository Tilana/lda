What is EOR?







Specialist secondary  & tertiary method of oil recovery
Successfully deployed for nearly 50 years
Can extract 20-40% more than primary recovery
Substantially increase oil recovery & productive life
Attractive economics even in low oil price markets
Used extensively in North America & Middle East
136 CO2 EOR projects in North America
US CO2 EOR project success ratio
Value
Sweet Spot
Source: Advances in Enhanced Oil Recovery Processes – Romero-Zeron – University of New Brunswick (2012)
Source: Oil & Gas Journal/Pennwell 2016 EOR Survey Report
For every barrel of oil extracted from oil fields in primary recovery phase, there remains
3-4 barrels of stranded oil left in the ground
Canary Networks-Investor Roadshow Presentation  – 30-31 August 2016

How does CO2 EOR work?
 CO2 EOR answers the question “How do I
profitably get more out of what I already own?”
Secure CO2
supply
Transport 
via pipeline
or truck
Inject into
oil field
 Proven production engineering technique
 Most commonly-used form of EOR
 Over 130 projects delivered in North America
with 90%+ success rate
 Most efficient EOR approach recovering highest
percentage of remaining oil
 Accounts for ~60% of US EOR production
 CO2 sourced from natural accumulations and
man-made sources
 Effectively “recycles” the entire oil field – wells,
facilities & pipelines
 Only stand-alone profitable form of carbon 
capture & storage – no subsidies required
Known as “Green Oil” because stores underground more CO2 than it generates

Singleton South Project - Overview
 NE extension of Denver-Julesburg Basin - southern leg of
Singleton CO2 EOR Field redevelopment project

Targeting by-passed oil pay in Muddy Formation sands – same 
pay intervals as Grieve Project
 Project based on 3-stage appraisal & development program
 Appraisal stage based on re-entering existing Devon Opis-1P
and Opis-1H wells acquired from Devon Nov 2015
 Appraisal stage capital cost estimated at USD 3.8 million


Following appraisal production test success commence 
horizontal in-fill drilling program Q1 2017
Full field development based on 32-well horizontal well field 
development program
