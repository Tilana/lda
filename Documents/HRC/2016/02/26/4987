<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 In this addendum to his report, the Special Rapporteur analyses a trend that has 
accelerated following the 2008 global food price crisis: large-scale acquisitions and leases 
of land. 
</p>
<p> It is estimated that between 15 and 20 million hectares of farmland in developing 
countries have been subject to transactions or negotiations involving foreign investors since 
2006. The Special Rapporteur examines the potential impact on the human right to 
adequate food, recalling the relevant obligations imposed on States under international 
human rights law. 
</p>
<p> On the basis of this analysis, the Special Rapporteur proposes a set of core 
principles and measures for host States and investors. These principles are intended to 
inform current initiatives such as the adoption of guidelines on land policies and 
governance by international and regional organizations. Their main aim is to ensure that 
negotiations leading to land acquisitions and leases comply with a number of procedural 
requirements, including the informed participation of local communities. They also seek to 
ensure adequate benefit-sharing, and a proviso that under no circumstances should such 
transactions be allowed to trump the human rights obligations of States.

</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, presents this 
addendum to his annual report, submitted under Human Rights Council resolution 10/12. 
The addendum is based on a draft released in June 2009 that attracted considerable 
attention from a range of stakeholders and served as a source of inspiration to the round 
table on the promotion of responsible investment in agriculture convened on 23 September 
2009 in the margins of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly.1 
</p>
<p>2. Large-scale acquisitions and leases have accelerated following the 2008 global food 
price crisis. Some major food-importing, capital-exporting countries appear to have lost 
confidence in global markets as a stable and reliable source of food. Private investors, 
including investment funds, are increasingly attracted to agriculture, and increasingly 
speculate on farmland. In this addendum to his report, the Special Rapporteur analyses how 
these investments could impact on the right to food. Recalling the obligations of States 
under international human rights law, he seeks to provide guidance to ensure that these 
investment agreements do not lead to violations of the human right to adequate food. 
</p>
<p>3. Under article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, every State is obliged to ensure for everyone under its jurisdiction access to the 
minimum essential food which is sufficient, nutritionally adequate, and safe to ensure their 
freedom from hunger.2 The obligations of the State are threefold: to respect, protect and 
fulfil the human right to food. The State is obliged to refrain from infringing on the ability 
of individuals and groups to feed themselves where such an ability exists (respect), and to 
prevent others &#8212; in particular private actors such as firms &#8212; from encroaching on that 
ability (protect). Finally, the State is called upon to actively strengthen the ability of 
individuals to feed themselves (fulfil). 
4. The right to food framework contributes important lessons to the debate on large-
scale land acquisitions or leases. The arrival of investors in agriculture may present certain 
opportunities, but there are also important human rights challenges, and investments that 
can affect land rights are a particular source of concern. The human right to food would be 
violated if people depending on land for their livelihoods, including pastoralists, were cut 
off from access to land, without suitable alternatives; if local incomes were insufficient to 
compensate for the price effects resulting from the shift towards the production of food for 
exports; or if the revenues of local smallholders were to fall following the arrival on 
domestic markets of cheaply priced food, produced on the more competitive large-scale 
plantations developed thanks to the arrival of the investor. In concluding agreements on 
large-scale land acquisitions or leases, States should take into account the rights of current 
land users in the areas where the investment is made, as well as the rights of workers 
employed on the farms. They should also be guided by the need to ensure the right to self-
determination and the right to development of the local population. 
</p>
<p>5. A number of principles based on existing human rights law are put forward by the 
Special Rapporteur in the annex to this report, in order to inform current initiatives, such as 
the adoption of guidelines on land policies and governance by international and regional 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The round table was co-chaired by the Government of Japan, the World Bank, the Food and 
</p>
<p>Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural 
Development (IFAD), and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. It involved 31 
governments and 13 organizations.

</p>
<p>organizations. But neither host States nor investors should wait until such guidelines are 
adopted, to act in accordance with human rights. The home States of private investors are 
also under an obligation to regulate the conduct of these investors abroad, particularly if the 
host State appears unwilling or unable to do so.3 Development banks, including the World 
Bank and its private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation, which are bound by 
international human rights law as part of general international law,<footnote name="4">7
 A/HRC/4/18, annex I. </footnote> should immediately 
make their support to any large-scale investment in farmland conditional upon compliance 
with the minimum principles described below. These principles are not optional; they 
follow from existing international human rights norms.  
</p>
<p>6. An initiative is currently under way within the Food and Agriculture Organization of 
the United Nations (FAO), in collaboration with its partners, including UN-Habitat, the 
World Bank, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, governments, and civil 
society, to work towards voluntary guidelines on responsible governance of tenure of land 
and other natural resources. The process of elaboration of these guidelines is inclusive, and 
it seeks to build ownership of the guidelines, in particular by States, through a number of 
regional consultations. The Special Rapporteur is fully supportive of this process. The 
minimum human rights principles set out below and summarized in the annex to this report 
should be seen as a minimum safeguard and not as a substitute for more operational 
guidelines; nor do they compete with such guidelines. Like FAO and its partners, the 
Special Rapporteur is convinced that it is in the interest of all, investors (whether public or 
private) and host States alike, that investments in land are made responsibly. Otherwise 
they will not be sustainable and may increase social conflict. These principles should be 
seen as a contribution to the broader and more inclusive process, leading to more 
operational and detailed guidelines, which the Special Rapporteur welcomes. 
</p>
<p>7. Three provisos are in order. First, the debate on large-scale land acquisitions or 
leases, which this addendum seeks to inform, should not distract us from acknowledging 
that, to a large extent, the rush towards farmland in developing countries is the result of our 
own failures. We have failed in the past to adequately invest in agriculture and rural 
development in developing countries, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. We have failed to 
promote means of agricultural production which do not deplete the soils and exhaust 
groundwater reserves. And we are failing today to establish well-functioning and more 
reliable global markets for agricultural commodities. It would be unjustifiable to seek to 
</p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 See, e.g., Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comments No. 14 (2000) on 
</p>
<p>the right to the highest attainable standard of health (article 12 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), para. 39 and No. 15 (2002) on the right to water (arts. 11 and 
12), para. 31. In general comment No. 14, the Committee affirms that States parties should &#8220;prevent 
third parties from violating the right [protected under the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights] in other countries, if they are able to influence these third parties by way of legal 
or political means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and applicable international 
law&#8221;. Similarly, in 2007 the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on Canada 
to &#8220;&#8230; take appropriate legislative or administrative measures to prevent acts of transnational 
corporations registered in Canada which negatively impact on the enjoyment of rights of indigenous 
peoples in territories outside Canada. In particular, the Committee recommends that the State party 
explore ways to hold transnational corporations registered in Canada accountable&#8221; 
(CERD/C/CAN/CO/18, para. 17). See also report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises 
(A/HRC/8/5, para. 91).

<p>better regulate agreements on large-scale land acquisitions or leases, without addressing 
also, as a matter of urgency, these circumstances which make such agreements look like a 
desirable option. 
</p>
<p>8. Second, the Special Rapporteur has consistently insisted on the need for agricultural 
systems to support, as a priority, the production of food to respond to local needs. It is only 
to the extent that investments can improve local food security by increasing productivity 
and serving local markets, while avoiding an increase in inequalities of incomes in rural 
areas, that they are justified. It is this concern for local food security that guides, in 
particular, principle 8 of the set of principles listed in the annex to this report. 
</p>
<p>9. Third, the Special Rapporteur insists on the fact that the principles listed in the 
annex are minimum principles. This means that a large-scale investment in land will not 
necessarily be justified even though it may comply with the various principles listed. 
Indeed, these principles call for governments to carefully examine the opportunity costs 
involved in ceding land to an investor (principle 1); to examine alternatives to agreements 
that have an impact on land tenure (principle 4); and to perform a participatory impact 
assessment prior to the conclusion of such agreements (principle 9). In the vast majority of 
cases of large-scale investments examined by the Special Rapporteur, the benefits of the 
investment (in terms of creation of infrastructure, marketing opportunities, and access to 
credit) could be achieved &#8212; and work for the benefit of both the investor and the producer 
&#8212; by the use of other business models such as contract farming, without any change being 
made to the rights over the land. Such alternatives should be explored prior to any shift in 
rights over the land. Unless such alternatives are prioritized, the development of large-scale 
land acquisitions or leases will result in nothing less than an agrarian counter-reform; such 
a consequence would be completely unacceptable and run directly counter to the realization 
of the right to food, further marginalizing the communities that depend on access to land for 
their livelihoods. 
</p>
<p>10. The principles listed in the annex are relevant to large-scale investments in farmland 
by foreign investors, whether private or public. But the current speculation on land and 
commercial pressures on land users stem, for the most part, from national investors, 
particularly in a context in which the renewed interest in agricultural investment threatens 
to increase land concentration. While these principles are not applicable in full to such 
pressures, the Special Rapporteur intends to prepare a thematic report on the issue of land 
rights for presentation to the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The context 
</b></p>
<p>11. Over the past three to four years, private investors and governments have shown a 
growing interest in the acquisition or long-term lease of large portions of arable land (above 
1,000 ha) in a number of countries, mostly in the developing world. According to an 
estimate from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), between 15 and 20 
million hectares of farmland in developing countries have been the subject of transactions 
or negotiations involving foreign investors since 2006. This figure is equal to the total area 
of farmland in France and to a fifth of all the farmland of the European Union. The land 
which has been most in demand is that which is close to water resources and can therefore 
be irrigated at a relatively low cost in terms of infrastructure, and land which is closest to 
markets and from which produce can be easily exported. Among the main target countries 
in sub-Saharan Africa are Cameroon, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,5

 China is said to have acquired 2.8 million hectares in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to create 
</p>
<p>the world&#8217;s largest oil palm plantation (<i>New Zealand Herald</i>, 14 May 2009). </p>

<p>Ghana, Madagascar,6 Mali,7 Somalia, Sudan,8 United Republic of Tanzania9 and Zambia. 
But target countries are also in Central Europe, in Asia and in Latin America; among them 
are Brazil, Cambodia,10 Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan,11 the Philippines,12 Russia and 
Ukraine.13 Developing countries in general, and sub-Saharan Africa in particular, are 
targeted because of the perception that there is plenty of land available, because the climate 
is favourable to the production of crops, because local labour is inexpensive and because 
the land is still relatively cheap. In 2003, FAO estimated that an additional 120 million ha 
&#8212; an area twice the size of France or one-third that of India &#8212; will be needed to support 
the growth in food production by 2030, without considering the compensation required for 
what are certain to be losses resulting from unsustainable forms of agricultural production.14 
This expansion will occur mainly in developing countries. Since about 95 per cent of the 
cropland in Asia has already been utilized, it is in Latin America and Africa that most of the 
demand for increased arable land will be concentrated. Indeed, it is in these regions that the 
2002 joint FAO/International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis Global Agro-
ecological Assessment suggests that most of the world&#8217;s reserve agricultural land (up to 80 
per cent) is located.15 
12. The development of large-scale land leases or acquisitions can be explained by (a) 
the rush towards the production of agrofuels as an alternative to fossil fuels, a development 
encouraged by fiscal incentives and subsidies in developed countries; (b) the growth of 
population and urbanization, combined with the exhaustion of natural resources, in certain

<p>countries, which therefore see large-scale land acquisitions as a means to achieve long-term 
food security; (c) increased concerns of certain countries about the availability of fresh 
water, which in a number of regions is becoming a scarce commodity; (d) increased 
demand for certain raw commodities from tropical countries, particularly fibre and other 
wood products; (e) expected subsidies for carbon storage through plantation and avoided 
deforestation;16 and (f) particularly as far as private investors are concerned, speculation on 
future increases in the price of farmland. While this phenomenon is not entirely new, it has 
accelerated since the global food price crisis of 2007&#8211;2008, because the markets for 
agricultural commodities are seen to be increasingly unstable and volatile, and therefore 
less reliable for net food-importing countries, particularly following the decision by a 
number of large food-exporting countries to ban exports or to raise export levies during the 
spring of 2008. As a result, resource-poor but cash-rich countries have turned to large-scale 
acquisitions or rent of land in order to achieve food security.17 This has also led private 
investors, including large investment funds, to acquire land for merely speculative motives, 
because of the conviction that the price of arable land will continue to rise in the future.  
</p>
<p>13. This development presents certain opportunities. For many years, agriculture has 
been neglected, both in domestic public policies and in development cooperation, and has 
failed to attract foreign direct investment, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. It is in 
principle welcome that this is changing. More investment in rural areas can be particularly 
effective in reducing poverty, where it is concentrated. The arrival of investment has the 
potential to create employment, both on and off farm (in associated processing industries, 
for instance); to lead to transfer of technologies; to improve the access of local producers to 
markets at domestic, regional and international level; and to increase public revenues 
through taxation and export duties. For countries purchasing or leasing land abroad in order 
to grow staple crops, this means increased food security, since they will be less dependent 
on the international markets to acquire the food they need to feed their populations. The 
risks of lower productivity in agriculture in subtropical regions entailed by climate change 
and, in the future, increased costs of freight, may partially offset this advantage. 
</p>
<p>14. There are, however, also important risks in this development. In setting out the 
minimum human rights principles on which large-scale land acquisitions or leases should 
be based, the Special Rapporteur aims to provide guidance to States hosting such 
investments, in particular in their negotiations with foreign investors. States should be 
aware that, under certain conditions, foreign investors may seek to rely on existing 
investment agreements protecting them from expropriation and guaranteeing them fair and 
equitable treatment, in order to seek compensation for any loss of revenues which would 
result from restrictions imposed on their freedom to operate, unless such restrictions are 
clearly provided for in the investment agreement at the time it is concluded. It is therefore 
crucial that such circumstances be fully anticipated.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16
 This is the case particularly under the clean development mechanism (CDM) provided for in article 
</p>
<p>12 of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The 
CDM allows a country with an emission-reduction or emission-limitation commitment under the 
Protocol (Annex B Party) to implement an emission-reduction project in developing countries, in 
order to earn certified emission reduction (CER) credits, each equivalent to one ton of CO2. The 
CERs may be traded and can be counted towards meeting Kyoto targets.

development. </p>

</p>
<p><b> III. The human right to adequate food 
</b></p>
<p>15. Under article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, every State is obliged to ensure for everyone under its jurisdiction access to the 
minimum essential food which is sufficient, nutritionally adequate, and safe to ensure their 
freedom from hunger.18 States would be acting in violation of the human right to food if, by 
leasing or selling land to investors (whether domestic or foreign), they were depriving the 
local population of access to productive resources indispensable to their livelihoods. They 
would also be violating the right to food if they negotiated such agreements without 
ensuring that this will not result in food insecurity, for instance because this would create a 
dependency on foreign aid or on increasingly volatile and unpredictable international 
markets (as large proportions of the food produced as a result of the foreign investment 
would be shipped to the country of origin of the investor or sold on the international 
markets), or because the revenues of the most marginal local farmers would decrease as a 
result of the competition consequent on the arrival of such investors. During the global food 
price crisis of 2007&#8211;2008, the impacts of high food prices on international markets were 
significantly larger in countries with fewer domestic alternatives to internationally traded 
grains, whose prices increased the most (maize, wheat, and rice).19 Governments should be 
aware of the increased vulnerability which may result from increasing their dependency on 
international markets to achieve food security; the volatility of prices on international 
markets appears likely to increase and would make them even less reliable in the future 
than they have been in the past. 
</p>
<p>16. The need to preserve food security within the host country should be taken into 
account proactively in the negotiation of the investment agreements concerned. Depending 
on the circumstances of each country, specific provisions may have to be included: for 
instance a clause providing that a certain minimum percentage of the crops produced shall 
be sold on local markets, and that this percentage may increase, in proportions to be agreed 
in advance, if the prices of food commodities on international markets reach certain levels. 
Complementary measures may also have to be adopted by the host government, in support 
of local production; where local producers risk being negatively impacted by the arrival of 
low-priced food on the domestic markets as a result of the increased production made 
possible, at competitive prices, by foreign investment, support measures should be adopted 
allowing them to improve the productivity of local farmers. 
</p>
<p>17. In addition, the realization of the right to food may be pursued more effectively if 
host States and investors agree on a certain number of conditions according to which the 
investment will be made.  
</p>
<p>18. First, in countries facing high levels of rural poverty and in the absence of 
employment opportunities in other sectors, investors should be encouraged to establish and 
promote farming systems that are labour-intensive rather than focused on achieving the 
highest productivity per hectare. This requirement will ensure that investment agreements 
contribute to the fullest extent possible to reinforcing local livelihood options and in 
particular provide access to a living wage for the local population involved. It is important 
in this respect to note that, contrary to a widespread myth, large-scale plantations are not 
necessarily more productive than small-scale, family-operated farms: although there are 
economies of scale in the processing and marketing of agricultural production, for most

<p>crops there are no economies of scale in agricultural production. Since, in addition, family 
farms are much more labour-intensive, the interest of the local population may be better 
served, taking employment effects into account, by outgrower schemes than by the 
establishment of plantations operated by wage labour,20 although such schemes should 
comply with a number of conditions outlined in the main report of the Special Rapporteur 
on agribusiness and the right to food (A/HRC/13/33, paras. 43&#8211;45).  
19. A recent study based on large-scale land leases or acquisitions in four sub-Saharan 
countries notes in this regard that &#8220;the vast majority of documented projects continue to be 
run as large plantations based on concessions or leases. As large areas of land are 
commonly offered on very favourable terms, an incentive is created for establishing 
company-managed plantations rather than promoting contract farming approaches. Even 
&#8216;local content&#8217; provisions requiring prioritisation of the local workforce in recruitment, 
common in extractive industry contracts, appear rare [&#8230;]. There is enormous scope here for 
governments to develop systems of incentives to promote more inclusive business models 
among large-scale investors&#8221;.21 
</p>
<p>20. Second, it is vital that high environmental standards are complied with. A number of 
United Nations agencies, including the United Nations Environment Programme,22 FAO 
and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, have underscored the 
potential of sustainable farming to meet the growth in demand.23 Recently, the seventeenth 
session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development adopted a 
resolution recognizing that &#8220;sustainable agricultural practices as well as sustainable forest 
management can contribute to meeting climate change concerns&#8221;, and that &#8220;sustainable soil, 
land, livestock<b>, </b>forest, biodiversity and water management practices, and resilient crops are 
essential&#8221;;24 it also called for the creation of an enabling environment for sustainable 
agriculture.25

<p>(Italy), 18&#8211;20 April 2009, they also emphasized &#8220;the importance of increasing public and private 
investment in sustainable agriculture, rural development and environmental protection in cooperation 
with international organisations&#8221;, and the need to &#8220;tackle climate change impacts and ensure 
sustainable management of water, forests and other natural resources, while considering demographic 
growth&#8221;. </p>

<p>21. The development of more sustainable farming approaches is directly linked to the 
right to food, because of the strong link between the state of the environment and food 
production.26 Crops are dependent on soil nutrient availability, on water (ground and 
surface water for irrigation), on climate and on weather (rainfall and growth season), on the 
availability of insects for pollination, and on the abundance and effects of certain pests, 
such as pathogens, insects and weeds, which have a major impact on crops worldwide, 
particularly in Africa.27 Agricultural productivity thus depends on the services rendered by 
the ecosystems. Unless it shifts from being one of the major causes of climate change and 
soil degradation to being a net contributor to the maintenance of the environment, 
agricultural production will undergo significant declines in the future.28 Assuming a 4.4&#176; C 
increase in temperature and a 2.9 per cent increase in precipitation, it has been estimated 
that by 2080, global agricultural output potential is likely to decrease by about 6 per cent 
(or 16 per cent without carbon fertilization, the impacts of which are disputed). The decline 
will vary between 10 and 25 per cent across regions, but it is projected that by 2080, 
agricultural output potential may be reduced by up to 60 per cent for several African 
countries, and on average 16 to 27 per cent for others in Africa, dependent upon the effect 
of carbon fertilization.29 It is therefore vital that, as agriculture intensifies in order to meet 
the growing demand for food, it does so in ways which are environmentally sustainable.30 
</p>
<p>22. For these reasons, both investors and host States should cooperate in identifying 
ways to ensure that the modes of agricultural production respect the environment, and do 
not accelerate climate change, soil depletion, and the exhaustion of freshwater reserves. 
Depending on the circumstances and, particularly, on the local agro-ecological conditions, 
they may have to explore low external input farming practices as a means to meet this 
challenge.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. The rights of land users, and indigenous peoples in particular 
</b></p>
<p>23. In many developing countries and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, the rights of 
land users are not properly secured. Much of the land is formally owned by the State, and 
the land users have no property titles to the land they cultivate. In many cases too, a 
complex combination of property rights and users&#8217; rights results in a situation in which 
those who cultivate the land do not own it, although they may or may not be paying rent in 
cash or kind or may or may not have a formal agreement with the nominal owner. This 
situation is the source of legal uncertainty. It also implies that land users will not have 
access to legal remedies, and receive adequate compensation, if they are evicted from the 
land they cultivate, for instance after the Government has agreed that foreign investors take

<p>possession of the land. It is also important to recognize other use rights on land such as 
grazing and gathering wood, which are often critical sources of livelihood, especially for 
women. The rights of pastoralists in particular are generally neglected in public debates. 
Yet, as drylands constitute nearly half of the land area of sub-Saharan Africa, pastoralism is 
of particular importance for the continent: almost half of the total number of about 120 
million pastoralists/agro-pastoralists worldwide reside in sub-Saharan Africa, where the 
largest pastoral/agro-pastoral populations (of 7 million each) are in Sudan and Somalia, 
followed by Ethiopia with 4 million.31 In this context, there is a real risk that land 
considered &#8220;empty&#8221; or &#8220;idle&#8221; will be sold or leased to investors, including foreign investors, 
without taking into account the important services it renders to the local population.  
</p>
<p>24. It is essential therefore that no eviction takes place which would not comply with 
human rights requirements, as clarified in general comment No. 7 (1997) of the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the right to adequate housing (article 11 (1) of 
the Covenant): forced evictions, and in the basic principles and guidelines on development-
based evictions and displacement presented in 2007 by the former Special Rapporteur on 
the right to adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of 
living.32 These guidelines provide a practical tool to assist States and agencies in 
developing policies, legislation, procedures and preventive measures to ensure that forced 
evictions do not take place, and to provide effective remedies to those whose human rights 
have been violated, should prevention fail. They are based on the principle that no eviction 
shall take place unless &#8220;(a) authorized by law; (b) carried out in accordance with 
international human rights law; (c) undertaken solely for the purpose of promoting the 
general welfare; (d) reasonable and proportional; (e) regulated so as to ensure full and fair 
compensation and rehabilitation; and (f) carried out in accordance with the &#8230; guidelines&#8221;.33 
They provide guidance to States and agencies about which steps need to be taken prior to, 
during and after evictions, in order to minimize the negative impact of evictions on human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>25. According to the guidelines, &#8220;In order to secure a maximum degree of effective legal 
protection against the practice of forced evictions for all persons under their jurisdiction, 
States should take immediate measures aimed at conferring legal security of tenure upon 
those persons, households and communities currently lacking such protection, including all 
those who do not have formal titles to home and land.&#8221;34 
</p>
<p>26. Individual titling is certainly desirable in many circumstances, particularly in order 
to encourage land-related investment, to lower the cost of credit by allowing land to be used 
as collateral, and to encourage more sustainable farming, particularly by the planting of 
trees and more responsible use of the soil and water resources. However, individual titling 
may not offer sufficient protection where adequate macroeconomic conditions are not 
present, and when smallholders risk being priced out. Unless smallholders receive adequate 
support, the creation of markets for property rights over land may in fact lead to distress 
sales by smallholder farmers facing debts, for instance after a bad harvest, or to farmers 
being expelled from land used as collateral to guarantee repayment of a loan, and thus 
result in more land concentration. In addition, individual titling is not a solution for those 
land users who do not cultivate the land, for instance pastoralists. It may increase the risk of 
conflicts rather than limiting it, if important gaps exist between customary and traditional 
usage rights over land and the formal rights guaranteed through titling. Individual titling

<p>may not protect adequately the access of local communities to common goods; as noted by 
the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor in its final report, &#8220;In some legal 
cultures community-based ownership in natural resources such as grazing lands, forests, 
water, fisheries, and surface minerals are traditional and effective ways to grant control and 
proprietary rights to persons who have little or no other property. These systems should be 
both recognised and fully protected against arbitrary seizure.&#8221;35 An alternative to individual 
titling may therefore be collective registration, by local communities, of the land they use, 
in order to ensure that the land can only be converted to new uses with their free, prior and 
informed consent, and that they are fully involved in any negotiation with potential 
investors.  
</p>
<p>27. Access to land for indigenous peoples has been given specific forms of protection 
under international law. Articles 13 to 19 of ILO Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries relate to land rights. Under article 
8, paragraph 2 (b), of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
&#8220;States shall provide effective mechanisms for prevention of, and redress for, &#8230; any action 
which has the aim or effect of dispossessing [indigenous peoples] of their lands, territories 
or resources.&#8221; Under article 10 of the Declaration, they are guaranteed the right not to be 
forcibly removed from their lands or territories, and no relocation shall take place without 
their free, prior and informed consent and after agreement on just and fair compensation 
and, where possible, with the option of return. Articles 25 and 26 of the Declaration, in 
addition, recognize the distinctive spiritual relationship of indigenous peoples with their 
traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and used lands, and that they have the right to 
own, use, develop and control these lands. States must therefore give legal recognition and 
protection to these lands, territories and resources, with due respect to the customs, 
traditions and land tenure systems of the indigenous peoples concerned. 
</p>
<p>28. Perhaps most relevant here, article 32 of the Declaration embodies the principle of 
free, prior and informed consent. Paragraph 2 provides that &#8220;States shall consult and 
cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own 
representative institutions in order to obtain their free and informed consent prior to the 
approval of any project affecting their lands or territories and other resources, particularly 
in connection with the development, utilization or exploitation of mineral, water or other 
resources.&#8221; Indigenous peoples have often been victims of discrimination and 
marginalization; they have been ignored in public policies and excluded from the State. 
When governments enter into negotiations with an outside entity, whether private or 
governmental, there is a real risk that their interests and rights will not be taken into 
account, unless procedural safeguards are scrupulously complied with. 
</p>
<p><b> V. The human rights of agricultural workers 
</b></p>
<p>29. Among the people who are most vulnerable to food insecurity are the nearly half a 
billion women and men who help produce the food we all depend on: waged agricultural 
workers. Ensuring an adequate protection of this category of persons would constitute a 
major contribution to the alleviation of hunger. This is a challenge which is made more 
pressing by the increased investments in large-scale agricultural projects, in order to ensure 
food security and for the production of agrofuels. Reference is made to the challenges 
identified and recommendations made with regard to agricultural workers in the main

<p><b> VI. The negotiation of large-scale leases or acquisitions of land 
and the rights of local populations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The right to self-determination and the exploitation of natural 
resources 
</b></p>
<p>30. In article 1, paragraph 2, of both the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights the right to 
self-determination, defined as the right of all peoples to freely dispose of their natural 
wealth and resources, is recognized, and both covenants stipulate that no people may be 
deprived of its own means of subsistence. As regards indigenous peoples, this principle is 
further reaffirmed by article 3 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples. As recognized by the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights, the right to self-determination imposes on governments an obligation to protect 
individuals under their jurisdiction from being deprived of their access to productive 
resources, for instance as a result of the arrival of domestic and foreign investors.36 This 
corresponds to what the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination refers to as 
the internal aspect of the right to self-determination, understood as the rights of all peoples 
to pursue freely their economic, social and cultural development without outside 
interference. This right presents clear links with the right of every citizen to take part in the 
conduct of public affairs at any level, as referred to in article 5 (c) of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination37 and article 25 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as with the rights of 
minorities, which are recognized in article 27 of the Covenant.38 This further strengthens 
the principle already referred to above in section 3 according to which no people&#8217;s land, 
including in particular indigenous peoples, can have its use changed without prior 
consultation.39 
</p>
<p><b> B. The right to development: transparency and accountability in the use of 
revenues 
</b></p>
<p>31. It is essential that land leases or purchases are fully transparent, and that the 
revenues are used for the benefit of the local population. It would appear that, in some 
cases, land is leased at very low rents, or sold below market prices, or even given away 
against vague promises of employment creation or transfer of technology. However, while 
States have a right to engage in economic affairs, it is a corollary under the Declaration on 
the Right to Development that they should &#8220;formulate appropriate national development

<p>policies that aim at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and 
of all individuals, on the basis of their active, free and meaningful participation in 
development and in the fair distribution of the benefits resulting therefrom&#8221;.40 Development 
should be seen as a process which should benefit &#8220;the entire population and &#8230; all 
individuals on the basis of their active, free and meaningful participation in development 
and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom&#8221;.41 This requires that States 
ensure the adequate participation of the local communities concerned by land leases or 
purchases, and that the decision-making process is fully transparent.42 Participation is key 
to ensuring long-term sustainability and the success of investments.43 
</p>
<p>32. The revenues gained from these agreements should serve to fulfil the rights of the 
population, consistent with the duty of States to &#8220;ensure, inter alia, equality of opportunity 
for all in their access to basic resources, education, health services, food, housing, 
employment and the fair distribution of income&#8221;.44 Indeed, referring to the link between 
foreign direct investment and the fulfilment of Millennium Development Goal No. 8 to 
develop a global partnership for development, the Working Group on the right to 
development noted that the right to development &#8220;implies that foreign direct investment 
(FDI) should contribute to local and national development in a responsible manner, that is, 
in ways that are conducive to social development, protect the environment, and respect the 
rule of law and fiscal obligations in the host countries. The principles underlying the right 
to development, as mentioned above, further imply that all parties involved, i.e. investors 
and recipient countries, have responsibilities to ensure that profit considerations do not 
result in crowding out human rights protection. The impact of FDI should, therefore, be 
taken into account when evaluating progress in Goal 8 in the context of the right to 
development&#8221;.45 This argument is further strengthened by the obligation of all States to 
ensure the progressive realization of the right to adequate food, to the maximum of all 
available resources, as stated in article 2, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In addition, the State must proactively engage in 
activities intended to strengthen people&#8217;s access to and utilization of resources and the 
means to ensure their livelihood, including food security; it would be acting in violation of 
this obligation if it did not use the revenues available to move as expeditiously as possible 
towards that goal.46

concerned, but that presupposes that an appropriate institutional framework is in

negotiations leading to such agreements comply with a number of procedural 
requirements ensuring informed participation of the local communities and therefore 
adequate benefit-sharing, and that the agreements themselves take into account 
human rights which could be negatively impacted by such investments. Agreements to 
lease or cede large areas of land should under no circumstances be allowed to trump 
the human rights obligations of the States concerned. The host State is obliged to 
ensure the protection of human rights under its jurisdiction, and the investor has a 
responsibility to respect such rights and not to create obstacles to the State 
discharging its obligations under international law. Particularly where the investor is 
a private entity and the host State is unable or unwilling to act in accordance with its 
obligations, the home State of the investor must ensure that these obligations are 
complied with. The minimum principles listed in the annex seek to ensure that these 
responsibilities are met. </b></p>

</p>
<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Minimum human rights principles applicable to large-scale 
land acquisitions or leases 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principle 1: </b>The negotiations leading to investment agreements should be conducted in a 
fully transparent manner, and with the participation of the local communities whose access 
to land and other productive resources may be affected as a result of the investment 
agreement. In considering whether or not to conclude an agreement with an investor, the 
host government should always balance the advantages of entering into such an agreement 
against the opportunity costs involved, in particular when other uses could be made of the 
land available, which could be more conducive to the long-term needs of the local 
population concerned and the full realization of their human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Principle 2: </b>In general, any shifts in land use can only take place with the free, prior and 
informed consent of the local communities concerned. This is particularly important for 
indigenous communities, in view of the discrimination and marginalization to which they 
have historically been subjected. Forced evictions should only be allowed to occur in the 
most exceptional circumstances. They are only allowable under international law when they 
are in accordance with the locally applicable legislation, when they are justified as 
necessary for the general welfare, and when they are accompanied by adequate 
compensation and alternative resettlement or access to productive land. Prior to carrying 
out any evictions or shifts in land use which could result in depriving individuals of access 
to their productive resources, States should ensure that all feasible alternatives are explored 
in consultation with the affected persons, with a view to avoiding, or at least minimizing, 
the need to resort to evictions. In all cases, effective legal remedies or procedures should be 
provided to those who are affected by eviction orders.  
</p>
<p><b>Principle 3: </b>In order to ensure that the rights of local communities will be safeguarded at 
all times, States should adopt legislation protecting these and specifying in detail the 
conditions according to which shifts in land use, or evictions, may take place, as well as the 
procedures to be followed. Moreover, States should assist individuals and local 
communities in obtaining individual titles or collective registration of the land they use, in 
order to ensure that their rights will enjoy full judicial protection. Such legislation should be 
designed in accordance with the basic principles and guidelines on development-based 
evictions and displacement presented in 2007 by the former Special Rapporteur on the right 
to adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living,47 and 
with general comment No. 7 (1997) of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights on the right to adequate housing (article 11 (1) of the Covenant): forced evictions. 
<b>Principle 4: </b>The local population should benefit from the revenues generated by the 
investment agreement. Investment contracts should prioritize the development needs of the 
local population and seek to achieve solutions which represent an adequate balance 
between the interests of all parties. Depending on the circumstances, arrangements under 
which the foreign investor provides access to credit and improved technologies for contract 
farming, against the possibility to buy at predefined prices a portion of the crops produced, 
may be preferable to long-term leases of land or land purchases, although contract farming 
itself should comply with the conditions set out in the report of the Special Rapporteur on 
agribusiness and the right to food (A/HRC/13/33, paragraphs 43&#8211;45).

<p><b>Principle 5: </b>In countries facing important levels of rural poverty and in the absence of 
employment opportunities in other sectors, host States and investors should establish and 
promote farming systems that are sufficiently labour-intensive to contribute to employment 
creation. Labour-intensive modes of production can be highly productive per hectare. 
Investment agreements should contribute to the fullest extent possible to reinforcing local 
livelihood options and in particular provide access to a living wage for the local population 
affected, which is a key component of the human right to food. 
</p>
<p><b>Principle 6: </b>Host States and investors should cooperate in identifying ways to ensure that 
the modes of agricultural production respect the environment, and do not accelerate climate 
change, soil depletion, and the exhaustion of freshwater reserves. Depending on local 
conditions, they may have to explore low external input farming practices as a means to 
meet this challenge. 
</p>
<p><b>Principle 7: </b>Whatever the content of the arrangement, it is essential that the obligations of 
the investor be defined in clear terms, and that these obligations be enforceable, for instance 
by the inclusion of predefined sanctions in case of non-compliance. For this mechanism to 
be effective, independent and participatory ex post impact assessments should be made at 
predefined intervals. The obligations of the investor should not be limited to the payment of 
rents, or &#8212; in the case of land purchases &#8212; to a monetary sum. They should include clear 
and verifiable commitments related to a number of issues which are relevant to the long-
term sustainability of the investment and to its compliance with human rights. In particular, 
such commitments may relate to the generation of local employment and compliance with 
labour rights, including a living wage as far as waged employment is concerned; to the 
inclusion of smallholders through properly negotiated outgrower schemes, joint ventures or 
other forms of collaborative production models; and to the need to make investments in 
order to ensure that a larger proportion of the value chain can be captured by the local 
communities, for instance by the building of local processing plants.  
</p>
<p><b>Principle 8: </b>In order to ensure that they will not increase food insecurity for the local 
population, particularly as the result of increased dependence on international markets or 
food aid in a context of higher prices for agricultural commodities, investment agreements 
with net food-importing countries should include a clause providing that a certain minimum 
percentage of the crops produced shall be sold on local markets, and that this percentage 
may increase, in proportions to be agreed in advance, if the prices of food commodities on 
international markets reach certain levels. Appropriate support schemes may also have to be 
put in place to increase the productivity of local farmers, in order to ensure that they will 
not suffer income losses as a result of low-priced produce arriving on the local markets, 
which has been produced under more competitive conditions on the large-scale plantations 
developed by foreign investors. 
</p>
<p><b>Principle 9: </b>In order to highlight the consequences of investment on the enjoyment of the 
right to food, impact assessments should be conducted prior to the completion of the 
negotiations on (a) local employment and incomes, disaggregated by gender and, where 
applicable, by ethnic group; (b) access to productive resources by local communities, 
including pastoralists or itinerant farmers; (c) the arrival of new technologies and 
investments in infrastructure; (d) the environment, including soil depletion, the use of water 
resources and genetic erosion; and (e) access, availability and adequacy of food. Only 
through such impact assessments, which should include a participatory dimension, can it be 
ensured that the contracts providing for the lease or sale of land will distribute the benefits 
equitably between the local communities, the host State, and the investor.  
</p>
<p><b>Principle 10: </b>Under international law, indigenous peoples have been granted specific 
forms of protection of their rights to land. States shall consult and cooperate in good faith 
with the indigenous peoples concerned in order to obtain their free and informed consent 
prior to the approval of any project affecting their lands or territories and other resources, </p>

<p>particularly in connection with the development, utilization or exploitation of mineral, 
water or other resources. 
</p>
<p><b>Principle 11:</b> Waged agricultural workers should be provided with adequate protection and 
their fundamental human and labour rights should be stipulated in legislation and enforced 
in practice, consistent with the applicable ILO instruments. Increasing protection of this 
category of workers would contribute to enhancing their ability, and that of their families, 
to procure access to sufficient and adequate food.
