NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
a)Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information with the
instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed
financial statements do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for
complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed
financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments), which
we consider necessary, for a fair presentation of those financial statements. The results of operations
and cash flows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 may not necessarily be indicative of
results that may be expected for any succeeding quarter or for the entire fiscal year. The information
contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our audited financial
statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31,
2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
included in Item 8 of our annual report on Form 10-K as of December 31, 2015.
The preparation of unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, that affect
the amounts reported in the unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it
believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and
expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those
estimates and judgments. In particular, significant estimates and judgments include those related to:
the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted
for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent
liabilities, derivative liabilities, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing
operating losses, those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts.
Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably
possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at
the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements, which management considered in
formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events.
Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
All amounts referred to in the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements are in United
States Dollars ($) unless stated otherwise.
b)Principles of Consolidation
The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and
its subsidiary in which it has a majority voting interest. All significant inter-company accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in the unaudited consolidated financial statements. The entities
included in these unaudited consolidated financial statements are as follows:
Propell Technologies Group, Inc. – Parent Company
Novas Energy USA Inc. (wholly owned)
Novas Energy North America, LLC (60% owned)
F-5
PROPELL TECHNOLOGIES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES (continued)
c)Use of Estimates
The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing
basis, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that
it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and
expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those
estimates and judgments. In particular, significant estimates and judgments include those related to:
the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment, the fair value of warrants and stock options granted
for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude of contingent
liabilities, derivative liabilities, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing
operating losses, those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts.
Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably
possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at
the date of the consolidated financial statements, which management considered in formulating its
estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the
actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.
d)Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In April 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) “ASU 2016 – 10 Revenue from Contract with Customers: identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing”. The amendments in this update clarify the two following aspects (a)
contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b)
determining whether an entity’s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to
use the entity’s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity’s
intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments in this update are intended to
reduce the degree of judgement necessary to comply with Topic 606. This guidance has no effective
date as yet. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.
Any new accounting standards, not disclosed above, that have been issued or proposed by FASB that
do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the financial
statements upon adoption.
e)Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at
the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively,
the Company had no cash equivalents.
The Company minimizes credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of
its primary financial institution. The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits. At June 30,
2016, the Company had cash balances of $9,923,473, which exceeded the federally insured limits by
$9,510,855. At December 31, 2015, the Company had cash balances of $11,700,143, which exceeded
the federally insured limits by $10,877,045.
f)Related parties
Parties are considered to be related to the Company if the parties that, directly or indirectly, through
one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company,
or own in aggregate, on a fully diluted basis 5% or more of the Company’s stock. Related parties also
include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of
principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may
deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the
other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own
separate interests. The Company discloses all related party transactions. All transactions are recorded
at fair value of the goods or services exchanged. Property purchased from a related party is recorded at
the cost to the related party and any payment to or on behalf of the related party in excess of the cost is
reflected as a distribution to related party.

11NET LOSS PER SHARE
Basic loss per share is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during
each period. Diluted loss per share is based on basic shares as determined above plus common stock
equivalents, including convertible preferred shares and convertible notes as well as the incremental
shares that would be issued upon the assumed exercise of in-the-money stock options using the
treasury stock method. The computation of diluted net loss per share does not assume the issuance of
common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect on net loss per share. For the six months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015, all stock options, unvested restricted stock awards, warrants, convertible preferred
stock and convertible notes were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share. Dilutive
shares which could exist pursuant to the exercise of outstanding stock instruments and which were not
included in the calculation because their affect would have been anti-dilutive are as follows:

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains

and those identified under Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.
Overview and Financial Condition
Our Company
We intend to be an oil exploitation and production (“E&P”) company through the acquisition and growth
of a base of producing assets by leveraging M&A and operational expertise, and by using advanced
technology to increase their production. On July 6, 2015, we closed the final tranche of our private
placement of the sale of our Series C Preferred Stock and raised an additional $9,750,000, the use of
proceeds of which was specified to be for the acquisition, enhancement and maintenance of an oil
field. Since the closing of the private placement, we have shifted our operational focus from being a
direct provider of well services based upon plasma pulse technology to actively seeking to acquire
producing oil fields to generate revenues and the development of untapped hydrocarbon reserves
through resource conversion once oil supply/ demand rebalances and prices rebound. As a result, in
August 2015, our board of directors and shareholders approved the exclusive sublicense to our
majority owned subsidiary Novas Energy North America, LLC (“NENA”) of our rights to use certain
plasma pulse technology that we had licensed from Novas Energy Group Limited (the “Licensor”)
pursuant to the terms of an exclusive license agreement (the “License Agreement”), for treatment of
vertical wells in the United States (hereafter, the “Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology”). The Licensed
Plasma Pulse Technology refers to the process and apparatus of Licensor for its plasma pulse
technology as covered by Licensor’s patent rights. Although we are indirectly engaged in the oil
recovery business through NENA and directly through our treatment of oil wells in Mexico, it is not now
our foundational business strategy.
The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Novas Energy USA, Inc. (“Novas”) entered into a sublicense
agreement (the “Novas Sublicense Agreement”) with NENA and Licensor pursuant to which NENA
was granted the right, subject to certain exceptions to be the exclusive provider of the Licensed Plasma
Pulse Technology for treatment of vertical wells to third parties in the United States. As such, NENA as
the Operator, now has the exclusive right to use the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment
of vertical wells in the United States. We retained, however, the right to utilize the Licensed Plasma
Pulse Technology to treat wells that we may acquire in the United States. We also have the right to
utilize plasma pulse technology not covered by the License Agreement. To date, NENA has treated a
total of thirteen wells, three in the USA, one in Colorado and two in Kansas and ten in Alberta, Canada.
During the first six months of 2016, NENA treated four wells in the United States utilizing our down-
hole tools. In October 2015, Novas entered into an operating agreement with Technovita Technologies
USA, Inc. (“Technovita”) (the “Joint Venture Agreement”) through a newly formed Delaware limited
liability company, NENA, whereby Novas agreed to contribute $1,200,000 ($600,000 to be delivered
on the effective date (October 22, 2015) of the Joint Venture Agreement, $300,000 on November 1,
2015 and $300,000 on the two month anniversary of the Effective Date) to the capital of NENA for 60%
of the membership interests of NENA and Technovita agreed to contribute an aggregate of $800,000 to
the capital of NENA for 40% of the membership interests of NENA. Pursuant to a side agreement
entered into on November 18, 2015, the revenue and expenses incurred by Technovita prior to
entering into the operating agreement have been included in the joint venture and consolidated into the
Company’s results effective September 1, 2015. Subject to certain exceptions and pursuant to the
terms of Sublicense Agreements (the “Technovita Sublicense Agreement”) that was entered into
between Technovita, NENA and Licensor, NENA is the exclusive provider of the Licensed Plasma
Pulse Technology for treatment of vertical wells to third parties in Canada.
1
Certain oil recovery technology used by Novas, and sublicensed by NENA, is based on an exclusive,
perpetual royalty-bearing license (the “License Agreement”) to engage in the commercial application of
the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology entered into on January 30, 2013, as amended in March 2014
and December 23, 2014 with Licensor which granted Novas the right to use the Licensed Plasma
Pulse Technology in the United States and Mexico to enhance oil production. The License Agreement
provides Novas with the right to practice the licensed process and to utilize the Licensed Plasma Pulse
Technology to provide services to third parties and for ourselves as well, and to sublicense the
Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States.
On July 19, 2016, we received a notice from Licensor purporting to effectively terminate the License
Agreement for non-payment of required royalties, asserting, among other things, that as of June 30,
2016, Novas owed Licensor a pro rata amount of $1,458,333 for the Licensed Plasma Pulse
Technology for the United States and Mexico, of which $1,000,000 was alleged to be in arrears.
Licensor has since reiterated its demands, particularly as to its demands related to Mexico. We and
Novas believe that there is no legal basis for Licensor to terminate the License Agreement and intend
to vigorously defend against any attempt by Licensor to enforce a termination of the License
Agreement. Further, we believe that Licensor has failed to materially perform its obligations under the
License Agreement, and we believe that such failures on Licensor’s part may impact what, if any,
payments are due under the License Agreement by Novas to Licensor.
We and Novas believe that it is evident from the plain language of the Sublicense Agreement, and the
fact that we transferred to NENA substantially all of its rights for the use of Licensed Plasma Pulse
Technology in the United States of America, that the Sublicense Agreement replaced and superseded
the royalty fees due under the License Agreement for the use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse
Technology in the Licensed Territory.
In 2013, we closed a Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of Novas, under which we
acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Novas in exchange for 100,000,000 shares of our
common stock. Novas had entered into a license for use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology
licensed from Licensor for use in the United States and Mexico. Prior to the closing of the second
tranche of the Series C Preferred Stock private placement and the sublicense with NENA, our focus
had been on the provision of production enhancement services. We have not concluded any further
agreements under this joint venture model other than in Mexico where we intend to treat 15 wells
through our partner Pozotech utilizing a plasma pulse technology. We anticipate deriving
approximately $375,000 in revenue from the treatment of the 15 wells.
To date, we derived $496,962 in revenue from our oil enhancement business. We have financed our
operations primarily from sales of our securities, both debt and equity, and to a lesser extent revenue
from operations and we expect to continue to obtain required capital in a similar manner. We have
incurred an accumulated deficit of $16,152,295 through June 30, 2016 and there can be no assurance
that we will be able to achieve profitability.
Management Discussion and Analysis of financial condition
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our
consolidated financial statement as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis we review our estimates
and assumptions. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results are likely to differ from those
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Results of Operations for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015
Net revenues
Net revenues were $65,531 and $8,500 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
respectively, an increase of $57,031 or 671.0%. All of the revenue during the quarter has been derived
from the NENA joint venture in which we have a 60% share. In the prior year we had derived $8,500 of
revenue from the treatment of well by Novas, our wholly owned subsidiary. Due to the current market
conditions in the oil industry, our ability to generate significant revenues remains very limited.
Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold was $16,887 and $42,147 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, a decrease of $25,260 or 59.9%. Cost of goods sold during the current year, primarily
represents treatment costs incurred by NENA in treating wells in Canada and the USA. Several of the
wells that were treated did not generate revenue. In the prior year the cost of sales consisted primarily
of engineering services provided by third party contractors and a provision for royalty expense on wells
treated by Novas.
Gross profit (loss)
Gross profit (loss) was $48,644 and $(33,647) for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, an increase of $82,291, primarily due to the treatment of several wells under the NENA
joint venture. In the prior year, the cost of sales included engineering costs incurred on wells treated for
no revenues.
Total expenses
Total expenses were $1,009,465 and $781,067 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, an increase of $228,398 or 29.2%. Total expenses consisted primarily of the following:
Professional fees were $98,806 and $226,333 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, a decrease of $127,527 or 56.3%. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in; i)
 ·
legal fees of $110,050 due to non-recurring work performed on the joint venture agreements by our
legal counsel; ii) a decrease in once-off patent legal costs of $17,193 during the three months ended
June 30, 2015 related to patenting the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the USA.
Business development expenditure totaled $15,671 and $0 for the three months ended June 30,
 ·
2016. The business development expenditure relates to the treatment of several wells by NENA as a
marketing tool to prove NENA’s abilities, in an effort to generate a sustainable revenue stream.
Consulting fees totaled $374,472 and $125,280 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, an increase of $249,192 or 198.9%. The increase is primarily due to consulting and
 ·
contracting fees incurred by NENA. The NENA joint venture has only been operational since the third
quarter of the prior year.
General and administrative expenditure was $956,390 and $773,568 for the six months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $182,822 or 23.6%. This increase is primarily due to
the following; i) an increase in payroll expenses of $322,294 due to payroll expenses of $103,180
incurred by NENA, a once off signing bonus of $60,000 paid to our new CEO and an increase in
salary expenditure, including benefits expenditure, due to the employment of our new CEO in January
2016 and a COO in March 2016, previously we did not have a COO function; ii) an increase in
investor relations expenditure of $73,785 due to a new contract entered into with an investor relations
firm which required an upfront payment and a monthly fee; iii) an increase in insurance expenditure of
$40,013 due to an increase in the level of D&O coverage; iv) an increase in building rental expense of
$23,091 due to rental expense incurred by NENA and an increase in the rental expense incurred for
 ·
an apartment leased for John Huemoeller, which terminated on May 31, 2016; v) an increase in
equipment rental expense of $27,071 due to equipment leased by NENA to treat wells; vi) an
increase in franchise taxes paid to the State of Delaware based on the number of shares outstanding,
which number had increased due to the issuance of the additional 4,500,000 preferred shares in the
prior year and the issuance of 13,000,000 restricted common stock to two directors offset by a
decrease in stock based compensation expense which was $42,895 and $482,572 for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $439,677. The current year stock based
compensation consists of a charge for stock options issued to our CEO and COO during the current
quarter. The prior year stock based compensation consists of a charge of $482,572 for restricted stock
issued to our former Chief Executive Officer, John Huemoeller and one of our directors, John Zotos.
The charge for restricted stock was fully amortized at December 31, 2015.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $34,996 and 36,883 for the three months ended June 30,
 ·
2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $1,887 or 5.1%. This decrease is primarily due to fixed
assets that were fully depreciated during the prior year and have subsequently been scrapped.
3
Other (expense) income
Other (expense) was $(763) and $0 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an
increase of $763 was primarily due to a loss on fixed assets which were stolen of $1,248 offset by other
income of $496.
Net loss
We incurred a net loss of $960,511 and $814,714 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
an increase of $145,797 or 17.9%, respectively and which consists of the various items discussed
above.
Deemed preferred stock dividend
A deemed preferred stock dividend of $1,355,085 has been disclosed in the statement of operations for
the three months ended June 30, 2015. This amount represents the in-the-money value of the
conversion feature of the Series C Preferred Stock as of the date of issue. These shares of Series C
Preferred Stock are convertible into common stock at an exercise price of $0.12291665 per share.
Undeclared Series B and Series C Preferred stock dividends
A deemed preferred stock dividend of $156,071 and $62,586 has been disclosed for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This amount represents the dividends that are due, but
remain undeclared, to Series B and Series C preferred stock holders for the three months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015.

 ·
2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $232 or 0.3%. This decrease is primarily due to certain
assets becoming fully depreciated in the prior year.
Other (expense) income
Other income was $199,248 and $0 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an

2016 and 2015 respectively, a decrease of $18,455. In the prior year the derivative liability movement
reflected the mark-to-market of equities issued to short-term note holders who converted their debt to
equity at deeply discounted prices based on variable priced conversion rates which was offset by a
mark-to-market credits on the remaining short-term convertible notes.
Net loss
We incurred a net loss of $2,008,158 and $1,490,921 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, an increase of $517,237 or 34.7%, respectively and which consists of the various items
discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources.
To date, our primary sources of cash have been funds raised from the sale of our securities and the
issuance of convertible and non-convertible debt. No additional funds were raised during the current
financial period.
We have spent $171,502 on plant and equipment for the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily on
new down hole tools acquired.
We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $16,152,293 through June 30, 2016 and incurred negative
cash flow from operations of $1,598,200 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. We have spent, and
need to continue to spend, substantial amounts in connection with implementing our new business
strategy.
Our primary commitments include the minimum commitments under the license agreements and our
commitment to invest an additional $300,000 into the joint venture based on their cash flow needs.
Based upon our current plans, we believe that our cash will be sufficient to enable us to meet our
anticipated operating needs for at least the next twelve months, subject to any property acquisition.
Our minimum commitments under the License Agreement for the next five years (assuming the License
Agreement and the Novas Sublicense Agreement remain in effect and the $500,000 annual royalty
payment with respect to the United States territory is not required to be paid), is summarized as follows:
Amount
2016 $500,000  
2017   500,000  
2018   500,000  
2019   500,000

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks
None.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
(a)Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), the Company
carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company’s management, including the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), who also serves as our principal financial and accounting
officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under
Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon
that evaluation, the Company’s CEO who also serves as our principal financial and accounting officer
concluded that due to a lack of segregation of duties and insufficient controls over review and
accounting for certain complex transactions, that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as
of June 30, 2016 were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, was recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the
Company’s CEO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The
Company intends to retain additional individuals to remedy the ineffective controls. We have begun to
take actions that we believe will substantially remediate the material weaknesses identified. In
response to the identification of our material weaknesses, we are in the process of expanding our
finance and accounting staff. However, we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial
reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future.
(b)Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016 that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Part II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
None.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and our audited
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016. This discussion contains
forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. See
“Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and
assumptions associated with these statements. Actual results and the timing of events could differ
materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including
those set forth below, under Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and elsewhere herein, and those identified
under Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed
with the SEC on March 30, 2016.
Risks Relating to Our Company
Our business is difficult to evaluate because we are currently focused on a new line of business
and a new business strategy and have very limited operating history and limited information.
We have recently engaged in a new business line involving plasma pulse technology, including
utilizing the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology. We have also recently switched our business model
with our entry into a Joint Venture Agreement with Technovita. There is a risk that the joint venture will
be unable to successfully operate this new line of business or be able to successfully integrate it with
Technovita’s management and structure. To date, the joint venture has generated minimal revenue.
The joint venture estimates of capital, personnel and equipment required for our new line of business
are based on the experience of management and businesses they are familiar with. The joint venture
management has limited direct experience in this new line of business. The joint venture is subject to
the risks such as their ability to implement their business plan, market acceptance of the proposed
business and services, under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel,
financing and other resources, competition from better funded and experienced companies, and
uncertainty of their ability to generate revenues. There is no assurance that the joint venture activities
will be successful or will result in any revenues or profit, and the likelihood of their success must be
considered in light of the stage of development. To date, we have derived minimal revenue from the
joint venture. Even if the joint venture generates revenue, there can be no assurance that it will be
profitable. In addition, no assurance can be given that the joint venture will be able to consummate its
business strategy and plans, as described herein, or that financial, technological, market, or other
limitations may force the joint venture to modify, alter, significantly delay, or significantly impede the
implementation of such plans. The joint venture has insufficient results for investors to use to identify
historical trends or even to make quarter-to-quarter comparisons of its operating results. You should
consider our prospects in light of the risk, expenses and difficulties we will encounter as an early stage
company. Our revenue and income potential is unproven and our business model is continually
evolving. We are subject to the risks inherent to the operation of a new business enterprise, and cannot
assure you that we will be able to successfully address these risks.
We currently have limited revenues from the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology and may not
generate any revenue in the near future, if at all, from the use of our technology.
We currently have generated limited revenues from the use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology.
To date, we have derived limited revenue from the joint venture. During the first six months of 2016, the
joint venture has treated four wells using our down-hole tools. The majority of the wells that were
treated were treated as sample wells to demonstrate the ability of plasma pulse technology at no cost
to the well owner. Therefore, there can be no assurance that well owners will determine that the price
to be paid by the joint venture customers for their services, whether in the form of a cash payment or
profit sharing arrangement, will be deemed to be reasonable and that customers will be willing to pay
such prices.
We may not be profitable.
We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. For the six months ended June 30, 2016
and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, respectively, we had net revenues of $147,768
and $91,000 from our plasma pulse oil recovery business. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 we
have sustained a net loss of $2,008,158 and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we
sustained a net loss of $4,331,980 and $5,018,483, respectively. To date, we have not generated
significant revenue from the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology and NENA has not generated any
significant revenues from the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology. Our ability to become profitable
depends on our ability to have successful operations and generate and sustain sales, while
maintaining reasonable expense levels, all of which are uncertain in light of our limited operating
history in our current line of business and our recent changes in business strategy.

Although we believe the Licensor does not have the right to terminate the License Agreement, if
the Licensor is successful in its claims, the result could have material adverse outcomes.
On July 19, 2016, we received a notice from Licensor purporting to effectively terminate the License
Agreement for non-payment of required royalties, asserting, among other things, that as of June 30,
2016, Novas owed Licensor a pro rata amount of $1,458,333 for the Licensed Plasma Pulse
Technology for the United States and Mexico, of which $1,000,000 was alleged to be in arrears.
Licensor has since reiterated its demands, particularly as to its demands related to Mexico. We and
Novas believe that there is no legal basis for Licensor to terminate the License Agreement and intend
to vigorously defend against any attempt by Licensor to enforce a termination of the License
Agreement. Further, we believe that Licensor has failed to materially perform its obligations under the
License Agreement, and that such failures on Licensor’s part may impact what, if any, payments are
due under the License Agreement by Novas to Licensor.
We and Novas believe that it is evident from the plain language of the Sublicense Agreement, and the
fact that we transferred to NENA substantially all of its rights for the use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse
Technology in the United States of America, that the Sublicense Agreement replaced and superseded
the royalty fees due under the License Agreement for the use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse
Technology in the Licensed Territory.
As our sole source of income at this time is through NENA, and the majority of NENA’s revenue has
been derived from the Sublicense Agreement with Novas, the termination of the License Agreement or
loss of the United States as a Licensed Territory could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We rely on a license to use the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology that is material to our
business and if the agreement were to be terminated, it could have an immediate material
adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
We have a License Agreement with the Licensor granting us the right to use certain critical intellectual
property, which we have sub-licensed to NENA. If we or NENA breach the terms of this agreement,
including any failure to make minimum royalty payments required thereunder, the Licensor has the
right to terminate the license. If we or NENA were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain this
license on acceptable terms, or find that it is necessary or appropriate to secure new licenses from
other third parties, it would halt our ability or that of NENA to market the Licensed Plasma Pulse
Technology, which could have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results
and financial condition.
We may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to meet the minimum royalties under our
license agreement.
The License Agreement with the Licensor requires us to pay aggregate minimum royalty payments of
$1,000,000 per year; however, no minimum royalty payment is due prior to (i) December 31, 2015 with
respect to Mexican operations and (ii) the three-year anniversary of the license agreement with respect
to the United States operations and provided further that the $500,000 due for operations in the United
States is not required to be paid under the terms of the Novas Sublicense Agreement so long as the
Novas Sublicense Agreement remains in effect. If the minimum royalty is found to be due, is not timely
paid, and is otherwise not waived or deferred, the Licensor has the right to terminate the License
Agreement with respect to a certain territory under certain circumstances and in certain other
circumstances has the right to terminate the entire agreement. Subsequent to year end, the $200,000
due with respect to our license to operate in Mexico was waived. To date, we have not generated
enough revenue to pay minimum royalty payments and the Licensor has threatened to terminate the
License Agreement for our failure to pay the royalty that the Licensor claims is due. No assurance can
be given that the joint venture or we will generate sufficient revenue to make these minimum royalty
payments. If the minimum royalties are found to be due and not otherwise waived or deferred, any
failure to make the required payments would permit the Licensor to terminate the license. Although we
believe that no payment is due with respect to the territory of the United States and that other payments
have been waived or excused, there can be no assurance that a court would agree with our position. If
we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain this license, it would halt our ability to market the
Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, which could have an immediate material adverse effect on our
business, operating results and financial condition.
8
Our future plans and operations may require that we raise additional capital.
To date, we have not generated enough revenue from operations to pay all of our expenses. During the
year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2014 we raised a total of
$14,750,000 from our private placement of Series C Preferred stock to Ervington consummated during
February and June 2015. We have used the funds raised in our financings for working capital purposes
and intend to acquire an oil well with the funds that were recently raised. However, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to achieve our goals with the cash on hand or the cash generated from
operations.
The joint venture may not be able to service customers with the tools that are available to it.
The joint venture’s ability to continue to service customers and expand its business is dependent upon
it acquiring additional apparatuses to be utilized with plasma pulse technology. The joint venture has
previously used our six down-hole tools to treat wells as well as those obtained from the Licensor
However, we have not entered into a licensing agreement with the joint venture for the use of our tools
and until such time as a licensing arrangement is concluded, our tools will not be available for use by
the joint venture. In addition, even if we should enter into a licensing agreement with the joint venture,
we have a limited number of tools available for use. If the tools should require repair the joint venture
may be unable to service customers. In addition, with only six tools, the joint venture can only treat a
limited number of wells at a time and are unable to treat wells on days when the tools are in transit from
one customer’s well to another well.
There is no guarantee that the planned joint venture will be successful.
To date, Technovita has treated very limited wells with the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology and
therefore there is no guarantee that the Technovita team will be successful in meeting its milestones.
Due to limited data about well treatment it is difficult to assess the revenue to be derived from the
Canadian wells, which may not perform as expected and may contribute less than 40% to the revenue
of the planned joint venture. We will only have a 60% interest in revenue derived from treatment of U.S.
wells instead of our current 100% interest. Although Novas has the right to terminate the joint venture if
certain milestones are not met, if the milestones are met there can be no assurance that the revenue
derived from U.S. wells will not exceed 60% of the revenue of the joint venture. We did not receive a
valuation or fairness opinion regarding the joint venture and Novas’ percent ownership in the joint
venture. To date, we have contributed $900,000 to the joint venture and are required to contribute and
additional $300.000 to the joint venture that may not be recovered in the event that the joint venture
dissolves. In addition, the joint venture will bear the additional costs associated with the additional
Technovita management team.
There is uncertainty as to market acceptance of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology and products.
The Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology has been utilized in the United States on a limited basis.
NENA has not yet generated any revenue from the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology and prior to
sublicensing the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology to NENA, we had not generated significant
revenue from the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology and there can be no assurance that the
Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology will be accepted in the market or that NENA’s commercialization
efforts will be successful.
The results of the application of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology for initial well treatments may
not support future well treatments and are not necessarily predictive of future long-term results on the
wells for which the initial data is favorable.
To date, we have applied the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology to treat over forty wells in the USA
and an additional twelve wells in Canada, and we do not have long terms results on the wells that
were treated. Of such wells, we have seen improvement results in many wells. Favorable results in our
early treatments may not last and may not be repeated in later treatments of other wells. Success in
early treatments does not ensure that wells treated at a later date will be successful. Additionally,
collecting treatment data results is not always possible as operators that pay for the service are not
required to deliver data or we are required to work under non-disclosure agreements.

The beneficial ownership of a significant percentage of our common stock gives Ervington
effective control of us, and limits the influence of other shareholders on important policy and
management issues.
Ervington currently beneficially owns approximately 50.9% of our voting shares on a fully diluted basis
(including outstanding options, warrants and convertible instruments). In addition, Ervington currently
has the right to three votes on our board of directors and has appointed two members with an
aggregate of three votes, which constitutes a majority of the votes on our board of directors. As a result
of these appointment rights and its voting control of our company, Ervington has the power to control
the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of our
directors, our business strategy, our day-to-day operations and any proposed merger, consolidation or
sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Ervington’s control of our company could discourage the
acquisition of our common stock by potential investors and could have an anti-takeover effect,
preventing a change in control of our company that might be otherwise beneficial to our shareholders,
and possibly depress the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that conflicts
of interest will not arise with respect to Ervington’s ownership and control of our company or that any
conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to the other shareholders of our company.
Trends in oil and natural gas prices affect the level of exploration, development, and production
activity of our customers and the demand for our services and products, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated
financial condition.
Demand for the services and products of the joint venture or oil derived from wells we acquire is
particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development, and production activity of, and the
corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies.
The level of exploration, development, and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and
natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile.
Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in
the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other economic
factors that are beyond our control. The recent decline in oil prices from $80 per barrel in December
2014 to $40 per barrel in December 2015 has resulted in a decline in oil drilling which has depressed
the immediate level of exploration, development, and production activity, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial
condition. Even the perception of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas
companies can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-
scale development projects. Factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include:
the level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas, especially demand for natural gas in the
 ·
United States;
governmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and
 ·
production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;
·weather conditions and natural disasters;
·worldwide political, military, and economic conditions;
10
the level of oil production by non-OPEC countries and the available excess production capacity within
 ·
OPEC;
oil refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of
 ·
natural gas;
·the cost of producing and delivering oil and natural gas; and
·potential acceleration of development of alternative fuels.
Legislative and regulatory changes affecting the environment and the oil industry could
adversely affect our business
Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting oil recovery efforts to potential
fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. State and local
governments, for example, continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the impact of
oil recovery efforts on the environment. We cannot predict the effect any legislation may have on our
business and we can offer no assurances they will not have a material adverse effect on our business.
Various federal legislative and regulatory initiatives have been undertaken which could result in
additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations and possibly
our operations. For example, the Department of Interior has issued proposed regulations that would
apply to hydraulic fracturing operations on wells that are subject to federal oil and gas leases and that
would impose requirements regarding the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing
process as well as requirements to obtain certain federal approvals before proceeding with hydraulic
fracturing at a well site. These regulations, if adopted, could also be applicable to our operations and
would establish additional levels of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays
and increased operating costs. At the same time, legislation and/or regulations have been adopted in
several states that require additional disclosure regarding chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing
process but that include protections for proprietary information. Legislation and/or regulations are being
considered at the state and local level that could impose further chemical disclosure or other regulatory
requirements (such as restrictions on the use of certain types of chemicals or prohibitions on hydraulic
fracturing operations and competitive operations in certain areas) that could affect our operations.
The adoption of any future federal, state, local, or foreign laws or implementing regulations imposing
reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process if applicable to
competitive processes such as ours, could make it more difficult to complete natural gas and oil wells
and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and
consolidated financial condition.
Liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages arising as a result of
environmental laws could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our
liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
We will be exposed to claims under environmental requirements for wells we acquire and treat and the
joint venture will be exposed to claims under environmental requirements for wells it treats. In the
United States, environmental requirements and regulations typically impose strict liability. Strict liability
means that in some situations we or the joint venture could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs,
natural resource damages, and other damages as a result of our or the joint ventures conduct that was
lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of prior operators or other third parties. Liability for damages
arising as a result of environmental laws could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect
on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
Existing or future laws, regulations, related to greenhouse gases and climate change could
have a negative impact on our business and may result in additional compliance obligations
with respect to the release, capture, and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material
adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial
condition.
Changes in environmental requirements related to greenhouse gases and climate change may
negatively impact demand for the services of the joint venture. For example, oil and natural gas
exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements (including land use
policies responsive to environmental concerns). State, national, and international governments and
agencies have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would
restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business. Because our business
depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations,
treaties, or international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including
incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our
business if such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand
for oil and natural gas. Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with
respect to the release, capture, sequestration, and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material
adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
11
Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property
challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our
competitive position.
We rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that the joint venture uses in its services and
products. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future,
and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of some
foreign countries in which our services and products may be sold do not protect intellectual property
rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Our failure to protect our proprietary
information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us
could materially and adversely affect our competitive position and that of the joint venture.
Any future recompletion activities engaged upon by us on wells that we acquire may not be
productive.
We may acquire properties upon which we believe recompletion activity will be successful.
Recompletion or workovers on oil and natural gas wells involves numerous risks, including the risk that
we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural-gas reservoirs. The costs of recompleting,
and operating wells are often uncertain, and operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a
result of a variety of factors, including the following unexpected drilling conditions:
·pressure or irregularities in formations;
·equipment failures or accidents;
·fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering;
·difficulty identifying and retaining qualified personnel;
·title problems;
·other adverse weather conditions; and
·shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment
Certain of our future activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an
adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.
We intend to become an exploitation and production stage company.
We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of our Series C Preferred Stock to acquire oil fields and
intend to become an exploitation and production stage company which will face a high risk of business
failure because of the unique difficulties and uncertainties inherent in oil and gas exploitation ventures.
Potential investors should be aware of the risks and uncertainties normally encountered by oil and gas
companies and the high rate of failure of such companies. The likelihood of our success must be
considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays that could be
encountered in connection with our planned exploitation and followed drilling. These potential
problems include, but are not limited to, possible problems relating to exploitation and additional costs
and expenses that may reduce our current forecast of income and asset value. Additional expenditures
related to exploitation may not result in the confirmation of anticipated oil and gas reserves. Problems
such as unusual or unexpected formations and other conditions are involved in mineral development
and often result in unsuccessful efforts. The acquisition of additional fields will be dependent upon us
possessing capital resources at that time in order to purchase and/or maintain such concessions. If no
funding is available, we may be forced to cease our exploitation activities.
To date, we have not successfully acquired any fields. Our acquisition of a filed is dependent upon
market conditions and pricing. The competition for the acquisition of fields is intense. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to acquire a suitable field with our existing resources.
12
Our anticipated future oil drilling and producing operations will involve various risks.
Once we acquire wells and commence oil exploitation activities, we will be subject to all the risks
normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including:
·well blowouts, cratering, explosions and human related accidents
·mechanical, equipment and pipe failures
·adverse weather conditions and natural disasters
·civil disturbances and terrorist activities
·oil and natural gas price reductions
environmental risks stemming from the use, production, handling and disposal of water, waste
 ·
materials, hydrocarbons and other substances into the air, soil or water title problems
·limited availability of financing
·marketing related infrastructure, transportation and processing limitations
·regulatory compliance issues
We intend to maintain insurance against many potential losses or liabilities arising from well
operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts believed by management
to be prudent. However, insurance will not protect us against all risks.
Uncertainty of economic conditions, worldwide and in the United States may have a significant
negative effect on operating results, liquidity and financial condition.
Effects of change in domestic and international economic conditions could include a decline in
demand for oil and natural gas resulting in decreased oil, and natural gas reserves due to curtailed
drilling activity; A decline in reserves would lead to a decline in production, and either a production
decline, or a decrease in oil, and natural gas prices, would have a negative impact on our cash flow,
profitability and value.
There is competition in the oil and gas industry for acquisition of oil wells and we have limited
financial and personnel resources with which to compete.
Competition in the oil and gas industry is extremely intense in all aspects, including but not limited to
raising investment capital and obtaining qualified managerial and technical employees. We are an
insignificant participant in the oil and gas industry due to our limited financial and personnel resources.
Our competition includes large established oil and gas companies, with substantial capabilities and
with greater financial and technical resources than we have, as well as the myriad of other small stage
companies. These companies are able to pay more for development prospects and productive oil and
natural gas properties and are able to define, evaluate, bid for, purchase and subsequently drill a
greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. As a result of
this competition, we may be unable to attract the necessary funding or qualified personnel. If we are
unable to successfully compete for funding or for qualified personnel, our activities may be slowed,
suspended or terminated, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue
operations.
Shortages of oil field equipment, services, qualified personnel and resulting cost increases
could adversely affect results of operations.
The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and
other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation
with oil and natural gas prices, resulting in periodic shortages. When demand for rigs and equipment
increases due to an increase in the number of wells being drilled, there have been shortages of drilling
rigs, hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel and other oilfield equipment. Higher oil and natural
gas prices generally stimulate increased demand for, and result in increased prices of, drilling rigs,
crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. These shortages or price increases could
negatively affect the ability to drill wells and conduct ordinary operations by the operators of the
Company’s wells, resulting in an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, cash flow and
operating results.
13
Our operations will be subject to permitting requirements.
Oil drilling operations will be subject to permitting requirements, which could require us to delay,
suspend or terminate our operations. Our operations, including but not limited to any exploitation
program, require permits from the U.S. government. We may be unable to obtain these permits in a
timely manner, on reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits, or
if there is a delay in receiving these permits, our timetable and business plan for exploration and/or
exploitation, may be materially and adversely affected.
International expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political,
operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United
States.
Our amended license agreement grants us a license, which has been sub-licensed to NENA, to utilize
the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in Mexico and the joint venture is anticipated to conduct
business in Canada. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:
multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, export and import
 ·
restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits
and licenses;
failure by us or NENA to obtain regulatory approvals for the sale or use of our technology in various
 ·
countries;
·difficulties in managing foreign operations;
financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty enforcing contracts and collecting accounts
 ·
receivable and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
·reduced protection for intellectual property rights;
natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest,
 ·
outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; and
failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including its books and records provisions
 ·
and its anti-bribery provisions, by maintaining accurate information and control over activities.
Any of these risks, if encountered, could significantly harm the future international expansion and
operations of the joint venture and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We will have limited control over the activities on properties for which we own an interest but we
do not operate.
We may acquire interests in oil wells that will be operated by other companies. We will have limited
ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties or
the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. Our dependence
on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence
or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect
the realization of our targeted returns on capital and lead to unexpected future costs.
The loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain additional personnel could affect
our ability to successfully grow our business.
We are highly dependent upon the continued service and performance of our senior management. The
loss of any key employees may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business
objectives. We believe that our future success will also depend in part on our and their continued
ability to identify, hire, train and motivate qualified personnel. We face intense competition for qualified
individuals. We may not be able to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of
meeting our growing operational and managerial requirements, or we may be required to pay
increased compensation in order to do so. Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could
impair our ability to implement our business plan.
14
We may be adversely affected by actions of our competitors.
The market in the oil and gas recovery industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have
substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we have. We face competition from
owners of oil wells as well as large oil and gas companies The ability of the joint venture to compete
effectively depends in part on market acceptance of our technology, the environmental impact of our
technology and the joint ventures ability to service its customers in a timely manner. There can be no
assurance that the joint venture will be able to compete effectively or that it will respond appropriately
to industry trends or to activities of competitors.
Most of the potential customers of the joint venture are owners of oil wells and are subject to
risks faced by those industries.
We expect the joint venture to derive a significant portion of our future revenues from the
implementation of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology. As a result, it will be subject to risks and
uncertainties that affect the oil industry, such as availability of capital, weather and environmental
issues, government regulation, and the uncertainty resulting from technological change.
We have no separate independent audit committee. Our full Board of Directors functions as our
audit committee and is composed of four directors, none of whom are considered to be
independent. This may hinder our Board of Directors’ effectiveness in fulfilling the functions of
the audit committee.
Currently, we have no separate audit committee. Our full Board of Directors functions as our audit
committee and is comprised of four directors, one of whom has two votes and none of whom are
considered to be "independent" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the
Exchange Act. An independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance
process, assessing the Company's processes relating to its risks and control environment, overseeing
financial reporting, and evaluating internal and independent audit processes. The lack of an
independent audit committee may prevent the Board of Directors from being independent from
management in its judgments and decisions and its ability to pursue the committee's responsibilities
without undue influence. We may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite
qualifications. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified, independent directors, the management of
our business could be compromised.
Our Board of Directors, which does not have a majority of independent directors, acts as our
compensation committee, which presents the risk that compensation and benefits paid to these
executive officers that are board members and other officers may not be commensurate with
our financial performance.
A compensation committee consisting of independent directors is a safeguard against self-dealing by
company executives. Our Board of Directors acts as the compensation committee and determines the
compensation and benefits of our executive officers, administers our employee stock and benefit plans,
and reviews policies relating to the compensation and benefits of our employees. Although all board
members have fiduciary obligations in connection with compensation matters, our lack of an
independent compensation committee presents the risk that our executive officers on the board may
have influence over their personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate
with our financial performance.
Trading on the OTCQB may be sporadic because it is not a stock exchange, and stockholders
may have difficulty reselling their shares.
Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQB is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading
prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects.
Moreover, the OTCQB is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTCQB is often more
sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange
like NYSE. Accordingly, you may have difficulty reselling any of the shares you purchase from the
selling stockholders.
We cannot guarantee that an active trading market will develop for our common stock.
There currently is not an active public market for our common stock and there can be no assurance that
a regular trading market for our common stock will ever develop or that, if developed, it will be
sustained. Therefore, purchasers of our common stock should have long-term investment intent and
should recognize that it may be difficult to sell the shares, notwithstanding the fact that they are not
restricted securities. We cannot predict the extent to which a trading market will develop or how liquid a
market might become.
15
There may be future dilution of our common stock.
If we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, those sales could result in additional dilution
to our stockholders. Holders of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock have the right to convert their shares into
31,375,000 shares of common stock and; the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock has the right to
convert his shares into 4,000,000 common shares and Ervington, the sole holder of the Series C
Preferred Stock has the right to convert its shares of Series C Preferred Stock into 120,000,000 shares
of common stock. We also have warrants outstanding that are convertible into 6,339,498 shares of our
common stock.
Recent accounting changes may make it more difficult for us to sustain profitability.
We are a publicly traded company, and are therefore subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), which requires that our internal controls and procedures comply with Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We expect compliance to be costly and it could impact our results of
operations in future periods. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board now requires us to
follow the accounting standards on share based payments. Under this rule, companies must calculate
and record in their statement of operations the cost of equity instruments, such as stock options or
restricted stock, awarded to employees for services. We expect that we will use stock options to attract,
incentivize and retain our employees and will therefore incur the resulting stock-based compensation
expense. This will continue to adversely affect our operating results in future periods.
Maintaining and improving our financial controls and the requirements of being a public
company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to
attract and retain qualified board members.
As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of an exchange or the OTCQB. The requirements of these
rules and regulations will likely continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance
costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain
on our personnel, systems and resources.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls
and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting. Significant resources and
management oversight are required to design, document, test, implement and monitor internal control
over relevant processes and to, remediate any deficiencies. As a result, management’s attention may
be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, financial condition and
results of operations. These efforts also involve substantial accounting related costs.
We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide
assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material
weaknesses will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our
disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report
our financial results, prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may
cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a
decline in our stock price.
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our
financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. We have identified material
weaknesses in our internal controls with respect to our financial statement for the year ended
December 31, 2014. Our management discovered insufficient controls over review and accounting for
certain complex transactions and a lack of segregation of duties.
The design of monitoring controls used to assess the design and operating effectiveness of our internal
controls is inadequate.
We have begun to take actions that we believe will substantially remediate the material weaknesses
identified. In response to the identification of our material weaknesses, we are in the process of
expanding our finance and accounting staff. However, we cannot assure you that our internal control
over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the
future.
We have never paid dividends and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock in the
future.
Holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by
our Board of Directors. To date, we have paid no cash dividends on our shares of our preferred or
common stock and we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common
stock. Our Series C Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate of 4% per annum of the stated price,
which initially is $3.277777778 payable annually in arrears on December 31 of each year. In addition,
our Series B Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate of 8% per annum of the stated price, which
initially is $10.00 payable annually in arrears on December 31 of each year. Other than dividend
payments on the preferred stock we intend to retain future earnings, if any, to provide funds for
operations of our business. Therefore, any return investors in our preferred or common stock may have
will be in the form of appreciation, if any, in the market value of their shares of common stock.
16
Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.
The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors,
many of which are beyond our control, including:
·price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;
changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies
 ·
generally, or those in our industry in particular;
the public’s response to our press releases or other public announcements, including our filings with
 ·
the SEC;
announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic
 ·
partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;
·introduction of technologies or product enhancements that reduce the need for our products;
·market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole;
·the loss of key personnel;
·lawsuits threatened or filed against us;
·future sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders; and
other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these
 ·
events.
We may issue preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.
Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 10 million shares of
preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series,
the terms of which may be determined by the Board of Directors at the time of issuance without further
action by stockholders, and may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on
particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and
sinking fund provisions. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock, in
terms of dividends, liquidation rights and voting rights that could adversely affect the voting power or
other rights of the holders of our common stock. In the event of such an issuance, the Preferred Stock
could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a
change of control of our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or
changes in our Board of Directors or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the
completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could require substantial premium over the then
current market price per share. We currently have 3,137,500 Series A-1 Preferred Stock outstanding,
40,000 Series B Preferred Stock outstanding and have 4,500,000 Series C Preferred Stock
outstanding. The Series C Preferred Stock has the right to annual dividends in preference to all other
