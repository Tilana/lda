</p>
<p><b>I.  MANDATE OF THE FUND 
</b></p>
<p>1. The General Assembly, in its resolution 46/122, established the United Nations Voluntary 
Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery (the Fund) with the purpose of extending 
humanitarian, legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been violated as a 
result of contemporary forms of slavery. Funding is obtained by means of voluntary 
contributions from Governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), other private or 
public entities and individuals. 
</p>
<p><b>II. ADMINISTRATION AND BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF 
THE UNITED NATIONS VOLUNTARY TRUST FUND 
ON CONTEMPORARY FORMS OF SLAVERY 
</b></p>
<p>2. In conformity with resolution 46/122, the Fund is administered in accordance with the 
relevant financial regulations and rules of the United Nations on general trust funds for 
humanitarian assistance, by the Secretary-General, through the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), with the advice of a Board of Trustees. 
</p>
<p>3. The Board of Trustees is composed of five United Nations experts with relevant 
experience in the field of human rights and, in particular, with issues of contemporary forms of 
slavery, serving in their personal capacities. In December 2007 the Secretary-General appointed 
the following members for a three-year term ending on 31 December 2010, with due regard to 
equitable geographical distribution: Gulnara Shahinian (Armenia), Virginia Herrera Murillo 
(Costa Rica), Prateep Unsongtham Hata (Thailand), Cleophas Kwdjo Mally (Togo) and 
David Weissbrodt (United States of America). Ms. Shahinian resigned on 23 May 2008 because 
she was nominated as Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes 
and consequences. The Secretary-General is due to appoint her replacement in 2009.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>III.  GRANT CYCLE AND ADMISSIBILITY CRITERIA 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Grant cycle 
</b></p>
<p>4. The deadline for submitting applications for project grants for 2008 
was 31 December 2007. Admissible applications received were examined by the Board of 
Trustees at its thirteenth session, which took place in Geneva from 8-12 September 2008. The 
recommendations for grants adopted by the Board of Trustees at that session were approved by 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, on behalf of the Secretary-General, 
and the grants approved were to be paid in December 2008. Beneficiaries of project grants will 
have to provide the secretariat of the Fund with midyear narrative and financial reports on the 
use of their grants before 30 June 2009 and final year narrative and financial reports on the use 
of their grants before 28 February 2010. Until satisfactory reports on the use of previous grants 
are received, no new project grant can be paid to these beneficiaries. 
</p><p>5. The deadline for submitting applications for travel or project grants for 2009 
is 31 March 2009. Admissible applications received will be examined by the Board of Trustees 
at its fourteenth session, scheduled to take place in Geneva from 17-18 September 2009. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Admissibility of new applications and selection process 
</b></p>
<p>6. In accordance with the selection criteria adopted by the General Assembly in 
resolution 46/122, the beneficiaries of assistance from the Fund shall be individuals whose 
human rights have been severely violated as a result of contemporary forms of slavery. Project 
admissibility criteria are outlined in the Fund&#8217;s guidelines. 
</p>
<p>7. Admissible application forms are verified as to their conformity with approved selection 
criteria and additional information is requested from the organization if necessary. Reference 
organizations and specialized networks are also consulted if necessary. The complete application 
form is then summarized and analysed by the Secretariat in accordance with the selection 
criteria, to facilitate the work of the Board of Trustees. At its annual session, the Board of 
Trustees reviews all applications declared admissible, including the original application form, the 
summary analysis prepared by the secretariat and any other relevant information. The Board of 
Trustees then makes recommendations to the Secretary-General in accordance with the 
guidelines of the Fund and Board of Trustees. Following the session the secretariat reviews all 
the recommendations of the Board of Trustees for consistency with relevant United Nations 
administrative and financial rules and regulations. The High Commissioner approves, on behalf 
of the Secretary-General, the recommendations regarding project grants. 
</p><p>8. The beneficiary organizations are requested to accept all conditions attached to the grant, 
such as providing midyear and final narrative and financial reports on the use of grants by a 
given deadline. Upon receipt of this confirmation, the secretariat of the Fund requests the 
financial services of the United Nations Office at Geneva to pay the project grant promptly. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Monitoring and evaluation by the Board and Secretariat 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Secretariat reviews all narrative and financial reports received from beneficiary 
organizations on the use of project grants, and asks for additional information if needed. 
OHCHR field presences and other United Nations field offices such as those of the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) may be requested to provide the secretariat of 
the Fund with additional information on the organization or project. 
</p><p>10. In carrying out their evaluation, the Board and the Secretariat carry out the following 
activities: 
</p>
<p> (a) At its annual session the Board of Trustees reviews the situation of all project grants 
allocated in previous years. When the Board is satisfied with the reporting by a given 
organization, it recommends closing the file. If the report is not complete, the Board makes a 
recommendation requesting specific additional information. No new grants will be allocated to 
that organization until the Board is satisfied with its report; 
</p>
<p> (b) Board members may visit projects financed by the Fund within their geographic 
region; the secretariat of the Fund may also visit projects; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (c) Board members, who are respected United Nations experts in the field of 
contemporary forms of slavery, may establish, if needed, direct contact with project leaders in 
the field, during sessions of the Board of Trustees, or at relevant human rights meetings, in order 
to better evaluate the use of the grants. The secretariat may also meet with project leaders; 
 (d) Reference organizations and specialized networks may be invited to the session of 
the Board of Trustees at which their applications are examined in order, inter alia, to provide 
additional information on specific organizations or projects, answer questions and explain their 
activities to the Board. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE FUND 
</b></p>
<p>11. According to information received from OHCHR at the thirteenth session, US$ 970,050 
was available from new contributions paid since the twelfth session of the Board of Trustees 
(see annex I) as well as from previous unspent balance. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  THIRTEENTH SESSION OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES 
</b></p>
<p>12. The thirteenth session of the Board of Trustees of the Fund was held at OHCHR in Geneva 
from 8 to 12 September 2008. The session was opened by Julian Burger, Coordinator of the 
Indigenous Peoples and Minorities Unit, Rule of Law, Equality and Non-Discrimination 
Branch. Mr. Burger congratulated the new members Mr. Cleophas Kwdjo Mally and 
Ms. Virginia Herrera Murillo for their appointment and drew the attention of the Board members 
to the final results of the evaluation of the Fund that was undertaken by the Office for Internal 
Oversight Services (OIOS), following a recommendation by the Board at its eleventh session. He 
also welcomed the appointment of a new Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, 
including its causes and consequences. 
</p>
<p>13. Four Board members attended the session, and Mr. Weissbrodt was elected Chairman. The 
fifth Board member, Gulnara Shahinian (Armenia), who resigned on 23 May 2008 and had not 
been replaced at the time of the session, did not attend the session. 
</p>
<p>14. The Board held 10 meetings during which it examined information prepared by the 
secretariat concerning the financial situation of the Fund, fund-raising efforts, applications for 
new travel and project grants and the development of policies for future grant activities. 
</p><p>15. On 10 September 2008, the Board members and the Special Rapporteur organized a joint 
parallel event in the framework of the ninth session of the Human Rights Council with interested 
Governments and NGOs. On 12 September 2008, the Board of Trustees held its annual meeting 
with representatives of donor Governments, other donors and interested Governments 
(see paragraph 22). 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Recommendations for grants 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Board examined 181 applications for project grants from 48 countries amounting 
to US$ 2,490,837. Applications were received from the following continents and countries. 
Africa (40): Benin (2), Burkina Faso (1), Burundi (1), Cameroon (4), Central African 
Republic (2), Democratic Republic of the Congo (5), Ethiopia (1), Ghana (1), Ivory Coast (2), 
Kenya (2), Liberia (1), Malawi (1), Mali (1), Nigeria (5), Guinea (1), Rwanda (2), Tanzania (2), </p>

</p>
<p>17. In light of the selection criteria, the Board of Trustees recommended 71 project grants for a 
total amount of US$ 733,109 which will assist 71 non-governmental organizations in 
45 countries. In Africa (22): Benin (1), Burkina Faso (1), Burundi (1), Cameroon (1),

18. The Board also recommended a contingency list of 15 project grants for a total amount 
of US$ 108,000 which will assist 15 non-governmental organizations in India (cf. chart of 
project grants attached as annex III). 
<b>Gender dimension 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Board took into account the importance of gender representation as well as national 
and regional distribution when considering applications for travel and project grants. It appears 
that more than half of the individuals who benefited from project grants are women. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Fund-raising 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Board adopted its revised cost plan for 2008, based on the funds available. 
</p>
<p>21. The Board held its annual meeting with regular and new donor Governments, interested 
Governments and other donors. The meeting was attended by representatives of 12 States 
including Canada, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Holy See, Israel, Malaysia, Romania, 
Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland. 
</p>
<p>22. The Chairman and Board members thanked donors for their generous contributions to the 
Fund and gave examples of how these grants assist victims of contemporary forms of slavery. 
Several States expressed their support and appreciation for the work of the Fund. 
</p>
<p>23. The Board also met with Ms. Bernadette Pierard-Pasquier of the OHCHR Donor and 
External Relations Section and recommended that information on the Fund be disseminated 
during meetings with regular donors of OHCHR. The Board also recommended the 
strengthening of the collaboration between the Donor and External Relations Section and the 
secretariat of the Fund. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>24. The Board agreed to send a letter signed by the Chair to all Permanent Missions and 
Delegations to the United Nations Office at Geneva appealing for contributions to the Fund, not 
later than December 2008, which would also be used by the Board members in their respective 
regions as a basis for follow-up activities with States, as well as with other potential donors.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Follow-up to Office for Internal Oversight Services recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>25. As recommended by the Board at its eleventh session, a global review of the Fund was 
undertaken by OIOS from November 2006 to January 2007. The objectives of the review were to 
review the impact of the Fund&#8217;s activities on the target groups and ascertain if grants were 
awarded in accordance with United Nations regulations and rules, and Fund guidelines, as well 
as to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of its reporting and monitoring processes. The final 
report containing 21 recommendations was issued in June 2007. 
</p>
<p>26. The overall assessment of OIOS is that the Fund is addressing its mandate and has a 
positive impact on victims of contemporary forms of slavery. OIOS emphasized that the Fund 
has certain unique characteristics. It assists small organizations working at the grass-roots level, 
focuses on issues that Governments are often reluctant to recognize and gives credibility to new 
initiatives which can then access other sources of funds to further grow and develop. 
</p>
<p>27. Under its agenda item on follow-up to OIOS recommendations, the Board met with 
Joanna Di Domenico, auditor at OIOS. Ms. Di Domenico stressed the progress that was made by 
the secretariat in implementing recommendations and noted the net increase in the number of 
applications and contributions received. 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendations 1, 2 and 3 
</b></p>
<p>28. OIOS recommended that more detailed guidelines be established that include key 
indicators of contemporary forms of slavery for the selection of beneficiaries, to prioritize certain 
forms of contemporary slavery, in particular those not addressed by other international 
organizations and to support projects adopting a strategy that addresses the root causes of the 
problem, combined with direct assistance and income-generating activities that assist victims of 
contemporary forms of slavery. 
</p>
<p>29. The Board elaborated and provisionally adopted new guidelines and policies including key 
indicators of contemporary forms of slavery. Special provisions were inserted encouraging 
NGOs to develop sustainable projects accompanied by actions addressing the root cause of 
modern slavery, combined with direct assistance and income-generating activities that assist 
victims of contemporary forms of slavery. The Board also decided to request grantees to submit 
additional impact assessment reports two years after the termination of projects to enable a better 
impact assessment in the long term. 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendation 4  
</b></p>
<p>30. OIOS recommended that the Fund should consider building a longer-term relationship with 
organizations that give direct assistance by providing funding to them over a period of two to 
three years. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>31. The Board developed and provisionally adopted new guidelines and policies containing 
special provisions on a two-year funding policy - subject to the availability of funds. 
<b>Recommendation 5 
</b></p>
<p>32. OIOS recommended that the Board of Trustees should encourage applicants to focus their 
project proposals on capacity-building through activities such as technical assistance or training. 
</p><p>33. Special provisions were inserted into the new guidelines and policies to encourage 
applicants to use a part of their grants for capacity-building such as human rights education, 
project management, training and bookkeeping. In addition, the Board decided to request NGOs 
to include beneficiaries during the design and implementation phases of the projects. 
34. The Board also stressed that its members should have a more proactive role by providing 
capacity-building training, without any financial implication for the Fund, to selected NGOs in 
their respective regions. 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendations 6 and 7 
</b></p>
<p>35. OIOS recommended improving access to information available on the Fund&#8217;s website, to 
facilitate the establishment of partnerships and sharing of best practices among grantees, further 
raise awareness of the problem of slavery and to publicize the achievements of the Fund. 
</p>
<p>36. The Board discussed the new version of the website of the Fund prepared by the secretariat 
which contains links with other organizations working on slavery issues, success stories, and a 
directory of alternative sources of funding available for projects aiming to provide assistance to 
victims of contemporary forms of slavery and recommended that it be put online. The Board 
recommended that a compilation of best practices taken from narrative reports be drafted at the 
end of each reporting year and made publicly available. The Board also recommended 
disseminating its report to NGOs and OHCHR field offices. 
</p>
<p>37. The Board reviewed the directory of NGOs working on contemporary forms of slavery 
which was compiled by the secretariat and recommended extending the directory by including 
grass-roots NGOs. It further recommended widely disseminating information materials to NGOs, 
such as the booklet &#8220;The United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of 
Slavery&#8221;,<b>1</b> the special issue paper &#8220;Abolishing Slavery and its Contemporary Forms&#8221;<b>2</b> and the 
application forms. 
</p>
<p>38. The Board recommended that OHCHR encourage its field offices, Special Rapporteurs and 
other partners, to disseminate these materials. 
</p>
<p>39. The Board stressed the importance of annual observances to mark the United Nations 
International Day for the Abolition of Slavery (2 December) to raise awareness of the issue.

<p><b>2
</b>  HR/PUB/02/04. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendation 8 
</b></p>
<p>40. OIOS recommended that the Board of Trustees should focus to a greater extent on policy 
issues such as establishing priorities for the future development of the Fund, fund-raising, 
monitoring and technical expertise for NGOs, etc. in order to better address the needs of victims 
of slavery over the long term. 
</p>
<p>41. During its thirteenth session, the Board of Trustees devoted one day to policy and strategic 
issues to address the needs of victims of slavery over the long term. 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendation 9 
</b></p>
<p>42. OIOS recommended the establishment of a formal monitoring and evaluation mechanism 
to ensure that the grants approved are used for the purposes intended. 
</p>
<p>43. In line with recommendations made by OIOS, the Board recommended monitoring 
projects on a regular basis. Reports of project visits should be prepared by the secretariat for 
consideration by the Board at its annual session. The Board recommended undertaking two field 
missions prior to the disbursements of new grants in December 2008 and to make available 
4 per cent of the total budget of the Fund for these field missions. The Board recommended 
informing UNDP field offices of any planned evaluation missions, and to use these visits for 
outreach to organizations, particularly in affected areas, that have had low numbers of 
applications. 
</p>
<p>44. The Board also revised and adopted new forms for financial and narrative reports 
strengthening the monitoring and evaluation of grantees. 
</p>
<p>45. The first field mission was undertaken from 2 to 11 November 2008 by one member of the 
Board of Trustees (Prateep Ungsongtham Hata) and the secretariat of the Fund to pre-screen and 
monitor 13 grant recipients and potential grant recipients of the Fund in India (Andhra Pradesh). 
Findings and recommendations will be presented to the Board for its consideration at its next 
session. 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendation 10 
</b></p>
<p>46. OIOS recommended establishing a management information system to enable effective 
monitoring and follow-up of grants. 
</p>
<p>47. The Board noted with satisfaction that a new grant management system had been 
developed. This new grant management system is still at an early stage of development and the 
secretariat is currently building up the system database. 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendation 12 
</b></p>
<p>48. OIOS recommended that OHCHR should further strengthen its fund-raising efforts to raise 
more resources to increase the dissemination of the purpose and impact of the Fund&#8217;s work. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>49. The Board reviewed the fund-raising activities undertaken by the members of the Board 
and secretariat. A fund-raising meeting was organized on 19 February 2008 with donors and 
other interested Governments to discuss the future direction of the Fund. In addition, 15 bilateral 
meetings were organized with representatives of Permanent Missions. 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendation 13 
</b></p>
<p>50. OIOS recommended reformulating the processing and funding cycle of the Fund. The 
Board adopted a new grant cycle for project grants for 2010 as follows: 
 (a) Deadline for the submission of project applications for 2010: 31 March 2009; 
 (b) Annual session of the Board of Trustees: September 2009; 
</p>
<p> (c) Disbursement: October to December 2009; 
</p>
<p> (d) Submission of interim financial and narrative reports: 30 June 2010; 
</p>
<p> (e) Submission of financial and narrative reports: 28 February 2011. 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendations 15 and 16 
</b></p>
<p>51. OIOS recommended that OHCHR establish a more comprehensive and cost-effective 
pre-screening policy to ensure that grants are approved for credible applicants in a cost-effective 
manner and in coordination with OHCHR, UNDP field presences, and other relevant partners to 
verify the actual existence of new applicants. 
</p>
<p>52. The Board revised and adopted a new format for the pre-screening of applications as well 
as new application forms requesting applicants applying for the first time to the Fund to provide 
additional documents including: a registration certificate of the organization; statute of the 
organization; copy of bank records indicating signatories for the organization; copies of 
six months&#8217; bank statements; two letters of recommendation; and evidence of other sources of 
funding. The secretariat also coordinated with OHCHR and UNDP field presences to verify the 
existence and quality of all applicants. 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendation 18 
</b></p>
<p>53. OIOS recommended that OHCHR require grantees to sign a comprehensive agreement that 
safeguards the interests of the Fund and includes the obligation to cooperate with project 
evaluations; submit reports; maintain documentation as to how the grant was spent; and refund in 
cases of fraud, misuse or mismanagement. 
</p>
<p>54. The Board noted that a new standard grant agreement containing all requested provisions 
was sent to all beneficiaries of project grants in 2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D. Collaboration with the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of slavery, including its causes and consequences 
</b></p>
<p>55. Under the agenda item devoted to developments in the United Nations system concerning 
relevant mandates, the Board met with the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, 
including its causes and consequences. The members of the Board and the Special Rapporteur 
discussed means of collaboration. The Special Rapporteur agreed to contribute to the monitoring 
and evaluation of grantees, pre-screening processes of new applicants and capacity-building of 
grantees during her field missions.  
</p>
<p>56. In line with recommendations 6 and 8 made by OIOS, the Board decided to 
allocate US$ 10,000 to NGOs to fund grantees so they could attend regional, subregional and 
national meetings organized in the framework of the field missions of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>57. On 10 September 2008, the Board members and the Special Rapporteur convened a 
meeting in the framework of the ninth session of the Human Rights Council with interested 
Governments and NGOs to discuss collaboration between the Fund and the Special Rapporteur. 
This meeting was attended by representatives of 14 States including Azerbaijan, Bahrain, 
Belarus, Canada, Denmark, Israel, Finland, France, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland 
and the United States of America, and representatives of 14 non-governmental organizations. 
Various States expressed their support for the collaboration between the Fund and the Special 
Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>58. Taking into account the ongoing changes in the human rights machinery, the Board 
recommended revising OHCHR fact sheet No. 14 on &#8220;Contemporary Forms of Slavery&#8221;, in 
collaboration with the Special Rapporteur, in order to include a reference to the activities of the 
Fund and to the new mandate of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Other recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Board reviewed the implementation of its recommendations from the twelfth session 
in 2007, and expressed its gratitude that to the extent possible these recommendations were ably 
and competently handled by the secretariat. 
</p>
<p>60. The Board noted that increased cooperation with OHCHR special procedures mandate 
holders and field offices would be mutually beneficial, and recommended sharing information on 
organizations and coordinating work. 
</p>
<p>61. In light of the increased amount of contributions, application forms received and OIOS 
recommendations, the Board requested that OHCHR provide the Fund with all necessary 
administrative and secretarial support to fulfil its functions. The Board requested its Chair to 
transmit a letter to the High Commissioner concerning the need for further staffing of the 
secretariat of the Fund. 
</p>
<p>62. The Board recommended inviting the Programme Coordinator of the International Labour 
Organization International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (ILO-IPEC) to its 
fourteenth session and to include an agenda item on cooperation with ILO-IPEC. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
