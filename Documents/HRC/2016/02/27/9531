<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report sets out progress on the implementation of the recommendations 
contained in the study on human rights and disability and the achievements of the objectives set 
forth in the programme of work of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in 
relation to the human rights of persons with disabilities.  The report briefly lists activities of the 
Office over 2006 in the area.  The main achievement over 2006 has been the adoption, in 
December, by the General Assembly of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities, the eighth core international human rights instrument.  Consequently, the report 
provides a presentation of some of the principal elements of the Convention.  The report 
recommends that the Human Rights Council maintain the issue of human rights and disability 
under consideration and suggests that the Council might wish to consider requesting the 
High Commissioner to submit annual analytical thematic reports on human rights and disability.

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. By its resolution 2005/65, the Commission on Human Rights requested the Office of 
the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to report to the Commission at its 
sixty-second session on progress in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the 
study on human rights and disability and on the achievement of the objectives set forth in the 
programme of work of the Office in relation to the human rights of persons with disabilities.  In 
its decision 2/102, the Human Rights Council decided to request the Secretary-General of the 
United Nations and the High Commissioner to continue with the fulfilment of their activities, in 
accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to 
update the relevant reports and studies.  The present report is submitted in response to these 
requests. 
</p>
<p>2. The 2002 OHCHR study on &#8220;Human rights and disability:  the current use and future 
potential of United Nations human rights instruments in the context of disability&#8221; (the study), 
focused on the work carried out by the (then) six core United Nations human rights treaty bodies 
to advance the equal effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by 
persons with disabilities.  The study concluded that, despite their considerable potential, the 
United Nations human rights treaties had not been fully used in the context of disability.  In 
order to enhance the future use of the existing human rights treaties and mechanisms, the study 
addressed a wide range of recommendations to States parties, treaty bodies, the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Commission on Human Rights, national human 
rights institutions and civil society.<b>1</b>   
</p>
<p>3. In the context of its recommendations, the study considered the possible drafting of a new 
convention on human rights and disability.  The study concluded by noting that such a 
convention &#8220;would mark a huge step forward and should not undermine but underpin the 
protections provided in the existing six human rights treaties&#8221;.  In 2001, the General Assembly 
established an Ad Hoc Committee on a Comprehensive and Integral International Convention on 
the Protection and Promotion of the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disability (the Ad Hoc 
Committee) which met for eight sessions and submitted a draft text to the General Assembly for 
action.  On 13 December 2006, the General Assembly adopted the International Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (&#8220;the Convention&#8221;) and its Optional Protocol, as 
contained in its resolution 61/106 (see A/61/611, annex).   
</p>
<p>4. Given the importance of this new development, including in relation to the 
implementation of the recommendations of the study, the present report seeks to provide 
information to the Human Rights Council on the new Convention.  Consequently, the report is 
divided into three sections.  The first section provides an update on OHCHR activities 
during 2006 in relation to human rights and disabilities.  The second section provides a detailed

<p>outline of the purpose, content, obligations and monitoring mechanisms contained in the new 
Convention.  The third section draws some conclusions and indicates some recommendations 
for possible action by the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>I. ACTIVITIES ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND DISABILITIES OF THE 
OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>5. Over 2006, OHCHR has continued to increase its work on human rights and disabilities.  
In keeping with the five action points outlined in the High Commissioner&#8217;s Plan of Action, 
those activities have sought to promote:  more synergy in the relationship between OHCHR 
and the various United Nations human rights bodies; an enhanced leadership role for the 
High Commissioner; greater country engagement; closer partnerships with civil society and 
the United Nations agencies; and, strengthened management and planning for OHCHR.  
</p>
<p><b>More synergy in the relationship between the Office of the High Commissioner and the 
various United Nations human rights bodies 
</b></p>
<p>6. Much of the work of the Office over the reporting period has focused in assisting the 
Ad Hoc Committee of the General Assembly that drafted the International Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol.  To that end, the Office participated 
in the seventh and eighth sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee from 16 January to 3 February and 
from 14 to 25 August 2006 and 5 December 2006, respectively.  At the seventh session, the 
Office organized a briefing and lunchtime panel on treaty body reform and provided a 
background paper on international monitoring.  In September and October 2006, the Office 
participated in the Drafting Group established by the Ad Hoc Committee to ensure that the 
six language versions of the new Convention were technically consistent and coherent.  The 
Office also participated in the process of adoption both at the resumed eighth session of the 
Ad Hoc Committee on 5 December as well as at the final adoption by the General Assembly at 
its sixty-first session, on 13 December 2006. 
</p>
<p>7. The Office has begun working with special procedures of the Human Rights Council to 
promote the rights of persons with disabilities within the context of their mandates.  On 23 and 
24 November, the Office hosted an expert seminar on &#8220;The right to education of persons with 
disabilities&#8221; to assist the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education in the preparation of his 
thematic report to be submitted to the Council at its fourth session (A/HRC/4/29).  Similar 
activities are planned for 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>An enhanced leadership role for the High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Plan of Action highlighted an enhanced leadership role for the High Commissioner 
through, amongst other things, greater interaction with relevant United Nations bodies.  On 
27 January 2006 as well as 5 December 2006, the High Commissioner addressed the 
Ad Hoc Committee.  In her January statement, the High Commissioner encouraged the 
Ad Hoc Committee in its work, acknowledging that future implementation of the Convention 
would require resources while underlining the fact that resource constraints should not 
obscure the need to combat deeply rooted discrimination.  In her December statement, the 
High Commissioner welcomed the adoption of the Convention, highlighting the way in which 
the negotiation process had already provided a catalyst for change within the United Nations, in </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>particular given the strong involvement of civil society organizations and national human rights 
institutions in the negotiations as well as the increased efforts to ensure physical and 
technological accessibility at the United Nations offices.   
</p>
<p>9. During the second session of the Human Rights Council, the High Commissioner and the 
President of the Council, Mr. Luis Alfonso de Alba (Mexico), hosted a lunchtime briefing on the 
Convention for States representatives and observers to the Council.  The High Commissioner 
highlighted a selection of provisions in the Convention such as the prohibition on torture and the 
right to education and their relevance to persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b>Greater country engagement 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Office has also participated in national level meetings aimed at disseminating 
information on the Convention.  On 30 and 31 October, the Office participated in an 
international seminar on the Convention organized in Mexico by the Department of Foreign 
Affairs.  On 20 November, a representative of the Office in Uganda participated in a meeting 
organized by the Government.  On 30 November, the Office participated in a meeting hosted by 
the Department of Public Information in Moscow.  On 1 December, the Office participated in a 
conference organized by Disabled Persons South Africa in Durban, South Africa, where the 
Office made a presentation on the Convention.  On 20 December, the Office participated in a 
Conference on the Convention in Madrid organized by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs 
of Spain.  In terms of technical cooperation, the Human Rights Unit of the United Nations 
Assistance Mission in Afghanistan is co-funding a project with the United Nations Development 
Programme concerning a radio programme designed to promote greater awareness and 
understanding of the situation of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>11. In 2006, the Office, together with the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Department of 
Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) agreed to co-publish a &#8220;Handbook for Parliamentarians on 
the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities&#8221;.  The Handbook will be 
available in the second half of 2007 and is intended to enhance understanding of the Convention 
amongst parliamentarians and other actors at the country level. 
</p>
<p><b>Closer partnerships with civil society and the United Nations agencies 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Office has also participated in inter-agency meetings on the Convention.  In 
June 2006, the Office convened a meeting of Geneva based intergovernmental organizations and 
civil society organizations working on human rights and disability with a view to disseminating 
information to relevant partners on the negotiation process.  The Office participated in an 
Inter-Agency Meeting from 10 to 11 August hosted in New York by DESA to coordinate 
agencies&#8217; work related to the Convention.  On 30 November, the Office also participated in the 
Inter-Agency Coordination Group on Mine Action Sub-Group in Geneva, in order to disseminate 
information on the Convention as it relates to assistance to victims of landmines.   
</p>
<p>13. The Office continued assisting national human rights institutions (NHRI) to participate in 
the negotiation process of the Convention.  The Office sponsored the participation of the 
representative of the International Coordinating Committee of NHRIs to the January and August 
sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee.  In April 2006, the Office also provided a briefing on the 
negotiation process to the International Coordinating Committee of NHRIs in Geneva. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>14. Over 2006, the Office participated in several expert group meetings related to the 
negotiation and adoption of the Convention.  In March, the Office participated in a consultative 
meeting organized by DESA for non-European Union (EU) Eastern European States.  The 
meeting involved both member States and disabled persons organizations (DPOs) and aimed at 
contributing to the work of the Ad Hoc Committee.   
</p>
<p>15. From 20 to 21 November, the Office participated in a two-day Conference, organized by 
CBM (International) and light for the world (Austria), which was part of the International 
Disability and Development Consortium (IDDC) project &#8220;Breaking the cycle of poverty and 
disability in Development Cooperation&#8221; Disability Mainstreaming in Development Cooperation, 
supported by the Directorate General Employment and Social Affairs of the European 
Commission, in partnership with several non-governmental organizations.  The objective of this 
first European gathering was to formulate a strategy to promote the Convention and its role in 
advancing development policies inclusive of disability.   
</p>
<p><b>Strengthened management and planning for OHCHR 
</b></p>
<p>16. In April 2006, the Office filled the post of Advisor on Human Rights and Disability 
ensuring dedicated full-time attention to the mandate at an appropriate level.   
</p>
<p>17. In keeping with the theme of the International Day of Disabled Persons 2006 
(3 December) which was &#8220;e-accessibility&#8221;, the Office accomplished the first stage of its revision 
of its homepage, making the page on disabilities accessible.  The upgrading of the rest of the 
website is in progress. 
</p>
<p><b>II. INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS 
WITH DISABILITIES AND ITS OPTIONAL PROTOCOL 
</b></p>
<p>18. On 13 December 2006, the General Assembly adopted the International Convention 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its optional protocol, as contained in 
resolution 61/106 (see A/61/611, annex), making it the eighth core human rights treaty.  The 
Convention will be open for signature on 30 March 2007 in New York.  The following section 
outlines some of the main articles and issues raised in the new Convention.  The section is 
intended as an introduction to the Convention; however, given space limitations, the report does 
not attempt to give a comprehensive overview of each of its provisions. 
</p>
<p><b>General overview 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Convention consists of 50 articles on purpose, general principles, general 
obligations, specific rights, and actions to be adopted by States to ensure an enabling 
environment for the fullest enjoyment, without discrimination, of the rights of persons with 
disabilities, to foster international cooperation and to establish international and national 
monitoring.  The Convention does not create any new rights; rather it clarifies the obligations of 
States in relation to existing civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights.  In order to 
ensure an environment conducive to the fulfilment of the rights of persons with disabilities, the 
Convention includes articles on awareness-raising, accessibility, situations of risk and 
humanitarian emergencies, access to justice, personal mobility, habilitation and rehabilitation, as 
well as statistics and data collection.  The Convention establishes a Conference of States parties </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>to meet regularly to consider any matter with regard to implementation of the Convention and to 
be convened by the Secretary-General of the United Nations no later than six months after the 
entry into force of the Convention.  The Convention also establishes the Committee on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities with authority to receive and review periodic reports 
submitted by States parties to the Convention.   
</p>
<p>20. Under the Optional Protocol to the Convention, individuals and groups of individuals 
may submit allegations of breaches of any of the provisions of the Convention to the Committee.  
The Optional Protocol also permits the Committee to undertake in-country inquiries where there 
has been reliable evidence of grave or systematic violations of the rights of persons with 
disabilities. 
</p>
<p>21. It is often stated that the Convention represents a paradigm shift in attitudes that moves 
from a perception of persons with disabilities as objects of charity, medical treatment and social 
protection to subjects of rights, able to claim those rights as active members of society.  The 
Convention achieves this paradigm shift by affirming that persons with disabilities hold civil, 
cultural, economic, political and social rights, are entitled to full protection against 
discrimination and by establishing monitoring mechanisms at the national and international 
levels to ensure that persons with disabilities are able to enforce those rights.   
</p>
<p><b>Purpose and definitions 
</b></p>
<p>22. Article 1 of the Convention identifies its purpose &#8220;to promote, protect and ensure the full 
and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with 
disabilities and to promote respect for their inherent dignity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>23. The Convention does not include a definition of &#8220;disability&#8221; or &#8220;persons with disabilities&#8221; 
as such.  However, elements of the preamble and article 1 provide guidance to clarify the 
application of the Convention.  First, the preamble recognizes that &#8220;disability is an evolving 
concept and that disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and 
attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders their full and effective participation in society 
on an equal basis with others&#8221;.  Article 1 states that &#8220;(p)ersons with disabilities include those 
who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction 
with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis 
with others&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>24. Several elements of these provisions are relevant to highlight.  First, there is recognition 
that &#8220;disability&#8221; is an evolving concept resulting from attitudinal and environmental barriers 
hindering the participation of persons with disabilities in society.  Consequently, the notion of 
&#8220;disability&#8221; is not fixed and can alter, depending on the prevailing environment from society to 
society.  Second, disability is not considered as a medical condition as such, but rather as a result 
of the interaction between negative attitudes or an unwelcoming environment with the condition 
of particular persons.  By dismantling attitudinal and environmental barriers - as opposed to 
treating persons with disabilities as problems to be fixed - those persons can participate as active 
members of society and enjoy the full range of their rights.  Third, the Convention does not 
restrict coverage to particular persons; rather, the Convention identifies persons with long-term 
physical, mental, intellectual and sensory disabilities as beneficiaries under the Convention.  The </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>reference to &#8220;includes&#8221; assures that this need not restrict the application of the Convention and 
States parties could also ensure protection to others, for example, persons with short-term 
disabilities or who are perceived to be part of such groups. 
</p>
<p><b>Principles 
</b></p>
<p>25. Article 3 sets out the general principles of the Convention.  The General Principles can be 
grouped as follows:  respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy and independence of 
persons; non-discrimination, equality of opportunity and equality between men and women; 
participation and inclusion; respect for difference and acceptance of human diversity; 
accessibility; and, respect for the evolving capacities of children with disabilities and respect for 
their right to preserve their identities. 
</p>
<p>26. While all the general principles are of equal importance, the present section illustrates 
the relevance of three of these, namely:  the principle of non-discrimination; the principle of 
accessibility; and the principle of participation and inclusion.  First, the principle of 
non-discrimination is one of the basic principles of international human rights law.  
&#8220;Discrimination on the basis of disability&#8221; is defined in similar, although not exact, terms as 
definitions of discrimination found in other human rights treaties<b>2</b> as follows:  &#8220;Discrimination 
on the basis of disability means any distinction, exclusion or restriction on the basis of disability 
which has the purpose or effect of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, 
on an equal basis with others, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, 
economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.  It includes all forms of discrimination, 
including denial of reasonable accommodation&#8221; (art. 2).   
</p>
<p>27. The inclusion of the denial of reasonable accommodation as a form of discrimination is 
significant.  Reasonable accommodation is defined as follows:  &#8220;&#8216;Reasonable accommodation&#8217; 
means necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate 
or undue burden, where needed in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the 
enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms&#8221; (art. 2). 
</p>
<p>28. Consequently, individuals with disabilities are able to claim that the State, and through 
the State, other actors such as the private sector, have obligations to take steps to accommodate 
his or her particular situation, so long as those steps do not impose an overly harsh burden.  For 
example, if an employee has an accident resulting in a physical disability, whether at or outside 
the workplace, which requires the employee to use a wheelchair in the future, the employer now 
has a responsibility to provide, for example, ramps, clear corridors, ensure wheelchair accessible 
toilets and make other adjustments and modifications so that the persons can continue to work as 
an active employee.  A failure to make such accommodations would give rise to a cause of 
action so that the individual employee could bring a claim to an appropriate judicial or 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  See e.g., International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 
</p>
<p>article 1; Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
article 1. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>quasi-judicial body on the ground of discrimination.  However, the accommodations that the 
employer must undertake are not unlimited; they must only be &#8220;reasonable&#8221; such that, for 
example, a disproportionately expensive accommodation would not be mandatory. 
</p>
<p>29. Second, the principle of accessibility is a crucial element in dismantling the barriers that 
hinder the effective enjoyment of rights by persons with disabilities.  Physical, technological, 
information, communication, economic and social accessibility is important to the full 
participation of anyone in society.  For persons with disabilities, accessibility is particularly 
significant, given the many barriers blocking full access.  The provision of ramps, sufficiently 
large and unblocked corridors and doors, the placement of door handles, the availability of 
information in Braille and easy to read formats, the use of sign interpretation/interpreters, the 
availability of assistance and support can ensure access to a person with a disability to the 
workplace, a place of entertainment, a voting booth, to transport, to a courtroom and so on.  
Without accessibility, not only is movement of persons with disabilities restricted, the enjoyment 
of other rights is also restricted.  Consequently, not only is accessibility a general principle of the 
Convention, it is also a stand-alone provision.  Article 9 requires States parties to take 
appropriate measures to &#8220;enable persons with disabilities to live independently and to participate 
fully in all aspects of life&#8221; by taking appropriate measures to ensure access to the physical 
environment, to transportation, to information and communications and to other facilities and 
services open or provided to the public in both urban and rural areas. 
</p>
<p>30. Third, the principle of participation and inclusion runs throughout the Convention.  
Significantly, article 1 of the Convention recognizes that full and effective participation in 
society by persons with disabilities is hindered by various barriers in society.  Participation in 
political and public life is expressly recognized in a dedicated article (art. 29) which guarantees 
&#8220;to persons with disabilities political rights and the opportunity to enjoy them on an equal basis 
with others&#8221;.  This includes the right to participate directly or through freely chosen 
representatives and the encouragement of the formation and participation of persons with 
disabilities in non-governmental organizations and associations at the international, national, 
regional and local levels.  Similarly, the Convention specifically recognizes participation in 
cultural life, recreation, leisure and sport in a separate article (art. 30).  Participation and 
inclusion is also expressly referred to in relation to living independently and being included in 
the community (art. 19), inclusive education as an element of the right to education (art. 24) as 
well as full inclusion and participation in all aspects of life as the objective of habilitation and 
rehabilitation (art. 26).  Further, the Convention acknowledges the importance of participation in 
processes it establishes, with the requirement that States give due consideration to the 
participation of experts with disabilities in the future Committee on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities that will monitor implementation.  The significance of participation and inclusion to 
the Convention is summed up by the motto used by civil society organizations during the 
negotiations:  &#8220;nothing about us without us&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>General obligations on States parties 
</b></p>
<p>31. Article 4 of the Convention sets out the General Obligations on States parties with regard 
to the rights of persons with disabilities.  Specifically, States parties &#8220;undertake to ensure and 
promote the full realization of all rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with 
disabilities without discrimination of any kind on the basis of disability&#8221;.  In meeting this general 
obligation, the Convention sets out a series of specific actions that States parties must undertake.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Human rights obligations are sometimes categorized as obligations to respect, protect and fulfil 
human rights.<b>3</b>  The following groups the obligations identified under article 4 according to these 
three general categories: 
</p>
<p> (a) <i>The obligation to respect</i> - States parties must:  refrain from engaging in any act 
or practice that is inconsistent with the Convention; modify or abolish existing discriminatory 
laws, customs and practices; closely consult with and actively involve persons with disabilities in 
the development and implementation of legislation and policies to implement the Convention; 
</p>
<p> (b) <i>The obligation to protect</i> - States parties must take all appropriate measures to 
eliminate discrimination on the basis of disability by any person, organization or private 
enterprise; 
</p>
<p> (c) <i>The obligation to fulfil</i> - Many of the specific obligations on States fall within this 
category.  For example, States must adopt legislative, administrative, policy, programmatic and 
other measures to implement the rights of persons with disabilities; undertake or promote 
research and development into relevant goods and services, provide accessible information to 
persons with disabilities on relevant technology and other assistance, services and facilities; 
promote training of professionals and staff working with persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>32. Article 4 also makes specific reference to the obligations on States parties in relation to 
the economic, social and cultural rights of persons with disabilities.  The article acknowledges 
that some aspects of these rights are immediately realizable while other aspects are subject to 
progressive realization.<b>4</b>  In other words, while some aspects of these rights - such as the 
prohibition on discrimination, the prohibition on acts that infringe rights and so on - are subject 
to immediate implementation, other aspects of these rights require the dedication of resources 
over time.  As noted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
acknowledgement of the progressive nature of some obligations concerning economic, social and 
cultural rights reflects the realities of the real world and the difficulties of any country in 
ensuring full realization of these rights, particularly in light of resource constraints.  However, 
the Committee also notes the progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights now regularly refers to the typology 
</p>
<p>of obligations (respect, protect and fulfil) in relation to economic, social and cultural rights in its 
recent general comments.  The Human Rights Committee has also used the typology, although 
less systematically:  see e.g., Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 31 (2004) on 
&#8220;The Nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on States parties to the Covenant&#8221;. 
<b>4
</b>  Article 4 (2) states:  &#8220;With regard to economic, social and cultural rights, each State party 
</p>
<p>undertakes to take measures to the maximum of its available resources and, where needed, 
within the framework of international cooperation, with a view to achieving progressively the 
full realization of these rights, without prejudice to those obligations contained in the present 
Convention that are immediately applicable according to international law.&#8221; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>nevertheless imposes clear obligations on States parties to undertake deliberate, concrete and 
targeted steps towards achieving these rights within a reasonably short time of the treaty&#8217;s entry 
into force for the State concerned.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Rights contained in the Convention 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Convention sets out the obligations on States parties to the Convention in relation to 
civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights.  While the Convention does not recognize 
any new rights, the Convention does define with greater clarity the application of existing rights 
to the specific situation of persons with disabilities.  It is not possible to cover all of the articles 
comprehensively.  The following examples illustrate how a limited selection of the rights 
recognized in the Convention has practical application to the lives of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>34. Equal recognition before the law:  The Convention reaffirms that persons with disabilities 
have the right to recognition everywhere as persons before the law and that they enjoy legal 
capacity on an equal basis with others.  At its most basic level, the Convention ensures that the 
practice of not registering children with disabilities at birth is clearly a human rights violation.  
Further, the recognition of the legal capacity of persons with disabilities acknowledges that 
persons with disabilities can make decisions affecting their lives.  Where necessary, States 
parties have to take appropriate measures to provide access to support for persons with 
disabilities so that they are able to take decisions on their own behalf.  States must ensure that all 
measures that relate to the exercise of legal capacity provide for appropriate and effective 
safeguards to prevent abuse, in accordance with international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>35. The right to vote:  The Convention guarantees political rights of persons with disabilities 
and States parties must ensure the right and opportunity for persons with disabilities to vote and 
be elected, including by ensuring voting procedures, facilities and materials are appropriate, 
accessible and easy to understand and use.  To give an example, for a blind person to enjoy the 
right to vote on an equal basis with others, that person might require voting material in Braille 
and might require a trusted assistant in the voting booth to help fill out the voting form.  The 
Convention therefore guarantees these or similar additional accommodations so that persons with 
disabilities can enjoy the right to vote on an equal basis with others. 
</p><p>36. The right to education:  The Convention recognizes the right of persons with disabilities 
to education.  To this end, States parties must ensure an inclusive education system at all levels 
and life-long learning.  Learners with disabilities therefore have a right not to be excluded from 
the general education system on the basis of disability and to reasonable accommodation for the 
individual learner&#8217;s needs.  This not only means that learners have a right to attend mainstream 
schools and not be relegated to segregated schools, it also means that the special education needs 
of persons with disabilities must be taken into account in the general education system.  This 
goes beyond grouping all learners together in one classroom to ensuring the provision of 
effective individualized support that maximizes academic and social development.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>The Convention and social development 
</b></p>
<p>37. A distinctive aspect of the Convention is its social development dimension.  When the 
General Assembly decided to move forward on a new convention on human rights and disability, 
it decided, in its resolution 56/168 to establish an Ad Hoc Committee &#8220;to consider proposals for 
a comprehensive and integral international convention to promote and protect the rights and 
dignity of persons with disabilities, based on the holistic approach in the work done in the fields 
of social development, human rights and non-discrimination &#8230;&#8221;.  Accordingly, the Convention 
refers to social development in the context of the promotion and protection of the rights of 
persons with disabilities in the preamble and in several provisions.  For example, the preamble, 
at paragraph (t) highlights the fact that the majority of persons with disabilities live in conditions 
of poverty and recognizes the critical need to address the negative impact of poverty on persons 
with disabilities.  Many articles also refer to social development.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>38. The relationship between social development, human rights and non-discrimination is 
established in several ways throughout the Convention.  The present report shall focus on three 
of those. 
</p>
<p>39. First, as with previous human rights treaties, although in greater detail, the Convention 
provides guidance on the steps and measures that States parties have to take in order to guarantee 
the enjoyment of the rights of persons with disabilities.  In some cases, these steps and measures 
appear in dedicated articles such as:  awareness-raising (art. 7), accessibility (art. 9), access to 
justice (art. 13), personal mobility (art. 20), habilitation and rehabilitation (art. 26), statistics and 
data collection (art. 31), international cooperation (art. 32).  The enjoyment of the specific rights 
recognized in the Convention relies in large part on States parties meeting their obligations in 
relation to these developmental aspects.  Thus, for example, the right to work of persons with 
disabilities requires an accessible work place, equal protection before the law for persons with 
disabilities relies on access to justice, while the compilation and analysis of statistics and data 
will be a crucial element in effective national and international monitoring. 
</p>
<p>40. Second, the Convention seeks to change the way that development is undertaken in the 
field of disability.  Not only should States and other development actors take steps to initiate 
development programmes relevant to disability, those steps must also respect a process based on 
the human rights principles and obligations established under the Convention and human rights 
law more generally.  Consequently, in taking social development measures, the State should 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  Other articles also refer to development, for example:  States have to undertake or promote 
</p>
<p>research and development of universally designed goods and services (art. 4), ensure the full 
development, advancement and empowerment of women (art. 6), promote the development of 
accessible information and communications technologies (art. 9), ensure effective individualized 
support measures are provided in environments that maximize academic and social development 
and enable persons with disabilities to learn life and social development skills to facilitate 
participation in the community (art. 24), promote the development of initial and continuing 
training for professionals and staff working in habilitation and rehabilitation services (art. 26), 
and promote opportunities for entrepreneurship and the development of cooperatives in the 
sphere of work (art. 27). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>ensure, to the fullest extent possible, the participation of persons with disabilities and their 
representative organizations in decision-making, in particular through consultation.  Similarly, 
development programmes should be non-discriminatory and should promote equality between 
men and women.  Further, development programmes should be subject to monitoring and 
evaluation, including through the mechanisms established under the Convention, so that persons 
with disabilities have recourse to arbitration where a development programme risks breaching a 
right recognized in the Convention.  Finally, and significantly, the Convention seeks to 
mainstream human rights and disability within existing development programming.  For 
example, the preamble, in paragraph (g) recognizes the importance of mainstreaming disability 
issues as an integral part of relevant strategies of sustainable development.  Thus, while the 
introduction of specific rights-based development programming related to disability will be 
important to promote implementation of the Convention, it will also be crucial to start 
mainstreaming human rights and disability into broader development programming which has, in 
the past, sometimes tended to neglect disability. 
</p>
<p>41. Third, the Convention recognizes the importance of international cooperation and its 
promotion to support national efforts on implementation of the Convention.  The Convention 
promotes international cooperation measures such as:  the inclusion of persons with disabilities 
in international development programmes; supporting capacity-building and exchange of 
information; facilitating research and access to knowledge; and, providing technical and 
economic assistance.  The Convention establishes a Conference of States parties and the 
Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Importantly, article 32 on international 
cooperation encourages international development programmes to be &#8220;inclusive of and 
accessible to persons with disabilities&#8221;.  Thus, for example, a development programme not 
specifically related to persons with disabilities - the construction of a school, the improvement of 
public transportation, the enhancement of sanitation services - should also consider the rights of 
persons with disabilities in its design and implementation so that the results of the development 
programme are accessible to persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b>Some cross-cutting issues 
</b></p>
<p>42. It is also relevant to highlight some of the cross-cutting issues relevant to the enjoyment 
of the rights of persons with disabilities through the Convention. 
</p>
<p>43. Women with disabilities:  The Convention recognizes the fact that women with 
disabilities often face multiple forms of discrimination and a specific article is devoted to  
&#8220;Women with disabilities&#8221; (art. 6).  The article recognizes that women and girls with disabilities 
are subject to multiple forms of discrimination and requires States parties to take measures to 
ensure full development, advancement and empowerment of women for the purpose of 
guaranteeing the exercise and enjoyment of their rights.  This recognition also appears in the 
preamble, paragraph (q) which recognizes that women and girls with disabilities are often at 
greater risk, both within and outside the home, of violence, injury, or abuse, neglect or negligent 
treatment, maltreatment or exploitation.  To this end, preambular paragraph (s) emphasizes the 
need to incorporate a gender perspective in all efforts to promote the enjoyment of the rights of 
persons with disabilities. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>44. Children with disabilities:  In a similar vein, the Convention recognizes the particularly 
vulnerable position that children with disabilities often face.  The Convention therefore obliges 
States to take all necessary measures to ensure the full enjoyment by children of their rights on 
an equal basis with others.  The reference recalls the only other express reference to 
&#8220;disabilities&#8221; in any of the core human rights instruments, which appears in the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child (CRC).  The CRC recognizes &#8220;disability&#8221; as a category of discrimination 
(art. 2) and that children with disabilities should enjoy a full and decent life (art. 23).  The 
present Convention therefore builds on the CRC through the identification of comprehensive 
obligations on States to protect the rights of children with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>45. Responsibilities of the private sector:  While the obligations under the Convention rest on 
the future States parties, the private sector has an important role to play in combating 
discrimination and in providing opportunities for persons with disabilities to participate actively 
in the public sphere.  In this regard, the role of the private sector is expressly recognized in 
several instances in the Convention.  Importantly, States parties have an obligation to take all 
appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination on the basis of disability by any person, 
organization or private enterprise (art. 4).  Further, States parties will have to ensure that private 
entities that offer facilities and services open to the public take into account all aspects of 
accessibility for persons with disabilities (art. 9).  In protecting the freedom of expression of 
persons with disabilities, States parties have to urge private entities that provide services to the 
general public, including through the Internet, to provide information and services in accessible 
and usable formats (art. 21).  States must also raise awareness of the human rights of persons 
with disabilities including through the promulgation of ethical standards for public and private 
health care (art. 25).  Finally, States shall safeguard the right to work, including by promoting the 
employment of persons with disabilities in the private sector through appropriate policies and 
measures, which may include affirmative action programmes (art. 27). 
</p>
<p>46. In addition to issues explicitly addressed by its provisions, the Convention will be of 
particular relevance to a number of specific issues or groups facing particular human rights 
challenges.  For example, the Convention may be particularly relevant when addressing the 
rights of victims of landmines.  Disability can occur as a result of conflict, particularly due to 
unexploded ordnance.  The Convention requires States parties to take all necessary measures to 
ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk, including 
situations of armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies.  Moreover, a range of provisions of 
the Convention are relevant to assisting the victims of conflict who have become disabled as a 
result.  For example, while victims of landmines are not explicitly mentioned, the promotion of 
emergency and continuing health care, the provision of habilitation and rehabilitation services, 
economic reintegration through the right to work and the requirement to introduce legislative and 
policy frameworks to combat discrimination on the basis of disability are all relevant to assisting 
the victims of landmines.  In this way, the Convention can be considered to complement other 
international instruments such as the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, 
Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction; Ottawa Convention 
on Landmines which promotes victim assistance in its article 6. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Monitoring mechanisms at the national level 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Convention requires States parties to establish monitoring mechanisms at both the 
national and international levels.  In this regard, the Convention continues a recent development 
in human rights law requiring States parties to human rights instruments to establish national 
monitoring mechanisms.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>48. First, the Convention, in article 33, requires States parties to designate one or more focal 
points within government for matters relating to implementation.  Second, States parties must 
give due consideration to the establishment or designation of a coordination mechanism within 
the Government to facilitate related action in different sectors and at different levels.  Given the 
comprehensive nature of the rights and obligations established under the Convention, focal 
points and coordination mechanisms within the Government will be important in ensuring 
comprehensive and coordinated reform and cohesive strategies across different ministries and 
different levels of government - central, provincial and local. 
</p>
<p>49. The third national mechanism provided for by the Convention concerns the 
establishment, designation and/or strengthening of an independent monitoring mechanism that 
takes into account the Paris Principles.<b>8</b>  By the terms of the Convention, a State party has the 
option of assigning national monitoring to an existing human rights institution or of establishing 
a new institution.  This reflects the reality that a considerable number of States already have 
independent human rights institutions, many of which have a mandate in relation to the 
promotion and protection of the rights of persons with disabilities.  What is significant is that the 
Convention requires States parties to ensure that an independent national institution will have 
authority to monitor implementation of the Convention. 
</p>
<p><b>Monitoring mechanisms at the international level 
</b></p>
<p>50. As with other United Nations human rights instruments, the Convention establishes a 
Conference of States parties and an independent monitoring body known as the Committee on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Conference of States parties will meet regularly - at 
least biennially - to consider any matter with regard to the implementation of the Convention.  
The Committee, to be established when the Convention comes into force, will consist of 
12 independent experts, rising to 18 experts after an additional 60 ratifications or accessions to 
the Convention.  States parties will elect experts by secret ballot for a term of four years, eligible 
for re-election once.  In electing the members, States parties have to give due consideration to 
geographical distribution, representation of different forms of civilization and of the principal

</p>
<p>legal systems, balanced gender representation and participation of experts with disabilities.  
Members will serve in their personal capacity and shall be of high moral standing and have 
recognized competence and experience in the field of human rights and disability. 
</p>
<p>51. The primary function of the Committee will be to consider reports of States parties on the 
measures taken to give effect to the obligations under the Convention and on the progress made 
in that regard.  States parties must submit the first comprehensive report within two years after 
the entry into force of the Convention for the State party concerned and then the State will have 
to submit further reports every four years or whenever the Committee so requests.  Subsequent 
reports need not repeat information provided in the first report.  States are invited to consider 
preparing the reports through an open and transparent process, giving due consideration to close 
consultation with persons with disabilities and their representative organizations.  The 
Committee will consider the reports and make suggestions and general recommendations on the 
report as appropriate. 
</p>
<p>52. An optional protocol to the Convention establishes two additional procedures - an 
individual communications procedure and an inquiry procedure.  According to the individual 
communications procedure, a State party to the protocol recognizes the competence of the 
Committee to receive and consider communications from or on behalf of individuals or groups 
of individuals subject to its jurisdiction claiming a violation by that State of any of the provisions 
in the Convention.  The Committee must assess whether the communication is admissible, 
including whether the petitioner has exhausted domestic remedies prior to considering the merits 
of the communication.  The Committee, after examination of the admissibility and merits of the 
communication, may transmit its suggestions and recommendations to the State party and the 
petitioner. 
</p>
<p>53. The protocol establishes a second optional procedure whereby the Committee may, on 
the receipt of reliable information indicating grave or systematic violations by a State party of 
the rights in the Convention, invite the State party to cooperate in the examination of the 
information.  Upon the basis of this examination, the Committee may designate one or more of 
its members to undertake an inquiry and to report urgently to the Committee.  Where warranted 
and with the consent of the State, this inquiry may include a visit to the country concerned. 
</p>
<p>54. Finally, the Convention requires the Committee to report every two years to the 
General Assembly and to the Economic and Social Council on its activities.  In those reports, the 
Committee may make suggestions and general recommendations based on reports and 
information from States parties. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The present reporting year has been a landmark for human rights and disabilities 
with the adoption of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities.  The Office, together with States, United Nations partners, national human 
rights institutions and civil society organizations, has continued increasing its capacity and 
activities on human rights and disabilities, and it is intended to maintain and strengthen 
this trend over the coming years.  In this regard, the High Commissioner underscores the </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>importance of the issue of human rights and disabilities to the Human Rights Council and 
recommends that the Council devote dedicated and focused attention to the issue in its 
future programme of work.  To that end, the High Commissioner identifies the need for 
focused thematic analysis of the various issues facing the enjoyment of the rights of 
persons with disabilities and recommends that the Council consider requesting the 
High Commissioner to submit annual analytical thematic reports on human rights and 
disability.
