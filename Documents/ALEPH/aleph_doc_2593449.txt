Midstream, L.P. (&#147;Rose Rock&#148;) made during the public conference call

presentation jointly held by SemGroup and Rose Rock on August&nbsp;5, 2016 and

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman">First, we announced SemGroup&#146;s agreement to acquire the 
outstanding common units of Rose Rock Midstream. The transaction is progressing 
as planned and we
expect it to close later in the year. This merger is designed to simplify 
SemGroup&#146;s corporate capital structure and deliver several important 
benefits to shareholders including an enhanced credit profile, strong dividend 
growth and coverage
beyond 2016. We expect to realize significant benefits from the closing of the 
merger, including a reduced cost of capital and a simplified SemGroup capital 
structure. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-

margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SemGroup&#146;s 
announced second quarter dividend of $0.45 per share reflects a 7% increase over
the second
quarter of 2015. We expect to maintain our current dividend until the closing of
the Rose Rock merger transaction. Rose Rock previously announced its second 
quarter distribution of $0.66 per unit, a 1.5% increase over the same period 
last year. We
expect to maintain our current Rose Rock distribution until the closing of the 
merger. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-

hit. Just had a couple of clarifications on the balance sheet and how things 
will roll out post the
merger. So I think you clarified that there&#146;s no change in control 
triggered from the transaction. Any changes to how your revolver would work post
transaction and what will be the covenant metrics on the revolver? </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times

merger what would our balance sheet and what will our cap structure and target 
be going
forward? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt;

merger
announcement. At that time, and we&#146;re still maintaining that, we&#146;re 
looking at a leverage ratio on a combined basis post-merger targeted to be 4.5 
times or better. And we feel pretty comfortable running at those levels when we 
have all the
assets together. And we&#146;re also continuing to focus on a coverage post-
merger of 1.5 times. </P>
