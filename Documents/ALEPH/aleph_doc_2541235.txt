UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
On June 6, 2005, we signed a definitive agreement to purchase Precision Drilling Corporation’s Energy Services
Division and International Contract Drilling Division (the “Acquired Businesses”).
     The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and explanatory notes are presented
to illustrate the estimated effects the transaction would have had on our historical financial position and our results of
operations.
     The acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting as prescribed in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 141, “Business Combinations”. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
balance sheet was prepared as if the acquisition had occurred as of June 30, 2005. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statements of income were prepared as if the acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of
the period presented. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma items that are:
(1) directly attributable to the acquisition, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with respect to the statements of
operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results.
     The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are
reasonable. The unaudited pro forma adjustments to reflect the allocation of the purchase price are based upon the
preliminary information currently available, which may be revised, as additional information becomes available, such
as a finalized asset valuation from a third party consultant. The notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial statements provide a more detailed discussion of how such adjustments were derived and
presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements.
     The Company has incurred approximately $97 million in exit and restructuring costs to date. These costs consist of
the write off of purchased in-process R&D from Precision, and with respect to our operations, facility closures, asset
and inventory impairment and severance. We estimate that we will record an additional $20 — $30 million in charges
as incurred related to the restructuring, as the facility consolidations are continuing. Although we believe these costs
are directly attributable to the transaction, they have been excluded from the pro forma financial statements as they
represent material one-time charges related to historical Weatherford operations incurred after the transaction closed
that are not expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results.
     Such financial statements have been compiled from historical financial statements and other information, but do
not purport to represent what our financial position or results of operations actually would have been had the
transactions occurred on the dates indicated, or to project our financial performance for any future periods. The
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto should be read in
conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements as previously filed on our Annual Report on Form 10-
K, as amended on Form 10-K/A, for the year ended December 31, 2004, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
period ended June 30, 2005, and the historical condensed combined financial statements of the Acquired Businesses
included in this Form 8-K/A.
