<p><i>Summary 
</i>Between June 2010 and February 2011, the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights convened three regional multi-stakeholder consultations &#8211; 
in Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia and the Pacific &#8211; on the draft general 
guidelines on foreign debt and human rights (&#8220;the guidelines&#8221;) to assist the Independent 
Expert in further elaborating the guidelines.  
</p>
<p>The main goal of the consultations was to generate ideas, based on regional 
experiences and perspectives, on the form and content of the draft guidelines in order to 
improve them. The consultations addressed the following issues: (a) the key human rights 
and international legal principles that should underpin the guidelines; (b) the impact of 
economic reform policies and debt relief operations on the capacity of States to design and 
implement national development policies and programmes and to fulfil their human rights 
obligations; (c) the elements or principles that sovereign loan agreements should contain to 
ensure that these agreements do not contribute to the violation of human rights or constrain 
the fulfilment of human rights by borrower States; (d) elements of a new, enhanced debt 
sustainability framework (based on the principle of shared responsibility of creditors and 
debtors for preventing and resolving unsustainable debt situations as underscored in the 
Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development) 
which includes an assessment of the impact of debt burdens on the realization of human 
rights and the achievement of national development objectives; (e) the need for human 
rights impact assessments before and after loan contraction; (f) measures to safeguard gains 
from debt relief; (g) mechanisms for public audits of debt and lending portfolios; (h) the

<p>impact of trade liberalization on the capacity of States to fulfil their human rights 
obligations and how to ensure the coherence of national and international financial and 
trade policies; (i) how to promote transparency and accountability in loan contraction and 
use of loan funds as well as effective public debt management; and (j) the role of 
parliaments and civil society in holding Governments to account for debt and economic 
reform policies that may contribute to human rights violations.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Between June 2010 and February 2011, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) convened three regional multi-stakeholder 
consultations &#8211; in Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia and the Pacific &#8211; on 
the draft general guidelines on foreign debt and human rights (&#8220;the guidelines&#8221;)1 to assist 
the Independent Expert in refining and elaborating the guidelines. The first two regional 
consultations were co-sponsored by the respective regional economic commission. The 
third regional consultation was generously co-sponsored by the Government of Qatar.  
</p>
<p>2. The consultations brought together experts from States, United Nations entities, 
regional economic commissions, international and regional financial institutions, civil 
society and academia, largely drawn from each region.  
</p>
<p>3. The present report, which is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 
14/4 and decision 12/119, provides an update on the consultations.2 It highlights the main 
themes of the consultations. 
</p>
<p>4. The Independent Expert and his team have benefitted significantly from all these 
discussions and wish to thank the co-convenors of each consultation, as well as the 
participants, for their time and insightful contributions. The Independent Expert further 
wishes to express his special gratitude to the Government of Qatar for its generous support 
for the Asia-Pacific regional consultation. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background, purpose and format of the consultations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background  
</b></p>
<p>5. In its resolution 2004/18, the Commission on Human Rights requested the 
Independent Expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the 
full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights &#8220;to 
draft general guidelines to be followed by States and by private and public, national and 
international financial institutions in the decision-making and execution of debt repayments 
and structural reform programmes, including those arising from debt relief, to ensure that 
compliance with the commitments derived from foreign debt will not undermine the 
obligations for the realization of fundamental economic, social and cultural rights, as 
provided for in the international human rights instruments, and to present a preliminary 
draft on this matter to the Commission at its sixty-first session and a final draft at the sixty-
second session of the Commission.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>6. In its resolution 2005/19, the Commission decided to convene an expert consultation 
to contribute to the Independent Expert&#8217;s work to finalize the guidelines (para. 22). 
</p>
<p>7. In its decision 2/109, the Human Rights Council requested OHCHR to convene an 
expert consultation for the purpose of contributing to the process of drafting the general 
Guidelines. The consultation was expected to (a) provide an overall picture of the impact 
that foreign debt and debt relief programmes, as well as different kinds of economic reform 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The draft guidelines are available from 
</p>
<p>http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/development/debt/DraftGuidelines.htm. 
 2 Summaries of all regional consultations and the lists of participants will be available on the webpage 
</p>
<p>of the Independent Expert at http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/development/debt/index.htm.  </p>


<p>programmes, have on the capacity of States to comply with human rights standards, and (b) 
identify suggestions on possible recommendations to States, international organizations and 
other stakeholders regarding possible policy elements to promote and protect human rights 
in developing countries while implementing debt and economic reform programmes. 
</p>
<p>8. Following the above-mentioned expert consultation, the then Independent Expert 
(Bernards Mudho) presented a preliminary draft of the guidelines to the Human Rights 
Council at its seventh session.  
</p>
<p>9. The guidelines, which are not intended to be legally binding but are voluntary in 
character, include: 
</p>
<p>(a) Guidelines on foreign debt proposing, inter alia, a new debt sustainability 
framework which takes into account the impact of debt service on a country&#8217;s ability to 
fulfil its human rights obligations; debt relief operations guided by human rights 
considerations; and loan contraction and monitoring;  
</p>
<p>(b) Guidelines on economic reform policies calling for, inter alia, a human 
rights-based approach to poverty reduction strategies; trade negotiations and policies based 
on economic and social impact assessments (including an analysis of potential impact on 
human rights); structural reforms guided by international human rights obligations; and 
transparent, responsible, accountable and participatory government. 
</p>
<p>10. In his report to the Council (A/HRC/7/9), the former Independent Expert stated that 
the guidelines required further work and consultations. 
</p>
<p>11. In its resolution 7/4, the Council redefined the mandate of the Independent Expert 
and renamed it the Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related 
international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, 
particularly economic, social and cultural rights. The Council requested the current mandate 
holder to continue work on the development of the guidelines with a view to presenting an 
update thereon to the Council in 2010. It further called upon the Independent Expert to seek 
the views and suggestions of States, international organizations, United Nations agencies, 
funds and programmes, regional economic commissions, international and regional 
financial institutions and non-governmental organizations on the draft general guidelines. 
</p>
<p>12. In paragraph 37 of his preliminary report to the General Assembly (A/63/289), the 
Independent Expert intimated that, in order to guarantee the acceptability and effective 
implementation of the guidelines, it was necessary to ensure the fullest possible 
participation of all stakeholders (including civil society organizations and rights holders in 
the affected countries) in their finalization. 
</p>
<p>13. In its resolution 11/5, the Council requested the Independent Expert &#8220;to continue to 
seek the views and suggestions of States, international organizations, United Nations 
agencies, funds and programmes, regional economic commissions, international and 
regional financial institutions and non-governmental organizations on the draft general 
guidelines and his proposal of possible elements for consideration&#8221; (para. 25). In its 
decision 12/119, the Council requested OHCHR to assist the Independent Expert in the 
implementation of the activities envisaged in resolution 11/5, including organizing the 
consultations and providing the Independent Expert with appropriate support to  enable him 
to undertake the consultations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Purpose 
</b></p>
<p>14. The main purpose of the consultations was to generate ideas, based on regional 
experiences and perspectives, on the form and content of the draft guidelines in order to 
improve them.  </p>


<p>15. The consultations addressed the following issues: (a) the key human rights and 
international legal principles that should underpin the guidelines; (b) the impact of 
economic reform policies and debt relief operations on the capacity of States to design and 
implement national development policies and programmes and to fulfil their human rights 
obligations; (c) the elements or principles that sovereign loan agreements should contain to 
ensure that these agreements do not contribute to the violation of human rights or constrain 
the fulfilment of human rights by borrower States; (d) elements of a new, enhanced debt 
sustainability framework (based on the principle of shared responsibility of creditors and 
debtors for preventing and resolving unsustainable debt situations as underscored in the 
Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development) 
which includes an assessment of the impact of debt burdens on the realization of human 
rights and the achievement of national development objectives; (e) the need for human 
rights impact assessments before and after loan contraction; (f) measures to safeguard gains 
from debt relief; (g) mechanisms for public audits of debt and lending portfolios; (h) the 
impact of trade liberalization on the capacity of States to fulfil their human rights 
obligations and how to ensure the coherence of national and international financial and 
trade policies; (i) how to promote transparency and accountability in loan contraction and 
use of loan funds as well as effective public debt management; and (j) the role of 
parliaments and civil society in holding Governments to account for debt and economic 
reform policies that may contribute to human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Format 
</b></p>
<p>16. Each regional consultation took place over a period of two days and was divided 
into a number of thematic sessions.3 The first day set the context by focusing broadly on 
key human rights principles relating to foreign debt, policies on debt and debt relief, 
economic reforms, and the impact of these policies on the capacity of States to fulfil their 
human rights obligations, as well as the roles and responsibilities of creditors and debtors. 
Discussions during the second day focused on the form and content of the guidelines 
drawing on the discussions from the first day. 
</p>
<p>17. In order to contextualize the discussions, two to three expert panellists made brief 
presentations during each session. The presentations were followed by open discussion and 
summing up by the session chair. 
</p>
<p><b> III.  Latin America and Caribbean regional consultation  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Latin America and Caribbean regional consultation was held in Santiago on 18 
June 2010. It was organized by OHCHR and co-sponsored by the Economic Commission 
for Latin America and the Caribbean. The Independent Expert is grateful for this support 
and for the contributions made by all participants. 
</p>
<p>19. The consultation was originally scheduled to be held over two days but was held 
over one day. Although invitations had been sent by OHCHR to all States in the region 
through their permanent missions in Geneva and New York, it appeared that these may not 
have been transmitted to the respective capitals. Consequently, the first day of consultations 
</p>
<p>  
 3 The exception was the Latin America and Caribbean consultation, which took place over one day. See 
</p>
<p>section III of the present report. </p>


<p>was cancelled to enable the OHCHR regional office to follow up the invitations with States 
that had representation in Santiago.  
</p>
<p>20. Participants in the consultation included representatives from States, United Nations 
entities, civil society and the private sector.   
</p>
<p>21. The consultation was opened by the Regional Representative, OHCHR Regional 
Office for South America, who underscored the need for economic reform policies which 
are implemented specifically to guarantee the enjoyment of human rights and the need to 
discuss the causes and context under which human rights violations occur. He also recalled 
that the United Nations human rights treaty bodies have observed that high debt burdens 
and dependency on foreign aid can constitute an obstacle to State efforts to comply with 
their human rights obligations, such as access to water, food, housing, education and 
health.4  
</p>
<p><b> B. Session I: Rationale and purpose of the guidelines  
</b></p>
<p>22. This session focused on the rationale and purpose of the guidelines. It was noted that 
it was important to ensure that the guidelines adopted a framework that had clearly 
definable rights and responsibilities for debtors and creditors and that the guidelines were 
entrenched in a human rights-based framework. 
</p>
<p>23. Participants stressed that human rights should be at the centre of State public 
policies and that people should be the ultimate beneficiaries of these policies. It was further 
noted that while States had to service their foreign debt, that should not be done at the 
expense of basic social services or poverty reduction. 
</p>
<p>24. One participant proposed that the Independent Expert convene an expert working 
group to elaborate measures for a human rights-based approach to debt sustainability which 
could then be incorporated in the guidelines. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Session II: Debt, debt relief and economic reform 
</b></p>
<p>25. In this session, presentations and discussions focused on debt, debt relief and 
economic reform. Presentations outlined the status of current multilateral debt relief 
initiatives and addressed how these supported human rights and development, as well as the 
</p>
<p>

(Uganda) and 155 (Trinidad and Tobago).  </p>


<p>need for coherence between trade and debt policies. Attention was drawn to the adverse 
impact of macroeconomic conditionalities on the capacity of Governments to deliver 
essential social services and to the need for a new approach to debt sustainability, lending 
and borrowing and debt resolution that took account of resources needed by Governments 
to meet their development objectives. 
</p>
<p>26. In one presentation, some basic principles for responsible lending and borrowing 
were underlined, including the following: (a) loans must be driven by national needs and 
growth strategy; (b) fair interest rates and penalties policies must be applied; (c) 
parliamentary and citizen participation and consent are crucial; (d) full public disclosure of 
information must be ensured; (e) activities financed must not violate human rights treaties; 
(f) independent ex ante long-term integrated impact assessments of viability of project and 
details of how risk must be shared between signatories; (g) compliance with social, labour 
and environmental standards as enshrined in international agreements must be ensured; and 
(h) provision must be made for an independent and transparent arbitration procedure in the 
event of repayment difficulties or dispute.   
</p>
<p>27. Participants expressed support for the work of the Independent Expert and 
welcomed the consultation on the guidelines. Participants further highlighted the need for 
an international sovereign debt resolution or restructuring mechanism, under the aegis of 
the United Nations, to replace ad hoc mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Session III: Core human rights principles and obligations 
</b></p>
<p>28. This session explored core human rights principles and obligations relevant to 
foreign debt and economic reform. Participants underscored the importance of adopting a 
human rights-based approach5 to foreign debt and related policies. It was stated that one of 
the key contributions that the guidelines could make was the utilization of the analytical 
framework of respect, protect and fulfil &#8211; three levels of State obligations &#8211; for the 
framework of public policies concerning external debt. 
</p>
<p>29. The presentations highlighted the need for: (a) the guidelines to emphasize the 
shared responsibility of creditors and debtors for preventing and resolving situations of 
unsustainable debt; (b) public scrutiny of loan negotiations; (c) public participation through 
domestic representative bodies; (d) a gendered perspective to be central to decision-making; 
and (e) debt relief not to be considered official development assistance. It was further noted 
that international assistance was not an act of charity, but rather an obligation that States 
had assumed through the ratification of international human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>30. One participant stated that given the vulnerability to climate change of some island 
States in the region it was necessary to evaluate how that vulnerability affected gross 
domestic product and debt management processes.  
</p>
<p>  
 5 A human rights-based approach is a conceptual framework that is normatively based on international 
</p>
<p>human rights standards and operationally directed towards promoting and protecting human rights. 
See OHCHR, <i>Frequently Asked Questions on a Human Rights-based Approach to Development 
Cooperation</i> (New York and Geneva, United Nations, 2006), p. 15. See also &#8220;The human rights-based 
approach to development cooperation: towards a common understanding among United Nations 
agencies&#8221; (2003). </p>


<p><b> E. Session IV: Discussion on the way forward and next steps 
</b></p>
<p>31. Participants requested that a second consultation be held in the region to enable the 
full participation of all States and &#8220;to reinforce regional positions&#8221;. In response, the 
Independent Expert stated that budgetary constraints rendered it difficult to hold a second 
consultation in the region but that he was amenable to such a meeting if the States in the 
region were prepared to muster the necessary resources and host the consultation. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Africa regional consultation  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Africa regional consultation was held in Addis Ababa on 4 and 5 November 
</p><p>2010. It was organized by OHCHR and co-sponsored by the Economic Commission for 
Africa (ECA). The Independent Expert is grateful for this support, and for the contributions 
made by all participants. 
</p>
<p>33. In addition to the co-convenors (OHCHR and ECA), participants at the consultation 
included representatives from States in the region, parliamentarians, United Nations bodies, 
civil society organizations and academia. The African Development Bank (AfDB) was also 
represented at the consultation. 
</p>
<p>34. Opening remarks made on behalf of the Executive Secretary of ECA underlined the 
importance of analysing the impact of debt on the capacity of States to fulfil their human 
rights obligations and noted that the debt problem was not exclusively a problem of 
developing countries.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Session I: Rationale and purpose of the guidelines 
</b></p>
<p>35. This session addressed the rationale and purpose of the guidelines. The session 
began with a briefing by the Independent Expert on the connection between foreign debt 
and human rights. The Independent Expert also provided a sketch of the content of the draft 
guidelines focusing on the following elements: (a) a new debt sustainability framework 
which accounts for the impact of debt service on the debtor country&#8217;s ability to fulfil its 
human rights obligations; (b) participation of national parliaments and civil society in debt 
sustainability analyses; (c) the shared responsibility of lenders and borrowers for new loans 
and future debt burdens, which extended to the impact of debt on human rights; (d) 
transparency in the negotiation and implementation of loan agreements; (e) prudent use by 
debtor countries of the additional fiscal space provided by debt relief; (f) human rights-
based poverty reduction strategies; (g) trade negotiations and trade liberalization guided by 
human rights considerations; (h) implementation of regulatory frameworks and monitoring 
mechanisms to ensure that the actions of private actors did not undermine human rights; 
and (i) transparent, responsible, accountable and participatory governance.   
</p>
<p>36. The second presentation addressed the form and content of the guidelines. The 
speaker underlined the positive aspects of the guidelines, indicating that the proposed 
human rights-based approach to budgeting and monitoring could be a very useful tool for 
countries. The speaker further acknowledged the value of the holistic approach to debt in 
that the issue of debt was dealt with in the context of a country&#8217;s overall development 
strategy. Nevertheless, the speaker expressed some doubts concerning the enforceability of 
the guidelines and, in particular, whether all the provisions were realistic. </p>


<p>37. In the third presentation, the speaker acknowledged that the guidelines adopted a 
human rights-based approach to debt but noted that they still failed to clearly identify the 
legal rights at stake on the one hand, and the rights-holders and duty-bearers on the other. 
</p>
<p>38. Discussions reflected the need to place governance at the heart of the dialogue on 
foreign debt and human rights. Participants expressed concern regarding the voluntary 
character of the guidelines.  
</p>
<p>39. Participants also expressed concern over the lack of an independent international 
body for the resolution of debt-related disputes and assessment of the legitimacy of debt. 
</p>
<p>40. There was general agreement that the guidelines could benefit from the lessons 
drawn from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Participants further 
articulated the need to incorporate into the guidelines provisions designed to prevent the 
sale of sovereign debts to third parties (typically, commercial creditors commonly referred 
to as &#8220;vulture funds&#8221;6) and to address debt in the context of cooperation with emerging 
creditors. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Session II: Core human rights principles and obligations  
</b></p>
<p>41. This session commenced with two presentations, one on the human rights 
obligations of States, including the obligation of international assistance and cooperation, 
and the other on key human rights principles relevant to debt and related financial 
obligations of States.  
</p>
<p>42. In the first presentation it was underscored that international assistance was 
increasingly understood as a right (on the part of recipients) and an obligation (on the part 
of developed countries and donors) under the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights.7 Wealthy States had an obligation to provide economic assistance to 
help developing countries effectively implement the provisions of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>43. In his presentation, the Independent Expert emphasized the primacy of human rights 
obligations as reflected in Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations and the 
</p>
<p>  
 6 &#8220;Vulture funds&#8221; are private commercial entities that purchase the defaulted debt of poor countries on 
</p>
<p>the secondary market at significant discounts and then attempt, through litigation, seizure of assets or 
political pressure, to seek repayment of the full face value of the debt together with interest, penalties 
and legal fees. For a discussion of vulture funds and their impact on debt relief and human rights in 
poor countries, see the report of the independent expert (A/HRC/14/21). 
</p>
<p> 7 Under article 2, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
each State Party &#8220;undertakes to take steps, individually and through international assistance and 
cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources, with a 
view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present Covenant 
by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures&#8221;. According to 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the phrase &#8220;to the maximum of its available 
resources was intended by the drafters of the Covenant to refer to both the resources existing <i>within</i> a 
State and those available from the <i>international community</i> through <i>international cooperation</i> and 
<i>assistance</i>&#8221; (emphasis added). The Committee has further emphasized that &#8220;in accordance with 
Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter of the United Nations, with well-established principles of 
international law, and with the provisions of the Covenant itself, international cooperation for 
development and thus for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights is an obligation of all 
States&#8221; and that &#8220;it is particularly incumbent upon those States which are in a position to assist others 
in this regard&#8221;. General comment No. 3 (1990) on the nature of States parties obligations, paras. 13 
and 14. See also art. 4 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; art. 4, para. 2, and art. 32 of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; and art. 3, para. 3, of the Declaration on the

<p>importance of the rights to information and participation, which helped citizens hold their 
Governments accountable in relation to loan contraction, use of loan funds and debt 
management. 
</p>
<p>44. In the subsequent discussion, one participant expressed concern in relation to the 
low level of participation of the African diplomatic corps based in Addis Ababa. It was 
observed that this could possibly be attributed to the technical nature of the issues under 
consideration. In this regard, it was suggested that efforts should be made to put the issues 
under debate on the agenda of the African Union and to convene an African Union summit 
on the question of foreign debt and its impact on human rights. 
</p>
<p>45. There was broad agreement on the need for an improved legal framework to address 
the impact of external debt on the realization of human rights. Some participants expressed 
concern over the tendency of transnational corporations and international financial 
institutions to claim that they are not bound by international human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Session III: Debt, debt relief and economic reform  
</b></p>
<p>46. The session opened with three panel presentations. The first presentation, addressing 
debt relief, conditionality and accountability, highlighted the adverse impacts of 
conditionalities imposed as part of the current multilateral debt relief schemes. These 
conditionalities, it was contended, occasioned &#8220;sovereignty cost&#8221; which included a lack of 
space for policy formulation that undermined national ownership of development policies. 
The speaker also criticized the joint World Bank/International Monetary Fund debt 
sustainability framework for its failure to adopt pro-poor and human rights-based 
approaches. 
</p>
<p>47. In the second presentation, the relationship between poverty and human rights was 
explored and a human rights-based approach to poverty reduction strategies was proposed 
which: (a) takes into account both a moral value and a legal obligation; (b) seeks to 
empower people; (c) is based on the human rights obligations of States; (d) promotes 
accountability; and (e) complies with human rights principles.  
</p>
<p>48. In the third presentation, the speaker addressed the issue of coherence between debt 
and trade policies and related obligations of States. It was asserted that one of the major 
obstacles to finding an enduring solution to the debt problems of developing countries had 
been the approach of bilateral and multilateral lenders that viewed the debt crisis as a mere 
financial problem. For this reason, the measures aimed at addressing the debt crisis were 
confined to fiscal and monetary restraints, structural reforms involving the reduction of 
public sector spending (including on basic social services), and trade and financial 
liberalization. The view was expressed that the debt problem of developing countries was 
rooted in the unequal economic relationships between those countries and developed 
countries and that most debts were illegitimate or odious. The current approach to debt had 
resulted in massive poverty in many debtor countries. It was proposed that a human rights-
based approach to debt management and trade policies be adopted as a lasting solution to 
the debt crisis and related socio-economic problems. 
</p>
<p>49. In the discussions that followed, participants opined that the guidelines needed to 
address more clearly the issue of illegitimacy or odiousness of debt. In this regard, it was 
proposed that a set of criteria for the identification of illegitimate and odious debt should be 
established. 
</p>
<p>50. In regard to the question of policy coherence, participants underlined the need, both 
at the international and national levels, for better coherence between debt and trade policies. 
To illustrate, one participant referred to the huge subsidies that creditor countries provided </p>


<p>to their farmers while debtor countries were prevented, by the same creditors, from doing 
the same, to the detriment of their farmers. 
</p>
<p>51. Finally, concern was expressed that the lack of legal personality of key actors such 
as the London and Paris Clubs rendered it difficult to hold them accountable for their 
decisions which might have negative impacts on human rights in debtor countries.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Session IV: Loan negotiation, contraction, management and use &#8211; the 
relevance of human rights principles  
</b></p>
<p>52. This session featured several presentations focusing on various issues relating to 
loan negotiation, contraction, management and use. The first presentation outlined the role 
of the African Legal Support Facility of AfDB. It was noted that the Facility is an 
independent entity which provided assistance to States confronted with lawsuits by vulture 
funds, as well as technical assistance on loan negotiations and agreements. 
</p>
<p>53. This was followed by presentations on the role of parliament and civil society in 
ensuring transparency and accountability in loan contraction, use of loan funds and debt 
management. The speakers identified the secrecy around loan negotiations and difficulty in 
accessing information on public financial management and loans as key obstacles to 
accountability and highlighted the need for parliament and civil society to be involved at 
various stages of the loan processes. Several proposals to enhance the capacity of 
parliaments to play an effective oversight role were put forward, including (a) strengthening 
the research, planning, monitoring and evaluation capacity of parliament, and (b) 
strengthening relationships between parliaments and other oversight bodies.  
</p>
<p>54. Participants observed that the issue of accountability was not comprehensively dealt 
with in the guidelines and underscored the need to ensure participation and oversight by 
parliaments and civil society organizations in loan contraction, use and management. Some 
participants requested the Independent Expert to facilitate capacity-building sessions for 
African parliamentarians on the issue of foreign debt and human rights. 
</p>
<p>55. The oversight role of parliament in relation to public debt was acknowledged and the 
need for reinforcement of constitutional and legislative frameworks concerning this role 
emphasized. In addition, participants underscored the importance of public debt audits as an 
accountability mechanism and acknowledged the value of external debt management 
initiatives such as those managed by the World Bank and the Commonwealth Secretariat.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Other sessions  
</b></p>
<p>56. The remainder of the sessions focused on the form and content of the draft 
guidelines. The sessions were preceded by a sketch of the guidelines by the Independent 
Expert. 
</p>
<p>57. The discussions highlighted the need for the guidelines to: (a) incorporate references 
to international human rights standards (including the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights); (b) stress the obligation of international assistance and cooperation in the 
realization of human rights; (c) link the guidelines to the Paris Declaration on Aid 
Effectiveness: Ownership, Harmonisation, Alignment, Results and Mutual Accountability; 
(d) emphasize that privatization should be nationally driven; (e) be less technical in order to 
make them accessible to all; (f) include provisions on an international debt resolution 
mechanism; (g) underscore the right of citizens to participate in the formulation of 
economic policies; (h) address cases of countries experiencing conflict, post-conflict </p>


<p>countries and countries faced with natural and other disasters; and (i) clearly define the role 
of parliaments and civil society. 
</p>
<p>58. Some participants felt that the scope of the guidelines was too narrow and that there 
was a need to broaden it to address issues such the relevance of financed projects and 
successful or failed projects. 
</p>
<p>59. One participant cautioned against the use of fluid terms such as macroeconomic 
stability. It was noted that it was possible to have good macroeconomic indicators while at 
the same time the poor and marginalized were unable to access basic services. 
</p>
<p>60. Another participant suggested that the term &#8220;principles&#8221; should be used in place of 
&#8220;guidelines&#8221; in order to bolster the influence of the guidelines. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Asia-Pacific regional consultation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Asia-Pacific regional consultation was held in Doha on 31 January and 1 
February 2011. It was organized by OHCHR and generously co-sponsored by the 
Government of Qatar. The Independent Expert is grateful for this support, and for the 
contributions of all participants. He reiterates his special gratitude to the Government of 
Qatar for its generosity and continuing support for his mandate. 
</p>
<p>62. Participants in the consultation included representatives of States, parliamentarians, 
civil society organizations and academics. The World Bank was also represented at the 
consultation.  
</p>
<p>63. Sheikh Khalid bin Jassim Al-Thani, Director of the Bureau of Human Rights, 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, delivered an opening statement on behalf of the 
Government of Qatar in which he noted that the hosting of the meeting was part of his 
Government&#8217;s efforts to consolidate international standards aimed at protecting human 
rights. He further stated that the regional consultation underscored the importance of 
improving the guidelines. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Session I: Rationale and purpose of the guidelines 
</b></p>
<p>64. This session began with the Independent Expert briefing the participants on the 
background and rationale of the guidelines and explaining the relationship between foreign 
debt and human rights, including the right to development.   
</p>
<p>65. The Independent Expert&#8217;s briefing was followed by a presentation on the form and 
content of the guidelines. It was observed that the guidelines failed to clearly identify the 
legal rights at stake on the one hand, and the rights holders and duty bearers on the other. 
The presenter pointed to the need for a human rights-based approach which, it was 
contended, would offer an explicit normative framework underpinned by universally 
recognized moral values reinforced by legal obligations. It was noted that the voluntary 
character of the guidelines was a major weakness.  
</p>
<p>66. Participants stated that the guidelines should inform the economic policies of States 
and serve as a reminder that the realization of human rights was the primary obligation of 
all States. There was general consensus that the guidelines should be anchored to the 
existing legally binding human rights instruments as this would enhance their legitimacy. 
Some participants stated that the guidelines should not go below minimum international 
human rights standards.  </p>


<p>67. There was broad agreement on the need for more coherence between debt and trade 
policies at both the national and international level. In addition, participants underlined the 
need to link international human rights obligations with international financial obligations. 
Foreign debt, it was emphasized, should be viewed not as an exclusively economic issue 
but as a human rights issue as well. 
</p>
<p>68. A number of participants articulated the view that the obligation of international 
assistance and cooperation as enshrined in the core international human rights treaties and 
the principle of shared responsibility should be underscored in the guidelines.  
</p>
<p>69. Participants acknowledged that debt is an important part of the development process. 
However, they noted that excessive debt undermines the capacity of States to fulfil their 
human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>70. Some participants felt that the guidelines could be enriched by lessons drawn from 
the multilateral debt relief initiatives, in particular, the HIPC initiative.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Session II: Core human rights principles and obligations 
</b></p>
<p>71. This session highlighted a number of key human rights principles, such as the 
primacy of human rights and the principle of non-retrogression, according to which 
Governments must not take measures or adopt policies that had the effect of jeopardizing 
the enjoyment of human rights. Other important principles considered were the principles 
of non-discrimination, participation, transparency, accountability and the right to an 
effective remedy for those whose rights had been violated.  
</p>
<p>72. In a presentation on human rights and development, participants&#8217; attention was 
drawn to recent initiatives concerning the World Bank&#8217;s cooperation on human rights, such 
as the October 2006 issue of <i>Development Outreach</i> on human rights and development, the 
study <i>Human Rights Indicators in Development: An Introduction</i>, and its cooperation with 
the Human Rights Council, United Nations treaty bodies, the special procedures and the 
High-Level Task Force on the Right to Development. The presentation also outlined the 
activities of the World Bank&#8217;s Nordic Trust Fund that were relevant to human rights. 
</p>
<p>73. In his presentation on core human rights principles relevant to debt and economic 
reform, the Independent Expert focused on the principles of the primacy of human rights, 
international assistance and cooperation, equality and non-discrimination, participation and 
inclusion, accountability, and non-retrogression. He also highlighted the shared 
responsibility of creditors and debtors with regard to preventing and resolving 
unsustainable debt situations. 
</p>
<p>74. In the discussions that ensued, participants noted the role of the World Bank in 
providing guidance to national, bilateral and multilateral institutions on debt relief and 
project appraisal. In this regard, they suggested that the World Bank should promote the 
incorporation of human rights in project appraisals with a view to mainstreaming the 
practice in the future. However, one participant stated that the World Bank did not have a 
normative role in human rights and it was yet to be convinced that adopting a human rights-
based approach could yield added value in its development assistance. 
</p>
<p>75. According to one participant, more work was required to establish data-based 
evidence, indicators and methodology to support the case for a human rights-based 
approach to foreign debt. 
</p>
<p>76. Some participants offered the view that the guidelines would be useful if they 
provided some practical guidance as to how States and other actors could conduct 
negotiations on issues related to human rights. </p>


<p><b> D. Session III: Debt, debt relief and economic reform 
</b></p>
<p>77. This session began with three panel presentations, addressing: the issues of debt 
relief, conditionality and debt sustainability; the integration of human rights into poverty 
reduction strategies; and coherence between debt and trade policies and related obligations 
of States. In the first presentation, the speaker highlighted the fact that heavy debt burdens 
undermined the rights of States to self determination as elaborated in the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as these entailed a ceding of 
sovereignty to international financial institutions. 
</p>
<p>78. In the second presentation, the speaker lamented the absence of a key human rights 
element &#8211; empowerment of the poor &#8211; in poverty reduction strategies. Empowerment in 
relation to poverty required that steps be taken both immediately and over the long term 
towards changing systems and structures so that the poor were assured of access to and 
control over resources, which included economic assets as well as opportunities for 
education, health and other requisites for human development and well-being. The speaker 
stressed that from a human rights perspective, the principles of accountability, transparency 
and participation should be key pillars of poverty reduction strategies.  
</p>
<p>79. The third presentation reflected the concern that human rights continued to play a 
secondary role in matters related to trade and economic policy, and the speaker raised the 
question of how possible it was to achieve coherence, given the normative and institutional 
fragmentation in international law. The speaker mentioned three potential points of 
convergence between human rights and economic policy: revisiting trade-offs in economic 
policy to ensure that they respected human rights; regulating markets to protect human 
rights; and addressing redistribution to ensure equity and prevent impoverishment. 
</p>
<p>80. In the discussions that followed, participants stated that the guidelines should 
address more clearly the issue of illegitimacy or odiousness of debt, provide concrete 
indicators for evaluating economic policies and debt management against human rights 
criteria, and ensure that debt arrangements do not have negative effects on the 
implementation of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Session IV: Loan negotiation, contraction, management and use &#8211; the 
relevance of human rights principles  
</b></p>
<p>81. In this session the focus was on the role of human rights impact assessments and the 
role of parliaments and civil society in ensuring transparency and accountability in loan 
contraction, use of loan funds and debt management. 
</p>
<p>82. A panellist described a human rights impact assessment as &#8220;a systematic process that 
aims to measure the impact of an activity or project on human rights&#8221;. Recalling resolution 
11/5 of the Human Rights Council which called upon debtors and creditors, particularly 
international financial institutions, to consider preparing human rights impact assessments 
for development projects, Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and loan agreements, the 
speaker noted that the value of a human rights impact assessment lay in the fact that it was 
based on international standards that were legally binding either as treaty commitments or 
as customary international law. 
</p>
<p>83. Concerning the role of parliaments, it was observed that parliaments often did not 
provide checks and balances or effective oversight of loan negotiations and debt 
management. It was noted that while in most countries there were usually parliamentary 
committees with responsibility to scrutinize government expenditure, such committees 
often had limited or no role in ensuring transparency and accountability in loan agreements, </p>


<p>loan use and debt management. Some suggestions on strengthening parliamentary oversight 
of debt management were put forward. 
</p>
<p>84. A presentation on the role of civil society highlighted its role in the formulation, 
adoption and advocacy of principles, standards and rules on lending and borrowing; public 
revenue generation, public spending and debt management; establishment and 
implementation of monitoring mechanisms; and the ensuring of transparency and 
accountability in both borrowing and lending countries. The speaker emphasized the issues 
of lender responsibility for the impact of their lending on the one hand and borrowers&#8217; dual 
obligations to the lender and to their citizens, on the other. 
</p>
<p>85. Participants noted that a human rights impact assessment was not a one-size-fits-all 
measure for loan agreements and that it depended on the project or activity in question. In 
this regard, they underscored the need for development of a detailed human rights impact 
assessment tool. It was further observed that impact assessments were the responsibility of 
both lenders and borrowers. 
</p>
<p>86. Participants underlined the need for the adoption of new, or the reinforcement of 
existing, constitutional and legislative provisions concerning the role of parliament in loan 
negotiation, contraction and debt management. Some participants expressed support for the 
creation of specialized parliamentary committees due to the technical nature of the subject. 
There was general agreement on the importance of debt audits &#8211; objective assessments of 
debt from an ethical, financial, social and legal perspective &#8211; in ascertaining the debt 
portfolio of countries. 
</p>
<p>87. Concern was expressed over the increase in borrowing from private financial 
markets due to the fact such loans were not subject to public auditing and impact 
assessments. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Other sessions 
</b></p>
<p>88. The rest of the sessions were devoted to commenting on the scope and application of 
the guidelines, overarching principles, guidelines on foreign debt, and guidelines on 
economic reform policies, and to identifying missing elements in the draft guidelines. 
</p>
<p>89. Discussions reflected the need: (a) to include a broad range of international 
instruments in the general context section of the guidelines; (b) to include definitions of key 
terms used in the guidelines; (c) to identify key overriding norms and principles, such as the 
principle of non-retrogression and the do-no-harm principle; (d) to underscore the 
obligations of international assistance and cooperation as enshrined in legally binding 
human rights instruments; (e) to clarify the link between foreign debt and economic reform 
policies; (f) to explain the role of different domestic institutions such as national human 
rights institutions; (g) to refer to the impact of foreign debt on specific groups, as well as to 
measures to address the needs of specific groups; (h) to consider whether a system of 
remedies should be included in the guidelines; (i) to include the issue of bonds, secondary 
debt markets and &#8220;vulture funds&#8221;; and (j) to include debt audits. 
</p>
<p>90. Participants also stressed the importance of drawing lessons from other principles 
and guidelines, such as those on development-based evictions and displacement developed 
by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context. </p>


<p><b> VI. Recurring themes  
</b></p>
<p>91. There were a number of recurring themes in the consultations. First, there was 
general support for the work of the mandate and consensus on the need for the guidelines. 
</p>
<p>92. Second, participants agreed on the need for the guidelines to be anchored in a rights-
based framework and, in particular, to enshrine key human rights principles such as the 
primacy of human rights, equality and non-discrimination, accountability, participation and 
non-retrogression, as well as the principle of the shared responsibility of creditors and 
debtors as underscored in the Monterrey Consensus. Additionally, the guidelines should 
foster effective implementation and compliance with binding international human rights 
standards. 
</p>
<p>93. Third, participants noted that human rights impact assessments are a critical part of 
due diligence to ensure respect for human rights and should be included in the guidelines.  
</p>
<p>94. Fourth, participants expressed concern regarding the voluntary character of the 
guidelines and noted the challenges of enforcing voluntary standards. Nevertheless, most 
participants felt that anchoring the guidelines in existing human rights obligations would 
enhance their influence. 
</p>
<p>95. Fifth, participants underscored the oversight role of parliament and civil society in 
relation to loan contraction and debt management and articulated the need for robust legal 
national frameworks to ensure, in particular, an effective role for parliament. 
</p>
<p>96. Sixth, participants called for measures preventing the sale of sovereign debts to third 
parties to be included in the guidelines. 
</p>
<p>97. Seventh, there was agreement that incoherence in debt and trade policies, both at the 
national and international levels, undermined efforts to find a durable solution to the debt 
crisis as well as debt relief efforts. 
</p>
<p>98. Eighth, the guidelines should provide guidance to all actors involved in the 
formulation, implementation and monitoring of national and international policies on debt 
and related financial obligations. 
</p>
<p>99. Ninth, there was broad consensus on the need for an independent and transparent 
international sovereign debt resolution or restructuring mechanism and for the guidelines to 
contain provisions in this regard.  
</p>
<p>100. Finally, the value of public debt audits as an accountability mechanism was 
acknowledged and it was proposed that the guidelines should include provisions for audits.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Next steps 
</b></p>
<p>101. The last regional consultation is scheduled to be held in Geneva on 20 and 21 June 
</p><p>2011.  
</p>
<p>102. A final seminar of a core group of expert stakeholders will be held in September 
2011 in Geneva to discuss a revised version of the guidelines and the operationalization of 
the guidelines. 
</p>
<p>103. In view of the proposals from two of the regional consultations for expert workshops 
to elucidate certain elements of the guidelines, particularly those relating to a new debt 
sustainability framework and human rights impact assessments, the Independent Expert 
also hopes, resources permitting, to convene at least two expert consultations on these 
issues. The Independent Expert calls upon States, international and regional organizations, </p>


<p>international financial institutions, regional economic commissions and non-governmental 
organizations to consider sponsoring these workshops. 
</p>
<p>104. The Independent Expert will present a progress report and a revised draft of the 
guidelines to the Human Rights Council in 2012.   
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusion  
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> In the present report, the Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and 
other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all 
human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, has highlighted the 
main themes of the three regional multi-stakeholder consultations on the draft 
guidelines on foreign debt and human rights that were convened by OHCHR to assist 
the Independent Expert in his ongoing work on developing and elaborating the 
guidelines. The consultations have been immensely helpful in clarifying aspects of the 
guidelines, identifying some missing elements and generating ideas on possible 
elements for inclusion in the guidelines. 
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> The Independent Expert is encouraged by the broad acceptance by all 
participants of the need to ensure that commitments derived from foreign debt and 
related obligations do not undermine the capacity of States to fulfil their human rights 
obligations. Nevertheless, some challenges remain. These include ensuring the full 
participation of all stakeholders, particularly States and international financial 
institutions. In addition, further discussion and elaboration is needed concerning some 
of the more complex conceptual and operational issues addressed during the 
consultations. 
</b></p>
<p>107.<b> The Independent Expert looks forward to continuing the consultations and his 
dialogue with all stakeholders in order to elaborate the draft guidelines. He urges all 
States and other stakeholders to continue supporting the process of refining and 
developing the guidelines.
