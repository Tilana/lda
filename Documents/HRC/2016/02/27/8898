<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51/77 and other 
subsequent resolutions of the Assembly on the rights of the child, including its most recent, 
resolution 63/241, in which the Assembly requested the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict to continue to submit a report to the 
Human Rights Council on the activities undertaken in discharging her mandate, including 
information on her field visits, and on the progress achieved and the challenges remaining on the 
children and armed conflict agenda. This report should be read in the context of the report of the 
Special Representative to the General Assembly (A/63/227), in which she provided a 
comprehensive account of activities undertaken by the Office of the Special Representative in 
2007/2008; as well as the eighth report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict 
(A/63/785-S/2009/158). These reports, and the series of recommendations provided therein, 
should form the primary basis for discussion by the Human Rights Council of the work of the 
Special Representative in the period under review. 
</p>
<p>2. Grave child rights violations in situations of armed conflict represent a profound challenge 
to the international legal order. The normative infrastructure for the protection of children is both 
robust and comprehensive and enjoys an unprecedented consensus among Member States. Since 
the entry into force in 2002 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
on the involvement of children in armed conflict, it has been ratified by 128 Member States and 
ratifications continue. However, running counter to this is the shocking reality that in far too 
many situations of armed conflict children are routinely brutalized and their most fundamental 
rights contravened. It is critical, therefore, for the international community to remain steadfast, 
resolute and focused on ensuring accountability and fighting impunity for grave violations. 
</p>
<p>3. Even as accountability and fighting against impunity must remain a centrepiece of the 
collective action of the international community, there are some emerging challenges for the 
protection of children that must be understood in the context of changing characteristics of 
armed conflict and their consequences for children. It is a context in which the most vulnerable 
segments of the population - women, children and the elderly - have become the primary targets 
of armed actors and where children have sometimes also been turned into weapons of war. Some 
of these keystone priorities for the Office of the Special Representative are outlined in section IV 
of this report. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  WORKING WITH THE UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEM 
</b></p>
<p>4. Over the last year, the Office of the Special Representative has strengthened its strategic 
partnership with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR). A focal point for children and armed conflict within the Human Rights Council and 
Treaties Division in Geneva was identified in November 2008 to facilitate interaction and act as 
a coordinator between the Office of the Special Representative and the different sections of 
OHCHR, including its Inter-Branch Task Force on child rights issues. 
</p>
<p>5. The Office of the Special Representative also appreciates the continued efforts by OHCHR 
to encourage the mainstreaming of child rights issues related to armed conflict into its field </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>presences, as well as into the work of human rights mechanisms, including the universal periodic 
review (UPR) of the Human Rights Council, and treaty bodies such as the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, as well as special procedures. 
</p>
<p>6. The Office of the Special Representative is further encouraged by the practice of a number 
of special rapporteurs of including a section on children and armed conflict in their reports, and 
by their proactive advocacy for the protection of children&#8217;s rights in situations of conflict. 
</p>
<p>7. In 2008/2009, the Office of the Special Representative provided contributions for 
consideration by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in reviewing State party reports on 
the implementation of the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict in 
Chad, the Philippines and Uganda. The Office has submitted inputs for the UPR reports on 
Afghanistan, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo; and has also collaborated with other special procedures mandate holders to prepare joint 
submissions on the human rights situation in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 7/20 and S-8/1 and in the occupied Palestinian 
territory in accordance with Council resolution S-9/1 on grave violations of human rights in the 
occupied Palestinian territory particularly due to the recent Israeli military attacks against the 
occupied Gaza Strip. 
</p>
<p>8. The Office will continue to share information on the status of the protection of children 
affected by armed conflict in specific country situations of common concern ahead of country 
reviews by the human rights mechanisms, including key recommendations by the 
Secretary-General and the Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict in 
the context of Security Council resolution 1612 (2005). In the same vein, the concluding 
observations and recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review respectively, as they pertain to the issue of 
children and armed conflict, will constitute a basis for continued advocacy by the Office. 
</p>
<p><b>III. ENDING IMPUNITY FOR GRAVE VIOLATIONS 
AGAINST CHILDREN IN ARMED CONFLICT 
</b></p>
<p>9. The need to address impunity and bring to justice those responsible for violations of the 
rights of children in situations of armed conflict, in contravention of applicable international law, 
continues to be a focus of priority attention and action by the Office of the Special 
Representative. Towards this end, the Office of the Special Representative regards the Human 
Rights Council as an important component of, and a critical partner in, efforts to ensure the 
application, enforcement and compliance of parties to conflict with international norms and 
standards to protect children&#8217;s rights, as well as to ensure full accountability for commissions of 
grave violations against children. 
</p>
<p>10. In recent years, there have been several unprecedented initiatives to address impunity for 
crimes against children by international justice mechanisms, mixed criminal courts and tribunals 
and, increasingly, through national justice systems. The trial of former militia leader 
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo in the Ituri region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, before the 
International Criminal Court, solely for the recruitment and use of children, continues. The 
Office of the Special Representative submitted an amicus curiae brief during the course of the 
proceedings, in which the Special Representative urged the Court to adopt a case-by-case </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>method in interpreting the provisions of the Court that define enlistment, conscription, 
participation and use of children, so as to protect all children associated with armed groups in 
line with the Principles and Guidelines on Children Associated with Armed Forces or Armed 
Groups (the Paris Principles) and the Paris Commitments to protect children from unlawful 
recruitment or use by armed forces or armed groups (the Paris Commitments). The Special 
Representative will appear before the Court later this year as an expert witness to provide 
testimony on the issues in her amicus brief. 
</p>
<p>11. Action at the international level must, however, be underpinned by a commitment to 
address impunity at the national level, including undertaking appropriate reforms of national 
legislation for the protection of children in order to bring laws into line with international 
obligations; addressing prevailing cultures of impunity for grave violations against children 
through rigorous investigation and prosecution of those responsible; addressing juvenile justice 
issues that guarantee adequate legal, social and psychological protection for children; as well as 
strengthening child protection capacity and training for military, police, law enforcement and 
judiciary officials within national security sector reform efforts. 
</p><p>12. Further, ensuring that national implementation of relevant international laws applicable to 
child rights is consistent with international standards, such as the Rome Statute, is important in 
enabling national authorities to cooperate with the International Criminal Court, where 
appropriate. For example, collaboration between the Government of the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo and the International Criminal Court has resulted in the arrest and transfer to the 
Court of Germain Katanga, a commander of the Forces de r&#233;sistance patriotique d&#8217;Ituri and 
Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, the former head of the Front des nationalistes et integrationnistes and 
colonel in the Forces arm&#233;es de la R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo (FARDC). Both 
individuals are charged with the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity, 
including the use of children in hostilities. Their trials will begin in September 2009. 
</p>
<p>13. National legislation relating to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes should 
also ensure that these crimes are punishable under national law and have the same scope as the 
definition contained in the Rome Statute. Again, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Congolese judges applied the definition of crimes against humanity as defined in the Rome 
Statute in the trial of Mai-Mai warlord G&#233;d&#233;on Kyungu Mutanga. This was the largest trial 
involving crimes against humanity in the country, and his conviction by the military justice 
system on March 2009 set an important precedent for those who suffered human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>14. Several important legislative reforms undertaken recently at national level to address 
impunity for grave violations against children include: (a) the Sudan Armed Forces Act adopted 
by the National Assembly in December 2007, which establishes 18 years as the minimum age for 
recruitment and lays down criminal penalties for individuals who recruit children below 18 years 
old. The Act also outlines penalties for a range of violations of international law, including 
killing, sexual slavery, abduction and enslavement, rape, torture and attacks on schools and 
hospitals; (b) a revised Penal Code adopted by the National Assembly in Burundi which, 
inter alia, prohibits the enlistment of children in the armed forces, stipulates 18 years as the 
minimum age for conscription, raises the age of criminal responsibility to 15 years, provides 
alternatives to imprisonment and strengthens sentences against perpetrators of violations against 
children, particularly sexual violence; and (c) a law on child protection promulgated on 
10 January 2009 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which prohibits the recruitment and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>use of children by armed forces, armed groups and the police, sets the legal majority age 
at 18 years, and calls for the creation of special tribunals and police special units for the 
protection of children. 
</p>
<p>15. Another significant development in the fight against impunity for the recruitment and use 
of child soldiers is the adoption of the Child Soldiers Accountability Act of 2008 in the 
United States of America. This law makes it a federal crime to knowingly recruit or use those 
under the age of 15 as soldiers, and permits the United States to bring charges under the law 
against both United States citizens and non-citizens who are in the United States. It also allows 
the United States to deport or deny entry to individuals who have knowingly recruited children 
as soldiers. In addition, the coming into force of the Child Soldier Prevention Act on 
23 June 2009 restricts the provision of United States military training, financing and other 
defence-related assistance to countries identified as recruiting or using child soldiers in 
government armed forces or government-supported paramilitaries or militias, in violation of 
international law. 
</p>
<p>16. Despite these positive steps to investigate and prosecute violators, some former 
commanders of armed groups who were well known for their recruitment and use of child 
soldiers are now in Government or senior military positions. In the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, Jean-Pierre Biyoyo was recently promoted to the rank of major in FARDC despite being 
convicted by a military court in March 2006 for the recruitment and use of children while a 
leader of the Mudundu 40 militia, and Bosco Ntaganda was made a general in FARDC in 
January 2009 despite being the subject of an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal 
Court for the war crime of enlisting child soldiers and using them in hostilities. In Sri Lanka, 
Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan (also known as Colonel Karuna) became Minister of National 
Integration and Reconciliation. Prior to April 2004, he was the commander of the eastern 
division of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and was responsible for recruiting 
children into LTTE ranks. After breaking away from LTTE, he formed the Tamil Makkal 
Viduthalai Pulighal (TMVP), which continued to recruit children. Recently, TMVP entered into 
an action plan with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) to release children in their 
ranks. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Action plans to halt the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>17. The application of international norms, combined with the political process in the context 
of Security Council resolutions on children and armed conflict, has yielded several concrete 
actions and commitments by parties to conflict. In particular, in accordance with 
resolutions 1539 (2004) and 1612 (2005), parties to conflict, in collaboration with the 
United Nations, have developed and implemented time-bound action plans which, among other 
commitments, oblige parties to immediately release all children within their ranks; put in place 
measures to prevent further recruitment such as training for military personnel and strengthening 
of birth registration systems; discipline those responsible for recruiting children; and provide 
access to recruitment and training centres for independent monitoring by the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>18. Since her previous report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/9/3), formal action plans 
to halt the recruitment and use of children were signed with TMVP on 1 December 2008, and the 
Government of Uganda on 16 January 2009. Important commitments to begin negotiations on an 
action plan were received from the Justice and Equality Movement in the Sudan and the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Moro Islamic Liberation Front in the Philippines. In addition, commitments by the Government 
of Nepal to release children from Maoist cantonments as a matter of priority, as well as 
commitments by the Forces nationales de lib&#233;ration (FNL) in Burundi to immediately and 
unconditionally separate and release all children were also received. In fact, between April and 
May 2009, a total of 340 children were separated from FNL and have been reunited with their 
families and communities, marking the end of the demobilization phase of all children formerly 
associated with FNL. And in July 2009, the Government and the Unified Party of Nepal-Maoist 
declared that they will discharge the 2,973 children remaining in the cantonments to the 
United Nations for rehabilitation and reintegration. 
</p>
<p>19. Also in 2009, the Uganda People&#8217;s Defence Forces and local defence units were removed 
from the annexes of the Secretary-General&#8217;s report (A/63/785-S/2009/158) as a result of the full 
commitment by the Government of Uganda and concerted efforts toward implementing the 
provisions of its action plan.  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Representative, however, remains very concerned that grave violations 
continue to be committed against children by parties to conflict, in blatant violation of 
international law, and would like to bring to the attention of the Human Rights Council parties 
who were included in the annexes to the latest report of the Secretary-General on children and 
armed conflict (ibid., annexes I and II) for the recruitment and use of children and the 
commission of other grave violations against children. More must be done to systematize and 
activate the full range of options available to the international community to ensure more robust 
action against recalcitrant violators. There are, for example, 18 such persistent violators<b>1</b> who 
have been explicitly named and listed by the Secretary-General for four years or more, and the 
lack of action against them undermines accountability initiatives. A successful deterrent to the 
recruitment and use of child soldiers and other grave violations against children will only be 
established when individuals are held accountable through the rule of law. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Field visits by the Special Representative 
</b></p>
<p>21. Apart from the sustained engagement and pressure placed on parties to conflict by the 
Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, United Nations human rights 
mechanisms and other relevant bodies of the United Nations and its partners, field visits by the 
Special Representative have brought high-level visibility to the situation and rights of children

 <p> 
</p>
<p>affected by armed conflict, as well as garnered several key commitments by relevant 
stakeholders, including the Government, non-State actors and the United Nations and partners, 
for the protection of children as reflected in international humanitarian and human rights 
instruments. These visits also serve to highlight national efforts to advance child rights concerns 
in armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>22. As an independent moral voice and high-level advocate, the Special Representative has 
engaged in child protection dialogue with all parties to conflict, including non-State actors, 
without prejudice to their political or legal status and with the consent of the Member States 
concerned. For example, during her mission to the Central African Republic in May 2008, the 
Special Representative engaged in discussions with the Arm&#233;e populaire pour la restauration de 
la R&#233;publique et de la d&#233;mocratie (APRD), securing their commitment to release all children 
associated with their forces. On 7 July 2009, APRD followed through and released all 
182 children, who were between the ages of 10 and 17, to UNICEF. Almost all these children 
have been reunited with their families. The dialogue with such actors, with the approval of and 
facilitation by the Governments concerned, is essential if not critical on humanitarian grounds, to 
ensuring the release of children. 
</p>
<p>23. In 2008 and the first half of 2009, the Special Representative carried out nine field 
missions, including to Iraq (April 2008), Chad and the Central African Republic (May 2008), 
Afghanistan (June 2008), Nepal and the Philippines (December 2008), the occupied Palestinian 
territory and Israel (February 2009) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (April 2009). 
Some of the more important commitments received from Governments and other parties to 
conflict during these missions are included below. The critical challenge is to ensure timely 
follow-up and adherence to commitments made and their practical implementation, in order to 
bring about concrete results for the protection of children on the ground. It is therefore important 
for the Human Rights Council and the broader international and human rights community to join 
in monitoring these undertakings to ensure that parties to conflict honour their commitments.  
</p>
<p><b>Iraq 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Government of Iraq and the multinational forces in Iraq committed to abide by 
international humanitarian law and international juvenile justice standards with regard to 
children in detention. 
</p>
<p><b>Chad and the Central African Republic 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Government of Chad committed to allow verification by United Nations teams of 
detention centres, training camps and military facilities; release as a matter of priority children 
associated with armed groups held in detention; and establish an inter-ministerial task force to 
coordinate and ensure effective reintegration of children. 
</p>
<p>26. The leader of APRD, Laurent Djim Wei, committed to prepare a list and release all 
children in his armed group as soon as proper arrangements are made for their protection and 
reintegration into communities. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Government of Afghanistan and the international military forces agreed to abide by 
standards of international humanitarian law and juvenile justice standards with regard to children 
in detention. 
</p>
<p>28. The Government of Afghanistan also committed to take appropriate measures to put an end 
to and prevent the perpetration of sexual violence against children, in particular the practice of 
<i>bacha baazi</i> (&#8220;boy play&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>29. The International Security Assistance Forces reaffirmed their commitment to abide by 
international humanitarian law during their operations and take all necessary measures to limit 
civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p><b>Nepal 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Prime Minister of Nepal committed to the release of 2,973 children from the Maoist 
army cantonments by the end of February 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>Philippines 
</b></p>
<p>31. The leadership of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front committed to enter into an action plan 
with the United Nations to halt the recruitment and use of children and to ensure their separation 
and return into civilian life. 
</p>
<p><b>Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Government and the FARDC Military Command committed to entering into dialogue 
with the United Nations for the preparation of a time-bound action plan to prevent child 
recruitment and to identify and release children already present in integrated FARDC brigades, 
as well as to issuing a directive to all FARDC commanders to respect international humanitarian 
law and reaffirming that they would be held accountable for grave violations committed against 
children and other civilians. 
</p>
<p>33. The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo also committed to setting up 
specialized units of the National Police to deal with crimes of sexual violence against women 
and children. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  EMERGING CONCERNS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rape and other grave sexual violence against children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>34. Widespread and systematic rape and sexual violence against children, both girls and boys, 
is increasingly a characteristic of conflict, often perpetrated in a rule of law vacuum that is a 
consequence of conflict, and exacerbated by an ensuing culture of impunity. In some instances, 
sexual violence has been used as a premeditated tactic of war designed to humiliate or 
exterminate a population or to force displacement. For children, the physical and mental 
consequences are devastating, with far-reaching negative effects on sustainable peace and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>security. The high incidence of rape and sexual violence against children in Burundi, Chad, the 
Central African Republic, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Somalia 
and the Sudan are of particular concern. 
</p>
<p>35. There is universal consensus that rape and sexual violence against children in armed 
conflict is a grave breach of international humanitarian law and a most serious human rights 
violation. Furthermore, international criminal law explicitly outlaws rape and sexual abuse 
during wartime, and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court states that rape, sexual 
slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization or &#8220;other forms of sexual 
violence of comparable gravity&#8221; may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
Jean Pierre Bemba Gombo, a former commander-in-chief of the Mouvement de lib&#233;ration du 
Congo, is currently standing trial at the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes 
against humanity charges resulting from alleged instances of rape and other abuses by troops 
under his command. 
</p>
<p>36. International law also provides that children affected by armed conflict are entitled to 
special respect, protection and care, including against all forms of sexual violence and 
exploitation. It is therefore critical that efforts be strengthened towards ending impunity and 
ensuring access to justice, accountability and remedies for cases of such crimes against children. 
Towards that end, in his report on children and armed conflict, the Secretary-General 
recommended that the Security Council include rape and other grave sexual violence against 
children as additional criteria for inclusion of parties to conflict who perpetrate this crime onto 
the annexes of his report (ibid., para. 158). This is a positive step towards expanding the 
protection framework for children and driving United Nations and international efforts to seal 
commitments to put an end to sexual violence against children. 
</p>
<p><b>Children internally displaced as a result of armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>37. Children who are internally displaced count among the most vulnerable categories of 
children affected by armed conflict. In addition to the dangers to their physical safety and 
security during flight, these children are vulnerable to a host of other threats, including 
separation from family, trafficking, abduction by armed groups, lack of food and basic services, 
detention against their will and exploitation and abuse. Reports of some of these incidents have 
been received from Afghanistan, Chad, the Central African Republic, Colombia, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Myanmar, Pakistan, the Philippines, Somalia, Sri Lanka and the 
Sudan. 
</p>
<p>38. In some situations, the recruitment of children by armed groups also continues to be a 
pressing issue for internally displaced families and communities perpetually at risk of being 
further displaced. A protracted displacement situation, extended stay in camps, proximity of 
camps from national borders, and in some cases the infiltration and presence of armed elements 
in internally displaced persons&#8217; settlements also places children at a heightened risk of 
recruitment. 
</p>
<p>39. The Office of the Special Representative, in collaboration with the efforts undertaken by 
the Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons, 
stresses the need to address some of the key protection concerns for children displaced as a result 
of conflict, including the need for a proper registration system for separated and unaccompanied </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>children that promotes early family tracing and reunification; the care and protection of children 
with disabilities and with critical medical conditions; and, where appropriate, the need to ensure 
that children identified as being formerly associated with armed groups are separated from 
adults, granted legal protection and linked to services for swift rehabilitation and reintegration. 
</p>
<p>40. In addition, in line with the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the Special 
Representative will continue to advocate for the &#8220;rights and guarantees&#8221; which should be 
accorded to every internally displaced child affected by armed conflict. These include: 
</p>
<p> (a) The enjoyment of the same rights and freedoms as those not displaced in their 
country. They shall not be subject to discrimination as a result of their displacement whether or 
not they are living in camps; 
</p>
<p> (b) The right to relevant documentation. Competent authorities shall issue internally 
displaced children with all documents necessary for the full enjoyment and exercise of their legal 
rights; 
</p>
<p> (c) The right of every child to be reunited with his or her family. Every effort must be 
made to reunify separated children with their immediate family or relatives, failing which they 
may be placed with foster families. Siblings are to be kept together and institutional care is to be 
avoided; 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>Terrorism and counter-terrorism and its impact on children 
</b></p>
<p>41. Terrorism, more than any other concept, has come to dominate the security discourse in 
many places around the globe. Both terrorist actions and counter-terrorism measures can have 
multiple consequences for children and in recent years have created particular challenges for the 
protection of children, particularly in regard to the violation of human rights and the rule of law. 
The conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and the occupied Palestinian territory pose many of these 
problems. 
</p>
<p>42. Terrorist attacks disproportionately target civilians in hitherto sacrosanct locations, such as 
places of worship, schools and hospitals, markets and other public spaces. Such indiscriminate 
attacks, when deliberately targeting civilians, are grave abuses of human rights. And when such 
attacks take place in the context of an armed conflict, they constitute war crimes. Children are 
also increasingly being used to perpetrate these attacks, because they can be more easily 
compelled to act and they are less conspicuous. In some situations, children are being recruited 
and trained as suicide bombers, in blatant violation of international law, and used as human 
shields, decoys in suicide car bombings, or to transport improvised explosive devices. 
</p>
<p>43. Anti-terrorism measures often also target children, including through arrest and detention 
of children for reasons such as alleged participation in terrorist activities or other forms of 
association with terrorist groups. Legal and practical safeguards such as regular and independent 
monitoring of detention centres have often been disregarded. Many of these children are detained 
for extended periods of time and without due process provisions, in violation of international 
standards of juvenile justice. In detention they sometimes suffer beatings, and physical and 
psychological torture.  
</p>
<p>44. Precision aerial bombardment and other types of military operation also result in what is 
termed &#8220;collateral damage&#8221;, and children are often the victims. Recent statements in Afghanistan 
suggesting that the protection of civilians will be the primary goal of military operations in these 
areas are therefore welcomed. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>45. Two bedrock standards of international humanitarian law are the principles of &#8220;distinction&#8221; 
and &#8220;proportionality&#8221;. They are universally accepted, enshrined in international law, and apply to 
State and non-State actors in all armed conflicts. These principles aim to protect civilians against 
the effect of hostilities and prevent unnecessary &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; resulting from military 
action. However, both these cornerstone elements of international law are being challenged by 
new types of military action, with major consequences for children. It is crucial that the 
international community reaffirm the principles of international humanitarian law and that 
military forces around the world, along with armed groups, adhere to those principles which 
have been developed over the centuries for the protection of women and children. 
</p>
<p><b>Attacks on schools 
</b></p>
<p>46. The deliberate targeting of schools is prohibited under international law, and can amount to 
a war crime. Schools are civilian institutions that often provide shelter and tend to the needs of 
children during conflict. The core humanitarian legal principle of &#8220;distinction&#8221; demands that 
civilian objects, including schools, must be protected against the consequences of military 
operations. Furthermore, humanitarian law makes clear that if in the &#8220;fog of war&#8221; there is a doubt 
whether a school or hospital is a military or civilian object, the presumption that must be made is 
that a building normally dedicated to civilian purposes remains a civilian object. 
</p><p>47. The escalation in the number of systematic and deliberate attacks on schoolchildren, 
teachers and school buildings is alarming, as these attacks not only damage property and cause 
harm to students and teachers, but they also incite fear and limit access to education services by 
children. Particularly disturbing is the targeting of girl students and girls&#8217; schools, such as in 
Afghanistan, warranting the increased attention of, and action by the international community. 
</p>
<p>48. In the recent conflict in Gaza and southern Israel, many schools were damaged or 
destroyed by aerial bombardment, rocket fire and long-distance artillery. Some of these schools 
were schools administered by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine 
Refugees in the Near East. 
</p>
<p><b>Accountability for acts committed by children during armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>49. The accountability for acts committed by children during armed conflict has recently been 
brought to light through the case of Omar Kadr, who faces charges of war crimes before the 
United States military commission for alleged offences committed at age 15 in Afghanistan, 
purportedly as a child soldier. In the Sudan, following its armed attack on Khartoum, a 
17-year-old child associated with the Justice and Equality Movement was tried and sentenced to 
death by special counter-terrorism courts created after the event. Based on the current practice of 
ad hoc tribunals, the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the International Criminal Court, there is 
an emerging consensus that children below the age of 18 should not be prosecuted for war 
crimes and crimes against humanity by international courts.  
</p>
<p>50. International law recognizes the need to provide children with special protection because 
of their particular vulnerability, and considers children&#8217;s immaturity if they commit offences 
during armed conflict. In addition, international law prohibits the imposition of the death penalty 
for any offences committed by children under the age of 18 years. Children should be considered 
primarily as victims, and decisions whether to prosecute a child must be guided by the principle </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of their best interests, bearing in mind the child&#8217;s emotional, mental and intellectual maturity, the 
extent of the child&#8217;s moral culpability, the possibility of alternative accountability and 
reconciliation mechanisms that focus on the child&#8217;s rehabilitation. If a child is to be tried in any 
jurisdiction for crimes, his/her treatment should be in accordance with international human rights 
standards specific to the rights of the child, in particular with regard to the age of criminal 
responsibility, fair trials, sentencing and detention.  
</p>
<p>51. Similarly, national courts trying children for international crimes must also uphold their 
rights in accordance with international standards for juvenile justice. For example, in 
Afghanistan, child protection actors have welcomed juvenile-specific provisions, including on 
offences relating to children associated with armed groups, in the law on combating terrorist 
offences adopted in 2008. The law states that when an offence has been committed by 
individuals below the age of 18, the 2005 juvenile code will apply. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>52.<b> The Special Representative welcomes and appreciates the strengthened collaboration 
between her Office and the United Nation human rights system, and reiterates her 
continued support including to share regular information and to advocate for the 
protection of children affected by armed conflict. The Special Representative is also 
encouraged that information from the monitoring and reporting mechanism on grave 
violations against children in armed conflict established in accordance with 
Security Council resolution 1612 (2005), as well as conclusions adopted by the 
Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict have been 
mainstreamed by the Human Rights Council and the wider human rights system, 
particularly through reports submitted for the universal periodic reviews and by the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child. 
</b></p>
<p>53.<b> The Special Representative encourages the Committee on the Rights of the Child and 
special procedures mandate holders, as appropriate, to continue to take account of 
recommendations by the Secretary-General and conclusions of the Security Council 
Working Group insofar as they are relevant to reporting on a particular country situation. 
</b></p>
<p>54.<b> The Special Representative reiterates the recommendation made in her last report 
that concluding observations made by the Committee on the Rights of the Child on reports 
submitted by States parties under article 8 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict should also be 
taken into consideration by the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review when 
reviewing a State submission under the UPR process. More importantly, the Special 
Representative encourages States parties to integrate the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and its Optional Protocols in their reports submitted for the universal periodic 
review process. 
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> Further, in the light of the information provided in sections III and IV above, the 
Special Representative offers the following recommendations. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Ending impunity for grave violations against children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> Member States who bear a central and immediate political, legal and moral 
responsibility should comply with international norms and standards for the protection of 
children within their territories, and take strong and urgent action to bring to justice 
individuals responsible for the recruitment and use of children in the armed forces or 
armed groups and their use in hostilities in violation of applicable international law and 
other grave violation against children through national justice systems, including 
undertaking appropriate reforms of national legislation for the protection of children in 
order to bring laws into line with international obligations, as well as strengthening 
child-protection capacity and training for military, police, law enforcement and judiciary 
officials within national security sector reform efforts. 
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child are encouraged to 
strengthen national and international measures for the prevention of recruitment of 
children into armed forces or armed groups and their use in hostilities. In particular, these 
include signing and ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict; enacting legislation that explicitly 
prohibits the recruitment of children into armed forces/groups and their use in hostilities; 
and exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction in order to strengthen the international 
protection of children against recruitment. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rape and other grave sexual violence against children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> Recognizing that rape and other grave sexual violence against children is prevalent in 
some situations of armed conflict, concerned Member States are urged, as a matter of 
priority, to adopt and implement national strategies to prevent, respond to and combat 
sexual violence. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Children internally displaced as a result of armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> Member States should respect the &#8220;rights and guarantees&#8221; accorded to children 
internally displaced by armed conflict, as spelled out in paragraph 40 of this report. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Terrorism and counter-terrorism and its impact on children 
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> Parties to situations of armed conflict are urged to immediately halt the recruitment 
and use of children, a violation of international law, in particular using them to commit 
terrorist acts. 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> Member States are also urged to ensure that counter-terrorism measures are in line 
with their obligations under international humanitarian law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Attacks on schools 
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> Parties in situations of armed conflict are urged to adhere to international law 
protecting the right to education in situations of concern. This includes protecting both </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>educational institutions and the process of education, including students, teachers, 
academics and other education personnel. Special attention should be paid to the 
protection of girls, given the increased targeting of girls&#8217; education in some countries. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Accountability for acts committed by children during armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> Member States should ensure that children who are accused of crimes under 
international law allegedly committed while they were associated with armed forces or 
groups are considered primarily as victims, and that they are treated in accordance with 
international law and other relevant standards on juvenile justice, and within a framework 
of restorative justice and social rehabilitation. Neither capital punishment nor life 
imprisonment without the possibility of release should be imposed for offences committed 
by persons below 18 years of age. Detention of children should be used as a last resort and 
for the shortest period of time. </b></p>
