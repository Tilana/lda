undertake.</P>
<P align=justify>Subsequent to our Board of Directors' approval of the
Amendment, the holder of the majority of the outstanding shares of our

shares, thereby potentially increasing the per share market value of our common
stock, which would make us more attractive as a business combination target.
However, in many cases, the market price of a corporation&#146;s shares declines
after a reverse stock split.</P>
<P align=justify>On July 13, 2015, subsequent to the approval by Board of
Directors of the Reverse Stock Split, the holders of the majority of the
outstanding shares of our corporation entitled to vote gave us their written
consent to implement the Reverse Stock Split at the option of the Board of
Directors by July 13, 2016.</P>
