<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The document describes the main developments in Colombia during 2007 regarding the 
situation of human rights and international humanitarian law, covered by the agreement between 
the Government of Colombia and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR), which was renewed in 2007 and remains in force until October 2010. 
The report highlights the fact that the intertwined dynamics of the internal armed conflict, 
drug-trafficking and organized crime continue to weigh heavily on the human rights situation. At 
the same time, the report notes the persistence of structural problems in certain State institutions. 
Throughout the year, the need to guarantee the rights of all victims of violations of human rights 
and breaches of humanitarian law was placed at the centre of public debate. The document 
stresses that it is urgent and imperative to make a proper and timely response to their claims.

English and Spanish only. 
** The present document is submitted late in order to reflect the most recent information </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> Some of the challenges to be faced relate to the consolidation of the demobilization of the 
paramilitaries, and the emergence of new illegal armed groups; both of them directly affect 
human rights. The magnitude of the tasks pending in the judicial proceedings under Law 
975/2005 of 2005 (the &#8220;Justice and Peace Law&#8221;), and the persistence of obstacles to its full 
application, are causes of uncertainty and concern. There are important challenges in relation to 
the need to guarantee the participation of the victims in these processes. At the same time, the 
Supreme Court&#8217;s investigations, despite many obstacles and even threats, have made good 
progress in showing how seriously public institutions and society at large have been infiltrated 
by the paramilitaries and their organizations. 
</p>
<p> During 2007, political decisions and measures were taken by the highest civilian and 
military authorities to counter the persistent extrajudicial executions attributed to the State 
security forces. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People&#8217;s Army (FARC-EP) 
guerrillas and, to a lesser degree, the National Liberation Army (ELN), have not stopped 
committing serious breaches of international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p> Approximately 45 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line, including the 
majority of displaced persons; this situation hinders the full enjoyment of their rights. This report 
also includes information and analysis on disturbing human rights situations in groups that are 
especially vulnerable, including the victims of the internal armed conflict, displaced persons, 
indigenous groups, Afro-Colombians, women, trade unionists, human rights defenders, 
journalists and children. The report also summarizes the activities of the office in Colombia of 
OHCHR (the Office of the United High Commissioner for Human Rights) during 2007 and 
presents eight recommendations which, if carried out, would help to bring about a notable 
improvement in the situation of human rights and humanitarian law. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 26 November 1996, the Government of Colombia and the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) agreed on the establishment of an office in 
Colombia of OHCHR, which opened in April 1997. Its mandate is to assist the Colombian 
authorities in developing policies and programmes to promote and protect human rights, to 
advise civil society on matters of human rights, to observe the situation of human rights and 
international humanitarian law in the context of the violence and the internal armed conflict, and 
to submit its reports and analyses to the High Commissioner. 
</p>
<p>2. The High Commissioner visited Colombia from 7 to 9 September 2007 to sign an 
agreement with the Government of Colombia to extend the office in Colombia&#8217;s mandate<b>1</b> in its 
entirety up to 30 October 2010. After 10 years of activities, the High Commissioner wishes to 
express her acknowledgement to the Colombian people and to the authorities for having 
welcomed and cooperated with the Office. The High Commissioner also extends her gratitude to 
those countries and organizations which have given support to the office in Colombia, and 
contributed to the promotion and protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>3. This report covers the period from January to December 2007, focusing on the most 
significant aspects of the office in Colombia&#8217;s mandate. It is based on the following activities: 
systematic and analytical observations of the human rights situation, including field visits, the 
processing of complaints, the analysis of reports and statistics, interviews with State authorities, 
victims, other representatives of civil society, United Nations agencies in Colombia, bodies from 
the international community and NGOs. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  THE POLITICAL CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p>4. Colombia has been seriously affected by an internal armed conflict for more than 40 years. 
It has also become increasingly evident that the illegal armed groups are directly or indirectly 
involved in drug-trafficking,<b>2</b> and are associated with local and international networks of 
organized crime and corruption. The complex relationships between all these factors, added to 
persistent structural problems such as impunity and limitations of access to justice, inequality 
and discrimination, continue to affect the human rights situation negatively. That said, it must be  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  See chapter III, &#8220;Activities of the Office in Colombia&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  These activities include charges to growers, storage and trafficking in their respective zones of 
</p>
<p>influence or control, the direct administration of supplying the precursors required to process 
illegal drugs, the recruitment and payment of growers and harvesters, protection and 
maintenance of clandestine landing strips and, in some cases, the direct exportation of drugs and 
related money-laundering. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>recognized that Colombia has made progress in restoring security throughout the country in 
recent years,<b>3</b> and the visibility given to human rights in the public agenda is a solid 
achievement. 
</p>
<p>5. During 2007, the most relevant political and security-related events with an impact on the 
human rights situation were: (a) the judicial proceedings against demobilized paramilitary 
leaders under Law 975/2005, known as the &#8220;Justice and Peace Law&#8221;;<b>4</b> (b) judicial investigations 
into the activities of a number of high-level public servants for their alleged links with 
paramilitary groups;<b>5</b> (c) the emergence or consolidation of a range of new illegal armed groups 
following the paramilitary demobilization process, some of them having strong links with 
organized crime and drug-trafficking; and (d) the holding of regional and local elections. 
</p>
<p>6. The security forces continued to implement &#8220;el plan de guerra&#8221; (war plan) against illegal 
armed groups, in particular against the guerrillas, through the &#8220;Plan Consolidaci&#243;n&#8221;, which 
replaced the former &#8220;Plan Patriota&#8221;. The intensity of hostilities frequently had a negative impact 
on the civilian population, and breaches of international humanitarian law were attributed to all 
armed actors. Several new illegal armed groups<b>6</b>  emerged, building up strength and engaging 
in violent acts in certain regions. FARC-EP and ELN persisted in their violent disruptions of 
public order and continued to infringe international humanitarian law. A number of 
organizations - including the Organization of American States&#8217; Mission to Support the Peace 
Process in Colombia (MAPP/OEA) - raised the alert on guerrilla activities in specific areas, 
formerly under demobilized paramilitary groups&#8217; control.<b>7</b> According to the security forces, there 
was an increase in militia-type activities by the guerrillas as they retreated from the regular  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  Relevant official violence-related indicators showed a decrease in the number of massacres 
</p>
<p>and homicides, kidnappings, guerrilla attacks against small villages and military bases, illegal 
checkpoints and destruction of transmission towers and oil pipelines, among others. As a result, 
foreign direct investment and tourism also rose during the year. 
 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  Law 975/2005 of 2005 (&#8220;Justice and Peace Law&#8221;) regulates the procedures to be followed with 
</p>
<p>demobilized members of illegal armed groups and establishes judicial benefits based on their 
contribution to justice and reparation. See &#8220;Report on the Implementation of the Justice and 
Peace Law: Initial Stages in the Demobilization of the AUC and First Judicial Proceedings&#8221;,

<p>forces&#8217; offensives. These dynamics are more directly observed in the south of the Department of 
C&#243;rdoba, in the Urab&#225;-Choc&#243; area, eastern Antioquia, the north of Santander, the north of 
Tolima, Nari&#241;o, Putumayo, Guaviare, Vichada and Arauca. 
</p>
<p>7. The Government authorized and sponsored a number of initiatives of its own<b>8</b> and of third 
parties, to make contact with FARC-EP, with varying degrees of support. Its intention was to 
find agreements which would lead to the release of hostages in exchange for imprisoned 
guerrillas and, perhaps, eventually lead to peace talks. There was enormous consternation when 
the 11 deputies from the Departmental Assembly of Valle del Cauca had been murdered,<b>9</b> after 
being held by FARC-EP since 2002. Their death was met with a unanimous outcry by 
Colombians, leading to massive protests, and a widespread movement of public opinion urging 
the release of all the kidnap victims. A mixture of shock and grief also shook the nation with the 
publication of pictures of the hostages and letters written by them to their families, seized by the 
authorities from FARC-EP agents in late November, which showed their deplorable situation. 
All of this reminded people at home and abroad that those who fall into the hands of illegal 
armed groups remain permanently defenceless and vulnerable. Some of them have already been 
held for as long as 10 years.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>8. On 28 October 2007 elections were held nationwide for regional and local authorities. 
Governors and members of local assemblies were elected in the 32 departments, mayors and 
councillors in 1,094 municipalities, four metropolitan districts, and for local wards. Candidates 
were nominated from a broad range of political groups.<b>11</b> The voter turnout was high and the 
results confirmed the country&#8217;s political plurality. The mobilization of the forces of law and 
order contributed to security at the polls. During the polling day, a climate of normality 
prevailed. However, before and after that day, there were isolated acts of violence.<b>12</b> There were 
death threats and even murders in some places, mainly by guerrilla groups (especially 
FARC-EP), although some were attributed to members of the new illegal armed groups, 
drug-traffickers and criminal gangs who threatened the lives of numerous candidates and

</b>  For example, they identified over 180 imprisoned members of FARC-EP, including one of its 
</p>
<p>leaders, for unilateral release.

</b></p>
<p>  See section on &#8220;Guerrilla groups&#8221; (paras. 45-49). 
<b>11
</b></p>
<p>  The National Registry Office reported that 61,949 candidates were registered. 
<b>12
</b></p>
<p>  Results in 18 municipalities in the departments of Atl&#225;ntico, Bol&#237;var, Boyac&#225;, Caquet&#225;, Cesar, 
Huila, Magdalena, Nari&#241;o and Santander were challenged for supposed irregularities, such as 
vote-buying or obstacles to voters and threats to officials in charge. Disturbances in a few places 
caused damage to the Registrar&#8217;s Office, local government offices and private homes. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>restricted their political activities.<b>13</b> A total of 8 aspiring candidates and 23 registered candidates 
were murdered; 4 aspiring candidates and 5 registered candidates were kidnapped.<b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>9. Another important aspect of the political context was the continuation of the dialogue 
among the Government, civil society and the international community, which led to the III 
International Congress on Colombia, held in Bogot&#225; in November 2007. The final declaration 
reaffirmed the need to continue with efforts to achieve results [in applying the recommendations 
of the High Commissioner] as quickly as possible.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  II. THE HUMAN RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL  
  HUMANITARIAN LAW SITUATION 
</b></p>
<p>10. Although there are some encouraging signs of improvement, the situation of human rights 
and international humanitarian law remains a matter of concern, particularly in regions in which 
the dynamics of internal armed conflict have become more intense. 
</p>
<p>11. The authorities, especially the Government, welcomed the High Commissioner&#8217;s 
recommendations and cooperation in general, renewing their commitment to full 
implementation, while acknowledging that there are still challenges to be faced and 
shortcomings to be remedied. However, major efforts and additional measures must be sustained 
and reinforced over a long period of time if they are to be really effective. This should include 
coordinated and convergent actions by all sectors and institutions of the State and civil society. 
Specific efforts must be made to prevent victims&#8217; demands from becoming invisible and thus 
irrelevant. The fulfilment of the rights of victims of the armed conflict to truth, justice, and 
reparation, and the guarantee of non-repetition, are essential conditions for a transition towards 
lasting peace and national reconciliation. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  State authorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  The fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p>12. Structural problems persist in the administration of justice. These include the 
underreporting of crimes to the authorities, the difficulties of access to the judicial system, the 
insufficiency of funds and technological resources (despite increased budgets), the lack of 
uniform criteria in the application of the law, the high workload of judges and prosecutors, 
the slow pace of proceedings, and cases of corruption. During 2007 some progress was made 
in opening up channels to combat impunity, particularly in judicial proceedings under 
Law 975/2005 against demobilized paramilitary leaders whose depositions represent a first step 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  Threats were reported in Antioquia, Arauca, Bol&#237;var, Cauca, Putumayo, Santander, Tolima 
</p>
<p>and Valle, and voters were intimidated in C&#243;rdoba and Nari&#241;o. 
<b>14
</b></p>
<p>  Antioquia, Valle del Cauca and Tolima were the departments worst affected.

<p>  &#8220;Declaration of Bogot&#225;&#8221;, III International Conference on Colombia, Bogot&#225;, 
30 November 2007, see Point 7. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>in clarifying past events.<b>16</b> Investigations have also been undertaken by the Supreme Court and 
the Attorney General&#8217;s Office against high-level civilian and military officials for alleged links 
with paramilitary groups and corruption.  
</p>
<p>13. Investigations into the storming of the Palace of Justice by the M-19 guerrilla group and its 
recovery by the army in 1986, and others related to the murders of members of the Uni&#243;n 
Patriotica were reopened.<b>17</b>  The courts also handed down decisions against members of the 
security forces who perpetrated extrajudicial executions, as in the cases of the three trade 
unionists murdered in August 2004 at Ca&#241;o Seco in Saravena, Arauca, and the farmer murdered 
in April 2004 in the village of La Hondita in El Pe&#241;ol, Antioquia. In both cases the military 
patrols reported that the victims had been &#8220;shot in combat&#8221;, and the courts found that they were 
not. The Attorney General&#8217;s Office also ordered the detention of an army captain for the 
massacre of five adults and three children in San Jos&#233; de Apartad&#243;, Antioquia, in February 2005. 
</p>
<p>14. At the international level, the Inter-American Court on Human Rights has ruled against the 
Colombian State, which accepted responsibility for the extrajudicial execution of an indigenous 
leader in the Nasa community, Cauca, by members of the armed forces in February 1988. In 
another case in which the State has also accepted responsibility, the same Court found that 
paramilitaries, with the collaboration of State agents, were guilty of the massacre of 12 officers 
of the judiciary<b>18</b> in January 1989 in La Rochela, Santander. 
<b>(a) Investigations into links between public officials and private enterprise with  
 paramilitary groups 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Supreme Court of Justice opened investigations into the activities of 45 members of 
Congress for their alleged links with paramilitary groups. The accused are from 16 different 
departments; 18 of them have been imprisoned. Others under investigation include four former 
departmental governors and 18 former mayors. In November, the Procurator General dismissed 
the Director of the Administrative Department of Security (DAS) and barred him from holding 
public office for 18 years, for having collaborated with paramilitary groups and taken part in acts 
of corruption. All of these investigations have revealed the extent of paramilitary infiltration 
within the State through alliances with politicians and the support of certain private companies.<b>19</b>  
The Supreme Court has given clear evidence of its strength and independence, which reinforces 
the possibility to further expose other paramilitary connections with members of public and 
private institutions. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>16
</b>  See note 4 above. 
</p>
<p><b>17
</b>  This left-wing political party was created within the context of peace talks with FARC-EP in 
</p>
<p>the late 1980s. Many of Uni&#243;n Patriotica&#8217;s members and supporters have been murdered. 
<b>18
</b></p>
<p>  Several of the paramilitaries involved in this massacre are currently applying for legal benefits 
under Law 975/2005. 
<b>19
</b></p>
<p>  In that same line, a United States court convicted and fined Chiquita Brands International for 
having financed Colombian paramilitary groups between 1997 and 2004. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>16. Despite these very important cases, there remain serious structural problems for the 
efficacy of the justice system, as mentioned before. The full introduction of the accusatory 
system in the criminal courts, due to be completed by early 2008, is intended to help combat 
impunity at all levels. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Judicial proceedings under Law 975/2005, the &#8220;Justice and Peace Law&#8221; 
</b>17. Law 975/2005 regulates the procedures to be followed with demobilized members of 
illegal armed groups and establishes judicial benefits based on their contribution to justice and 
reparation. In 2007, 3,127 of the 31,671 demobilized paramilitaries<b>20</b> were candidates for 
benefits under Law 975/2005. As at 19 December 2007, the Attorney General&#8217;s Office had 
begun the process of receiving 1,057 voluntary depositions; of these, 941 depositions were 
closed because the deponents did not ratify their willingness to be processed according to Law 
975/2005. A total of 542 candidates for benefits are in prison. The Attorney General&#8217;s Office has 
also registered 121,547 victims. There is a marked contrast between the large number of cases 
and the limited progress made - during 2007 not a single indictment was issued. This shows the 
size of the Attorney General&#8217;s challenges, and supports many of the concerns and doubts about 
the process. 
</p>
<p>18. Some of the victims and some human rights defenders have pointed out that the 
information revealed by the demobilized paramilitaries is often neither complete nor truthful. It 
is evident, too, that the statements made by the majority of these paramilitaries often attempt to 
justify - and even openly claim credit for - the acts committed by their organizations. This leads 
to real risks to the lives and safety of those victims who participate in proceedings.<b>21</b> At the same 
time, the flow of information that has come to light as a result of these depositions has exposed 
the enormous dimensions of paramilitary criminal activity,<b>22</b> and the unspeakable details of 
events hitherto unknown to the authorities - let alone the public.<b>23</b> These new disclosures 
generate legitimate concern about the group of approximately 19,000 demobilized paramilitaries 
who have not submitted to Law 975/2005 and have no formal investigation open against them.<b>24</b>  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>20
</b>  There are still 439 of these candidates that have not yet been conclusively identified. 
</p>
<p><b>21
</b>  See section on &#8220;Victims of the armed conflict&#8221; (paras. 50-52). 
</p>
<p><b>22
</b>  For example, a former leader of the group called &#8220;Bloque Bananero&#8221; of the paramilitary AUC 
</p>
<p>declared that he ordered the murder of approximately 1,500 people in the Urab&#225; area (in the 
Department of Antioquia) alone. 
<b>23
</b></p>
<p>  The Attorney General reported that there was no record of prior investigations in the case 
of 2,193 of the 3,127 people who claim the status of demobilized paramilitaries. 
<b>24
</b></p>
<p>  See especially Decree 128 of 22 January 2003 &#8220;which regulates Act 418 of 1997, 
supplemented and amended by Act 548 of 1999 and Act 782 of 2002 in the matter of 
reincorporation into civil society&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>19. There is a growing consensus regarding the need for new professional and technical 
resources for the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, the Procurator General and the judicial system. 
There must also be renewed national and international political support in order to reinforce the 
judicial and political processes of the Justice and Peace Law. 
20. Another challenge lies in the implementation of mechanisms to guarantee security for the 
victims to participate and to receive reparations. This will have to be a central issue in 2008 if the 
Attorney General&#8217;s Office takes the steps that should follow the depositions of the paramilitary 
leaders.<b>25</b>  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Extrajudicial executions 
</b>21. The persistence of extrajudicial executions attributed to members of the security forces, 
especially members of the Army, has prompted the Government to strengthen the control 
mechanisms. The political will of senior civilian and military personnel to adopt measures which 
will prevent, investigate, punish and expose situations in which this type of action has occurred 
has been most evident in their discussions with the Office during 2007; and they acknowledge 
that serious crimes, such as extrajudicial executions, do not even achieve any kind of military 
advantage. 
</p>
<p>22. New directives produced this year by senior Ministry of Defence officials and military 
authorities<b>26</b> have emphasized technical and regulatory matters. These directives could serve as 
the practical basis for a comprehensive attempt to deal with allegations of extrajudicial 
executions attributed to the security forces. The office in Colombia will closely and regularly 
monitor implementation and results in 2008. All these measures follow the orientation of several 
recommendations made by this office, and it is expected that they will be fully developed in the 
document on integral policies of human rights and international humanitarian law to be 
published by the Ministry of Defence in early 2008. The Government has also asserted that the 
Military Criminal Justice has a restrictive area of action and should be limited to exceptional

</p>
<p><b>25
</b>  For example, there is an unresolved procedural debate about the correct moment to issue 
</p>
<p>individual indictments - whether to use information already in hand for immediate prosecution, 
or to wait until all the evidence is in for all possible cases (including those yet unopened, based 
on hitherto unknown facts now coming to light).  
<b>26
</b></p>
<p>  For example, resolution 12 of 5 March 2007, &#8220;Rules for Engagement for the Military Forces&#8221;; 
Permanent Directive 10 of 6 June 2007 &#8220;Reiteration of the obligations on the part of the 
authorities to enforce the law and prevent the murder of protected persons&#8221;; Permanent  
Directive 19 of 2 November 2007, &#8220;Complement to Directive 10 of 2007 - Reiteration of the 
obligations on the part of the authorities to enforce the law and prevent the murder of protected 
persons&#8221;; Permanent Directive 300-28 of 20 November 2007, &#8220;Rules, analysis, diagnosis and 
measurement of the impact of operational results in the light of the policy of democratic 
security&#8221; (where priority is accorded to demobilization over arrests, and arrests have priority 
over deaths in combat). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Code.<b>27</b> Adjustments were also made to adopt the accusatory system within the Military Criminal 
Justice. Other Army measures included the deployment of operational legal advisers; the 
strengthening of internal controls; the reinforcement of its human rights offices; and training on 
the application of guidelines for personnel who are the &#8220;primary responsible authority&#8221; to 
preserve evidence for the Attorney General&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p>23. There is an abundance of guidelines within the military, and an expanded policy of training 
in human rights and international humanitarian law. Nevertheless, there is still much to be done 
towards the effective implementation of these principles within the security forces.  
</p>
<p>24. The office in Colombia continues to receive complaints of extrajudicial executions 
attributed to the security forces. Some common characteristics of the complaints are the 
following: the victims are represented as having being killed in combat; the scene of the crime 
has been tampered with before the bodies were identified; and often investigations have been 
initiated by the Military Criminal Justice system. Official investigations reveal that the 
underlying motives in several of these cases may be related to pressure on the military to show 
results, or to false claims of success in action by certain members of the security forces to obtain 
benefits and recognition. 
</p>
<p>25. The complaints also indicate that the victims included some who might have been linked to 
new illegal armed groups, such as in Toluviejo in June 2007, where six young men, apparently 
recruited by unidentified persons, were found dead several days later and were reported as 
having been killed in combat in Chin&#250;, C&#243;rdoba, by the Unified Action Group for Personal 
Liberty (GAULA) of Army Brigade 11. 
</p>
<p>26. It is urgent to identify internal obstacles so that the policies described above can become 
fully operative. There is also a need to make progress in the review, design and implementation 
of new models of tactical training to be used at the level of operative units, and to analyse 
lessons learned.  
</p>
<p>27. At the same time, OHCHR welcomes the decision taken by the military leadership 
regarding the June 2007 incident in Balsillas, Caquet&#225;, when two soldiers shot six people 
(including a minor). The immediate reaction of the military commanders was to send the case to 
the civilian jurisdiction, where the soldiers were tried and sentenced in just three months.  
</p><p>28. If extrajudicial executions are to be totally eradicated, the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and 
the control agencies need to have greater commitment. The Attorney General&#8217;s Office has 
created a special unit to conduct investigations of extrajudicial executions. The complexity and 
dimensions of this problem require the allocation of sufficient technical and budgetary resources, 
and appropriate training for the investigation team.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>27
</b>  In July, Congress approved a reform to the Military Criminal Code that did not exclude all 
</p>
<p>human rights violations and serious breaches of international humanitarian law from the military 
jurisdiction, as required by international norms. President Alvaro Uribe objected to this 
provision. A final decision by the Constitutional Court is pending. See Republic of Colombia, 
<i>Diario Oficial</i>, Year CXLIII, 46,706 (31 July 2007). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>29. So far, the depositions by demobilized paramilitary leaders have revealed the location 
of 1,009 clandestine graves within their respective zones of influence or control. This has made it 
possible to recover the remains of 1,196 victims, most of whom have not yet been identified 
(440 were reported as preliminary identified, and 118 fully identified bodies have been returned 
to the families).<b>28</b> The process has certainly revealed the way in which these extremely serious 
crimes were systematically committed by paramilitary groups, and the widespread practice of 
enforced disappearance in Colombia in recent years. 
</p>
<p>30. It is urgent to redirect the processes of exhumation so that many more bodies can be 
properly identified. This will only happen if there is greater effort to facilitate the participation of 
the victims&#8217; families in the processes of investigation, in line with international standards. 
Colombian and foreign forensic experts have already made this recommendation to the 
authorities. The National Plan for the Search of the Disappeared, issued in February 2007, 
favours collective and regional investigations, thus facilitating the identification of patterns and 
optimizing the efforts to identify the remains. But the Plan has barely gone into operation. There 
have been positive experiences in the application of this type of approach in Santa Marta, 
Magdalena, and Yopal, Casanare, which are worth perfecting and extending to other regions, 
with the inclusion of guarantees for the relatives.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Torture and the excessive use of force 
</b></p>
<p>31. The office in Colombia has received information on cases of torture, cruel, inhuman and 
degrading treatment and the excessive use of force by members of the security forces. In Cesar, 
complaints have stated that in some extrajudicial executions attributed to Army personnel, the 
victims had been tortured. 
</p>
<p>32. Likewise, the office in Colombia received information on torture inflicted on soldiers by 
their superiors in Bogot&#225;, and it was also informed of cases of torture attributed to members of 
the National Police in certain police stations or during patrols in Bogot&#225;, Huila and Norte de 
Santander. In the first of these cases, six officers in Bogot&#225; were removed from active service. 
The office in Colombia is also following up complaints on excessive use of force by members of 
the Police Force&#8217;s Mobile Anti-Riot Squad (ESMAD) in Choc&#243; and Putumayo. 
</p>
<p>33. Cases were reported of abuses allegedly committed by members of the police against the 
transgender population engaged in prostitution in Bogot&#225;, Medellin and Cali. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Illegal or arbitrary detentions 
</b></p>
<p>34. Complaints were made about illegal or arbitrary detentions in which warrants were 
exclusively based on the testimony of former guerrillas, which was not properly corroborated by  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>28
</b>  Data from the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, Justice and Peace Unit, covering information 
</p>

</p>
<p>other evidence. In Cesar, 11 people were arrested and presented to the media as guerrillas, and 
had to be released several days later for lack of proper evidence. The same happened to 
another 12 detainees in Santander. 
</p>
<p>35. Some judicial decisions have questioned the impartiality of witnesses, such as former 
guerrillas or paramilitaries who receive economic benefits for their testimonies. This happened in 
the case of a human rights defender in Santander who spent 14 months in prison on the basis of 
the testimony of two former guerrillas, and was later acquitted when it was shown to be false. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  The situation in prisons 
</b></p>
<p>36. According to official data, overcrowding in prisons has reached an average of 20.6 per cent, 
and the situation is much worse in some establishments. The Government intends to build 
11 new prisons during its remaining two and a half years of office. The current situation requires 
additional efforts and measures to meet the basic needs of prisoners, such as health, food, 
sanitation, legal advice and expert assistance, and others such as family visits, education and 
work projects. Steps already taken to implement an educational model and work training should 
be extended to a greater number of inmates. The continuing need for differential treatment of 
women prisoners, indigenous people, Afro-Colombians, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender 
persons (LGBTs) and AIDS sufferers within the prison system is still a matter of concern. 
</p>
<p>37. The National Penitentiary and Prison Institute (INPEC) has indicated that it will amend 
Law 65/1993 (Penitentiary Code) and reform the General Regulations for Penitentiaries and 
Prisons, to respond to the above-mentioned issues. 
</p>
<p>38. Finally, Law 975/2005 implies new challenges in the design of a criminal policy. This 
refers particularly to the security risks caused by the complex situations arising when those 
formerly involved with paramilitary, guerrilla and common criminal groups are brought together 
in the same facility.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  The demobilization processes 
</b></p>
<p>39. After the formal end of the collective demobilization, the Casanare Rural Self-Defense 
Group is the only remaining paramilitary group recognized during the negotiation process that is 
still operating.<b>29</b> As per the information directly collected by the office in Colombia, there is still 
concern that there are new illegal armed groups operating in the Departments of Meta, Vichada 
and Guaviare, and there have been actions in Nari&#241;o attributed to the self-styled Nueva 
Generaci&#243;n (&#8220;New Generation&#8221;), as was already mentioned in the High Commissioner&#8217;s report 
of 2006 (E/CN.4/2006/9). These groups are heavily armed, have a military organization and 
responsible leaders, and have the capacity to control territory and to conduct military operations 
against other armed actors. They represent an active factor in intensifying the armed conflict,  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>29
</b>  Members of the &#8220;Cacique Pipint&#225; Front&#8221;, which operated in the departments of Caldas and 
</p>
<p>Antioquia, surrendered in September 2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>with direct and serious consequences for the civilian population. There has been information 
suggesting that certain members of the armed forces have links with actions attributed to these 
groups, or take an acquiescent or tolerant attitude to them. 
</p>
<p>40. There are also serious challenges to the consolidation of the demobilization process, 
precisely because of the emergence of new illegal armed groups.<b>30</b> The structures, interests and 
modus operandi of these groups are not homogeneous, and the use of identical terms to describe 
them often conceals a wide variety of different activities, aims and alliances. However, whatever 
their denomination, they remain a legitimate source of concern because they continue to inflict 
violence on the civilian population,<b>31</b> for example, in the Departments of Choc&#243;, Valle del 
Cauca, and Putumayo. The extensive use of the name <i>Aguilas Negras</i> (Black Eagles) by several 
of the existing groups, although they apparently do not belong to a single structure, has created 
confusion and has occasionally enabled these groups to divert attention from their real 
importance. For this reason, the simple description of these new structures as &#8220;criminal gangs&#8221;, 
does not take into account the complexity, variety and plurality of the phenomenon and the 
danger it implies. Official figures report that the armed forces killed more than three times as 
many members of such groups in 2007 as they did in 2006.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>41. The authorities have detected that former middle-ranking cadres from previous 
paramilitary groups act as heads of some of these new groups, and that a number of low-level 
demobilized members operate in areas which were once zones of influence of the paramilitaries. 
Information received by the office in Colombia claims that these groups maintain links with 
demobilized paramilitary leaders who have accepted the terms of Law 975/2005. The 
Attorney General&#8217;s Office is investigating demobilized paramilitary leaders accused of 
continuing with their criminal activities from their cells in Itagui, Antioquia.  
</p>
<p>42. Many of these groups have been engaged exclusively in illegal activities which imply a 
control of territory and of the population, such as drug-trafficking, extortion, security-related 
actions, racketeering and other illegal activities. These have often led to violent disputes among 
the criminals themselves. Their activity is making a noticeable impact on the population in the

<p>form of murders,<b>33</b> massacres, acts of &#8220;social cleansing&#8221;,<b>34</b> death threats and child recruitment,<b>35</b> 
evidencing the need for ever greater efforts by the authorities to combat these new groups and 
investigate their possible links with public servants and local government officials. Likewise, the 
economic influence of these groups tends to encourage corruption amongst authorities. 
</p>
<p>43. The Government considers security and development to be central to sustainable 
reintegration of demobilized persons, admittedly aware that the persistence of drug-trafficking 
and other illegal activities facilitates the relapse of former combatants and renews the capacity 
for recruitment of all illegal armed groups. The Presidential Advisory Office for Reinsertion is 
implementing a number of projects for the effective reintegration of the demobilized population. 
However, it faces serious challenges in trying to secure greater participation of regional and 
municipal authorities and the business sector to offer alternative means of employment to the 
demobilized and guarantee their security. This Office draws attention to the fact that many of the 
victims who have not received reparations in the judicial proceedings under Law 975/2005 
perceive the efforts described here as a form of &#8220;revictimization&#8221; that offends their personal 
dignity and sense of justice. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Guerrilla groups 
</b></p>
<p>44. The FARC-EP continued to disregard their duty to respect international humanitarian law. 
They have committed grave and systematic breaches such as massacres, murders, the taking of 
hostages, the planting of anti-personnel mines, acts of sexual violence, recruitment of children 
(boys and girls) and terrorist acts. Among their many crimes, members of this group were said to 
be responsible for two massacres in May and August 2007 with 10 victims (among them a girl) 
perpetrated in Turbo, Antioquia, as well as the murder of 11 Valle del Cauca assemblymen.<b>36</b> 
They also murdered a number of municipal officials, including two councillors in Doncello, 
Caquet&#225;, and the mayor of San Jos&#233; de Palmar, Choc&#243;. 
</p>
<p>45. FARC-EP continued taking hostages, among them 10 timber workers in Riosucio, Choc&#243;, 
a candidate for the mayoral elections in Anor&#237;, Antioquia, and five people in the Department of 
Nari&#241;o who were later found murdered. This tactic is also employed, to a lesser degree, by ELN. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>33
</b>  For example, the murder in Cali, Valle del Cauca, of Sergio Mauricio Cort&#233;s, an activist in the 
</p>
<p>Polo Democr&#225;tico Alternativo political party, in May 2007. This crime was denounced by the 
victim&#8217;s brother to the Attorney General&#8217;s Office. The victim&#8217;s brother was murdered at the end 
of that month. 
<b>34
</b></p>
<p>  For example, the murder of four women in La Hormiga, Putumayo, in July 2007, supposedly 
because they were suffering from AIDS, considered to be drug addicts and to have maintained 
relations with guerrillas. 
<b>35
</b></p>
<p>  For example, the recruitments reported in Cartagena, Medellin and Valle del Cauca 
which are quoted in the report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict 
(A/62/609-S/2007/757, para. 116) of 21 December 2007. 
 
</p>
<p><b>36
</b>  See note 9 above. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>The systematic kidnapping and the prolonged captivity of hostages are a matter of grave concern. 
FARC-EP disregard the obligation to give humane treatment to persons deprived of their 
freedom for reasons related to the conflict, as is the case of members of the security forces held 
captive for many years. They also take hostages to obtain economic benefits or to exert political 
pressure. These military and police personnel and civilians have spent many years in captivity in 
conditions which are not verifiable, with no access to the humanitarian intervention by the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). This must be a cause for serious ethical 
and legal reflection that should question the categories of breaches of international humanitarian 
law applied to these situations in the light of the universal criminal jurisdiction. The 
High Commissioner has always unreservedly condemned this situation and has insisted firmly 
and repeatedly that the kidnap victims should be unconditionally released. 
</p>
<p>46. FARC-EP continued to plant anti-personnel mines and to commit violent acts. They are 
considered to be responsible for a car-bomb explosion in Cali on 10 April which destroyed the 
Headquarters of the Metropolitan Police there, produced the death of a civilian, and severely 
damaged various buildings. 
</p>
<p>47. Although ELN continues to engage in talks with the Government, it continues to disregard 
international humanitarian law and has made death threats, committed murders, taken hostages 
and used anti-personnel mines. Among their crimes, there was the murder of an indigenous 
leader of the Awa ethnic group in Ricaurte, Nari&#241;o, and kidnappings in Norte de Santander and 
Arauca.  
</p>
<p>48. Fighting continues between FARC-EP and ELN in the departments of Arauca,<b>37</b> Cauca 
and Nari&#241;o, and this has led to an increase in the number of murders, death threats, planting of 
anti-personnel mines, and forced displacement. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Situations of special concern and particularly vulnerable groups38 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Victims of the armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>49. As noted earlier, the Attorney General&#8217;s Office has registered over 121,547 victims of 
crimes committed by members of paramilitary groups who expect to exercise their rights in the 
proceedings in progress under Law 975/2005. Nevertheless, the number of victims of crimes 
committed in the internal armed conflict is not restricted to that group alone, and the condition of 
the victims as such is not derived from the State&#8217;s recognition or by their participation in judicial 
proceedings. All of these victims have a legitimate aspiration to truth, justice, and integral  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>37
</b>  In Arauca alone during the first six months of 2007, 128 murders were attributed mainly to 
</p>
<p>FARC-EP and ELN. 
<b>38
</b></p>
<p>  The office in Colombia has been following up situations which also affect sectors such as the 
community of lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, including cases of homicide such 
as those perpetrated against transvestites, particularly in Cali, where 12 murders of this kind 
were reported in the first six months of 2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>reparation; and to guarantees of non-repetition. It may be that the response to these expectations 
will always be relative, but the State has a permanent duty to maintain its willingness to resolve 
these problems in the best possible manner. 
</p>
<p>50. Those victims who aspire to exercise their rights under Law 975/2005 are confronted with 
serious and very concrete obstacles, beginning with the danger to their lives and their personal 
safety. The National Police has reported 160 cases of death threats against victims claiming their 
rights, and the National Commission for Reparation and Reconciliation (CNRR) has recorded 
13 murders of people who were pressing claims for the restoration of land and other possessions. 
There are still difficulties for the victims who wish to be parties in related court proceedings due 
to a lack of clarity regarding the application of some provisions of Law 975/2005. Added to this, 
there is limited access to legal counsel and to appropriate representation in court. 
</p>
<p>51. In September, the Government created the Program of Protection for Victims and 
Witnesses under Law 975/2005, but this programme has received criticisms from some of the 
main beneficiary sectors. Both the Government and CNRR have recognized the need for 
administrative mechanisms for reparation that will overcome the limitations of the existing 
judicial mechanisms. At the time of writing, the Government and CNRR were working to set up 
a legal framework, which could represent an important initial step forward to fulfil the rights to 
truth, justice and guarantees of non-repetition. This is an area of reform and adjustment still 
required by the process initiated with Law 975/2005. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Displaced persons and isolated communities 
</b></p>
<p>52. In 2007, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees published a 
comprehensive report on forced displacement in Colombia.<b>39</b> The figures on forced displacement 
in 2007 reveal that incidents were provoked mainly by attacks on the civilian population by 
FARC-EP and the ELN, by clashes between these two groups,<b>40</b> or by clashes between 
these groups and law enforcement agencies.<b>41</b> In Nari&#241;o, one of the departments most 
affected, displacements were caused by clashes between the guerrillas and the self-styled 
Nueva Generaci&#243;n.<b>42</b> Also, in certain areas displacement was related to the presence of illegal 
crops, or to pressure exerted by illegal armed groups, or gangs engaged in the growing of illegal 
crops and drug-trafficking, or as the effect of aerial spraying. 
</p>
<p>

published August 2007. 
<b>40
</b></p>
<p>  In Arauca, 253 families were displaced in January, and 132 in April, including 16 families 
from the Makaguan ethnic group from the La Esperanza de Tame indigenous reservation. 
<b>41
</b></p>
<p>  In March, displacement of El Charco affected some 5,000 inhabitants. 
 
</p>
<p><b>42
</b>  In May, some 525 people were displaced in the municipality of Cumbitara (Department of 
</p>
<p>Nari&#241;o). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>53. FARC-EP continued to isolate a number of communities,<b>43</b> on occasion planting 
anti-personnel mines, which has seriously affected the economic, social and cultural rights of the 
population to the point of preventing access to health care and food. 
</p>
<p>54. The Government has increased the funding allocated to meet the needs of the displaced 
population and its budgetary effort is significant. However, the Controller General, the 
Procurator General and the Constitutional Court have drawn attention to persisting deficiencies 
with regard to the differentiated attention to specific population groups (such as women, 
indigenous, Afro-Colombians) and inequity in handling protected rights, especially the right to 
housing. Cases of forced displacement (a crime under Colombian law, which has driven almost 
2 million Colombians off their land)<b>44</b> have not been properly investigated, and very few 
perpetrators have been convicted and reparation has been granted in very few cases.<b>45</b> 
</p>
<p>55. The Constitutional Court has actively followed up the issue of displaced persons and 
established indicators to measure the effective enjoyment of rights and to overcome the situation 
that it had declared unconstitutional, among other means, by extending the three-month period of 
humanitarian emergency aid offered by the State until the affected persons can support 
themselves. The court also made it clear that the State must take full responsibility for the 
stabilization of the situation of all displaced persons. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Indigenous groups and Afro-Colombians 
</b></p>
<p>56. Indigenous and Afro-Colombian groups - who make up a considerable percentage of the 
displaced population - have been particularly affected. This situation is partly due to the fact that 
they are located in territories that are strategic in the dynamics of the internal armed conflict, and 
partly because they have suffered from discrimination and marginalization. In addition, they 
have also been affected by large-scale productive projects imposed on their collectively held 
territories and by legislation unfavourable to traditional forms of production, by the development 
of major infrastructure projects - such as dams which can negatively impact the environment - 
and by the aerial spraying of illegal crops. 
</p>
<p>57. Serious violations committed against indigenous ethnic communities have been attributed 
to illegal armed groups. One instance was the massacre of eight Aw&#225; and Pastos Indians in the  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>43
</b>  In Arauca, the population has been affected by restrictions to the circulation of traffic imposed 
</p>
<p>by FARC-EP on roads connecting the municipalities of Arauca, Saravena and Tame. 
<b>44
</b></p>
<p>  Official figure given by the United Registry System (SUR, Sistema &#218;nico de Registro), 
although non-official figures report up to 3 million displaced persons. 
<b>45
</b></p>
<p>  The Council of State&#8217;s decision of November 2007 declared the State responsible for the 
damages caused to 538 persons displaced from the rural district of Filogringo (Municipality of 
El Tarra, Department of Norte de Santander) following a paramilitary attack in March 2000, 
fining the State almost 12 billion Colombian pesos (equivalent to about US$ 6 million) in 
reparations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>municipality of Cumbal, Nari&#241;o, in June 2007, attributed to FARC-EP. The worst affected 
regions are Arauca, Cauca, Choc&#243;, C&#243;rdoba, Guajira, Nari&#241;o, Putumayo and Valle del Cauca. 
The intensification of the armed conflict in Buenaventura gravely affected the individual and 
collective rights of the Afro-Colombian population in that area. A very large number of members 
of the nomad group Nukak Mak&#250; - inhabitants of a region in the Department of Guaviare who, as 
a group, are in danger of extinction - have been displaced and are in a critical situation, needing 
very specific attention due to their cultural peculiarities. 
</p>
<p>58. The Government extended its comprehensive plan for the support of extremely vulnerable 
or endangered indigenous communities into the Departments of Cesar, Risaralda, Meta and 
Guajira. This is a positive step which needs to be consolidated, expressly taking into account 
results from studies conducted among several ethnic groups focusing on their expected life plans. 
</p>
<p>59. A plan for integral development was formulated to improve the situation of 
Afro-Colombians, and progress was made in regulating several articles of Law 70 of 1993 on 
collective land ownership. This is a process which should culminate in specific decisions arrived 
at after consultation with the communities themselves. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>60. In 2007, human rights defenders - both men and women particularly rural and grassroots 
leaders - were murdered. In Antioquia, Casanare, Norte de Santander, Putumayo and Sucre, 
cases were reported in which responsibility was attributed to members of the security forces. 
Other cases were attributed to FARC-EP in Antioquia, Arauca, Caldas and Putumayo and to new 
illegal armed groups in Antioquia, Bol&#237;var, Cesar, C&#243;rdoba, Putumayo and Valle del Cauca. 
Cases were recorded also of threats made against human rights defenders in Antioquia, Atl&#225;ntico 
and Bogot&#225; and information was stolen from the offices of human rights NGOs in Bogot&#225;. 
Information was also stolen from the Regional Ombudsman&#8217;s offices in Bol&#237;var and Santander. 
Some members of organizations which offer advice to the victims of paramilitary groups in the 
proceedings under Law 975/2005 have also received threats or been subjected to interference 
with their work and their work has been publicly questioned, even by State authorities, especially 
in Bogot&#225; and Medell&#237;n.  
</p>
<p>61. In the course of her visit to Colombia from 7 to 9 September 2007, the High Commissioner 
reiterated her support for the dedicated and courageous work of men and women working as 
human rights defenders, and advocated for effective measures to improve their protection. The 
High Commissioner called for public officials to stop making statements designed to discredit 
human rights defenders&#8217; work, because they might increase the danger to the defenders&#8217; lives or 
personal safety. 
</p>
<p>62. The Protection Programme of the Ministry of Interior and Justice was strengthened with 
additional personnel and extended its coverage to new groups of beneficiaries, such as displaced 
persons and victims who were involved in cases under Law 975/2005. Until effective results are 
achieved in the investigation, processing and punishment of those responsible for the attacks on 
human rights defenders, however, crimes against them are unlikely to cease. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>63. Renewed impetus must be given to the tasks recommended to the Procurator General and 
the Ministry of Defence to guarantee that military and police intelligence files do not include 
human rights defenders and organizations without justification. Legislation has yet to be 
introduced which will regulate the handling of this kind of information in accordance with 
international standards. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Trade unionists 
</b></p>
<p>64. Official figures from the Ministry of Social Protection record 26 murders of union leaders 
or members, 18 of whom were teachers. The trade unions record a total figure of 34. The 
difference between these numbers, and the consideration of accumulated figures over longer 
periods,<b>46</b> has generated an intense debate on the risks faced by union activists in Colombia. 
</p>
<p>65. A number of murders and death threats against trade unionists denounced to the office in 
Colombia in 2007 were attributed to members of the FARC-EP, to new illegal armed groups, or 
to unidentified persons. 
</p>
<p>66. In 2006 the Attorney-General created a special unit to investigate these incidents; to date 
the unit has received a total of 1,231 cases. The unit has 13 prosecutors, a group of investigators 
and 24 lawyers. At the time of writing, there were convictions in 82 of those cases, 36 of which 
were issued in 2007. There was a conviction in only one of the 21 investigations into the murders 
of unionists initiated in 2007. The judiciary&#8217;s administrative authority, the Superior Council of 
the Judicature, appointed three specialized judges (known as &#8220;Decongestion Judges&#8221;) who have 
been working on 24 cases in recent months, of which seven have been decided.<b>47</b> 
</p>
<p>67. The State has paid attention to the problems of union members, especially in allocating a 
significant amount of resources to provide protection to union members. Nevertheless, the poor 
results of the judicial system reveal an urgent need for more decisive actions that will secure 
fundamental rights and the practical exercise of the right to freedom of association. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Journalists 
</b></p>
<p>68. Journalism in Colombia is vigorous, and it expresses a variety of ideological perspectives. 
Nevertheless, in 2007 the Foundation for Freedom of the Press (FLIP, or Fundaci&#243;n para la 
Libertad de Prensa) recorded 1 murder, 92 death threats, 2 kidnappings and 7 exiles. The office 
in Colombia received information regarding journalists who had been intimidated or otherwise 
threatened while covering the public hearings of demobilized paramilitary leaders in Medell&#237;n, 
Barranquilla and Bogot&#225;. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>46
</b>  According to the International Confederation of Unionists, in 2006 there were 78 unionists 
</p>
<p>murdered in Colombia. See Annual Report 2007. 
<b>47
</b></p>
<p>  ILO, Special Services and Decongestion Center, Judiciary Branch. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>69. The Ministry of Interior and Justice maintains its Journalists Protection Program, but the 
measures requested from the Committee for Regulation and Assessment of Risk need to be 
expedited. The lack of effective progress in the investigation, processing and punishment of 
those responsible for violations of the rights of journalists contributes to the persistence of 
crimes against them.  
</p>
<p><b>7.  Violence against women and children in the context of the conflict 
</b></p>
<p>70. The armed conflict continues to have a specific impact on women, even though, as in 
previous years, it is not easy to document cases of sexual abuse that have occurred in this 
context. Information has been received on cases attributed to FARC-EP, revealing that sexual 
violence is used as a mechanism for pressure or retaliation. For example, in June 2007 a teacher 
was subjected to sexual violence in Medell&#237;n for having refused to instruct her pupils in the 
political ideals of the guerrillas. FARC-EP was also attributed responsibility for the murder of 
women who attempted to desert from their ranks. 
</p>
<p>71. The office in Colombia also received information on cases of sexual violence attributed to 
members of the army in incidents which occurred in Bol&#237;var and Putumayo. 
</p>
<p>72. In May 2007, the Attorney General set up a special group within its Human Rights Unit to 
be responsible for the investigation of cases in which the victims have been women, children and 
adolescents subjected to specific violations of their rights in the context of the armed conflict. 
</p><p>73. Minors - both boys and girls - find themselves in a particularly precarious situation when 
they are victims of displacement due to the armed conflict. Cases are still being recorded of boys 
and girls seriously harmed by anti-personnel mines, acts of sexual violence, indiscriminate 
attacks and terrorist activities. 
</p>
<p>74. FARC-EP continued to recruit children of both sexes, especially in the departments of 
Arauca, Cauca, Antioquia, Sucre, Bol&#237;var, Guaviare, Meta, Nari&#241;o and Valle del Cauca. In some 
cases the children were placed in the front line, resulting in killings in combats with State 
security forces. Likewise, ELN and the new illegal armed groups continued to recruit children. 
</p>
<p><b>8.  Economic, social and cultural rights: poverty and inequality 
</b></p>
<p>75. During 2007, official figures, including statistics on poverty, unemployment and other 
socioeconomic indicators, were the object of public debate due to the changes introduced in 
official methods of measurement and to limitations of access to &#8220;plain files&#8221;, thus impeding 
comparisons with figures from previous years. As a result the credibility of these figures has 
been questioned. Official statistics reflect that approximately 45 per cent of Colombia&#8217;s 
population lives below the poverty line, and 12 per cent in extreme poverty.<b>48</b> Displaced persons 
are the poorest of the poor.<b>49</b> The Gini coefficient for Colombia, which is a measure of inequality

</p>
<p>of income and wealth, is 58.6, the third worst in Latin America.<b>50</b> Progress is therefore needed in 
identifying the most appropriate instruments with which to measure the effective enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>76. In 2007, the Government&#8217;s initiative in implementing the pilot phase of the Social 
Protection Network for Overcoming Extreme Poverty (a project known as JUNTOS) plans to 
extend social services, and has a target of 1.5 million families as potential beneficiaries, of which 
300,000 families are victims of forced displacement. The beneficiaries receive cash subsidies 
with the condition that their children attend school and go for medical check-ups. The 
programme has extended the access to services in rural areas, but its impact on the reduction of 
overall poverty and inequity is contingent on further advances in an integral policy against 
poverty. The high rate of economic growth in 2007 and the reduction of unemployment<b>51</b> were 
not accompanied by an improvement in the quality of employment contracts. 
</p>
<p>77. In 2007 reforms to the Social Security (Health) System<b>52</b> came into effect, relieving the 
lowest income earners from any obligation to make contributions.<b>53</b> This measure may help to 
eliminate barriers to access of the poorest groups to health services: access to these services is at 
present not equitable, particularly in the case of displaced populations, indigenous groups, 
women, adolescents and the elderly. 
</p>
<p>78. The reforms to the regime of budget transfers from the central Government to regional and 
local governments approved in 2007 will modify the distribution of funds received by the 
regions for education, health, drinking water and sanitation services,<b>54</b> and its impact on both the 
coverage and quality of services is still uncertain. As a point of context of this development, the 
Ombudsman has denounced the fact that in 2007 over 16 million Colombians did not have 
access to drinking water. The State also failed to comply fully with the mandate of the 
Constitution that education for those aged between 5 and 15 (including at least one year of 
pre-school and nine years of basic education) should be universal, free and mandatory. Finally, 
other norms approved this year will make it more difficult to recognize land ownership rights of 
the displaced in rural areas.<b>55</b>

</p>
<p>79. The approval of policies for health<b>56</b> and education<b>57</b> has all in all been positive and should 
serve as a basis for other specific measures that will guarantee the rights of sectors that are 
particularly vulnerable and discriminated against. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  ACTIVITIES OF THE OFFICE IN COLOMBIA 
</b></p>
<p>80. During 2007, the office in Colombia received 1,871 complaints and followed up 1,563 of 
them. A total of 234 observation missions were undertaken, which represented 606 days of 
field visits. The office in Colombia continued with its activities in other areas of its 
mandate - advisory services, technical cooperation and dissemination - from Bogot&#225;, 
Bucaramanga, Cali and Medell&#237;n. On the first of these areas, activities were concentrated mainly 
on instruction regarding international standards of transitional justice, the prevention of 
violations of human rights, particularly extrajudicial executions, the scope of military 
jurisdiction, discrimination, gender-based violence and the rights of victims. Regarding 
dissemination activities, there were 42 press releases and 11 lectures on subjects such as peace 
and human rights, victims&#8217; rights, gender and armed conflict and impunity, among others.  
</p>
<p>81. The renewal of the office in Colombia&#8217;s mandate was preceded by a joint reflection 
exercise of between State agencies and the office regarding its activities in Colombia since 1997, 
and the performance of the State. This exercise enabled themes of common interest to be 
identified and the scenarios to enrich the implementation of the Agreement to be created. Also, 
an assessment of the impact of the office in Colombia was made during the year in a frank and 
productive dialogue with Colombian organizations, civil society and the international 
community. The analysis led to recommendations that will prove useful in enriching the 
responses which the office in Colombia will make to new demands and needs that arise with 
regard to the situation of human rights and humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>82. Working with the embassies of Spain and Sweden and with the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), the office in Colombia continued to support the Government 
and civil society in the process of formulating a National Action Plan on Human Rights and 
International Humanitarian Law, with encouraging results in the definition of criteria for a 
methodology for agreeing content and stages for substantial progress in 2008. The office in 
Colombia also provided advice to the National Plan for Education in Human Rights, which 
advanced in 2007 by forming five regional technical teams and by developing pilot plans for the 
five regions. 
</p>
<p>83. Among other technical cooperation projects implemented in the course of 2007, there was 
the programme to incorporate a human rights-based approach into municipal development 
plans. The office in Colombia offered advice to local authorities and civil society organizations 
in 20 municipalities and 2 districts of Bogot&#225;.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>84. Working with the Ministry of Interior and Justice, the office in Colombia implemented a 
programme of training in human rights for 141 officials and community leaders in 9 Civic 
Coexistence Centers set up in municipalities where the conflict has been most intense. The office 
in Colombia also started a project to support the Office for Ethnic Affairs of the Ministry of 
Interior and Justice in the area of prior consultations with indigenous groups. 
</p>
<p>85. Working with the Procurator General, the office in Colombia supported the transition of 
municipal administrations in a process of accountability addressed to municipal ombudsmen. 
</p>
<p>86. The office in Colombia held many training courses, including the following: (a) courses for 
military officers and for personnel from other Latin American countries on matters of human 
rights and international humanitarian law; (b) training for 12 civilian and military institutions on 
the Istanbul Protocol regarding investigation of torture; (c) courses for prosecutors on 
investigation of extrajudicial executions under the Minnesota Protocol; (d) courses for 98 judges 
and appeal justices from the Courts Martial System on the application of the system&#8217;s 
jurisdiction. 
</p><p>87. In the area of enforced disappearances, the office in Colombia began a project for the 
development of a &#8220;diagnostic guide&#8221; on the procedure to be followed before the administration 
of justice in cases of enforced disappearance. In coordination with the ICRC, the office in 
Colombia facilitated the work of an inter-institutional round table on psychosocial assistance to 
the relatives of victims of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>88. The project for strengthening the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, co-financed by the 
European Union, ended in 2007. Activities after June were financed by USAID and were 
designed to assist the implementation of the High Commissioner&#8217;s recommendations for the 
institutional strengthening of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, the fight against impunity and the 
promotion of human rights and international humanitarian law in that office. 
</p>
<p>89. The signature of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) with 
the Government of Colombia on 23 July 2007 was a noteworthy accomplishment for the 
United Nations Country Team in Colombia. The office in Colombia participated actively in the 
drawing up of the document. 
</p>
<p>90. In the framework of the United Nations Action 2 Global Fund, the office in Colombia 
supported the incorporation of the human rights-based approach in the pilot programme executed 
jointly with the United Nations system in Soacha, along with the training of United Nations 
officials in planning with a human rights perspective, and the evaluation of the impact of 
activities performed from 2004 and 2007 in the Action 2 Programme. 
</p>
<p>91. Working through the Inter-Agency Group on Gender, the office in Colombia played an 
active part in preparing information material on gender for all United Nations System officers in 
Colombia. It also offered advice on the issue of gender-based violence to women members of 
Congress, and participated in the design of an &#8220;Integral Strategy for the prevention, attention and 
eradication of all forms of gender-based violence in Colombia&#8221;, a project to be financed by the 
Millennium Development Goals Fund (MDGF) of Spain&#8217;s agency for international cooperation 
and development, AECID. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The office in Colombia of OHCHR has continued to support and follow up the 
implementation of the recommendations made to all relevant institutions in previous 
reports. The results have been of a varied nature. Noteworthy achievements include the 
strengthening of the mechanisms for working with the Government, particularly with the 
Ministry of Defence and the armed forces, and the progress made in judicial investigations 
of the links of political leaders with paramilitary groups. There is however a need for 
further progress in the fight against impunity. The economic and political structures of the 
demobilized paramilitary groups need to be dismantled. The illegal armed groups continue 
to disregard the recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> The office in Colombia intends to take advantage of the extension of its mandate to 
undertake a review of all the recommendations made during the past 10 years. This 
exercise will attempt to assess progress, identifying pitfalls and updating pending 
recommendations where necessary. The follow-up of the recommendations will be 
re-evaluated in order to promote implementation through more effective, permanent, 
coordinated and participatory mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The High Commissioner encourages the authorities to pay special attention to the 
following recommendations. She is firmly convinced that their implementation will 
contribute to a substantial improvement in the human rights situation and in respect for 
international humanitarian law:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The High Commissioner calls on the Government, the illegal armed groups and 
civil society to give priority to full respect for international humanitarian law and human 
rights, particularly the rights of victims, in their efforts to chart a course for dialogue and 
negotiations for the achievement of lasting peace;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The High Commissioner reiterates the importance of follow-up and 
implementation of previous recommendations pending. She invites the Government and 
civil society to continue to progress jointly and systematically in their efforts to establish 
methodologies to improve implementation of those recommendations. She hopes that the 
mechanisms set up for this purpose in 2006 will be maintained, and thanks the 
international community for its permanent accompaniment, which she urges it to continue. 
She trusts that these efforts will enable priority themes of the National Action Plan on 
Human Rights and international humanitarian law to be consolidated, and that this Plan 
will address the causes of the principal challenges in this area; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The High Commissioner calls on members of illegal armed groups to practice 
full respect for the norms of international humanitarian law and to release, immediately 
and unconditionally, all those they are holding as hostages; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The High Commissioner urges the Ministry of Defense and the Attorney 
General&#8217;s Office to implement effective means of dismantling all forms of illegal armed 
groups that have emerged after the demobilization process began, and to take all measures 
required to dismantle the political and economic structures of the demobilized paramilitary </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>groups. The High Commissioner urges the judiciary to continue in its investigations of 
public servants and political leaders who have links with paramilitary groups; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The High Commissioner urges the Government and Congress to redouble their 
efforts in the application of mechanisms of reparation that are inclusive and 
comprehensive, embracing all judicial and administrative measures that will provide an 
effective guarantee that the victims will be protected when they exercise their right to the 
truth, justice, reparation and non-repetition; 
 (f) The High Commissioner calls on the Government, Congress and international 
cooperation agencies to strengthen and increase resources for the Attorney General&#8217;s 
Office, the Procurator General, the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office and the Judiciary. The High 
Commissioner further urges these institutions to adopt all measures necessary to respond 
to the challenges of the implementation of Law 975/2005, and in general, the fight against 
impunity - especially the judicial proceedings regarding extrajudicial executions, murders 
of trade unionists, journalists and human rights defenders;  
 (g) The High Commissioner calls on the Government, the control agencies and the 
senior officers of the Armed Forces to strengthen their efforts to eliminate extrajudicial 
executions, to adopt measures designed to prevent, investigate, punish and publicize those 
situations in which such violations may have occurred, and to apply and extend the 
instructions issued by the Ministry of Defence, as a priority. The High Commissioner also 
urges the Attorney General&#8217;s Office to clarify all the accusations of alleged extrajudicial 
executions at the earliest opportunity;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) The High Commissioner urges the Government to increase its efforts to reduce 
poverty and extreme poverty, and in particular, to adopt integral and progressive 
approaches that will allow it to overcome the imbalances and inequities that affect large 
sectors of society, especially vulnerable groups and those living in rural areas. Priority 
should be given to grant and expand equitable access to health, education and housing 
services to displaced populations, indigenous groups, women, children, adolescents and the 
elderly. In addition, measures to protect and recognize land ownership rights of the 
displaced in rural areas should be considered and implemented. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>REPRESENTATIVE CASES OF VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
BREACHES OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The right to life 
</b></p>
<p>1. The office in Colombia of OHCHR received complaints of violations of the right to life by 
extrajudicial execution. In most cases, these executions followed the same pattern observed in 
previous years: the victims were civilians who were presented as members of guerrilla groups or 
other illegal armed groups, reported as killed in combat. 
</p>
<p>2. The office in Colombia reported several of these cases to the competent authorities. In 
Riohacha, La Guajira, members of the Cartagena Battalion were allegedly responsible for the 
death of a peasant farmer affected by mental disability. On 2 May 2007, in Hato Corozal, 
Casanare, there was the death of a community leader, in events attributed to members of the 
Counter-Guerrilla Battalion No. 65. On 13 May, in Pueblo Bello, Cesar, a murder was allegedly 
perpetrated by soldiers of Brigade 10. In Orito Putumayo, members of Mobile Brigade 13 were 
allegedly responsible for the death of 3 civilians on 9 September. 
</p>
<p>3. Other violations of the right to life were reported to have been committed by members of 
the Army. In Buenaventura, on 3 August, soldiers of the Cisneros Task Force were allegedly 
responsible for opening fire against students, whom they confused with guerrillas. A girl of 14 
died. On 17 September, in Montel&#237;bano, Cordoba, soldiers of Brigade 11 reportedly opened fire 
against two peasant farmers who were under the effects of alcohol, one of whom died. Two 
soldiers of Brigade IX were condemned for the killings of six civilians perpetrated on 10 June in 
San Vicente del Caguan, Caqueta. 
</p>
<p>4. The office in Colombia received complaints of extrajudicial executions attributed to 
members of the Police. These include the death of three individuals on 25 March in Ipiales, 
Nari&#241;o. On 8 September, the killing of a young man aged 22 in El Carmen, Bolivar, was 
allegedly perpetrated by members of the Sectional Judicial Police SIJIN, in an act which had 
characteristics of &#8220;social cleansing&#8221;. In Zulia, Norte de Santander, a man died on 3 July after 
being shot by members of the Mobile Rifles Squadron, EMCAR, in a manoeuvre which the 
police officers considered to be suspicious. 
</p>
<p>5. The office was also informed of several murders of human rights defenders, union 
members and other social leaders. On 28 January, the president of the Municipal Committee for 
the Displaced population in La Cotorra, Cordoba, was murdered. In Monter&#237;a, on 31 January, 
there was the murder of Yolanda Izquierdo, the leader of the displaced who coordinated a 
collective movement to recover lands usurped by paramilitary groups. In Medell&#237;n, Antioquia, 
on 23 April, the president of the Community Action Board of the El Pesebre district of 
Commune 13, who was also the adviser to the Asociaci&#243;n Madres de la Canderlaria (Mothers&#8217; 
Association of La Canderlaria) was murdered, allegedly because of her work in making 
denunciations. On 7 November, in Cartago, Valle del Cauca, the murder of the Coordinator of  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the Women&#8217;s Committee in the Sindicato Unico de Trabajadores de la Educaci&#243;n (union of 
education workers) was reported. On 4 May, a political activist of the Polo Democr&#225;tico 
Alternativo (&#8220;Alternative Democratic&#8221; list) party was murdered in Cali, Valle de Cauca. 
</p>
<p>6. In October, the office in Colombia received reports of death threats against members of the 
NGO Corporaci&#243;n Yira Castro, and the National Coordinator for the Displaced. In September, a 
human rights defender in Tulua, Valle del Cauca was displaced, due to death threats and the 
kidnapping of his wife. On 6 November, the Office condemned the aggression and death threats 
against Yolanda Becerra, president of Organizaci&#243;n Femenina Popular (Popular Women&#8217;s 
Organization). In Bogot&#225;, in May, three union members received pamphlets and telephone calls 
with death threats. 
</p>
