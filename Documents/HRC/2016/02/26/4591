</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which proclaims that all 
human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to 
all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, in particular as 
to race, colour or national origin,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
and the Protocols thereto, reaffirming the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and the Protocol against the 
Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and recalling the Convention for the 
Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others,  
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i> Recalling </i>previous resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on Human 
Rights and the Council on the protection of the human rights of migrants, the most recent 
being Council resolution 12/6 of 1 October 2009 and Assembly resolution 64/166 of 18 
December 2009, and recalling also the work of various special mechanisms of the Council 
that have reported on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, </p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence 
within the borders of each State, and to leave any country, including his own, and to return 
to his country, 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned</i> at the large and growing number of migrants, especially women and 
children, who attempt to cross international borders without the required travel documents, 
which places them in a particularly vulnerable situation, and recognizing the obligation of 
States to respect the human rights of those migrants, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>the obligations of States under international law, as applicable, to 
exercise due diligence to prevent crimes against migrants, to investigate and punish 
perpetrators and, in accordance with applicable law, to rescue victims and to provide for 
their protection, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of victims, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind also </i>that policies and initiatives on the issue of migration, including 
those that refer to the orderly management of migration, should promote holistic 
approaches that take into account the causes and consequences of the phenomenon, as well 
as full respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>that crimes against migrants and trafficking in persons continue to pose a 
serious challenge to humanity and require a concerted international assessment and 
response and genuine multilateral cooperation among countries of origin, transit and 
destination for its eradication,  
</p>
<p><i> Aware</i> that smuggling has become more widespread as immigration policies have 
become more restrictive, exposing migrants to, inter alia, kidnapping, extortion, forced 
labour, sexual exploitation, physical assault, debt servitude and abandonment,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> the need to protect the human rights of migrants regardless of their legal 
status, and expressing its concern at measures which, while they legitimately aim to reduce 
irregular migration, have contributed to its criminalization insofar as they treat irregular 
migration as a criminal rather than an administrative offence without the proper human 
rights protections, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the importance of 
international, regional and bilateral cooperation and the need to protect the human rights of 
migrants, particularly at a time in which migration flows have increased in the globalized 
economy and take place in a context of new security concerns,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Takes note with appreciation </i>of the study of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights on challenges and best practices in the 
implementation of the international framework for the protection of the rights of the child 
in the context of migration,1 and invites States to take into account the conclusions and 
recommendations of the study when designing and implementing their migration policies; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Takes note</i> of the work undertaken by the special procedures on the right to 
health and adequate housing in the context of migration; 
</p>

<p> 3. <i>Calls upon</i> States that have not yet done so to consider signing and ratifying 
or acceding to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families as a matter of priority, and requests the Secretary-
General to continue his efforts to promote and raise awareness of the Convention;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> States parties to the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime and the supplementing protocols thereto, namely, the 
Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air and the Protocol to 
Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, to 
implement them fully, and calls upon States that have not yet ratified or acceded to them to 
consider doing so as a matter of priority;  
</p>
<p><b> </b>5. <i>Encourages</i> Member States that have not already done so to enact domestic 
legislation and take further effective measures to combat international trafficking in and 
smuggling of migrants, recognizing that these crimes may endanger the lives of migrants or 
subject them to harm, servitude or exploitation, which may also include debt bondage, 
slavery, sexual exploitation or forced labour, and also encourages Member States to 
strengthen international cooperation to combat such trafficking and smuggling;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 6. Resolved to ensure respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
migrants, and recognizing the efforts made in this regard, requests States:  
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To effectively promote and protect the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of all migrants, including, in particular, the right to life and physical integrity, 
especially that of women and children, regardless of their immigration status, in conformity 
with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international instruments to which 
they are party; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To adopt concrete measures to prevent violations of the human rights of 
migrants while in transit, including in ports and airports and at borders and migration 
checkpoints, to train public officials who work in those facilities and in border areas to treat 
migrants and their families respectfully and in accordance with the law, and to prosecute, in 
conformity with applicable law, any act of violation of the human rights of migrants and 
their families, such as arbitrary detention, torture and violations of the right to life, 
including extrajudicial executions, during their transit from their country of origin to the 
country of destination and vice versa, including their transit through national borders;  
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To undertake, in cooperation with relevant organizations, information 
campaigns aimed at clarifying prospects, limitations, potential risks and rights in the event 
of migration in order to enable everyone, in particular women and children and their family 
members, to make informed decisions and to prevent them from becoming victims of 
trafficking or falling prey to transnational organized networks of smugglers or organized 
criminal groups;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses its concern</i> at legislation and measures adopted by some States that 
may restrict the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, and reaffirms that, 
when exercising their sovereign right to enact and implement migratory and border security 
measures, States have the duty to comply with their obligations under international law, 
including international human rights law, in order to ensure full respect for the human 
rights of migrants; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>8. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to respect the human rights and the inherent dignity of 
migrants and to put an end to arbitrary arrest and detention and, where necessary, to review 
detention periods in order to avoid excessive detention of irregular migrants, and to adopt, 
where applicable, alternative measures to detention; </p>


<p> 9. <i>Reiterates its concern</i> at:  
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The increasing activities of transnational and national organized crime and 
others who profit from crimes<b> </b>against migrants, especially women and children, without 
regard for dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws 
and international law and contrary to international standards;  
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The high level of impunity enjoyed by traffickers and their accomplices as 
well as other members of organized crime and, in this context, the denial of rights and 
justice to migrants who have suffered from abuse;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Encourages</i> States to address the need to protect victims of national and 
transnational organized crime, including kidnapping, trafficking and, in some instances, 
smuggling, through the implementation of programmes and policies that guarantee 
protection and access to medical, psychosocial and legal assistance;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recalls</i> that the Universal Declaration on Human Rights recognizes that 
everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts 
violating their fundamental rights, and therefore:  
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Requests States to prosecute, in conformity with applicable law, any crime 
against or violation of the human rights of migrants and their families, inter alia, arbitrary 
detention, torture and violations of the right to life, including extrajudicial executions, 
during their transit from their country of origin to the country of destination and vice versa, 
including through national borders; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Affirms that it is essential to place the protection of human rights at the 
centre of measures taken to prevent and end abuses against migrants, and to protect, assist 
and provide access to adequate redress to victims, in accordance with applicable law, 
including the possibility of obtaining compensation; 
</p>
<p>12. Strongly condemns the manifestations and acts of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against migrants and the stereotypes 
often applied to them, including on the basis of religion or belief, and urges States to apply 
and, where needed, reinforce the existing laws when xenophobic or intolerant acts, 
manifestations or expressions against migrants occur, in order to eradicate impunity for 
those who commit xenophobic and racist acts;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 13. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of international, regional and bilateral cooperation in 
the protection of the human rights of migrants, and therefore:  
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Encourages States to participate in international and regional dialogues on 
migration that include countries of origin, transit and destination, and invites them to 
consider negotiating bilateral and regional agreements on migrant workers within the 
framework of applicable human rights law and designing and implementing programmes 
with States of other regions to protect the rights of migrants; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Also encourages States to take the necessary measures to achieve policy 
coherence on migration at the national, regional and international levels, including by 
ensuring coordinated child protection policies and systems across borders that are in full 
compliance with international human rights law; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Further encourages States to strengthen further their cooperation in protecting 
witnesses and victims of smugglers and traffickers; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Encourages States to allow persons claiming to be in need of international 
protection to enter the national asylum procedure without delay; </p>


<p> 14. <i>Takes note </i>of actions taken by several special procedures of the Council and 
treaty bodies towards the effective prevention of violations of the human rights of migrants, 
including through joint statements and urgent appeals, and encourages them to continue 
with their collaborative efforts to this end, within their respective mandates; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>15. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
