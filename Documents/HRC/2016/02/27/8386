<p><i>Summary 
</i>At the invitation of the Government of South Africa, the Working Group on the use 
</p>
<p>of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right 
of peoples to self-determination visited South Africa from 10 to 19 November 2010. In 
accordance with its mandate, the Working Group focused on the legislation on mercenaries 
and private military and security companies and the impact of such legislation on the 
enjoyment and protection of human rights. It also examined whether mechanisms have 
been put in place in order to hold private military and security companies accountable for 
any involvement in human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>Since the period bringing an end to apartheid in 1994, many South Africans with 
extensive military skills and experience have been unwilling or unable to find employment 
in South Africa. As a result, they have offered their services abroad and many have been 
employed by international private military and security companies. Some have become 
involved in mercenary activities. In order to address these developments, South Africa was 
one of the first countries to adopt legislation on the provision of &#8220;foreign military 
assistance&#8221; in 1998. However, the Working Group found that there were a number of 
challenges in the implementation of such legislation, some of which are related to the 
functioning of the National Conventional Arms Control Committee, which is in charge of 
</p>
<p>

<p>examining and granting requests for authorization to provide security services in areas of 
armed conflict. Others are linked to the difficulties with prosecutions. Over all, it was clear 
to the Working Group that the 1998 legislation has not had a significant impact on the 
private military and security industry.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>Following the attempted coup d&#8217;&#233;tat in Equatorial Guinea in 2004, in which several 
South African mercenaries were involved, new legislation was adopted in 2006, but is not 
in force yet. While such legislation seeks to address some of the problems encountered 
previously, it remains to be seen whether the new legislation will effectively regulate the 
provision of security services in areas of armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>The Working Group also examined the framework that has been established to 
regulate the domestic private security industry in South Africa. Since there are some 
potential areas of overlap between the regulatory rules covering private security companies 
working within South Africa and those working abroad, the Working Group recommends 
that the authorities provide coordination and harmonization between the two regulatory 
frameworks. 
</p>
<p>The establishment of a regulatory and monitoring regime for private military and 
security companies is only a first step towards ensuring accountability in cases of human 
rights violations. The Working Group recommends that the authorities consider the 
establishment of accountability mechanisms for private military and security companies at 
the domestic level. The Working Group also recommends that effective remedies be 
offered to potential victims of human rights violations involving private military and 
security companies.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of South Africa, the Working Group on the use 
of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right 
of peoples to self-determination visited South Africa from 10 to 19 November 2010. In 
accordance with general practice, the Working Group was represented by two of its 
members, Alexander Nikitin and Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado.1  
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 2005/2, the Commission on Human Rights requested the Working 
Group to monitor mercenaries and mercenary-related activities in all their forms and 
manifestations in different parts of the world, and study and identify emerging issues, 
manifestations and trends regarding mercenaries or mercenary-related activities and their 
impact on human rights, particularly on the right of peoples to self-determination. In its 
resolution 7/21, the Human Rights Council also mandated the Working Group to monitor 
and study the effects of the activities of private companies offering military assistance, 
consultancy and security services on the international market on the enjoyment of human 
rights, particularly the right of peoples to self-determination, and to prepare draft 
international basic principles that encourage respect for human rights on the part of those 
companies in their activities. In its resolution 15/12, the Council requested that the Working 
Group continue to monitor mercenaries and mercenary-related activities in all their forms 
and manifestations, including private military and security companies, in different parts of 
the world, including instances of protection provided by Governments to individuals 
involved in mercenary activities, as well as to continue to study and identify sources and 
causes, emerging issues, manifestations and trends regarding mercenaries or mercenary-
related activities and their impact on human rights, particularly on the right of peoples to 
self determination.   
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group is grateful to the Government of South Africa for its invitation. 
In accordance with its mandate, the Working Group focused on the legislation on 
mercenaries and private military and security companies and the impact such legislation has 
had on the enjoyment and protection of human rights. It also examined whether 
mechanisms have been put in place in order to hold private military and security companies 
accountable for any involvement in human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>4. In the present report, the Working Group uses the term &#8220;mercenary&#8221; as defined in 
article 1 of the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and 
Training of Mercenaries, namely, any person who (a) is especially recruited locally or 
abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict; (b) is motivated to take part in the hostilities 
essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a party 
to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to 
combatants of similar rank and functions in the armed forces of that party; (c) is neither a 
national of a party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a party to the 
conflict; (d) is not a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict; and (e) has not 
been sent by a State which is not a party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its 
armed forces.  
</p>
<p>5. Article 1 of the Convention also provides that a mercenary is any person who, in any 
other situation (a) is specially recruited locally or abroad for the purpose of participating in 
a concerted act of violence aimed at (i) overthrowing a Government or otherwise 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 1 The Working Group is composed of five independent experts serving in their personal capacities. 
</p>
<p>Alexander Nikitin (Russian Federation) was the Chairperson-Rapporteur from October to December 
</p><p>2010. The other members were Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez (Colombia), Najat al-Hajjaji (Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya), Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado (Spain) and Faiza Patel (Pakistan). </p>

<p>undermining the constitutional order of a State; and (ii) undermining the territorial integrity 
of a State; (b) is motivated to take part therein essentially by the desire for significant 
private gain and is prompted by the promise or payment of material compensation; (c) is 
neither a national nor a resident of the State against which such an act is directed; (d) has 
not been sent by a State on official duty; and (e) is not a member of the armed forces of the 
State on whose territory the act is undertaken. 
</p><p>6. In the present report, a private military and/or security company is to be understood 
as a corporate entity which provides on a compensatory basis military and/or security 
services by physical persons and/or legal entities.2  
</p>
<p>7. During the mission, the Working Group held meetings in Cape Town and in Pretoria 
with Government officials from the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, 
the Department of State Security, the Department of Justice and Constitutional 
Development, the Department of Defence, the National Prosecuting Authority, the South 
African Police Service, parliamentarians, representatives of the diplomatic community, 
international organizations, academics, think tanks, journalists and representatives of the 
private military and security industry. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>8. South Africa became a fertile recruiting ground for mercenaries and private military 
and security companies for very specific historical reasons. National efforts to prohibit 
mercenaries and regulate private military and security companies operating in areas of 
armed conflict abroad must be analysed against this unique historical and political 
background. The issue of regulation has been the subject of significant debate by different 
stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>9. During the transition period early in the 1990s, many soldiers of the South African 
Defence Force (SADF) either left the Army or were demobilized. The SADF was replaced 
by the South African National Defence Force. Many of the ex-SADF soldiers had gained 
advanced military skills and extensive operational experience. The downscaling of the 
military created a massive surplus of potential recruits for the private sector. This has 
clearly facilitated the development of a private military and security industry in South 
Africa.  
</p>
<p>10. Executive Outcomes was one of the earliest private military and security companies 
to operate on the international market; its emergence prompted the former Special 
Rapporteur on the use of mercenaries as a means of impeding the exercise of the right of 
peoples to self-determination to refer to a &#8220;new operational model&#8221;.3 The company was 
founded in South Africa by Eeben Barlow in 1989 and recruited many former members of 
the SADF. The South African authorities clearly mistrusted a company employing former 
members of the special apartheid forces (E/CN.4/1997/24, para. 98). Nonetheless, 
Executive Outcomes was very successful at securing contracts with several African 
Governments that, facing serious opposition movements, had requested military assistance 
from the company. For instance, Executive Outcomes was involved in supporting the 
Government of Angola in training its armed forces and fighting the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) insurgents in the early 1990s (ibid., para. 51). 
Paradoxically, many Executive Outcomes employees had served in the SADF in the late 
</p>

 2 See the draft of a possible convention on private military and security companies (A/HRC/15/25, 
</p>
<p>annex), art. 2.  
 3 See the report on the question of the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and 
</p>
<p>impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination (E/CN.4/1997/24), paras. 92-111. </p>

</p>
<p>1980s helping UNITA rebels against the Government of Angola.4 Upon the request of the 
Government of Sierra Leone, the company also provided training to the country&#8217;s armed 
forces and took part in some military operations against the rebel Revolutionary United 
Front (E/CN.4/1997/24, para. 52).  
</p>
<p>11. It appears that the Government of South Africa&#8217;s disapproval of the activities of 
Executive Outcomes in other African countries was the main motivation behind the 
adoption of the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act in 1998 (ibid., para. 98). 
More generally, the authorities were concerned about the impact of the activities of such 
companies on its foreign policy objectives. Executive Outcomes was dissolved on 31 
December 1998. Many of the company&#8217;s employees went on to seek employment with 
other private military and security companies.  
</p>
<p>12. After the experience of Executive Outcomes, South African private military and 
security companies became smaller, more specialized, and mainly involved in non-combat 
services.5 It is not always clear where companies are incorporated, and there have been 
instances where companies have moved their headquarters from South Africa to other 
countries. It also appears that some companies were created and headed by South Africans, 
but established and incorporated elsewhere. There are few private military and security 
companies established in South Africa and there is no association of private military and 
security companies in South Africa. Nonetheless, one should refer to the recent 
establishment of the Pan-African Security Association, whose ambition is to represent the 
whole of the security industry in Africa. Several companies established and run by South 
Africans are currently members of the Association.  
</p>
<p>13. Many international private military and security companies are staffed by former 
members of the Special Forces and therefore closely associated with this strong network of 
military veterans. Some are former members of the 32 Battalion. Today, many South 
Africans work for private military and security companies such as Dyncorp International 
and Erinys International in places such as Iraq. Exact figures are hard to find, but it is 
estimated that between 2,000 and 4,000 South Africans might work in Iraq. According to 
the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, 35 South Africans employed in 
the private military and security industry died in Iraq between 2004 and 2010. Their bodies 
were repatriated to South Africa. Four others were abducted in 2006 and their status 
remains unknown. The figures for the injured are not available as such cases are not 
reported to the South African authorities.  
</p>
<p>14. In parallel to the growth of private military and security companies established 
and/or run by South Africans operating on the international market, the domestic private 
security industry, which had begun developing in the 1980s, also grew tremendously after 
</p><p>1994. The combination of persistently high levels of violent crime and insufficient police 
resources has favoured this growth. The arrival of international security firms on the South 
African market also contributed to the development of the domestic private security 
industry. The industry is largely dominated at the managerial level by white South Africans, 
while most employees are black.6 According to the Security Industry Alliance, the private

<p>security industry in South Africa is estimated to have an annual turnover of close to R50 
billion. Others estimate it at approximately R14 billion.7 
</p>
<p>15. At the end of March 2010, it was reported that 387,273 security officers were 
registered by the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSIRA) and actively 
employed by 7,459 private security companies. 8  In addition, there were 1,070,387 
registered but currently inactive security officers.9 The private security industry is the most 
important employer of entry-level workers in South Africa. As a point of comparison, there 
are 154,615 police officers (excluding civilians) working in the South African Police 
Service as of May 2011.10 These figures represent a ratio of private security officers to 
police of 2.57 (almost three times more private security officers), or 806 private security 
officers per 100,000 inhabitants in relation to only 313 police.11 
</p>
<p>16. The private security industry is well organized in South Africa. There are several 
employers associations. The largest alliance of security associations in South Africa is the 
Security Industry Alliance, which seems to be relatively effective in representing the 
security industry in its dealings with the authorities.12 Among other activities, it tries to 
work closely with the South African Police Service, the National Prosecuting Authority, the 
Department of Justice and other governmental entities involved in combating crime. The 
largest security companies operating in South Africa are core members of the Security 
Industry Alliance. 
</p>
<p>17. While the Government of South Africa has made it clear that it does not promote nor 
condone mercenary activities, some South African nationals have been involved in such 
activities on several occasions. In March 2004, several South Africans were arrested in 
Equatorial Guinea for their involvement in the attempted coup against President Obiang.13 
Nick du Toit, who was among this group, is a former army officer of the SADF. Other 
South Africans, led by a British national, Simon Mann, were arrested in Zimbabwe. They 
were tried in Harare and found guilty of arms smuggling on 22 July 2004. After serving 
their prison sentence in Zimbabwe, most of them were released in May 2005 and returned 
to South Africa, where they were prosecuted. However, Simon Mann was extradited to 
Equatorial Guinea. He and those arrested in Equatorial Guinea were tried in Malabo and 
found guilty of committing crimes against the Head of State and against the form of 
government, or being accomplices in such attempts. They received lengthy prison 
sentences, but were pardoned in 2009. The involvement of so many South Africans in the 
coup attempt orchestrated from South Africa was seen as a major embarrassment for the 
Government of South Africa and, as will be discussed below, prompted a revision of the 
legislation in 2006. After 2004, there were reports that South African mercenaries were still 
being recruited around Africa.

</p>
<p><b> III. Current legislative and regulatory framework 
</b></p>
<p>18. South Africa is not a party to the International Convention against the Recruitment, 
Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries or to the Organization of African Unity 
Convention for the Elimination of Mercenarism in Africa. 
</p>
<p>19. The South African Constitution, adopted in 1996, does not explicitly mention 
mercenaries, or private military and security companies. Nonetheless, article 198 (b) of the 
Constitution provides that &#8220;the resolve to live in peace and harmony precludes any South 
African citizen from participating in armed conflict, national or internationally, except as 
provided for in the Constitution or national legislation&#8221;. This provision provided the legal 
basis for the adoption of the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act (No. 15 of 
1998). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act of 1998  
</b></p>
<p>20. South Africa was one of the first countries to adopt legislation on the provision of 
&#8220;foreign military assistance&#8221; in 1998 and such legislation has often been hailed as a model 
for other countries. The primary aim of the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act 
is clearly to prohibit mercenary activities. Article 2 of the Act prohibits anyone within 
South Africa from recruiting, using or training persons for, or financing or engaging in 
mercenary activity, which is defined by the Act as the &#8220;direct participation as a combatant 
in armed conflict for private gain&#8221;. Any person who does so commits an offence. 
</p>
<p>21. The second aim of the Act is to regulate the provision of foreign military assistance 
by South African citizens, companies and permanent residents in South Africa. Under the 
Act, foreign military assistance includes military assistance to a party to an armed conflict 
in the form of advice or training; personnel, financial, logistical, intelligence or operational 
support; personnel recruitment; medical or paramedical services; or procurement of 
equipment. It also includes security services for the protection of individuals involved in 
armed conflict or their property; any action aimed at overthrowing a Government or 
undermining the constitutional order, sovereignty or territorial integrity of a State; and any 
other action that has the result of furthering the military interests of a party to the armed 
conflict. The definition of foreign military assistance is thus very broad and open to 
interpretation. 
</p>
<p>22. Any person or company who seeks to provide foreign military assistance must be 
specifically authorized to do so. Article 4 of the Act establishes a two-stage process in 
which nationals, permanent residents or firms first need to seek authorization from the 
National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC) to offer to provide foreign 
military assistance. In the second stage, the Committee forwards its recommendation to the 
Minister of Defence, who makes the final decision according to the criteria set out in 
article 7. This list provides for instance that authorizations will not be granted if they would 
result in the &#8220;infringement of human rights&#8221;. Article 5 of the Act provides that the same 
process must be followed for the approval of agreements for the rendering of foreign 
military assistance. 
</p>
<p>23. The text of the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act has a number of 
limitations. While the Act covers the provision of foreign military assistance to areas of 
armed conflict, it does not actually define the central notion of &#8220;armed conflict&#8221;; it merely 
provides that &#8220;armed conflict&#8221; includes any armed conflict between (a) the armed forces of 
foreign States, (b) the armed forces of a foreign State and dissident armed forces or other 
armed groups, or (c) armed groups (art. 1). The Working Group notes that the lack of a 
clear definition in the Act has resulted in some uncertainty as to the exact scope of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/32/Add.3  
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>application of the legislation. In this connection, the South African authorities have pointed 
out that there is no internationally accepted definition of armed conflict and that this 
concept is by nature difficult to define (see also para. 37 below). 
</p>
<p>24. The Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act has also been criticized for 
excluding humanitarian assistance from its scope. The Working Group was told that a 
number of South African private military and security companies have sought to evade 
regulation under the Act by claiming that they were carrying out demining or other 
humanitarian activities.14 Another limitation of the Act is that it covers only situations of 
armed conflict. As a result, the activities of private military and security companies in 
situations not involving armed conflict are not regulated by the Act. However, according to 
the South African authorities, the defence industry and military entities in South Africa 
have to apply according to the National Conventional Arms Control Act (No. 41 of 2002) 
in order to offer services outside South Africa. Yet another limitation of the Regulation of 
Foreign Military Assistance Act is that it does not specify what the sanctions are for 
breaches of the Act, which might limit its deterrence effect. 
</p>
<p><b> B. National Conventional Arms Control Committee  
</b></p>
<p>25. The NCACC plays a central role in the regulatory framework established by the 
Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act. Members of the NCACC, which is a 
Cabinet committee, are appointed by the President. It is comprised of eight Cabinet 
Ministers and three Deputy Ministers. The Directorate Conventional Arms Control acts as 
the Secretariat for the Committee. The NCACC is currently governed by the National 
Conventional Arms Control Act. It is supposed to meet once a month. It was initially 
appointed by the Cabinet in 1995 to ensure that arms trade and transfer policies conformed 
to internationally accepted practice. Its main and original function is to deal with 
applications for arms sales.  
</p>
<p>26. Under the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act, as mentioned above, the 
NCACC is also mandated to make recommendations to the Minister of Defence to 
authorize offers to provide foreign military assistance and approve agreements for the 
rendering of foreign military assistance. The Working Group was informed by the 
authorities that the Committee was given this additional mandate because private military 
and security companies operating in areas of armed conflict often exported arms. The 
Working Group regrets that despite its requests, it was not provided with comprehensive 
information as to the functioning of the NCACC, requests received, authorizations 
provided, or regular reporting on its activities as required in the Regulation of Foreign 
Military Assistance Act.  
</p>
<p>27. While the NCACC plays a central role in the implementation of the Regulation of 
Foreign Military Assistance Act, it is unclear what the Committee has achieved in this 
regard. While article 6 of the Act provides that the NCACC shall maintain a register of 
authorizations and approvals issued by the Minister of Defence, as well as submit quarterly 
reports to the National Executive, Parliament and the Parliamentary Committee on Defence 
and Military Veterans on the register, the Working Group received information that such 
reports had not been received on a quarterly basis. While the NCACC submits annual 
reports to Parliament, such reports have not always been made public. For instance, the 
reports of 2005, 2006 and 2007 were the subject of litigation before they were made

<p>available to the public. Even where information is publicly available on the activities of the 
Committee, it mainly refers to its activities on arms trade. There is very little public 
information available on how many applications have been received by the Committee 
under the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act, how many were successful and 
how many were rejected. When the NCACC reported to Parliament on its activities in 
2003-2004, it stated that the Committee had considered two applications for rendering 
military assistance in foreign countries and that both applications had been denied.15 The 
applications were reportedly submitted by Meteoric Tactical Solutions and Grand Lake 
Trading.16 
</p>
<p>28. Subsequent reports did not even contain any information about the NCACC 
activities under the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act. When the Minister of 
Justice and Constitutional Development and then Chairperson of the NCACC reported to 
Parliament on the activities of the Committee in November 2009, he did not report on the 
Committee&#8217;s activities under the Act and explained that &#8220;up until now the NCACC had not 
dealt with it yet&#8221;, but raised the question as to whether the previous NCACC may have 
dealt with the matter.17 The Committee report for 2009 does not contain any information 
about NCACC activities under the Act either.  
</p>
<p>29. During the mission, the Working Group was not able to gather relevant and 
significant information on the activities of the NCACC under the Regulation of Foreign 
Military Assistance Act and found that there was a lack of transparency concerning the 
Committee. The Working Group notes that, according to the South African authorities, 
disclosure of information is often limited by the conditions and terms of sale in the 
agreements. Nevertheless, the South African authorities recalled that the Promotion of 
Access to Information Act (No. 2 of 2000) allows any South African to request information 
which is in an NCACC report, providing that the application satisfies the conditions of the 
Act. The Working Group received information indicating that very few, if any, applications 
were made to the Committee under the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act. It 
was also unclear to the Working Group whether the register of authorizations and approvals 
which is to be maintained by the NCACC according to article 6 of the Act had been created 
and maintained.  
</p>
<p>30. The Working Group was told that many private military and security companies had 
chosen not to seek authorization from the NCACC to export their services. Indeed, many 
private military and security companies do not seem to have much confidence that their 
applications would be handled fairly and promptly by the Committee. It did not help that 
the reputation of the NCACC has been tarnished in recent years by allegations that it has 
approved controversial arms sales to countries with questionable human rights records. For 
instance, the Committee was much criticized when it authorized arms sales to Zimbabwe a 
few years ago.18 It should also be noted that the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance 
Act does not provide for a specific time frame within which the NCACC must make a 
decision on an application. During the visit, the Working Group was told that in some

<p>cases, the Committee took several years to reach a decision on an application for arms 
exports. It could be recommended that the NCACC should more regularly and publicly 
report on its activities and decisions. 
</p>
<p>31. Over all, the Working Group did not receive sufficient information to ascertain 
whether or not the NCACC is fulfilling its mandate in accordance with the provisions of the 
Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act. The Working Group believes that it may be 
useful to consider the reasons for the apparent insufficient performance of this body. 
Questions could be raised as to whether the Committee is the appropriate body to deal with 
applications under the Act. One should consider whether the NCACC, as a Cabinet 
committee, is the appropriate body to fulfil a regulatory role under the Act. An independent 
regulatory agency might fulfil that role more efficiently. As will be discussed below, there 
is also some possible overlap between the mandate of the NCACC and that of PSIRA. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Lack of prosecutions 
</b></p>
<p>32. In order to facilitate prosecutions, article 9 of the Regulation of Foreign Military 
Assistance Act provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction for national courts with regard to 
offences under the Act. However, despite public statements affirming that the violations of 
the Act would be prosecuted, there have been very few successful prosecutions since 
1998.19  
</p>
<p>33. The NCACC has referred several cases to the National Prosecuting Authority, but 
none seems to have led to prosecution. In 2003, the Committee reported to Parliament that 
it had referred two cases to the National Prosecuting Authority for possible prosecution 
under the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act. However, the National 
Prosecuting Authority indicated that there were difficulties in obtaining the evidence 
necessary to prosecute and secure convictions. 20  In 2004, the NCACC reported to 
Parliament that it had referred another three cases concerning Hover Dynamics, Meteoric 
Tactical Solutions and Liconex to the National Prosecuting Authority for possible 
prosecution under the Act. Again, the National Prosecuting Authority declined to prosecute 
on the ground that prima facie cases could not be established.21 
</p>
<p>34. During the mission, the Working Group was informed by the authorities that a total 
of eight cases had been prosecuted under the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act 
so far, and was provided with documents concerning some of those cases. Six of the 
prosecutions on charges of mercenarism were successful, two were not. The prosecutions 
are considered by the National Prosecuting Authority to have a deterrence value. No private 
military and security companies were involved in any of these cases, only individuals. The 
first prosecution under the Act was that of Fran&#231;ois Richard Rouget, a former French 
soldier and naturalized South African citizen. The Working Group was informed by the 
authorities that he had recruited former members of the SADF for military services in C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire. In August 2003, he pleaded guilty on a charge of recruiting mercenaries for the 
conflict in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. He was sentenced to a fine of R100,000 or five years 
imprisonment. This sentence was reduced on appeal to R75,000.22 In 2004, Carl Alberts 
was also arrested for alleged mercenary activities in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. In the plea agreement, of 
which the Working Group received a copy, he pleaded guilty to contravening the provisions

<p>of article 3 (b) of the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act (rendering of foreign 
military assistance) and was sentenced to a fine of R20,000. 
</p>
<p>35. The coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea in 2004 led to further plea bargains under the 
Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act. Crause Steyl and others were charged with 
violating the Act. They pleaded guilty on a charge of participating in a conspiracy to 
execute the coup, and sentenced with a fine of R200,000 or 10 years imprisonment. Mark 
Thatcher entered a plea bargain in 2005 for his financial involvement in the same coup 
attempt. He was sentenced to a fine of R3 million or in the event of non-payment to a term 
of five years&#8217; imprisonment, as well as a four-year suspended prison term.23 
</p>
<p>36. In one case, no plea bargain was reached and the case went to trial. It involved 11 
men, mainly South Africans, accused of involvement in the same coup attempt. The men 
had been arrested in Zimbabwe in March 2004, together with Simon Mann. After spending 
14 months in prison in Harare following convictions for immigration and arms smuggling 
offences, they were sent back to South Africa. The trial was held in the Pretoria Regional 
Court in February 2007. All were acquitted of all charges under the Regulation of Foreign 
Military Assistance Act. 
</p>
<p>37. In its discussions with the authorities, the Working Group was told that there were 
several reasons which could explain the low number of prosecutions under the Regulation 
of Foreign Military Assistance Act. First, the Act applies only where and when there is an 
armed conflict. However, there has been uncertainty as to whether the Act applies in a 
given situation or case because of the problems raised by the vague definition of &#8220;armed 
conflict&#8221; contained in the Act. According to the authorities, demonstrating the existence of 
an armed conflict has proved to be challenging in some cases. The Working Group was told 
that where there was uncertainty as to whether the Act applied, the National Prosecuting 
Authority sought expert witnesses who would state that a given situation was a situation of 
armed conflict. In cases related to Iraq, the National Prosecuting Authority struggled to find 
such expert witnesses. The Working Group was informed by the authorities that this was 
why the cases referred to the National Prosecuting Authority by the NCACC and involving 
private military and security companies operating in Iraq could not be prosecuted.  
</p>
<p>38. Furthermore, there have been serious difficulties in collecting evidence and finding 
witnesses in the countries concerned, especially in conflict areas. Aside from such 
difficulties, the ability to collect such evidence also very much depends on the level of 
cooperation offered by the country concerned. Finally, the Working Group also notes that 
the Priority Crimes Litigation Unit of the National Prosecuting Authority, which deals with 
cases prosecuted under the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act, is a very small 
unit composed of only a few lawyers. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Limited impact of the legislation on the industry 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Working Group received information suggesting that the Regulation of Foreign 
Military Assistance Act had had little impact on private military and security companies 
and on South African nationals working for private military and security companies abroad. 
During the mission, the Working Group was told that the Act had prompted a large part of 
the industry to relocate or go underground in order to escape regulation.  
</p>
<p>40. There is a certain level of distrust among individuals working in the private military 
and security industry towards the authorities, with the result that they do not believe in the 
fair execution of the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act.24 The Working Group 
</p>
<p>

</b></p>
<p>was told that the industry did not see the NCACC as credible, that the great majority of 
companies have not seen the benefit of submitting requests to the Committee and that the 
failure to do so had not resulted in any sanctions. In addition, the Act has been perceived by 
some as targeting former SADF soldiers who are now offering their services abroad.25 As a 
result, it seems that most companies have not applied for a licence to operate abroad but 
have continued to operate abroad. Some have gone underground instead. While the private 
military and security industry has to some extent ignored the Act, such an attitude was 
allowed to continue because of the lack of prosecutions. 
</p>
<p>41. Despite the existence of the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act, South 
African nationals continued to be recruited as mercenaries around the continent. As 
explained in the memorandum on the objects of a new bill on the issue, the 2004 coup 
attempt in Equatorial Guinea, which was mainly organized from South Africa and in which 
many of the mercenaries involved were South African nationals, was the main impetus for 
adopting new legislation to replace the Act, which was deemed inadequate for combating 
mercenary activities and regulating private military and security companies operating in 
areas of armed conflict abroad. When the then Minister of Defence introduced the new bill 
to the Defence Committee in November 2005, he explained that it was proposed as a 
replacement for the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act, which had become 
insufficient to prevent former members of the SADF from being drawn into the Iraq war as 
&#8220;mercenaries&#8221;. At the time, the South African Parliament was urged to adopt the bill 
urgently.26  
</p>
<p><b> E.  Regulation of the domestic private security industry 
</b></p>
<p>42. The domestic private security industry is treated by the authorities as separate from 
private military and security companies operating abroad. As a result, two distinct 
legislative and regulatory frameworks have been established. Private security companies 
operating in South Africa are regulated by the Private Security Industry Regulation Act 
(No. 56 of 2001), whereas any person or private military and security company exporting 
their services is covered by the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act 1998 (until 
the Prohibition of Mercenary Activities and Regulation of Certain Activities in Country of 
Armed Conflict Act adopted in 2006 enters into force; see para. 46 ff. below).  
</p>
<p>43. South Africa has established an elaborate system of regulation of the domestic 
private security industry. Private security companies that operate within South Africa are 
regulated by PSIRA, which is a statutory body governed by a Council. Any person who 
seeks to provide security services in South Africa must register as a security service 
provider with PSIRA. To be eligible to register, the security service provider must fulfil a 
number of requirements, such as being a South African citizen, being at least 18 years old, 
having complied with relevant training requirements, having a clean criminal record, being 
mentally sound and not being employed in the public service (art. 23 of the Private Security 
Industry Regulation Act). In addition, a company cannot offer private security services 
unless all the managers and owners of the company are also individually registered with 
PSIRA. Once obtained, registration can be withdrawn by PSIRA at any time if the security 
service provider is found to be guilty of certain offences. Under the Private Security 
Industry Regulation Act, a code of conduct has also been drawn up and is legally binding 
on all security service providers. PSIRA issues public annual reports which contain detailed 
</p>

</p>
<p>figures as to how many companies and individuals have applied for registration and how 
many such applications have been accepted or rejected.27 
</p>
<p>44. The Private Security Industry Regulation Act has also established a system of 
monitoring by inspectors who have been granted broad powers to investigate security 
service providers (art. 34). However, the number of inspectors remains very low: at the end 
of March 2010, there were only 37 inspectors (which included three managers).28 PSIRA is 
clearly too understaffed to fulfil its mandate of effectively regulating the private security 
industry. In addition, the Working Group was told that the Authority had faced recurring 
problems of poor management and inefficiency, which had undermined its reputation. The 
private security industry has complained about the performance of PSIRA and its inability 
to oversee the industry efficiently and keep convicted criminals out of it. This has prompted 
the Security Industry Alliance to develop its own employee history database. In order to 
address these problems, the authorities are currently considering a complete overhaul of the 
legislative framework on domestic private security providers. New legislation to replace the 
Private Security Industry Regulation Act is being drafted in consultation with all 
stakeholders. It remains to be seen whether PSIRA will be maintained or whether it will be 
abolished and its functions transferred to the South African Police Service. 
</p>
<p>45. While the Private Security Industry Regulation Act applies mainly to private security 
companies providing security services in the country, it is worth noting that it contains a 
provision on extraterritorial application and jurisdiction (art. 39). This suggests that the Act 
applies to domestic private security companies that are also offering their services abroad. 
As a result, such companies should in theory both register with PSIRA and seek 
authorization from the NCACC where they operate in areas of armed conflict. In contrast, a 
South African individual or company that does not operate within South Africa and only 
offers security services abroad is not obliged to register with PSIRA, but may be obliged to 
seek authorization from the NCACC under the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance 
Act. In practice, not many private security companies that operate in South Africa also 
operate abroad, but this may soon change as some of these companies seek to expand on the 
international market. Considering that there might be some overlap between the two 
legislative frameworks, the Working Group believes that there should be coordination and 
harmonization of the regulatory frameworks.29 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Pending legislation on private military and security companies 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The 2006 legislation 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Prohibition of Mercenary Activities and Regulation of Certain Activities in 
Country of Armed Conflict Act (No. 27 of 2006, hereinafter the new Act) was adopted by 
Parliament on 17 November 2006 and received the President&#8217;s assent on 12 November 
2007. During the mission, the Working Group found that there was some confusion, 
including among certain governmental authorities, about whether the new Act was in force 
or not. According to its own provisions, it will come into force on &#8220;a date determined by the 
President by Proclamation in the [Government] <i>Gazette</i>&#8221;. Such a date has not yet been 
determined by the President as certain regulations needed to implement the Act have not 
been issued. When the new Act comes into force, it will repeal the Regulation of Foreign 
Military Assistance Act. For the time being, the 1998 Act is still in force. 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/32/Add.3  
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>47. The new Act has many similarities with the Regulation of Foreign Military 
Assistance Act. It maintains the distinction between mercenary activities that are 
prohibited, and what is defined in the new Act as &#8220;assistance or service&#8221;, including 
&#8220;security services&#8221;, the provision of which is regulated. The new Act prohibits and 
criminalizes mercenary activities that are defined in more detail than in the previous Act. 
Article 2 of the new Act provides that no &#8220;person&#8221; in the Republic or elsewhere may 
participate as a combatant for private gain in an armed conflict; directly or indirectly 
recruit, use, train, support or finance a combatant for private gain in an armed conflict; 
directly or indirectly participate in any manner in the initiation, causing or furthering of an 
armed conflict, or a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat uprising or rebellion against any government; or directly or 
indirectly perform an act aimed at overthrowing a government or undermining the 
constitutional order, sovereignty or territorial integrity of a State.  
</p>
<p>48. Unlike the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act, the new Act is more 
specific about what is to be regulated. Indeed, security services are defined as including 
guarding and protection services, security advisory services and training, installing, 
servicing or repairing security equipment, and monitoring signals or transmissions. 
Assistance or service also includes any form of military or military-related assistance, 
service or activity, or any form of assistance or service to a party to the armed conflict by 
means of advice or training; personnel, financial, logistical, intelligence or operational 
support; personnel recruitment; medical or paramedical services; or procurement of 
services.30  
</p>
<p>49. Article 3 of the new Act provides that no person, unless specifically authorized 
under by the NCACC, may: (a) negotiate or offer assistance, including rendering service, to 
an armed conflict or in a regulated country; (b) provide any assistance or render any service 
to a party to an armed conflict or in a regulated country; (c) recruit, use, train, support or 
finance a person to provide or render any service to a party to an armed conflict or in a 
regulated country; or (d) perform any other act that has the result of furthering the military 
interests of a party to an armed conflict or in a regulated country. It must be emphasized 
that not only is authorization required for providing assistance or services, but also to 
negotiate or offer such assistance or service. 
</p>
<p>50. One major difference that is presented as an improvement on the current Act is that 
the new Act applies in relation to any country that has been proclaimed as a &#8220;regulated 
country&#8221; under article 6 of the Act. A country can be proclaimed as &#8220;regulated&#8221; by the 
President upon a recommendation of the NCACC.<b> </b>Where there are doubts about the 
existence of an armed conflict and therefore as to whether the Act applies or not, the 
proclamation of regulated countries will settle the question.  
</p>
<p>51. Another difference between the current Act and the new Act is that the latter covers 
the provision of humanitarian assistance. Article 5 of the new Act provides that no South 
African humanitarian organization may provide humanitarian assistance in countries of 
armed conflict or in regulated countries, unless it is registered for that purpose. This 
provision was inserted in the new Act in order to cover private military and security 
companies that allegedly act under the umbrella of humanitarian assistance in order to 
avoid regulation. Nonetheless, the new Act provides for exemptions in order to facilitate 
emergency humanitarian aid. 
</p>
<p>52. Under the new Act, the role of the NCACC is expanded. It will have to deal with 
requests for authorization for the following three categories, namely, persons wishing to: 
(a) provide certain assistance or render services in area of armed conflict; (b) enlist in 
foreign armed forces; and (c) render humanitarian assistance in an area of armed conflict. 
Decisions are made according to the criteria listed the new Act. As in the current Act, the 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/32/Add.3  
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>new Act provides that an authorization will not be granted if it would result in the 
&#8220;infringement of human rights&#8221;. Similarly, a register of declarations, authorizations and 
exemptions must be maintained by the NCACC and quarterly reports must be submitted to 
the National Executive and Parliament with regard to the register.  
</p>
<p>53. Like the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act, the new Act provides for 
extraterritorial jurisdiction. Accordingly, any act constituting an offence under the new Act 
and that is committed abroad is considered as having been committed in South Africa and 
the person who committed the act can thus be in tried in a South African court. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Potential challenges with the new legislation 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Working Group is of the opinion that the Prohibition of Mercenary Activities 
and Regulation of Certain Activities in Country of Armed Conflict Act constitutes an 
improvement on the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act since the definition of 
&#8220;armed conflict&#8221; is more comprehensive, the power to proclaim regulated countries should 
bring about more legal certainty, security services are clearly defined and the offence 
relating to mercenary activities is reformulated in more detail. However, the new Act has 
also been criticized for being even more unworkable and difficult to implement than the 
current one because its scope is even wider. Moreover, the new Act does not address some 
of the shortcomings of the legislation currently in place.31 
</p>
<p>55. During the mission, the Working Group was told about a number of potential 
challenges for the implementation of the new Act. First, the provisions of the new Act are 
seen as relatively stringent and there are concerns that it would make it unduly difficult for 
any South African to work abroad in the security sector. The Working Group was told that 
when the new Act comes into force, there are likely to be legal challenges to its 
constitutionality, on the ground for instance that every individual has the right to choose his 
or her profession under article 22 of the Bill of Rights. Another challenge that the new Act 
might raise relates to the prohibition for South Africans to enlist in the armed forces of any 
foreign State, unless authorized to do so by the NCACC (art. 4 of the new Act). It is 
estimated that some 1,000 South Africans are presently enlisted in the British Army. 
</p>
<p>56. The authorization system established under the new Act remains more or less the 
same as under the current Act and still relies mainly on the NCACC. This was criticized by 
some private military and security companies during the adoption process of the bill.32 In 
the light of the shortcomings in the efficient functioning of the NCACC, it remains to be 
seen whether the Committee will be able to fulfil its mandate under the new Act. The 
Working Group also notes that the new Act does not set any time limits for the application 
procedure, which might create uncertainty for applicants who apply to the Committee for 
authorization. During the adoption process of the bill, some private military and security 
companies suggested that if authorizations were not granted within a certain period, they 
should be deemed to have been granted.33 However, this suggestion was not taken up in the 
final text of the bill. Another concern expressed by some private military and security

</p>
<p><b> C. Delay in the entry into force of the new Act 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Prohibition of Mercenary Activities and Regulation of Certain Activities in 
Country of Armed Conflict Act was still not in force by the time the present report was 
finalized, which is more than four years after its adoption by Parliament in November 2006. 
The Working Group was informed by the authorities that certain regulations needed to be 
adopted in order for the new Act to come into force. Some of the matters which need to be 
prescribed are the form and manner of applications and fees. The Working Group was told 
that it remained unclear whether each company and/or whether each employee seeking to 
offer security services abroad needed to apply for authorization. Under the new Act, only a 
company which is registered or incorporated in South Africa can apply for authorization. 
The Working Group heard that it was not entirely clear whether, for instance, a South 
African national working for a foreign private military and security company in Iraq would 
be obliged under the new Act to apply for authorization. 
</p>
<p>58. The question of delay in the entry into force of the new Act was discussed in the 
Parliamentary Committee on Defence in November 2008. Members of the Committee 
asked representatives of the Department of Defence, which is in charge of drafting the 
regulations, why the new Act was not yet operational, despite the fact that it had been 
signed by the President in November 2007. They asked why the necessary regulations still 
had not been enacted, especially since Parliament had been asked to urgently process the 
legislation. The Department of Defence responded that the National Conventional Arms 
Control Act had to be amended first and that such amendment had just been adopted by 
Parliament. At the time, the Department of Defence explained that the regulations were in 
the process of being finalized and would be enacted within the following six months.35  
</p>
<p>59. During the visit, the Working Group was informed by the authorities that the process 
of drafting the regulations had started in 2007 and ended in September 2009 and that the 
draft regulations had been submitted to the NCACC for approval in 2010. The regulations 
will then be submitted to the President for promulgation. Such regulations mainly consist in 
application forms. During the visit, the Working Group was told that these regulations 
would also list the &#8220;regulated countries&#8221; to which the new Act would apply, or at least 
provide more details on the process leading to the proclamation of regulated countries. 
While the Working Group requested specific information on the regulations, the process for 
their adoption and the reasons for delay, it regrets that the responses received remained of a 
general nature. At the time of finalization of the present report, the regulations have not 
been promulgated. 
</p>
<p>60. As mentioned above, when the then Minister of Defence introduced the new bill to 
Parliament in 2005, it was presented by the authorities as a renewed attempt to deal with 
former members of the SADF who were offering their military skills abroad, and especially 
in Iraq.36 However, the Working Group was told that the South African National Defence 
Force was facing some difficulties and was slowly trying to &#8220;re-integrate&#8221; within its ranks 
some former SADF members with valuable military skills and expertise. Furthermore, the 
authorities may have become more interested in the employment and commercial potential 
of the private military and security industry than in monitoring the activities of military

<p>veterans. This might partly explain the delay in taking measures for the implementation of 
the new Act. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Lack of accountability mechanisms for private military and 
security companies 
</b></p>
<p>61. The establishment of a regulatory and monitoring regime for private military and 
security companies is only a first step towards ensuring accountability in cases of human 
rights violations. While South Africa has attempted to establish a regulatory framework for 
private military and security companies through the adoption of the Regulation of Foreign 
Military Assistance Act, the framework did not include a system of regular monitoring of 
the activities of private military and security companies. In other words, after a private 
military and security company seeks and obtains from the NCACC authorization to offer its 
services in areas of armed conflict, there is very little scrutiny of what that company 
actually does afterwards. While the authorization can be withdrawn at any time, it is not 
clear on what grounds it can or should be withdrawn. A private military and security 
company which is authorized to provide foreign military assistance does not have to report 
on a regular basis on its activities and is not subject to any inspections. 
</p>
<p>62. Furthermore, where there are allegations that a private military and security 
company and/or its employees may have been involved in human rights violations in the 
course of its activities outside South Africa, there is no mechanism to allow such 
allegations to be reported. It is therefore not clear how private military and security 
companies and/or their employees can be held accountable for any involvement in human 
rights violations. In the light of this absence of accountability mechanisms, potential 
victims of human rights violations involving private military and security companies do not 
have access to an effective remedy. The new Act does not address these important gaps.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>63. The Working Group reiterates its appreciation to the Government of South 
Africa for extending to the Working Group an invitation to discuss the measures 
taken by the Government to address mercenary activities and to regulate the activities 
of private military and security companies. Since the period bringing an end to 
apartheid in 1994, many South Africans with extensive military skills and experience 
have been unwilling or unable to find employment in South Africa. As a result, they 
have offered their services abroad and many have been employed by international 
private military and security companies. Some have become involved in mercenary 
activities. In order to address these developments, South Africa was one of the first 
countries to adopt legislation on the provision of foreign military assistance in 1998 
and it must be commended for taking that important step.  
</b></p>
<p><b>64. The Working Group found that the regulatory regime established in South 
Africa for private military and security companies operating abroad has faced serious 
challenges in terms of implementation, with the result that such attempts at regulation 
have not had enough impact on the private military and security company industry. 
The Working Group has received information indicating that very few applications 
for authorizations to provide security services in areas of armed conflict have been 
received and considered by the National Conventional Arms Control Committee 
(NCACC). More generally, the Working Group found that both in the private 
military and security industry and within broader public circles, there was a lack of 
trust in the ability of the NCACC to examine such applications in a fair and timely </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/32/Add.3  
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>manner. Furthermore, there are minimal sanctions for not seeking such 
authorizations: very few prosecutions have taken place so far, mainly because of the 
difficulties in collecting evidence in areas of armed conflict.  
</b></p>
<p><b>65. The attempted coup d&#8217;&#233;tat in Equatorial Guinea in 2004 provided momentum 
to revise the legislative framework. The relevant legislation was thus revised in 2006. 
In some regards, the new Prohibition of Mercenary Activities and Regulation of 
Certain Activities in Country of Armed Conflict Act constitutes an improvement on 
the previous legislation to the extent that it provides more clarity as to the scope of 
application of the legislation. At the same time, the new Act has included more 
activities within its scope. Moreover, the Working Group found that the challenges in 
the implementation of the previous legislation are not all addressed. The new Act is 
still not in force as the regulations required for its entry into force and effective 
implementation have not yet been issued.  
</b></p>
<p><b>66. Once again, the Working Group emphasizes the important role in the effective 
implementation of the legislation of the NCACC, which retains the responsibility to 
authorize the export of military and security services to regulated countries under the 
new Act. No matter how comprehensive the legislation is, successful implementation 
depends on the effectiveness of the implementation mechanism.  
</b></p>
<p><b>67. In parallel to the regulatory framework put in place for private military and 
security companies operating abroad, South Africa has also established an elaborate 
system of practical regulation for private security companies that operate on the 
domestic market. The Working Group notes that some South African private military 
and security companies have both domestic and foreign operations and that there are 
potential areas of overlap between the regulatory rules covering those companies 
working within South Africa and those working abroad.  
</b></p>
<p><b>68. The Working Group also recalls that the establishment of a regulatory and 
monitoring regime for private military and security companies is only a first step 
towards ensuring accountability in cases of human rights violations. Considering the 
significant role played by the Government of South Africa in international efforts at 
the United Nations to establish an international regulatory framework, including a 
legally binding instrument (convention), to ensure the accountability of private 
military and security companies for human rights violations, the establishment of 
accountability mechanisms for private military and security companies at the 
domestic level should be considered.  
</b></p>
<p><b>69. In the light of the above conclusions, the Working Group recommends that the 
Government of South Africa: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Publicly release more information on the activities of the NCACC and in 
particular on the applications submitted by private military and security companies to 
the NCACC, their processing and the decisions taken; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Allocate appropriate additional resources to investigating and 
prosecuting those companies operating abroad without the required authorizations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Strengthen its cooperation with other countries in order to facilitate 
investigations and prosecutions and consider accession to the 1989 International 
Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries, 
which contains provisions on, inter alia, mutual judicial assistance; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Undertake the necessary steps to ensure the effective implementation of 
the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act of 1998 and establish a mechanism 
for regular monitoring, pending the entry into force of the Prohibition of Mercenary </b></p>
