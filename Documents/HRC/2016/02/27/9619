<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Working Group on an optional protocol  
to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
Second session

</p>
<p><b>  Comments by the Committee on the Rights of the Child on 
the proposal for a draft optional protocol prepared by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Open-ended Working Group 
on an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child to provide a communications procedure</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 13/3, the Human Rights Council decided to mandate the Open-
ended Working Group on an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
to provide a communication procedure to elaborate an optional protocol. In this regard, it 
requested the Chairperson of the Working Group to prepare a proposal for a draft optional 
protocol, taking into account the views expressed and inputs provided during the first 
session of the Working Group in December 2009 and giving due regard to, inter alia, the 
views of the Committee on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with resolution 13/3, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights and the International Commission of Jurists organized an 
expert consultation in Geneva on 21 and 22 June 2010, under the chairmanship of Yanghee 
Lee and Jan Zermatten, respectively the Chairperson and the Vice-Chairperson of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child. Participants were drawn from different regions and 
legal systems and had experience in litigating on children&#8217;s issues at the national or 
international levels. The Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Open-ended Working Group, 
Drahoslav Stefanek, also participated in the consultation. The purpose of the consultation 
was to discuss the possible contents of the optional protocol and to facilitate the preparation 
of the contribution by the Committee to the Open-ended Working Group.  
</p>
<p>3. The ideas listed below were among those expressed by a majority of experts who 
participated in the consultation: 
</p>

<p> * Late submission.

</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/3 
</b></p>
<p><b>2</b> GE.10-16956 
</p>
<p> (a) There is a need to establish an individual complaints procedure to 
complement the current functions of the Committee on the Rights of the Child;  
</p>
<p> (b) Children, whether as individuals or as part of a group, should be able to 
submit complaints directly to the Committee; issues regarding representation, possible 
conflicts of interest, quality of representation and confidentiality of the procedure versus 
publicity should be dealt with in the optional protocol;  
</p>
<p> (c) Experts were generally in favour of an optional protocol that is flexible, 
innovative, suited to the needs of children and takes into account the main principles 
enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child; 
</p>
<p> (d) Experts were in favour of including the possibility of collective complaints in 
the optional protocol; different modalities could be envisaged, including the model of the 
European Social Charter;  
</p>
<p> (e) The procedure should be transparent and disseminated broadly among 
potential users;  
</p>
<p> (f) Consistent with the campaign for their universal ratification, the optional 
protocol should encompass the Convention and its two existing protocols;  
</p>
<p> (g) Regarding reservations, experts were generally in favour of following the 
model of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, i.e., including a provision by which no reservations to the optional protocol would 
be allowed;  
</p>
<p> (h) The possibility that the Committee request interim measures should be 
contemplated, along with a call for States parties to take measures as a result of the request; 
</p>
<p> (i) Concerning the time limit for the submission of communications to the 
Committee after exhaustion of domestic remedies, no support for a fixed time limit was 
expressed; 
</p>
<p> (j) Any friendly settlement procedure must ensure that the interests of the child 
are taken fully into consideration; 
</p>
<p> (k) An inquiry procedure would strengthen the optional protocol and the 
Committee&#8217;s jurisprudence; 
 (l) The optional protocol should reflect the fact that national institutions can play 
a positive role in the communication procedure, but due account should be taken of their 
diversity.  
</p>
<p>4. Following the expert consultation, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Open-ended 
Working Group, in compliance with resolution 13/3, prepared a proposal for the draft 
optional protocol to be used as a basis for the forthcoming negotiations 
(A/HRC/WG.7/2/2).  
</p><p>5. The Committee very much welcomes the proposal and its comprehensive approach. 
It commends the Chairperson-Rapporteur for his efforts, transparency and spirit of 
compromise in preparing it. The Committee also welcomes the fact that the proposal seeks 
to ensure consistency and coherence with respect to existing instruments and, to a great 
extent, uses agreed language from similar optional protocols and relevant provisions of 
existing human rights treaties. The Committee wishes nevertheless to comment on certain 
provisions of the draft with a view to contributing to the future discussions at the Open-
ended Working Group. </p>

<p><b> II. Comments on the proposal 
</b>6. Regarding the preamble, the Committee considers that it should reflect the fact that 
the optional protocol must be a child-oriented instrument. It would therefore welcome 
language to the effect that the States parties take into due account the importance of the 
status of the child as subject of rights and as a human being with evolving capacities.  
7. With regard to the second paragraph of the preamble, the Committee would 
welcome the inclusion of language by which the States parties would note that the 
Convention recognizes the rights set forth in it to each child within their jurisdiction 
without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child&#8217;s or his or her parent&#8217;s or legal 
guardian&#8217;s race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic 
or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status. 
</p>
<p>8. The preamble should also indicate that the existence of the protocol will reinforce 
and complement national and regional mechanisms, allowing children to submit complaints 
for violations of their rights. 
</p>
<p>9. Regarding article 1 (competence of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to 
receive and consider communications), the Committee suggests adding a paragraph 
indicating that, in all actions taken under the protocol, the Committee will favour the 
effective participation of the child and the fact that his or her views will be given due 
consideration. In view of the particular importance of time in matters relating to child 
protection, a further paragraph should be added indicating that the Committee will ensure 
the celerity of the procedure. 
</p>
<p>10. Regarding article 2 (individual communications), the Committee welcomes the 
comprehensive approach contemplated in the draft, including the extension of the 
communications procedure to any of the rights set forth in the Convention, the Optional 
Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Optional 
Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict. In the Committee&#8217;s view, it is 
essential that no right protected under these three instruments be excluded from the ambit 
of the communication procedure. These rights are interrelated, interdependent and 
indivisible; to exclude any right would risk creating a hierarchical relationship among them. 
For the same reason, the Committee considers that the opt-out clause contained in 
paragraph 2 would be inconsistent with the obligations accepted by the States parties who 
have voluntarily accepted to be parties to any of these three instruments. Accordingly, when 
ratifying the future optional protocol, States should not be given the option to exclude any 
of them from its scope.  
</p>
<p>11. The Committee considers that the child should be given a role in the submission of 
communications. Accordingly, paragraph 1 of article 2 could be completed as follows: 
&#8220;Communications may be submitted by or on behalf of a child or of children, or of an 
individual or group of individuals, within the jurisdiction of a State party, claiming to be 
victims, or to have been victims when child/children, of a violation by that State party of 
any of the rights set forth in (&#8230;)&#8221;. 
</p><p>12. The Committee welcomes the inclusion in article 2 of subparagraph 5, which would 
require the Committee to make a determination as to whether consideration of a 
communication is in the best interests of the child when the author of the communication is 
acting on behalf of a child or group of children. However, it considers that such a 
determination should be limited to those situations in which, in the Committee&#8217;s view, the 
consent of the child or children concerned has not been clearly established. The principle of 
&#8220;best interests of the child&#8221; would be construed necessarily as being a matter of the general 
application by the Committee in its consideration of communications under the optional 
protocol.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.10-16956 
</p>
<p>13. Regarding article 3 (collective communications), the Committee welcomes the 
inclusion of a collective communications procedure, as set forth in this provision. The 
Committee underscores the particular challenges that some children necessarily face in their 
access to justice, including the pursuit of remedies at the domestic level, and those 
challenges are necessarily compounded when approaching the more remote reaches of the 
Committee in Geneva. A collective communication procedure will, inter alia, allow the 
Committee to perform its own functions better in ensuring compliance with Convention 
obligations by allowing it to address a problem affecting an indeterminate number of 
persons in a single procedure, rather than to engage in consideration of a series of similar 
communications arising out of the same situation.  
</p>
<p>14. The Committee believes however, that the capacity of non-governmental 
organizations to submit collective communications should not be limited to those in 
consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. By doing so, the optional 
protocol may unduly constrain the flexibility that the Committee may need to exercise. The 
Committee would consider it appropriate to develop its own criteria for approving non-
governmental organizations in order to ensure the effectiveness of the procedure. 
</p>
<p>15. Furthermore, the Committee considers it too restrictive to limit collective 
communications to situations of grave or systematic violations of the Convention. In its 
view, a clear distinction should be made between the procedure under article 3 and the one 
described in article 10 (inquiry procedure for grave or systematic violations). The 
specificity of the collective communication procedure should not be based on the nature of 
the alleged violation, but mainly on the fact that it concerns a group of alleged victims who 
cannot be all identified by name. 
</p>
<p>16. Lastly, the Committee is of the view that paragraph 2 of article 3 should be removed, 
for the same reasons as those indicated in paragraph 10 above. 
</p>
<p>17. Regarding article 5 (interim measures), the Committee would welcome the inclusion 
of additional language making explicit the obligation of States to take all necessary steps to 
comply with interim measures. 
</p>
<p>18. With respect to article 6 (transmission of the communication), the Committee 
considers that, for the State party to take action on a communication submitted to it, the 
identity of the alleged victim cannot be withheld. Accordingly, the following language is 
suggested for paragraph 2: &#8220;The identity of any individual or group of individuals 
concerned is not public and is revealed to the State party only for the purpose of the 
procedure. The communication remains confidential, unless the expressed consent of the 
individual or individuals concerned is given, until the Committee adopts its final decision 
on it.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>19. Regarding article 7 (friendly settlement), the Committee would welcome the 
inclusion in the draft of language allowing it to develop a follow-up procedure to monitor 
the implementation of any friendly settlement and to allow for the possibility of reopening 
(by the Committee) or resubmitting (by the author) communications in cases of non-
implementation or unsatisfactory implementation of the settlement. The Committee would 
also welcome the inclusion of language to the effect that the Committee will develop 
precise rules to provide adequate supervision for friendly settlement processes. 
</p>
<p>20. Regarding article 8 (consideration of the merits), taking into consideration that the 
child is an individual with the right to be heard, the Committee should have the possibility 
of hearing the child or children concerned when it examines the merits of a communication 
not submitted directly by the child or children. Accordingly, article 8 should indicate that, 
when appropriate, the Committee will seek and invite the child or children to express their 
views (orally or in writing) in a manner compatible with the necessary celerity of the 
procedure and the spirit of article 12 of the Convention.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/WG.7/2/3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-16956 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>21. Regarding article 10 (inquiry procedure), the Committee suggests that the 
competence of the Committee to initiate inquiries concern situations of &#8220;grave and repeated 
violations&#8221; rather than of &#8220;grave or systematic violations&#8221; of the Convention. The 
Committee considers the term &#8220;systematic&#8221; to be too restrictive, as it suggests the existence 
of a deliberate policy of the State aiming at violating children&#8217;s rights. Furthermore, a 
provision should be added to this article indicating that the Committee would develop rules 
defining criteria on &#8220;grave and repeated violations&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>22. The Committee notes the inclusion in article 10, paragraph 7 (inquiry procedure for 
grave or systematic violations) and article 12, paragraph 1 (inter-State communications) of 
clauses giving States parties the possibility of limiting the competence of the Committee in 
the exercise of its functions under the protocol. The Committee would encourage the 
removal of these clauses in order to ensure that it can provide the same protection to all 
children, irrespective of the country under whose jurisdiction they find themselves.  
</p><p>23. The draft should include a provision to the effect that the Committee will adopt rules 
of procedure and methods of work for the exercise of its functions under the optional 
protocol. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Final remarks 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Committee would like the Open-ended Working Group to take into 
consideration the above comments, and remains available for further consultations at all 
stages of the negotiation process. It hopes that the Working Group will fulfil its mandate 
expeditiously and that the drafting process and approval of the final text by the Human 
Rights Council and the General Assembly will be completed in 2011.
