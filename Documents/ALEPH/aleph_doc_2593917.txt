Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the significant factors that have affected
Silvercorp Metals Inc. and its subsidiaries’ (“Silvercorp” or the “Company”) performance and such factors that may affect its future
performance. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and the related notes contained therein. In addition, the following should be read in conjunction with the
audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2016, the related MD&A, the Annual Information Form
(available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com), and the annual report on Form 40-F. The Company reports its financial position, results of
operations and cash flow in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (“IFRS”). Silvercorp’s significant accounting policies are set out in Note 2 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as well as Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
March 31, 2016. This MD&A refers to various non-IFRS measures, such as total and cash cost per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits,
all-in & all-in sustaining cost per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits, cash flow from operations per share, and production costs per
tonne. Non-IFRS measures do not have standardized meanings under IFRS. Accordingly, non-IFRS measures should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. To facilitate a better understanding of these
measures as calculated by the Company, we have provided detailed descriptions and reconciliations, in section 9 of this MD&A.
This MD&A is prepared as of August 10, 2016 and expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share, per share, unit cost, and production
data, unless otherwise stated.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

SILVERCORP METALS INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016
(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated)
(a) Mine and Milling Production
For the three months ended June 30, 2016 (“Q1 Fiscal 2017”), on a consolidated basis, the Company mined 237,857 tonnes of ore, up 2%
compared to 233,834 tonnes in the three months ended June 30, 2015 (“Q1 Fiscal 2016”). The increase in ore mined was mainly due to a 4%
increase in the ore mined in the Ying Mining District as the production in the prior year quarter was affected by the termination of a mining
contractor, offset by 4% decrease in the ore mined at the GC Mine. Correspondingly, ore milled increased by 2% to 231,334 tonnes of ore
compared to 226,956 tonnes in Q1 Fiscal 2016.
(b) Metal Sales
In Q1 Fiscal 2017, the Company sold 1.6 million ounces of silver, 16.7 million pounds of lead, and 5.2 million pounds of zinc, compared to 1.4
million ounces of silver, 14.9 million pounds of lead, and 4.6 million pounds of zinc, respectively, in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The increase of metals
sold was mainly due to, on a consolidated average basis, i) a 23%, 21%, and 22% increase in the head grades of silver, lead and zinc as
mining dilution reduced; ii) a 4%, 2% and 8% increase in silver, lead, and zinc recovery rates; and iii) the increase of ore production output as
discussed above.
The significant improvement in the head grades of silver, lead and zinc since the December quarter of 2015 can be attributed in part to an
internal “Enterprise Blog” system in the management of Mine Production and Safety Information which the Company implemented from
August 2015. The “Enterprise Blog” is an internet social media system that makes the distribution and flow of the work related knowledge and
information easy and transparent for parties at different locations. In the system, for example, each of the mining stopes, development faces, or
equipment is assigned a “blog” name. Daily results of onsite inspection for these stopes or faces by responsible engineers are required to be
“published” on their “blogs”. The results are listed in a structured data formatted in a “check list table”, containing information and supporting
photos as required by the Company. Related parties at different levels of the management team can access directly to the daily “blog” for each
work place, for the first hand information. Meanwhile the “Enterprise Blog” system will also record if a management person has accessed the
“blog” to read or comment on the daily results under his responsibility.
With the Enterprise Blog, information collection, distribution, retrieval, and monitoring has become transparent and immediate. The
information and knowledge collected by the frontline technicians or engineers freely flows throughout layers of the management structure. The
responsible management person has the pressure, incentive, and tools to make prompt and more accurate decisions that can be instantly
delivered to responsible parties. The benefits of the system are that team member collaboration becomes easy, KPI assessments are fair and
timely, and each person is accountable for his work.
(c) Mining and Milling Costs
In Q1 Fiscal 2017, the consolidated total mining cost and cash mining cost were $68.70 and $47.24 per tonne, a decrease of 2% and 13% as
compared to $69.81 and $54.39 per tonne, respectively, in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The decrease in cash mining cost is mainly due to i) a 3% saving
on labor costs; ii) a 7% decrease in mining preparation tunnelling and drilling costs; and iii) an increase in ore mined resulting in lower per
tonne costs.
The consolidated total milling cost and cash milling cost in Q1 Fiscal 2017 were $14.05 and $11.59 per tonne, a decrease of 13% and 16%,
respectively, compared to $16.12 and $13.73 per tonne, respectively, in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The decrease in cash milling costs is mainly due to i)
a 4% saving on labor costs; ii) a 3% reduction on utility costs; and iii) a 23% decrease in raw material and maintenance costs.
Correspondingly, the consolidated cash production cost per tonne of ore processed in Q1 Fiscal 2017

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016
(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated)
decreased by 13% to $61.65 from $71.01 in Q1 Fiscal 2016, while the consolidated per tonne total production costs decreased by 4% to
$85.58 from $88.82 in Q1 Fiscal 2016.
(d) Total and Cash Cost per Ounce of Silver, Net of By-Product Credits
In Q1 Fiscal 2017, the consolidated total production cost and cash cost per ounce of silver, net of byproduct credits, were $3.11 and $0.08
compared to $4.71 and $1.39, respectively, in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The overall decrease in cash cost per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits,
is mainly due to lower per tonne cash production costs and more silver sold.
(e) All-in Sustaining Cost per Ounce of Silver, Net of By-Product Credits
In Q1 Fiscal 2017, the consolidated all-in sustaining cost per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits, is $7.06 compared to $10.94 in Q1
Fiscal 2016. The decrease is mainly due to i) a lower cash cost per ounce of silver, net of by-product credit as discussed above; ii) a $0.6
million decrease in corporate administrative expenditures; and iii) a $1.4 million decrease in sustaining capital expenditures.
(f) Operation Review
(i) Ying Mining District
The Ying Mining District consists of several mines, including SGX, HPG, TLP, LM, and HZG mines, and is the Company’s primary source of
production.
The operational results at the Ying Mining District for the past five quarters are summarized in the table below:

ounces of gold, 12.5 million pounds of lead, and 1.5 million pounds of zinc in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The increase in metals sold is mainly due to the
improved head grades achieved and higher ore production in the quarter. As at June 30, 2016, Ying Mining District held 3,669 tonnes of
silver-lead concentrate inventories, an increase of 464 tonnes, compared to the 3,205 tonnes of silver-lead concentrate inventories held as at
March 31, 2016. The estimated metals contained in ending silver-lead concentrate were approximately 0.4 million ounces of silver and 3.8
million pounds of lead.
Total and cash mining costs per tonne were $78.64 and $52.33, respectively, compared to $75.00 and $56.65, respectively, in Q1 Fiscal
2016. The decrease in cash mining costs was mainly due to i) a 4% saving on labour costs; ii) a 7% decrease in mining preparation tunnelling
and drilling expenditures; and iii) an increase in ore mined resulting lower per tonne costs.
In Q1 Fiscal 2017, total ore milled at the Ying Mining District was 167,747 tonnes, an increase of 5% compared to 160,277 tonnes in Q1
Fiscal 2016. Cash milling costs were $10.07 compared to $12.98 in Q1 Fiscal 2016, and the decrease was mainly due to i) a 6% saving on
labor costs; ii) a 6% reduction on utility costs; and iii) a 37% decrease in raw material and maintenance costs.
Cash production cost per tonne of ore processed at the Ying Mining District was $66.27, a decrease of 10% compared to $73.68 in Q1 Fiscal
2016 as a result of the decrease in both per tonne cash mining and milling cost.
Cash cost per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits, at the Ying Mining District, was $0.12 compared to $1.03 in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The
decrease was mainly due to a 10% increase in by-production credits and a 25% increase in silver sold.
All in sustaining costs, net of by-product credits, at the Ying Mining District in Q1 2017 was $5.80 per ounce of silver compared to $9.18 in Q1
Fiscal 2016, and the decrease was mainly due to lower cash production cost per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits as discussed above
and approximately a $1.1 million decrease in sustaining capital expenditures.
In Q1 Fiscal 2017, approximately 16,498 meters (“m”) of underground diamond drilling (Q1 Fiscal 2016 – 16,366 m) and 4,836 m of
preparation tunnelling (Q1 Fiscal 2016 – 5,996 m) were completed and expensed as mining preparation costs at the Ying Mining District. In
addition, approximately 16,685 m of horizontal tunnel, raise, and declines (Q1 Fiscal 2016 – 17,455 m) were completed and capitalized.
Total capitalized exploration and development expenditures in Q1 Fiscal 2017 for the Ying Mining District were $4.9 million compared to $6.1
million in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The Company also paid $1.3 million to renew the mining permit for TLP and LM mine and incurred approximately
$0.5 million capital expenditures to construct a transportation tunnel and road in the current quarter. Total expenditures incurred to date to
construct the transportation tunnel and road are approximately $6.6 million and the tunnel and road have been substantially completed.

In Q1 Fiscal 2017, the Company mined 64,349 tonnes of ore at the GC Mine compared to 66,727 tonnes in Q1 Fiscal 2016. Head grades
were 99 g/t for silver, 1.5% for lead and 2.9% for zinc, compared to 93 g/t for silver, 1.7% for lead and 2.5% for zinc in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The total
mining cost and cash mining cost were $41.91 and $33.50, respectively, compared to $56.83 and $48.74 in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The decrease of
cash mining costs was mainly because approximately 33% of ore was by-product ore from exploration tunnelling or extracted from previously
mined stopes for which direct mining costs were paid in prior periods and the only cost involved was to ship the ore to the mill.

Total ore milled at the GC Mine in Q1 Fiscal 2017 was 63,587 tonnes compared to 66,679 tonnes in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The cash milling cost per
tonne was $15.60, which is comparable to $15.52 in Q1 Fiscal 2016.
In Q1 Fiscal 2017, the GC Mine sold 0.1 million ounces of silver, 1.9 million pounds of lead, and 3.4 million pounds of zinc, compared to 0.2
million ounces of silver, 2.4 million pounds of lead, and 3.0 million pounds of zinc. Less silver and metal sold was mainly due to less ore
milled and lower silver and lead recovery rates in the current quarter.
In Q1 Fiscal 2017, approximately 3,309 m of underground diamond drilling (Q1 Fiscal 2016 – 7,416 m) and 3,486 m of preparation tunnelling
(Q1 Fiscal 2016 – 4,645 m) were completed and expensed as mining preparation costs at the GC Mine. In addition, approximately 582 m of
horizontal tunnel, raise, and declines (Q1 Fiscal 2016 – 155 m) were completed and capitalized.
Total capitalized exploration and development expenditures in Q1 Fiscal 2017 for the GC Mine were $0.2 million compared to $0.2 million in
Q1 Fiscal 2016.

Financial results including sales, gross profit, net income, basic earnings per share, and diluted earnings per share are heavily influenced by
changes in commodity prices, particularly, the silver price.
Net income attributable to the shareholders of the Company in Q1 Fiscal 2017 was $4.7 million, or $0.03 per share compared to $2.3
million, or $0.01 per share in Q1 Fiscal 2016.
In the current quarter, the Company’s financial results were mainly impacted by the following: (i) improved head grades yielded higher silver,
lead, zinc sales of 20%, 12% and 15%, respectively; (ii) a 4% decrease in total production costs per tonne of ore processed; offset by (iii) the
decline of metals prices, as the realized selling price for silver, lead, and zinc decreased by 3%, 13% and 17%, respectively, compared to the
same prior year quarter.
Sales in Q1 Fiscal 2017 were $35.3 million compared to $32.2 million in Q1 Fiscal 2016. Silver and gold sales represented $20.8 million and
$0.9 million, respectively, while base metals represented $13.6 million of total sales in this quarter compared to silver, gold and base metals
of $17.9 million, $0.7 million, and $13.6 million, respectively, in Q1 Fiscal 2016.
Fluctuations in sales revenue are mainly dependent on metal production and the realized metal price. The net realized selling price is
calculated using Shanghai Metal Exchange (“SME”) prices, less smelter charges and recovery, and a value added tax (“VAT”) at a rate of
17% (VAT is not applied to gold sales). The following table is a reconciliation of the Company’s net realized selling prices in Q1 Fiscal 2017,
including a comparison with London Metal Exchange (“LME”) prices:
Silver (in US$/ounce)   Gold (in US$/ounce)   Lead (in US$/pound)   Zinc (in US$/pound)

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016
(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated)
Cost of sales in Q1 Fiscal 2017 was $19.5 million compared to $20.8 million in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The cost of sales included $14.6 million (Q1
Fiscal 2016 - $16.2 million) cash costs and $5.0 million (Q1 Fiscal 2016 - $4.6 million) depreciation, amortization and depletion charges. The
decrease of cash cost of sales was mainly due to a 13% decrease in cash production costs per tonne of ore processed. The total per tonne
ore production cost was $85.58 in Q1 Fiscal 2017, a decrease of 4%, from $88.82 in Q1 Fiscal 2016.
Gross profit margin in Q1 Fiscal 2017 was 45% compared to 36% in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The improvement of gross profit margin was mainly
due to the decrease of per tonne ore production costs. Ying Mining District’s gross profit margin was 49% compared to a 41% gross profit
margin in the same prior year quarter, while GC Mine’s profit margin was 17% compared to a 9% gross profit margin in Q1 Fiscal 2016.
General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses in Q1 Fiscal 2017 were $4.4 million compared to $5.3 million in Q1 Fiscal 2016. Items
included in general and administrative expenses in Q1 Fiscal 2017 are as follows:
(i)      Amortization and depreciation of $0.4 million (Q1 Fiscal 2016 - $0.4 million)
 
(ii)      Office and administrative expenses of $1.4 million (Q1 Fiscal 2016 - $2.0 million);
 
(iii)     Salaries and benefits of $1.6 million (Q1 Fiscal 2016 - $1.9 million);
 
(iv)     Stock based compensation expense of $0.2 million (Q1 Fiscal 2016 - $0.2 million); and
 
(v)      Professional fees of $0.7 million (Q1 Fiscal 2016 - $0.9 million).
Government fees and other taxes in Q1 Fiscal 2017 were $1.7 million (Q1 Fiscal 2016 - $1.3 million). Government fees include mineral
resource compensation fees and environmental protection fees paid to the state and local Chinese government agencies. Other taxes were
composed of surtax on value-added tax, business tax, land usage levy, stamp duty, and other miscellaneous levies, duties and taxes imposed
by the state and local Chinese governments. Although government fees and other taxes vary period over period, they normally range from 4%
to 5% of the total sales.
Foreign exchange loss in Q1 Fiscal 2017 was $0.1 million compared to $0.6 million in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The foreign exchange gain or loss is
mainly driven by the fluctuations of the RMB and US dollar against the functional currency of the entities.
Loss on disposal of plant and equipment in Q1 Fiscal 2017 was $264 compared to $7 in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The loss is related to the
disposal of obsolete equipment.
Share of gain in an associate in Q1 Fiscal 2017 was $17 (Q1 Fiscal 2016 – loss of $78), representing the Company’s equity pickup in New
Pacific Holdings Corp. (“New Pacific”). The Company recorded on the statement of income its proportionate share of New Pacific’s net gain or
loss, as the Company is able to exercise significant influence over the financial and operating policies of New Pacific.
Impairment loss in Q1 Fiscal 2017 was $181 compared to $nil in Q1 Fiscal 2016. As at June 30, 2016, the Company wrote off its 13.4%
ownership interest in the RZY project and recorded an impairment charge of $181 against its carrying value. The RZY project is an
exploration stage silver-lead-zinc project located in Qinghai Province, China, but has been put on care and maintenance for a prolonged
period since October 2013 and there was no formal plan on restoring the project.
Finance income in Q1 Fiscal 2017 was $431 compared to $277 in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The Company invests in high yield short-term
investments as well as long-term corporate bonds.
Finance costs in Q1 Fiscal 2017 were $264 compared to $332 in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The finance cost in the current period relates to the
unwinding of discount of environmental rehabilitations provision and the interest on the SGX mine right fee payable and the bank loan.
Income tax expense in Q1 Fiscal 2017 was $2.8 million compared to $255 in Q1 Fiscal 2016. The

income tax expense recorded in Q1 Fiscal 2017 included current income tax expense of $0.7 million (Q1 Fiscal 2016 – $219) and deferred
income tax expense of $2.1 million (Q1 Fiscal 2016 – $37).
5.Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as at June 30, 2016 were $73.4 million.
Working capital as at June 30, 2016 was $42.5 million.
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $20.2 million or $0.12 per share in Q1 Fiscal 2017 compared to $13.3 million or $0.08
per share in Q1 Fiscal 2016. Before changes in non-cash operating working capital, cash flows provided by operating activities were $15.5
million, an increase of $6.5 million, compared to $9.0 million in Q1 Fiscal 2016 as a result of the improvement of operating earnings.
Cash flows used in investing activities were $11.8 million in Q1 Fiscal 2016, comprising mainly of cash used in capital expenditures of

As of June 30, 2016, the Company has two office rental agreements totaling $4,418 for the next seven years and commitments of $6,418
related to the GC property. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred rental expenses of $152 (three months
ended June 30, 2015 - $190), which were included in office and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of income.
Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to properties in which it has an interest, these procedures do not guarantee the
Company's title. Property title may be subject to, among other things, unregistered prior agreements or transfers and may be affected by
undetected defects.
Due to the size, complexity and nature of the Company’s operations, the Company is subject to various claims, legal and tax matters arise in
the ordinary course of business. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be
resolved unfavorably to the Company. The Company accrues for such items when a liability is both probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated.
In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in
such proceedings, the Company and its legal counsel evaluate the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as
the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought. Major legal proceedings against the Company are summarized
as follows:
An action commenced pursuant to the Class Proceedings Act (Ontario) against the Company and certain of its senior officers and expert
advisors was initiated in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on May 21, 2013 relating to claims for misrepresentation, at common law
and pursuant to secondary market civil liability provisions under the Securities Act (Ontario) (the “Mask Action”).

(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated)
The lead plaintiff is John Mask and the amount claimed as special damages or general damages, not including claims for costs and interest,
is $80 million or such other sum the court finds appropriate in the event this action is certified and judgment pronounced at trial. Two other
class action lawsuits have been filed against the Company and certain of its senior officers and expert advisors in the Ontario Superior Court
of Justice pursuant to the Class Proceedings Act (Ontario) on September 11, 2013 and in the British Columbia Supreme Court pursuant to the
Class Proceedings Act (British Columbia) on September 9, 2013. The Company understands that, as between the three actions, only the
Mask Action is proceeding at this time. The Company believes that there is no merit to the allegations set out in these lawsuits and has
retained McCarthy Tétrault LLP as its defense counsel and intends to pursue a vigorous defense. On October 22, 2015 the Ontario Superior
Court of Justice denied Mr. Mask leave to proceed with a class action and awarded costs in favour of Silvercorp. Mr. Mask has since filed an
appeal with the Court of Appeal for Ontario. No provision has been established for these claims.
On August 19, 2014 an action was commenced against the Company in the Supreme Court of British Columbia seeking an unspecified
amount  of  damages  for  a  claim  of  false  imprisonment  and  defamation  (the  “Huang  Action”).  To  date,  the  Company  has  been
unsuccessful in its attempts to have the case dismissed. The case is currently scheduled for a 40 day jury trial, commencing January
2017. The Company believes that there is no merit to the allegations and intends to pursue a vigorous defence.
During the year ended March 31, 2016, an action was initiated by Luoyang Mining Group Co., Ltd. (“Luoyang Mining”) against Henan
Found seeking payment of $1.6 million (RMB10.0 million) plus interest related to the acquisition agreements Henan Found entered into
in August 2012 to acquire the XHP Mine. The $1.6 million has been included into the accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the
consolidated  statements  of  financial  position  of  the  Company.  Henan  Found  did  not  make  the  final  payment  as  certain  commercial
conditions were not fulfilled by Luoyang Mining. In April 2016, Henan Found filed a counter claim in Luoyang People’s Court against
Luoyang Mining to have the original acquisition agreements nullified and is seeking repayment of the amount paid to date of $9.7 million
(RMB62.8 million) plus compensation of direct loss of $2.5 million (RMB16.5 million) arising from XHP mine. The carrying value of XHP
mine was impaired to $nil in fiscal year 2015.
During  the  year  ended  March  31,  2016,  SX  Gold,  a  100%  owned  subsidiary  of  Henan  Found,  commenced  a  legal  action  against
Luoyang HA Mining Co. Ltd. (“HA Mining”) to seek payment of $4.0 million (RMB26.0 million) plus interest related to a share transfer
agreement that SX Gold entered into with HA Mining in September 2013. Pursuant to the agreement, SX Gold was to transfer all shares
it held in Songxian Zhongxin Mining Co. Ltd. to HA Mining for $11.8 million (RMB76.0 million). SX Gold fulfilled its responsibilities and
the title of the shares was transferred to HA Mining, who paid $7.8 million (RMB50.0 million). The remaining $4.0 million (RMB26.0
million) was unpaid. In April 2016, HA Mining filed a counter claim for $2.2 million (RMB14.0 million). On June 17, 2016, the court
issued an order in favor of SX Gold. The court order demand HA Mining to pay $3.4 million (RMB22.75 million) to SX Gold. On July 1,
2016, HA Mining filed an appeal to the court order. This case is currently under appeal. The outstanding receivable amount of $4.0
million (RMB26.0 million) was written off in prior years.
Available sources of funding
The Company does not have unlimited resources and its future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others,
cash flow from operations. To the extent that its existing resources and the funds generated by future income are insufficient to fund the
Company’s operations, the Company may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing. If additional funds
are raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of

current shareholders will be reduced and such equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of the
Company’s common stock. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that, if available, can be obtained on
terms favourable to the Company and its shareholders. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay, limit or
eliminate some or all of its proposed operations. The Company believes it has sufficient capital to meet its cash needs for the next 12 months,
including the costs of compliance with continuing reporting requirements.
6.Financial Instruments and Related Risks
The Company manages its exposure to financial risks, including liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and equity
price risk in accordance with its risk management framework. The Company’s Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the
establishment and oversight of the Company’s risk management framework and reviews the Company’s policies on an ongoing basis.
(a) Fair value
The Company classifies its fair value measurements within a fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance of the inputs used in making
the measurements as defined in IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures (“IFRS 7”).
Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.
The following tables set forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value level on a recurring basis within the
fair value hierarchy at June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 that are not otherwise disclosed. As required by IFRS 7, assets and liabilities are
classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The fair value of other financial instruments excluded from the table above approximates their carrying amounts as of June 30, 2016 and
March 31, 2016, respectively.
(b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its short term business requirements. The Company has in place a planning
and budgeting process to help determine the funds required to support the Company’s normal operating requirements on an ongoing basis
and its expansion plans.
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that give rise to commitments for future minimum payments. The
following summarizes the remaining contractual maturities of the Company’s financial liabilities.

The Company reports its financial statements in US dollars. The functional currency of the head office, Canadian subsidiaries and all
intermediate holding companies is CAD and the functional currency of all Chinese subsidiaries is RMB. The Company is exposed to foreign
exchange risk when the Company undertakes transactions and holds assets and liabilities in currencies other than its functional currencies.
The Company currently does not engage in foreign exchange currency hedging. The Company's exposure to currency risk affect net income
is summarized as follow:
Financial assets denominated in U.S. Dollars
Financial assets denominated in Chinese RMB

$
$
47,795
March 31, 2016

35,521
$
$
As at June 30, 2016, with other variables unchanged, a 10% strengthening (weakening) of the RMB against the CAD would have increased
(decreased) net income by approximately $0.1 million.
As at June 30, 2016, with other variables unchanged, a 10% strengthening (weakening) of the CAD against the USD would have decreased
(increased) net income by approximately $2.4 million.
(d) Interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its cash equivalents, short term investments, bank loan and outstanding mine right fee
payable. As at June 30, 2016, all of its interest-bearing cash equivalents and short term investments earn interest at market rates that are fixed
to maturity or at variable interest rate with terms of less than one year. The Company monitors its exposure to changes in interest rates on
cash equivalents and short term investments. Due to the short term nature of the financial instruments, fluctuations in interest rates would not
have a significant impact on the Company’s after-tax net income.
The outstanding mine right fee payable is subject to a floating interest rate based on the prevailing prime interest rate in China. The
outstanding bank loan is subject to a fixed interest rate of 4.35%. The Company monitors its exposure to interest rates and does not believe
there is significant interest rate risk as the Chinese central bank has maintained stable interest rates to ensure economic stability, with less
than 1% fluctuation in base interest rate in the last five years.

(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated)
(e) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial
loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk primarily associated to accounts receivable, due from related parties, cash and cash equivalents
and short term investments. The carrying amount of assets included on the balance sheet represents the maximum credit exposure.
The Company undertakes credit evaluations on counterparties as necessary and has monitoring processes intended to mitigate credit risks.
The Company has trade receivables from time to time from its major customers primarily in China engaged in the mining and milling of base
and polymetallic metals. The historical level of customer default is zero and aging of trade receivables are no more than 180 days, and, as a
result, the credit risk associated with trade receivables from customers as at June 30, 2016 is considered to be immaterial. There were no
amounts in receivables which were past due at June 30, 2016 (at March 31, 2016 - $nil) for which no provision is recognized.
(f) Equity price risk
The Company holds certain marketable securities that will fluctuate in value as a result of trading on Canadian financial markets. As the
Company’s marketable securities holding are mainly in mining companies, the value will also fluctuate based on commodity prices. Based
upon the Company’s portfolio at June 30, 2016, a 10% increase (decrease) in the market price of the securities held, ignoring any foreign
currency effects would have resulted in an increase (decrease) to comprehensive income of approximately $0.3 million.
7.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
8.Transactions with Related Parties
Related party transactions not disclosed elsewhere in the consolidated financial statements are as follows:

interest bearing, and due on demand.
9.Alternative Performance (Non-IFRS) Measures
The following alternative performance measures are used by the Company to manage and evaluate operating performance of the Company’s
mines and are widely reported in the silver mining industry as benchmarks for performance, but do not have standardized meaning.
Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of
performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the following tables provides the
reconciliation of these measures to the financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015: (a) Cash and Total Cost per
Ounce of Silver The Company assesses this measure in a manner that isolates the impacts of silver production volumes, the by-product
credits, and operating costs fluctuations. The Company believes these measures provide investors and analysts with useful information about
the Company’s underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of by-product credits on the Company’s cost structure, operating
profitability and ability to generate cash flows. The Company includes by-product credits from lead, zinc and gold, as the Company considers
these metals are incidental to the silver production process and as a result, the cost to produce the silver is reduced. Cash and total costs on a
by-product basis are calculated by deducting by-product lead, zinc and gold sales revenues from the Company’s cash and total cost of sales,
respectively. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and total cost per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:

All-in sustaining cost (“AISC”) per ounce and all-in cost (“AIC”) per ounce of silver are non-IFRS measures calculated based on guidance
developed by the World Gold Council in an effort to provide a comparable standard within the precious metal industry. The measures do not
have standardized meaning and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance
to IFRS. These measures are used by the Company to manage and evaluate operating performance at each of the Company’s mining units
and consolidated group, and are widely reported in the silver mining industry as a benchmark for performance.
AISC is an extension of the “cash cost” metric and provides a comprehensive measure of the Company’s operating performance and ability to
generate cash flows. AISC is based on the Company’s cash production costs, net of by-product sales, and further include corporate general
and administrative expense, government fee and other taxes, reclamation cost accretion, and sustaining capital expenditures. The Company
believes that this measure represents the total sustainable costs of producing silver from current operations.
AIC further extends the AISC metric by including non-sustaining expenditures, mainly investment capital expenditures, which are deemed
expansionary in nature that result in an increase in asset life, expanded mineral resources and reserves, or higher capacity and productivity.
The following tables provide a detailed reconciliation of these measures for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:

(c) Average Production Cost
The Company assesses average production cost as the total production cost on a co-product basis. This is calculated by allocating the
Company’s total cost of sales to each co-product based on the ratio of actual sales volumes multiplied by realized sales prices. The following

10.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements. These critical accounting estimates represent management estimates that are
uncertain and any changes in these estimates could materially impact the Company’s financial statements. Management continuously
reviews its estimates and assumptions using the most current information available. The Company’s critical accounting policies and
estimates are described in Note 2 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and ended June 30, 2016, as well as
the audited consolidated financial statements as of and ended March 31, 2016.
(i) Ore reserve and mineral resource estimates
Ore reserves are estimates of the amount of ore that can be economically and legally extracted from the Company’s mining properties. The
Company estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by appropriately qualified persons relating to the
geological and technical data on the size, depth, shape and grade of the ore body and suitable production techniques and recovery rates.
Such an analysis requires complex engineering and geological judgements to interpret the data. The estimation of recoverable reserves is
based upon factors such as estimates of foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, future capital requirements, and production costs along
with engineering and geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and grade of the ore body.
The Company estimates ore reserves in accordance with National Instrument 43-101, “Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects”, issued
by the Canadian Securities Administrators. There are numerous assumptions including:
Future production estimates – which include proved and probable reserves, resource estimates and committed expansions;
Expected  future  commodity  prices,  based  on  current  market  price,  forward  prices  and  the  Company’s  assessment  of  the  long-term
average price; and
Future cash costs of production, capital expenditure and rehabilitation obligations.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Page 20
SILVERCORP METALS INC.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016
(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated)
As the economic assumptions used may change and as additional geological information is produced during the operation of a mine,
estimates of reserves may change. Such changes may impact the Company’s reported financial position and results which include:
The carrying value of mineral rights and properties and plant and equipment may be affected due to changes in estimated future cash
flows;
Depreciation  and  depletion  charges  in  net  income  may  change  where  such  charges  are  determined  using  the  units  of  production
method, or where the useful life of the related assets change; and
The  recognition  and  carrying  value  of  deferred  income  tax  assets  may  change  due  to  changes  in  the  judgements  regarding  the
existence of such assets and in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets.
(ii) Impairment of assets
Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair
value less costs to sell and value in use. These assessments require the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity
prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), discount rates, operating costs, future capital requirements,
closure and rehabilitation costs, exploration potential, reserves and operating performance (which includes production and sales volumes).
These estimates and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty. Therefore, there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will
impact these projections, which may impact the recoverable amount of assets and/or cash generating units. Fair value is determined as the
amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Fair
value for mineral assets is generally determined as the present value of estimated future cash flows arising from the continued use of the
asset, which includes estimates such as the cost of future expansion plans and eventual disposal, using assumptions that an independent
market participant may take into account. Cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
11.New Accounting Standards
IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers, the standard on revenue from contacts with customers was issued in September 2015 and
may be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 for public entities with early adoption permitted. Entities
have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt the guidance. The Company is assessing the
impact of this standard.
IAS 7 - Statement of Cash Flows has been revised to incorporate amendments issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
("IASB") in January 2016. The amendments require entities to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate
changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017
with early adoption permitted. The Company is assessing the impact of this standard.
IAS 12 - Income Taxes has been revised to incorporate amendments issued by the IASB in January 2016. The amendments clarify how to
account for deferred tax assets related to debt instruments measured at fair value. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning
on or after January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company is assessing the impact of this standard.
IFRS 16 - Leases was issued by the IASB and will replace Leases (“IAS 17”). IFRS 16 requires most leases to be reported on a company’s
balance sheet as assets and liabilities. IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 with early application
permitted for companies that also apply IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company is currently assessing the impact of
this new standard.

The Company is exposed to many risks in conducting its business, including but not limit to: metal price risk as the Company derives its
revenue from the sale of silver, lead, zinc, and gold; credit risk in the normal course of dealing with other companies and financial institutions;
foreign exchange risk as the Company reports its financial statements in USD whereas the Company operates in jurisdictions that utilize other
currencies; equity price risk and interest rate risk as the Company has investments in marketable securities that are traded in the open market
or earn interest at market rates that are fixed to maturity or at variable interest rates; inherent risk of uncertainties in estimating mineral
reserves and mineral resources; political risks; and environmental risk.
Management and the Board of Directors continuously assess risks that the Company is exposed to, and attempt to mitigate these risks where
practical through a range of risk management strategies.
These and other risks are described in the Company’s Annual Information Form and NI 43-101 technical

reports, which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com; Form 40-F; Audited Consolidated Financial Statements; and Management’s
Discussion and Analysis for the year ended March 31, 2016. Readers are encouraged to refer to these documents for a more detailed
description of some of the risks and uncertainties inherent to Silvercorp’s business.
Due to the recent decline in metal prices, readers are especially encouraged to understand the significant impact of metal prices on the
Company’s operations.
Metal Price Risk
The Company’s sales price for lead and zinc pounds is fixed against the Shanghai Metals Exchange, while gold ounces are fixed against the
Shanghai Gold Exchange and silver ounces are fixed against the Shanghai White Platinum & Silver Exchange. These metal prices
traditionally move in tandem with and at marginally higher prices than those quoted on the North American and European market places. The
Company’s revenues are expected to be in large part derived from the mining and sale of silver, lead, zinc, and gold contained in metal
concentrates. The prices of those commodities has fluctuated widely, particularly in recent years, and are affected by numerous factors
beyond the Company’s control including international and regional economic and political conditions, expectations of inflation; currency
exchange fluctuations; interest rates; global or regional supply and demand for jewellery and industrial products containing silver and other
metals; sale of silver and other metals by central banks and other holders, speculators and producers of silver and other metals; availability
and costs of metal substitutes; and increased production due to new mine developments and improved mining and production methods. The
price of base and precious metals may have a significant influence on the market price of the Company’s shares and the value of the
properties. The effect of these factors on the price of base and precious metals, and therefore the viability of the Company’s exploration
projects, cannot be accurately predicted.
If silver and other metals prices were to decline significantly or for an extended period of time, the Company may be unable to continue
operations, develop the properties or fulfil obligations under agreements with the Company’s joint venture partners or under its permits or
licenses.
15.Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information is gathered and reported to
senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate to allow for timely
decision about public disclosure.
Management, including the CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures as at June 30, 2016, as defined in the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Canadian Securities
Administration. The evaluation included documentation review, enquiries and other procedures considered by management to be appropriate
in the circumstances. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-
15(e) under Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in
annual filings, interim filings, and other reports we filed or submitted under United States and Canadian securities legislation was recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in those rules.
16.Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter that has materially affected or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
