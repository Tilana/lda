<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its nineteenth session 
from 28 April to 9 May 2014. The review of Ethiopia was held at the 13th, meeting on

</p>

that direction. </footnote>/19/ETH/1 and Corr.<footnote name="1">47. Afghanistan applauded Ethiopia&#8217;s initiatives for empowerment of women,

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Ethiopia said that Ethiopia had taken a transparent and 
participatory approach in the preparation of the national report. The process had been led by 
the National Interministerial Committee and had involved the participation of various 
stakeholders and the dissemination of information on the implementation of the 
recommendations accepted at the first review. 
</p>
<p>6. Ethiopia had established a solid constitutional framework for the promotion and 
protection of human rights, which embedded ratified international human rights 
instruments. It guaranteed the human rights of all Ethiopians and ensured implementation 
of the rights of  the nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia to self-determination, to 
the preservation of their language, culture and history, and to representation and self-
administration in the federal and regional states.  
</p>
<p>7. Ethiopia had made major strides in the promotion and protection of civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights. It had registered double digit growth over the previous 
10 years and had integrated the goal of achieving good governance, the rule of law and 
human rights in the ongoing five-year Growth and Transformation Plan. </p>


<p>8. Ethiopia had adopted the first National Human Rights Action Plan (NHRAP). A 
Ministerial Steering Committee had been established for the formulation and 
implementation of the Plan, with the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission monitoring and 
evaluating its implementation. Mechanisms had been put in place for the participation of 
civil society. 
</p>
<p>9. The Proclamation on Charities and Societies ensured the realization of the right to 
freedom of association and provided an environment conducive to the growth and 
development of charities and societies. The Proclamation ensured accountability through 
predictability and transparency. It had created favourable conditions for the establishment 
and growth of grass-roots advocacy, and humanitarian and developmental civil society 
groups that could  thrive and serve their members and society at large. 
</p>
<p>10. The Proclamation required civil society organizations to allot 70 per cent of their 
budget for programme activities and the remaining portion for overhead costs. Agreements 
had also been signed with foreign civil society groups and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs). 
11. Ethiopia had zero tolerance for torture and inhuman, degrading or other cruel 
treatment,, which were prohibited by the Constitution. Measures, including the Prison 
Administration Proclamation, were in place to protect the rights of persons deprived of their 
liberty.  
</p>
<p>12. The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission monitored prison conditions and had 
provided capacity-building training to police and prison officers. Legal and policy measures 
had been taken on the rights of persons to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. 
Religious groups had established an interreligious council to maintain and advance 
interreligious tolerance. 
</p>
<p>13. Ethiopia recognized the imperatives of respecting human rights while countering 
terrorism. Proclamations, consistent with international human rights obligations, had been 
promulgated on anti-terrorism and anti-money-laundering and the financing of terrorism. 
The Anti-Terrorism Proclamation would not be used to silence opposition. 
</p>
<p>14. Freedom of expression continued to thrive. Ethiopians freely advocated their views 
either in support of or in criticism of government policies and measures. The Freedom of 
Mass Media and Access to Information Proclamation had been implemented in accordance 
with relevant constitutional guarantees. A national task force, spearheaded by the institution 
of the Ombudsman, had been established to oversee the effective implementation of access 
to information provisions of the Proclamation.  
</p>
<p>15. The delegation reported on the various measures taken to improve the welfare of 
children and the measures taken to promote and protect the rights of women and ensure 
their equal participation in political affairs, economic and social empowerment, ownership 
of property, inheritance of and rights over resources, as well as to combat harmful 
traditional practices, including female genital mutilation (FGM), and child, early and forced 
marriage. 
</p>
<p>16. Ethiopia was committed to implementing effectively the laws and policy 
frameworks for promoting the human rights of persons with disabilities by integrating 
disability as a cross-cutting sector of development. 
</p>
<p>17. Ethiopia had also initiated the process of ratification of the International Convention 
on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families 
(ICRMW) and had been working with host countries to advance the rights and interests of 
Ethiopian nationals abroad. It had intensified its efforts for the protection of the rights of 
migrants, with a special emphasis on migrant women and children. A national task force, 
chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, had been established for that purpose.  </p>


<p>18. Ethiopia maintained an open door policy towards refugees and was hosting over half 
a million of them. It worked closely with the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other United Nations agencies to provide 
protection and assistance to the refugees and mitigate the effects of hosting a large refugee 
population on the local host communities and the environment. 
</p>
<p>19. Ethiopia was determined to ensure that the fifth national election, to be held in May 
2015, would be free, fair and credible. The National Electoral Board and the judiciary had 
developed innovative systems for handling grievances and complaints during elections. 
</p>
<p>20. Ethiopia pursued a rights-based approach to development, with the objective of 
reducing poverty. Per capita income had increased and the proportion of the population 
living below the poverty line and the food poverty index had declined significantly. 
</p>
<p>21. Rapid economic growth had also enabled Ethiopia to undertake massive public 
investments in the social and infrastructure sectors. Investments in the construction of new 
health facilities and the upgrading of existing ones, and in strengthening the implementation 
of the health extension programme had brought about significant improvements in the 
health and well-being of the people. During 2012/2013, primary health service coverage 
had reached 93 per cent, while significant progress had been made in improving maternal 
and child health. Ethiopia had already achieved the Millennium Development Goal target of 
reducing child mortality by two thirds well before the 2015 deadline. 
</p>
<p>22. Massive investments had been made in the expansion of primary, secondary and 
tertiary education. Primary education was free for all citizens. The primary gross enrolment 
rate had increased to 95.<footnote name="4">3. Canada asked what progress Ethiopia had made to provide for free and independent 
media and to uphold civil and political rights. 
</footnote> per cent, and over 17.3 million children had been enrolled in 
primary schools in 2012/13. That progress had brought Ethiopia closer to achieving the 
Millennium Development Goal target of universal access to primary education. The gender 
parity index in primary schools as approximated by the ratio of girls to boys had reached 
0.<footnote name="9">8. Ethiopia was also committed to improving the rights and welfare of children and 
was taking steps to eliminate corporal punishment in family settings, which was prohibited 
under the Constitution. </footnote>4:<footnote name="1">46. Zimbabwe noted Ethiopia&#8217;s commitment to economic, social and cultural rights 
evidenced by the adoption of programmes to ensure food security, potable water supply, 
education and health care.  
</footnote> in 2012/13. 
</p>
<p>23. Ethiopia had invested massively in road maintenance and construction, in potable 
water supply and in energy and irrigation schemes, which demonstrated the positive impact 
of the economic growth on improving the non-income dimension of its citizens&#8217; welfare. In 
line with its focus on eradicating poverty, the Government had allocated a higher share of 
its budget to pro-poor sectors.
