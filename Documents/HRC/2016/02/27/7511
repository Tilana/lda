<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its nineteenth session 
from 28 April 7 to 9 May 2014. The review of Costa Rica was held at the 11th meeting, on 
5 May 2014. The delegation of Costa Rica was headed by Gioconda Ubeda Rivera, Deputy 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Worship. At its 17th meeting, held on 8 May 2014, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Costa Rica. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Costa Rica: Argentina, Botswana and Viet 
Nam.  
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Costa 
Rica: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/19/CRI/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/19/CRI/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/19/CRI/3).  
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Germany, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to Costa Rica through the troika. The questions are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). A summary of additional 
questions posed during the interactive dialogue by Angola, Canada, France, Ghana, 
Hungary, Iceland and Italy can be found in section I. B below. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Costa Rica indicated that it was a great responsibility to report on its compliance 
with and implementation of its international human rights obligations. In its second national 
report, Costa Rica had provided information on the follow-up to the recommendations 
received in 2009. In 2010, it had presented an additional document with its position on the 
recommendations, and in 2012 it had presented a midterm report on progress made and on 
specific compliance with some of the recommendations.  
</p>
<p>6. In preparing the second national report, 21 institutions from the executive branch, 
which together formed the Inter-Institutional Committee on Follow-Up to and Compliance 
with International Human Rights Obligations (CIIDDHH), had been involved. The judicial 
branch, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Supreme Electoral Court and the Legislative 
Assembly had also participated as observers. CIIDDHH had now been institutionalized as a 
mechanism for consultation and dialogue, through an executive decree, and with a 
permanent consultative body for civil society. 
</p>
<p>7. Costa Rica was pleased to report that, since the previous review, it had ratified the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance </p>


<p>(CPED), the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural 
Expressions of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO), International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 189 (2011) 
concerning decent work for domestic workers and the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. It had also signed the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-
ICESCR), which the delegation hoped would soon be approved by the Legislative 
Assembly. 
</p>
<p>8. Costa Rica was a middle-income country that, since 1949, had consistently invested 
in education. In 2011, Costa Rica had achieved a literacy rate of 97.6 per cent. The country 
had also a programme of cash transfer which was conditional on students remaining in the 
formal education system. Costa Rica hoped to increase the income of poor families, thus 
paving the way for access to education and ensuring universal secondary education. That 
would also be a step towards reducing poverty, combating the school dropout rate, 
addressing examination failure and tackling child labour.  
</p>
<p>9. Costa Rica had an internationally recognized quality universal health system, which 
was reflected in the average life expectancy of 79.3 years and in the low rate of child 
mortality. In 2011, 97.5 per cent of the population had their own water supply and nine out 
of ten persons had drinking water. The right to water had been recognized by the 
Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice and in March 2014, a new law on 
water resources had been approved on first reading.  
</p>
<p>10. Despite the aforementioned progress, Costa Rica faced challenges stemming from 
the structural situation which was reflected in the levels of social inequality and inequity, as 
well as the increasing level of organized crime in the region. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation reported on a number of important mechanisms that had been 
established or strengthened, and legislation, policies and programmes that had been adopted 
for the care and protection of the most vulnerable population groups, thereby promoting 
social inclusion. 
</p>
<p>12. The rights of children and adolescents had been seriously affected by increase in 
sexual exploitation, sexual abuse and adolescent pregnancy, in particular when they were 
linked to abusive relations with adults. The lead body in that area, the Patronato Nacional 
de la Infancia (National Child Agency), conducted policies, programmes and projects for 
the comprehensive protection of minors and their families, in coordination with other 
institutions and non-governmental organizations. Nevertheless, it was important to continue 
strengthening those programmes. 
</p>
<p>13. Costa Rica was also working to mainstream a gender perspective in all areas and had 
carried out a number of initiatives in State bodies to build a society based on the principle 
of gender equality.  
</p>
<p>14. With regard to specific population groups, the State had had to take targeted 
measures for indigenous peoples, persons of African descent, migrants and refugees. As 
part of the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and 
Related Intolerance held in Durban, and following the 2009 Durban Review Conference, 
Costa Rica had been pleased to announce that it had adopted a National Policy for a society 
free from racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia and a related Action Plan for 2014&#8211;
</p><p>2019. There was currently also a proposal for a reform of the Constitution which would 
declare Costa Rica to be a multi-ethnic and pluricultural nation. 
</p>
<p>15. Costa Rica had a strong judicial system which granted rights to persons regardless of 
their nationality, and which was strengthened through numerous rulings of the 
Constitutional Chamber, guaranteeing the effectiveness of the standards related to the </p>


<p>migrant population. Furthermore, over the previous four years, Costa Rica had been 
developing a new Migration Act and a comprehensive migration policy with a human rights 
perspective in order to achieve the integration of the migrant population in society. As a 
result, the conditions of migrants in Costa Rica had significantly improved between 2000 
and 2011. 
</p>
<p>16. Regarding the refugee population, Costa Rica had a long humanitarian tradition and 
long-standing experience in the integration of refugees. The Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) collaborated closely with Costa Rica. 
</p><p>17. Costa Rica had also been discussing ways to guarantee the rights of the lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) population. Activities were being carried out 
and initiatives were being developed in which civil society had played a fundamental role. 
</p>
<p>18. Another area in which the role of civil society had been important was the 
promotion and protection of the rights of persons with disabilities. Following the first UPR 
cycle, Costa Rica had promulgated a series of executive decrees which sought to improve 
the living conditions of persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>19. The delegation briefly referred to the national institutions which guaranteed 
compliance with international human rights standards in Costa Rica. Reference was made 
to the existence, since 1989, of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court and of the 
Office of the Ombudsman, which had been created in 1992, and had been accredited with A 
status by the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. The delegation also reported that, in 
compliance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT), in 2014, Costa Rica had 
adopted a law to create the National Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture, which would 
contribute to reducing overcrowding in prisons and improving living conditions for 
detainees. The new preventive mechanism was administratively assigned to the Office of 
the Ombudsman, but was financially and operationally independent, which guaranteed that 
it would function without any interference. Reference was also made to the National 
Coalition against Illicit Smuggling of Migrants and Trafficking in Persons, which was made 
up of 21 public institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>20. During the interactive dialogue, 89 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue can be found in section II below. All written statements of the 
delegations, to be checked against delivery on the United Nations Webcast archives,1 are 
posted on the extranet of the Human Rights Council when available.2

prison conditions and combat child labour, but remained concerned about the exploitation 
of children, the prevalence of violence against women and trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>22. Uruguay recalled that Costa Rica was a stable and consolidated democracy. It 
acknowledged progress in addressing migration issues and noted the reduction in the use of 
administrative detention.

</p>
<p>51. Cuba recognized progress in the areas of equality and non-discrimination. 
Challenges remained, such as inequality and inequity, which enabled the presence of 
criminal organizations in society, increasing the drug market and trafficking in and 
exploitation of persons. 
</p>
<p>52. The Democratic Republic of the Congo welcomed the establishment of CIIDDHH 
and the permanent body for consultations with civil society. It asked for further information 
regarding the integration of migrants and persons of African descent. 
</p>
<p>53. Ecuador recognized efforts to comply with recommendations from the first review. 
However, it expressed concern about the situation of migrant workers.  
</p>
<p>54. Egypt commended the delegation for the informative and comprehensive report. 
Egypt believed that Costa Rica had been a responsible member of the Human Rights

<p>55. El Salvador commended Costa Rica for the progress made since the last review, 
which had allowed the country to undertake an internal assessment of the situation 
nationwide.  
</p>
<p>56. Estonia welcomed progress made in the fields of gender equality and the rights of

</p>
<p>59. Germany welcomed the adoption of a rights-based National Policy for Children and

at the local level, as well as prison overcrowding. 
</p>
<p>60. Regarding ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW), Costa Rica 
indicated that it had previously believed that the existing laws, complemented by a 
resolution of the Constitutional Chamber, provided for the full protection of migrant 
workers and their families. However, the issue would be taken up again with greater 
impetus; Costa Rica therefore appreciated the recommendations that had been made in that 
regard. 
</p>
<p>61. Responding to comments made by Ecuador, Costa Rica indicated that it would not 
be able to accept recommendations or statements that were not based on reality. It was 
possible that there had been isolated cases of discrimination against migrant workers, which 
happened in every country, but it would not accept that there were no xenophobic policies 
in place and no systemic xenophobic actions taken. 
</p>
<p>62. In line with the voluntary commitments undertaken by Costa Rica during the last 
review, and under the framework of the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held in Durban, Costa Rica had 
adopted the National Policy for a society free from racism, racial discrimination and 
xenophobia, which aimed for an inclusive and more respectful society that embraced 
sociocultural and ethnic diversity. The Policy was the result of a joint process involving the 
State and civil society, based on the principle of &#8220;nothing about us without us&#8221; and 
targeting persons of African descent, indigenous or native peoples, migrants and refugees. 
The process had taken place under the framework of CIIDDHH and supported by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>63. Costa Rica recognized that it faced challenges regarding indigenous peoples. The 
existence of a favourable judicial framework was insufficient to ensure full protection of 
the rights of communities if it was not accompanied by State policies and actions which 
sought the effective application of and compliance with the standards to which the State 
itself had committed. Costa Rica shared information about a recent positive experience with 
indigenous communities in the south.  
</p>
<p>64. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples and the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination had made various comments and 
recommendations to Costa Rica relating to the situation of indigenous peoples, particularly 
since 2011. Those recommendations echoed the concerns and claims of the indigenous </p>


<p>peoples and coincided significantly with the efforts that the State was undertaking to 
address their situation. 
</p>
<p>65. Ghana welcomed the measures taken to improve care and respect for the elderly and 
improve access to water and sanitation by all. It asked about the impact of such measures. 
</p>
<p>66. Guatemala commended Costa Rica for progress made, particularly in addressing 
domestic violence. It shared the opinion of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the Rights of the Child on the 
importance of ratifying ICRMW.  
</p>
<p>67. Honduras commended Costa Rica for the national report. It appreciated the progress 
made since the previous review, in particular with regard to addressing the issue of 
migration. 
</p>
<p>68. Hungary took note of the ratification of CPED, the National Commission on the 
Improved Administration of Justice and the Access to Justice Commission. It asked about 
the impact of established bodies on the implementation of the Brasilia Regulations 
Regarding Access to Justice for Vulnerable People. 
</p>
<p>69. Iceland encouraged Costa Rica to strengthen efforts to combat trafficking in persons. 
It was concerned about the inadequate protection of the right to sexual and reproductive 
health. It raised questions on the implementation of programmes ensuring child protection 
and on measures to eliminate discrimination against LGBT persons. 
</p>
<p>70. India welcomed measures to promote inclusive social practices and respect for 
diversity, including the National Policy for a society free from racism, racial discrimination, 
and xenophobia. It expressed concern about the rights of indigenous peoples and 
acknowledged challenges that resulted from rising poverty and economic disparities. 
</p>
<p>71. Indonesia commended Costa Rica for prioritizing efforts to combat trafficking in 
persons. It appreciated various measures and policies for the promotion and protection of 
migrants, including the enactment of legislation.  
</p>
<p>72. Iraq commended Costa Rica for its accession to a number of international human 
rights instruments, including CPED, and the adoption of several laws, such as the 
Trafficking in Persons Act and the law prohibiting corporal punishment of children and 
adolescents. 
</p>
<p>73. Ireland commended the establishment of CIIDDHH and the Permanent Body for 
Consultation with Civil Society. It welcomed efforts to combat human trafficking, racism 
and racial discrimination. It noted, however, that concerns had been expressed about 
ongoing discrimination against the indigenous population.  
</p>
<p>74. Iran (Islamic Republic of) noted that there was no mechanism for the participation of 
indigenous peoples in decision-making regarding their well-being and development. It also 
noted that discrimination and violence against women and children continued.  
</p>
<p>75. Italy appreciated the establishment of CIIDDHH and measures to combat violence 
against women. It asked whether Costa Rica planned to include education on indigenous 
cultures in the national school curriculum.  
</p>
<p>76. Japan appreciated the ratification of CPED, the enhancement of the national justice 
system, the establishment of CIIDDHH and efforts to protect vulnerable groups, including 
children.  
</p>
<p>77. Libya commended efforts made to promote and protect human rights through the 
ratification of a number of international human rights instruments. It appreciated the 
adoption of a policy on the elderly and the establishment of institutions to combat 
trafficking. </p>


<p>78. Liechtenstein welcomed progress in addressing violence against women. It noted 
with concern reports regarding mistreatment of children by teachers, as well as by police 
officers in detention and incidents of intrafamily and sexual violence. It urged Costa Rica to 
ratify the Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>79. Malaysia acknowledged the efforts of Costa Rica to advance women&#8217;s rights, 
address violence against children and adolescents and combat trafficking in persons. It 
commended the establishment of the High Level Commission to monitor compliance with 
the Violence against Women Act. 
</p>
<p>80. Maldives applauded the establishment of CIIDDHH, the adoption of important 
legislation and the commitment of Costa Rica to environmental rights as a human rights 
obligation.  
</p>
<p>81. Mauritania noted the commitment and cooperation of Costa Rica with United 
Nations mechanisms through the ratification of and accession to different instruments. It 
commended measures to guarantee the rights of vulnerable groups, particularly women and 
children. 
</p>
<p>82. Mexico recognized efforts made to protect refugees and asylum seekers. It 
appreciated cooperation with human rights mechanisms that had visited the country. It 
hoped that Costa Rica would soon submit its overdue reports to treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>83. Costa Rica had implemented a series of initiatives to build a society based on the 
principle of gender equality. One example was the establishment of the 2007&#8211;2017 national 
policy, which had the support of women&#8217;s organizations and other sectors of civil society. 
Costa Rica had also developed gender equality policies in several national institutions and 
provided training on gender sensitivity. Steps were being taken to combat gender 
stereotypes through the media. In accordance with the recommendation in paragraph 91.2 
of the previous report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic (A/HRC/13/15), the 
National Women&#8217;s Institute (INAMU) had disseminated a first report on the situation of 
women&#8217;s rights in 2011. 
</p>
<p>84. In response to concerns raised by some delegations on the issue of violence against 
women, the delegation said that Costa Rica had established a High Level Commission to 
monitor compliance with the Violence against Women Act and a comprehensive care 
system for victims. In addition, abuse and assault against women had been criminalized in 
2011, an internal register of perpetrators had been created, the initial period of protection 
measures had been increased to one year, access to justice for victims had been 
strengthened and the criminal authorities had been authorized to apply measures in the 
absence of specialized domestic violence courts. In 2013, an emergency plan had also been 
drawn up to reduce gender-related murders of women. 
</p>
<p>85. In response to concerns raised by some delegations, Costa Rica indicated that the 
protection and promotion of the human rights of children were a fundamental pillar of State 
action. The National Policy for Children and Adolescents 2009&#8211;2021 set the strategic focus 
of the State to promote, protect and ensure the human rights of all children.  
</p>
<p>86. Costa Rica had also established a national strategic framework entitled &#8220;Road map 
to make Costa Rica a country free of the worst forms of child labor&#8221;, which promoted 
coordination among initiatives that had a direct or indirect impact on the prevention and 
eradication of child labour. 
</p>
<p>87. The rights of LGBTI persons was a challenging area for Costa Rica. There had been 
increased interest in the debate on the recognition of the rights arising from same-sex 
unions. Concerning the recommendation made by Spain relating to the right of transsexual 
persons to identify themselves in keeping with their gender identity (A/HRC/13/15, para. 
91.4), Costa Rica noted that in 2010, the Supreme Electoral Court had issued a decree </p>


<p>providing that everyone had the right to enjoy respect for their image and sexual identity 
when a photograph was taken for their identity card. Costa Rica acknowledged that 
changing cultural attitudes was a challenge. A protocol on harassment, bullying and 
cyberbullying in secondary schools had also been prepared.  
</p>
<p>88. Costa Rica indicated that a subsystem of indigenous education had been established 
by the Ministry of Public Education. With the support of the World Bank, Costa Rica had 
invested in infrastructure in indigenous territories and had prepared an educational 
programme. 
</p>
<p>89. Administrative actions had been taken to address prison overcrowding. Some 
detainees had been allowed to complete their sentences using non-custodial measures and 
efforts had been made to improve conditions in some prisons. The State recognized that 
there were still significant improvements to be made. 
</p>
<p>90. In order to address trafficking in persons, the Act on Trafficking and Related 
Activities had been promulgated, establishing the National Coalition against Illicit 
Smuggling of Migrants and Trafficking in Persons. The Act provided for increased
