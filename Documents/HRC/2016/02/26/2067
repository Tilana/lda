<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, and reaffirming the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural

and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> its resolutions 7/23 of 28 March 2008, 10/4 of 25 March 2009 and 18/22 
of 30 September 2011, on human rights and climate change, and 16/11 of 24 March 2011 
and 19/10 of 22 March 2012, on human rights and the environment,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 
objectives and principles therein, and emphasizing that parties should, in all climate 
change-related actions, fully respect human rights,1 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the holding of the recent conferences of the Parties to the Framework 
Convention, including the seventeenth session of the Conference, held in November 2011, 
in Durban, , and the eighteenth session, held in November 2012, in Doha, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming also</i> the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on 
Sustainable Development, held in June 2012, in Rio de Janeiro,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the commitment to enable the full, effective and sustained 
implementation of the Framework Convention through long-term cooperative action in 
order to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. 
 
</p>

<p><i>Recalling </i>the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human 
Environment, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Agenda 21, the 
Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21, the Johannesburg Declaration on 
Sustainable Development and the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on 
Sustainable Development,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable 
development, that the right to development must be fulfilled in order to meet the 
development and environmental needs of present and future generations equitably, and that 
the human person is the central subject of development and should be an active participant 
in and the beneficiary of the right to development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also</i> the challenges of climate change to development and to the 
progress made towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, in 
particular with regard to the goals on the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, on 
environmental sustainability and on health and nutritional well-being, especially in 
developing countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> that, as stated in the Framework Convention, the global nature of 
climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their 
participation in an effective and appropriate international response, in accordance with their 
common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and their social and 
economic conditions, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging also</i> that, as stated in the Framework Convention, responses to 
climate change should be coordinated with social and economic development in an 
integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse effects on the latter, taking into full 
account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for the achievement of 
sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights,2 the panel 
discussion on the relationship between climate change and human rights, held on 15 June 
2009, at the eleventh session of the Human Rights Council, and the 2010 Social Forum, 
which focused on the relationship between climate change and human rights,  
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that the adverse effects of climate change have a range of implications, 
both direct and indirect, for the effective enjoyment of human rights, including, inter alia, 
the right to life, the right to adequate food, the right to the highest attainable standard of 
health, the right to adequate housing, the right to self-determination, the right to 
development and the right to safe drinking water and sanitation, and recalling that in no 
case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing concern</i> that, while these implications affect individuals and 
communities around the world, the adverse effects of climate change will be felt most 
acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable situations owing 
to factors such as geography, poverty, gender, age, indigenous or minority status and 
disability, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with concern</i> that people in developing countries are among the most 
vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change on the full and effective enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>all human rights, particularly those in least developed countries, small island developing 
States, and in African countries that have contributed the least to global greenhouse gas 
emissions, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution, and 
that effective international cooperation to enable the full, effective and sustained 
implementation of the Framework Convention in accordance with the provisions and 
principles of the Convention is important in order to support national efforts for the 
realization of human rights implicated by climate change-related effects,  
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that, as stated in  the Framework Convention, the specific needs and special 
circumstances of developing country parties, especially those that are particularly 
vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, and of those parties, especially 
developing country parties that would have to bear a disproportionate or abnormal burden 
under the Convention, should be given full consideration, and further reaffirming the 
responsibility of countries to respect their human rights obligations; 
</p>
<p><i>Noting also</i> that, as stated in the Rio Declaration, States should cooperate to 
strengthen capacity-building for sustainable development by improving scientific 
understanding through exchange of scientific and technological knowledge, and by 
enhancing the development, adaptation, diffusion and transfer of technologies, including 
new innovative technologies, 
</p>
<p> <i>Affirming</i> that human rights obligations, standards and principles have the potential 
to inform and strengthen international and national policymaking in the area of climate 
change, promoting policy coherence, legitimacy and sustainable outcomes, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the establishment of the Climate Vulnerable Forum and the launching in 
2012 in New York of the second edition of <i>Climate Vulnerability Monitor</i>, which may 
become a useful tool to orient public policies and identify gaps in the promotion and 
protection of all human rights from the adverse effects of climate change, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reiterates</i> its concern that the adverse effects of climate change have a range 
of direct and indirect implications for the effective enjoyment of human rights and that the 
effects of climate change will be felt most acutely by those segments of population and 
communities around the world that are already in vulnerable situations owing to geography, 
poverty, gender, age, indigenous or minority status or disability; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Welcomes</i> the convening by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights of the seminar, held on 23 and 24 February 2012, on

takes note of its summary report;<footnote name="3">A/HRC/20/7. </footnote> 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses</i> <i>concern</i> that climate change has contributed to the increase of both 
sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse 
effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Takes note</i> of the adverse impact of climate change, particularly on women, 
bearing in mind the different effects of climate change on men, women, boys and girls; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Emphasizes</i> the urgent need to continue to address the adverse consequences 
of climate change for all, particularly on the situation of those segments of society most 
vulnerable to climate change, especially those in situations of extreme poverty and 
deteriorating livelihood conditions, as related to human rights obligations of States; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p> 6. <i>Stresses</i> <i>the importance</i> of fostering dialogue and cooperation between 
relevant international organizations and stakeholders to develop the analysis of the linkages 
between human rights and climate change; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Calls on</i> all States to continue to enhance international cooperation in relation 
to the adverse impact of climate change on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly in 
least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, including 
through dialogue and measures, such as implementation of practical steps to promote and 
facilitate capacity-building, financial resources and technology transfer in accordance with 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Decides</i> to convene, at its twenty-sixth regular session, from within existing 
resources, a full-day discussion on specific themes related to human rights and climate 
change on the basis of the different elements contained in the present resolution, including 
the identification of challenges to the realization of all human rights for all, including the 
right to development, as well as measures and best practices that can be adopted by States; 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To follow up on the importance for States to promote and protect human 
rights in all climate change-related actions and policies, and to forge stronger interface and 
cooperation between the human rights and climate change communities; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To invite special procedures mandate holders, within their respective 
mandates, and other relevant stakeholders, including academic experts and civil society 
organizations, to participate actively in the full-day discussion to consider, inter alia, the 
adverse effects of climate change, particularly on those segments of the population that are 
most vulnerable to climate change owing to factors such as those referred to in paragraph 1 
above, and the human rights challenges faced by all countries, particularly least developed 
countries, small island developing States and African countries, in relation to climate 
change; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to submit to the Human Rights Council, at its twenty-sixth session, following the 
full-day discussion, a summary report, including any recommendation stemming therefrom, 
for consideration of further follow-up action;
