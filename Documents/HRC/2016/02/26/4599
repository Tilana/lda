<p><b>  Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council</b>*<b>

<p><b>  15/13 
Human rights and international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights 
and the Council on the issue of the human rights and international solidarity, including 
Commission resolution 2005/55 of 20 April 2005 and Council resolutions 6/3 of 27 
September 2007, 7/5 of 27 March 2008, 9/2 of 24 September 2008 and 12/9 of 1 October 
2009, and taking note of the reports submitted by the independent expert on human rights 
and international solidarity, in particular his latest report,1 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> the fact that the processes of promoting and protecting human rights 
should be conducted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the 
United Nations and international law, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that, at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in June 1993, States 
pledged to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
development, and stressed that the international community should promote effective 
international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination 
of obstacles to development, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the fact that article 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development 
states that sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of developing 
countries and, as a complement to the efforts of developing countries, effective 
international cooperation is essential in order to provide these countries with the 
appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development, 
</p>
<p>  
 * The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its fifteenth session (A/HRC/15/60), chap. I. 
 1 A/HRC/15/32. 
</p>

<p><i> Taking into account </i>the fact that article 2 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights states that each State party to the Covenant 
undertakes to take steps, individually and through international assistance and cooperation, 
especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view 
to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant by 
all appropriate means, including, in particular, the adoption of legislative measures, 
</p>
<p><i> Persuaded </i>that sustainable development can be promoted by peaceful coexistence, 
friendly relations and cooperation among States with different social, economic or political 
systems, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the fact that the widening gap between the economically developed and 
developing countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights in 
the international community, and makes it all the more imperative for every nation, 
according to its capacities, to make the maximum possible effort to close this gap, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern </i>at the fact that the immense benefits resulting from the 
process of globalization and economic interdependence have not reached all countries, 
communities and individuals, and at the increasing marginalization from their benefits of 
several countries, particularly least developed and African countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its deep concern </i>at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases 
and agricultural pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in a 
massive loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental 
consequences for vulnerable societies throughout the world, in particular in developing 
countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the crucial importance of increasing the resources allocated for official 
development assistance, recalling the pledge of industrialized countries to allocate 0.7 per 
cent of their gross national product for official development assistance, and recognizing the 
need for new and additional resources to finance the development programmes of 
developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>that the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and 
the realization of the right to development call for a more enlightened approach, mindset 
and action based on a sense of community and international solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i> Determined </i>to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international 
community with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours by an 
increased and sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i> Asserting </i>the necessity of establishing new, equitable and global links of partnership 
and intra-generational solidarity for the perpetuation of humankind, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as a 
vital component of the efforts made by developing countries to realize the right to 
development of their peoples and to promote the full enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights by everyone has been insufficient, 
</p>
<p><i> Resolved </i>to strive to ensure that present generations are fully aware of their 
responsibilities towards future ones, and that a better world is possible for both present and 
future generations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms </i>the recognition set forth in the declaration adopted by the Heads of 
State and Government at the Millennium Summit of the fundamental value of solidarity to 
international relations in the twenty-first century, in stating that global challenges must be 
managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with basic 
principles of equity and social justice, and that those who suffer, or who benefit least, 
deserve help from those who benefit most; </p>


<p> 2. <i>Affirms</i> that international solidarity is not limited to international assistance 
and cooperation, aid, charity or humanitarian assistance; it is a broader concept and 
principle that includes sustainability in international relations, especially international 
economic relations, the peaceful coexistence of all members of the international 
community, equal partnerships and the equitable sharing of benefits and burdens; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses its determination </i>to contribute to the solution of current world 
problems through increased international cooperation, to create conditions that will ensure 
that the needs and interests of future generations are not jeopardized by the burden of the 
past, and to hand over a better world to future generations; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges </i>the international community to consider urgently concrete measures to 
promote and consolidate international assistance to developing countries in their 
development endeavours and for the promotion of conditions conducive to the full 
realization of all human rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon </i>the international community to promote international solidarity 
and cooperation as an important tool to help to overcome the negative effects of the current 
economic, financial and climate crises, particularly in developing countries; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Reaffirms </i>that the promotion of international cooperation is a duty for States, 
that it should be implemented without any conditionality and on the basis of mutual respect, 
in full compliance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, in 
particular respect for the sovereignty of States, and taking into account national priorities; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Affirms</i> that much more is needed, owing to the magnitude of global and local 
challenges, the alarming increase in natural and man-made disasters, and the continuing 
rises in poverty and inequality; ideally, solidarity should be preventive rather than simply 
reactive to massive irreversible damage already caused, and must address both natural and 
man-made disasters; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Recognizes</i> that there is an overwhelming manifestation of solidarity by 
States, individually and collectively, civil society, global social movements, and countless 
people of goodwill reaching out to others; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also recognizes </i>that the so-called &#8220;third-generation rights&#8221; closely 
interrelated to the fundamental value of solidarity need further progressive development 
within the United Nations human rights machinery in order to be able to respond to the 
increasing challenges of international cooperation in this field; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests </i>all States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations to mainstream the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity in their activities, and to cooperate with the 
independent expert on human rights and international solidarity in his mandate, to supply 
all necessary information requested by him and to give serious consideration to responding 
favourably to his requests to visit their country, to enable him to fulfil his mandate 
effectively; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Welcomes</i> the steps taken by the independent expert to identify the primary 
areas to be addressed, the main concepts and norms that can form the basis of a framework, 
and good practices to inform the future development of law and policy with regard to 
human rights and international solidarity; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Requests </i>the independent expert to continue his work in the preparation of a 
draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity, and in 
further developing guidelines, standards, norms and principles with a view to promoting 
and protecting this right, by addressing, inter alia, existing and emerging obstacles to its 
realization; </p>


<p> 13. <i>Also requests </i>the independent expert to take into account the outcomes of all 
major United Nations and other global summits and ministerial meetings in the economic, 
social and climate fields and to seek views and contributions from Governments, United 
Nations agencies, other relevant international organizations and non-governmental 
organizations in the discharge of his mandate; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Reiterates its requests </i>to the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to 
prepare, in close cooperation with the independent expert, inputs to contribute to the 
elaboration of the draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to international 
solidarity, and to the further development of guidelines, standards, norms and principles 
with a view to promoting and protecting this right; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Requests </i>the independent expert to submit a report on the implementation of 
the present resolution to the Council at its eighteenth session; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Decides </i>to continue its examination of this issue at its eighteenth session 
under the same agenda item.
