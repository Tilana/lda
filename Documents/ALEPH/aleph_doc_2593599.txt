Exhibit 99.2
Corporate Presentation August 2016
Legal Disclaimers Forward Looking Statements This presentation contains, and our officers and
representatives may from time to time make, “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements,
other than statements of historical facts, included in this presentation that address activities,
events, conditions or developments that Sanchez Energy Corporation (“Sancez Energy”, or the
“Company”) expects, estimates, believes or anticipates will or may occur or exist in the future are
forward-looking statements. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by the
company based on management’s experience, perception of historical trends and technical
analyses, current conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors believed to be
appropriate and reasonable by management. When used in this presentation, words such as
“will,” “potential,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “anticipate,” “could,”
“plan,” “predict,” “project,” “profile,” “model,” “strategy,” “future” or their negatives or the statements
that include these words or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes,
are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements
contain such identifying words. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning
Sanchez Energy’s future operating results and returns, Sanchez Energy’s strategy and plans or
view of the market, or Sanchez Energy’s ability to replace or increase reserves, increase
production, generate income or cash flows are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of performance. Such statements are subject to a number of
assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Although Sanchez
Energy believes that the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable
and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions
are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to
have been correct. Important factors that could cause Sanchez Energy’s actual results to differ
materially from the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements include, among
others: Sanchez Energy’s ability to successfully execute its business and financial strategies;
the timing and extent of changes in prices for, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, natural
gas liquids, natural gas and related commodities; Sanchez Energy’s ability to utilize the services
personnel and other assets of Sanchez Oil and Gas pursuant to existing services agreement;
Sanchez Energy’s ability to replace the reserves it produces through drilling and property
acquisitions; the realized benefits of Sanchez Energy’s various acquisitions and the liabilities
assumed in connection with these acquisitions; the realized benefits of Sanchez Energy’s
ventures, including with respect to our joint ventures with Targa Resources Corp.; the realized
benefits of Sanchez Energy’s transactions with Sanchez Production Partners LP, including with
respect to the Palmetto escalating working interest sale, divestiture of Western Catarina
midstream assets and the Carnero Gathering transaction; the extent to which Sanchez Energy’s
drilling plans are successful in economically developing its acreage in, and to produce reserves
and achieve anticipated production levels from, its existing and future projects; the accuracy of
reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may
therefore be imprecise; the extent to which Sanchez Energy can optimize reserve recovery and
economically develop its plays utilizing horizontal and vertical drilling, advanced completion
technologies and hydraulic fracturing; Sanchez Energy’s ability to successfully execute its
hedging strategy and the resulting realized prices therefrom; The credit worthiness and
performance of our counterparts including financial institutions, operating partners and other
parties; competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for employees and
other personnel, equipment, materials and services and, related thereto, the availability and cost
of employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services; Sanchez Energy’s ability
to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at
all, and to otherwise satisfy its capital expenditure requirements; the availability, proximity and
capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation
facilities; Sanchez Energy’s ability to compete with other companies in the oil and natural gas
industry; the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including tax
laws and regulations, environmental laws and regulations relating to air emissions, waste
disposal, hydraulic fracturing and access to and use of water, laws and regulations imposing
conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations and laws and regulations with
respect to derivatives and hedging activities; developments in oil-producing and natural-gas
producing countries, the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other
factors affecting the supply of oil and natural gas; Sanchez Energy’s ability to effectively
integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing
and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves,
production and costs with respect to such properties; unexpected results of litigation filed against
Sanchez Energy; the extent to which Sanchez Energy’s crude oil and natural gas properties
operated by others are operated successfully and economically; the use of competing energy
sources and the development of alternative energy sources; the extent to which Sanchez Energy
incurs uninsured losses and liabilities or losses and liabilities in excess of its insurance
coverage; and the other factors described under ITEM 1A, “Risk Factors,” in Sanchez Energy’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and any updates to
those factors set forth in its subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on
Form 8-K. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by
Sanchez Energy’s forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do,
Sanchez Energy may not have correctly anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the extent of
their impact on its actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of
Sanchez Energy’s forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of
the date on which such statement is made and Sanchez Energy undertakes no obligation to
correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Oil and Gas Reserves The Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requires oil and gas companies, in their filings with the
SEC, to disclose “proved oil and gas reserves” (i.e., quantities of oil and gas that are estimated
with reasonable certainty to be economically producible) and permits oil and gas companies to
disclose “probable reserves” (i.e., quantities of oil and gas that are as likely as not to be
recovered) and “possible reserves” (i.e., additional quantities of oil and gas that might be
recovered, but with a lower probability than probable reserves). We may use certain terms in this
presentation, such as “resource potential” that the SEC’s guidelines strictly prohibit us from
including in filings with the SEC. The calculation of resource potential, and any other estimates
of reserves and resources that are not proved, probable or possible reserves are not necessarily
calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines. Investors are urged to consider closely the
disclosure in Sanchez Energy’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015. Non-GAAP Measures Included in this presentation are certain non-GAAP
financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G.
Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in Sanchez Energy’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and
Current Reports on Form 8-K and the reconciliation to GAAP measures provided in this
presentation. 2

Appendix
27 NOL “Rights Plan” SN had a $765 million Net Operating Loss as of 12/31/15 Valuable asset
since NOL can offset future income taxes Significant changes in equity ownership could trigger
IRS limitations on future NOL usage Particularly complicated rules around ownership of
preferred shares In July 2015, SN implemented a NOL “Rights Plan” Highly visible message to
potential shareholders who may buy or currently own > 4.9% of SN Any shareholder who buys >
4.9% of SN without prior board approval would be subject to significant dilution through the
exercise of rights by other shareholders Automatically expires after 3 years from date of adoption
Similar to NOL rights plans of other public companies with significant NOLs relative to their
market capitalization For example, several large banks, home builders and automotive
companies enacted similar plans during 2008-2010 financial crisis

30 Non–GAAP Reconciliation and Measures Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) To Adjusted
EBITDA ($M) Reconciliation of PV-10 To Standardized Measure ($MM) Explanation of Non-
GAAP Measures Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income (loss) PLUS: (1)
Interest expense, including net losses (gains) on interest rate derivative contracts (2) Net losses
(gains) on commodity derivative contracts; (3) Net settlements received (paid) on commodity
derivative contracts; (4) Depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion; (5) Stock‑based
compensation expense; (6) Acquisition and divestiture costs included in general and
administrative; (7) Income tax expense (benefit); (8) Loss (gain) on sale of oil and natural gas
properties; (9) Impairment of oil and natural gas properties; and (10) Certain other items that we
deem appropriate; LESS: (1) Amortization of deferred gain on Western Catarina Midstream
Divestiture; (2) Interest income; and (3) Certain other items that we deem appropriate. Adjusted
EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users
of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and others, to assess our
operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry, without regard to
financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis. It is also used to assess our ability to
incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Our Adjusted EBITDA should not be
considered an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flow provided by or
used in operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented
in accordance with GAAP. Our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures of another company because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the
same manner. Standardized measure is calculated in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 69, “Disclosures About Oil and Gas Producing Activities,” as codified
in ASC Topic 932, “Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas.” For further information regarding the
calculation of the standardized measure, see “Unaudited Supplementary Information” included in
the financial statements included in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31.
