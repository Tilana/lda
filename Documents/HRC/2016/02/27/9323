<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The purpose of the mission to South Africa of the Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to 
non-discrimination in this context, Miloon Kothari, was to examine the status of realization of 
adequate housing, with particular attention to relevant programmes and policies to protect human 
rights relating to his mandate. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of South Africa 
for extending him an invitation to conduct such a mission.  
</p>
<p> In his report, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the legislative achievements of 
South Africa, such as the Constitution that is often cited as an example for the protection of 
economic, social and cultural rights, including for the right to adequate housing. He notes that 
South Africa has put in place a number of progressive legislative measures and policies aimed at 
fulfilling the right to adequate housing. Yet, a significant number of South Africans do not have 
access to this basic human right. He observes that the realization of the right to adequate housing 
in South Africa is hampered by the Government&#8217;s fragmented approach to the implementation of 
housing law and policy, as well as market forces representing real estate speculation trends, and 
considers that urgent action must be taken to improve access to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur is concerned that amendments to current legislation that prohibits 
unlawful evictions, as well the existence of initiatives at the provincial level to pass new 
eviction-related legislation may even be in contradiction with constitutional provisions and with 
the interpretation of the right to housing made by the Constitutional Court. 
</p>
<p> He was troubled throughout his visit and consultations by the situation he witnessed, 
particularly in some parts of the country and with regard to informal settlement dwellers, where 
it was clear to the Special Rapporteur that living conditions fall far short of safe and sustainable 
conditions. The Special Rapporteur also observed the problems faced by all levels of 
Government in providing adequate post hoc support to new settlements, resulting from land 
redistribution programmes. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur visited the Limpopo Province where mining companies have large 
projects which have required relocation of several communities. He believes that such projects 
should not be undertaken at the expense of the human rights of the individuals or the 
environment, resulting in contamination of water, forced displacements or evictions, or 
destruction of livelihoods of the people. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur notes the positive progress made by South Africa in the area of 
water and electricity. However, the water policy has faced implementation problems and pricing 
policies have led to supply cut-offs of low-income households for non-payment. The Special 
Rapporteur believes shortage of water and the disconnections constitute a grave issue in 
particular for people living with diseases, including cholera and diarrhoea, as well as people 
living with HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur noted that there is a critical lack of housing and support for people 
with special needs, marginalized people, women (in particular indigenous communities, women 
with disabilities, migrant women and women with HIV/AIDS), children and the elderly. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/16/Add.3 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p> During his visit the Special Rapporteur noted that there appears to be insufficient 
meaningful consultation between all levels of Government, civil society organizations and 
affected individuals and communities.  
</p>
<p> In the light of numerous issues described in this report, the Special Rapporteur has come to 
the conclusion that all possible additional measures should be taken in order to ensure equal 
opportunities in access to housing. There is a particular need to restructure the rental housing 
policy for low-income groups, to guarantee security of tenure for tenants and to formulate a 
specific national policy for special housing needs. There must be commitment at all levels of 
Government to adequate consultation and participation of civil society in planning. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur encourages South Africa to consider ratifying the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and to expeditiously implement concluding 
observations formulated by the United Nations human rights treaty bodies, as well as the 
recommendations made by special procedures of the Human Rights Council. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of South Africa, the Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and on the right to 
non-discrimination in this context, Miloon Kothari, undertook a mission to the country from 12 
to 24 April 2007. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was able to visit urban and rural areas 
such as Platfontein (Northern Cape); Sterkwater, Ga-Pila and Mothlohlo (Limpopo); 
Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni (Gauteng); Durban (KwaZulu Natal); and Cape Town 
(Western Cape).  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met with high-level representatives at State, provincial and 
municipal levels, including the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs; Minister of Agriculture and 
Land Affairs; judges of the Constitutional Court; Members of the Parliamentary Portfolio 
Committee on Housing; Deputy Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development; 
Chairperson and members of the South African Human Rights Commission; the Chief Land 
Claims Commissioner; Director-General of Finance of the Ministry of Finance; and high-ranking 
officials in all spheres of Government including Directors of Provincial Departments of Housing. 
The Special Rapporteur also met with civil society members, including non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), social movements, academics and women&#8217;s groups. He was very 
impressed with the level of competence and dedication to work of these women and men towards 
the enjoyment of the human right to adequate housing for all.  
</p><p>3. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for welcoming him and the 
extensive efforts made by both Government officials and civil society groups that facilitated 
meetings with a wide range of relevant actors. 
</p>
<p><b>I. THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND  
THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p>4. Since the end of apartheid in 1994, South Africa has made commendable efforts to address 
issues of racial segregation and inequality, and systematic human rights violations.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>5. After 300 years of colonial rule, and 82 years of white minority rule (including 46 years 
under the policy of apartheid), South Africa&#8217;s first democratic elections were held in April 1994 
under an interim Constitution which was modified in 1996. The process of drafting the 
Constitution involved extensive public participation. 
</p>
<p>6. The South African Parliament is bicameral, consisting of the National Assembly and the 
National Council of Provinces. There are nine provinces in South Africa, each with its own 
executive and legislative branch. While the national Executive Branch is in charge of the design 
of national policies, the provinces have responsibility for the delivery of housing programmes 
and other State services and implementation of national policy. Municipalities also have 
competence in local matters affecting their jurisdictions. They implement national housing 
policies in their areas of jurisdiction if accredited to do so and also have legislative competence 
for settlement planning under Schedule 4 of the Constitution. South Africa has ratified most core 
international human rights treaties; however, it has signed but not yet ratified the International </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.3 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR); nor has it ratified the Convention 
on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (CMW).  
</p>
<p>7. Although it has not ratified the ICESCR, South Africa supports the enhanced protection of 
economic, social and cultural rights at international level (e.g. the draft optional protocol to the 
ICESCR). 
</p>
<p>8. South Africa is one of the few countries that have constitutional provisions recognizing 
and protecting socio-economic rights. The Constitution is often cited as an example for the 
protection of such rights. It explicitly addresses the right to adequate housing; section 26 states 
that &#8220;1. Everyone has the right to have access to adequate housing. 2. The state must take 
reasonable legislative and other measures, within its available resources, to achieve the 
progressive realization of this right. 3. No one may be evicted from their home, or have their 
home demolished, without an order of court made after considering all the relevant 
circumstances. No legislation may permit arbitrary evictions.&#8221; Section 28 (1) c of the 
Constitution also calls for the right of children to basic shelter.  
</p>
<p>9. In addition, the Government of South Africa has put in place a number of legislative and 
other measures aimed at fulfilling the right to adequate housing, including the provision of rental 
housing, allocation of land for purchase and subsidizing the building of housing, among others. 
</p>
<p>10. Several institutions play an important role in promoting the enjoyment of human rights in 
South Africa. They include: the Public Prosecutor, the Human Rights Commission, the 
Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic 
Communities, the Commission for Gender Equality, the Auditor-General, and the Electoral 
Commission. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur visited the South African Human 
Rights Commission (SAHRC). SAHRC, established in accordance with the Paris Principles, 
handles complaints on human rights violations and also aims to create a national culture of 
human rights through its advocacy, research and legal functions.  
</p>
<p>11. The Constitutional Court of South Africa, the highest court, has been called upon to 
interpret constitutionally enshrined human rights and their implementation in a number of 
landmark decisions. These decisions have reinforced the justiciability not just of housing rights, 
but a number of socio-economic rights.<b>1</b> In the Grootboom judgement, for example, the 
Constitutional Court found that the State is constitutionally obliged to take steps to assist people 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Some of these important decisions can be found in the following cases: <i>Republic of</i> 
</p>
<p><i>South Africa v. Grootboom</i>, October 2000 (CCT 11/00); <i>Port Elizabeth Municipality v. Various 
Occupiers</i>, October 2004 (CCT 53/03); <i>Jaftha v. Schoeman and Others</i>, May 2004 (CCT 74/03); 
and <i>President of the Republic of South Africa and Others v. Modderklip Boerdery (Pty) Ltd 
(Agri SA and Legal Resources Centre, amici curiae)</i> November 2004 (CCT 20/04). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/16/Add.3

</p>
<p>living in crisis and emergency conditions by making available land and appropriate services, as 
well as water and sanitation. The case also made explicit the State&#8217;s responsibility in the 
fulfilment of housing rights through the creation of the conditions for access to adequate housing 
for people at all economic levels of South African society.<b>2</b>  
</p>
<p>12. Subsequent cases have further enunciated these rights and have led to the passing of 
legislation and amendments that reflect the Government&#8217;s obligations, including the Prevention 
of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act 1998 (PIE Act), which makes it a 
criminal offence to evict someone without a court order, and changes to the National Housing 
Code which set out policies for the provision of emergency accommodation. Other legislative 
responses include the Housing Act 1997, and the Social Housing Act (2006).  
</p>
<p>13. Since 1994, according to official data,<b>3</b> almost 3 million subsidies for housing have been 
approved. In 1997, it was estimated that approximately 2.4 million households lacked access to 
adequate housing; reports state that the housing shortfall increases by 204,000 households per 
annum.<b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>14. In 2004 a comprehensive plan for sustainable human settlement was designed. This policy, 
&#8220;Breaking New Ground&#8221;: A Comprehensive Plan for Developing Sustainable Human 
Settlements (hereafter &#8220;Breaking New Ground&#8221;), seeks to ensure the realization of the right to 
housing enshrined in the Constitution.<b>5</b>  
</p>
<p>15. It is also relevant for housing to note that, in order to promote the fulfilment of the right to 
land, provided in section 25, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Constitution, the Commission on 
Restitution of Land Rights and a Land Claims Court were established to &#8220;provide for the 
restitution of rights in land in respect of which persons or communities were dispossessed under 
or for the purpose of furthering the objects of any racially based discriminatory law&#8221;.<b>6</b> The 
Commission is mandated to promote equity for victims of dispossession, particularly the landless 
and the rural poor; reconciliation through the restitution process; and to contribute towards an

</p>
<p>equitable redistribution of land rights.<b>7</b> It has also developed a number of programmes to 
implement this goal, including the land tenure reform programme which aims at preventing farm 
dweller evictions. The main goal of the Commission was to redistribute 30 per cent of 
white-owned agricultural lands by 2014.  
</p>
<p><b>B. Socio-economic background 
</b></p>
<p>16. South Africa is a nation of diverse origins, cultural background, languages and beliefs. The 
total population of South Africa is 47.9 million.<b>8</b> The African population accounts for 
approximately 38.1 million, the white population is estimated at 4.4 million, the coloured 
population<b>9</b> at 4.2 million and the Indian/Asian population at 1.2 million. Fifty-one per cent of 
the population is female. There are six large groups who identify themselves as indigenous. 
These ethnic groups include the three main San peoples (Xun, Khwe and Khomani), the various 
Nama communities, the major Griqua associations and so-called revivalist Khoisan.  
17. Almost half the South African population (21.9 million people) live below the national 
poverty line as reported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 2004 and 
two thirds of total income is concentrated in the richest quintile of the population.<b>10</b> The high 
level of unemployment is also a key contributor to inequality; according to the International 
Labour Organization (ILO), in 2006 the total unemployment rate was 25.5 per cent of the 
economically active population.<b>11</b> Life expectancy at birth remains very low (47 years in 2004) 
due to the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>18. In terms of poverty, the Nama and the San people constitute some of the poorest sectors in 
South African society, partly because they live in rural areas but also because of stigma and 
discrimination, as they are seen as fit only for menial labour.

</b>  Section 25 of the Constitution provides that: &#8220;the state must take reasonable legislative and 
</p>
<p>other measures, within its available resources, to foster conditions which enable citizens to gain 
access to land on an equitable basis&#8221; and that &#8220;A person or community whose tenure of land is 
legally insecure as a result of past racially discriminatory laws or practices is entitled, to the 
extent provided by an Act of Parliament, either to tenure which is legally secure or to 
comparable redress.&#8221; available at http://land.pwv.gov.za/restitution/Default.htm.

</p>
<p>19. South Africa has also become a major host country for immigrants. It has in recent years 
tried to strengthen a policy which targets immigration of skilled labour. There are 
approximately 2 million asylum-seekers and undocumented migrants in the country.<b>12</b>  
</p>
<p><b>II.  GOOD PRACTICES 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur welcomes &#8220;Breaking New Ground&#8221;, the ambitious housing policy 
formulated by the National Department of Housing, which seeks to promote sustainable human 
settlements and articulates a commitment to housing projects and developments that are socially 
inclusive and integrated. The main features of the &#8220;Breaking New Ground&#8221; policy include the 
informal settlement upgrading programme, centred on poverty alleviation; the release or 
acquisition of public land for housing projects; the management of housing stock; and the 
provision of infrastructure and services for low-income communities.  
</p>
<p>21. One part of this policy foresees implementation of &#8220;inclusionary&#8221;<b>13</b> measures such as 
encouraging developers to include low-cost housing in projects targeting middle and upper class 
sectors. This aims at creating inclusionary housing and integrated settlements through 
establishing subsidy programmes for the lowest-income sectors in order to redress the current 
context of income and race polarization within South African cities.  
</p>
<p>22. In consonance with &#8220;Breaking New Ground&#8221;, many policies have been developed at the 
provincial and municipal levels. During conversations with officials concerning such policies, 
the Special Rapporteur was encouraged by the frankness with which they discussed the 
challenges for adequate housing and associated rights in South Africa. 
</p>
<p>23. The authorities also informed the Special Rapporteur of other positive steps. The 
introduction of the National Home Builders Registration Council (NHBRC) which requires the 
listing of all projects, the registration of all builders and ongoing inspections of houses, has 
reportedly improved the quality of government-subsidized houses. It has also put penalty 
measures for builders, and other service providers in the value chain, who are not following the 
standards and regulations of the NHBRC and other institutions. The urban renewal incentives 
ensure that developers invest money in renovating buildings for low-income housing. In 
addition, the Government has a programme to repair and improve some of the houses built 
between 1994 and 1999.

</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes housing projects that aim to realize the right to 
housing, taking into account the indivisibility of rights. He welcomes the work of social 
movements and non-governmental organizations in the field of housing.  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the example set by Freedom Park, an informal 
settlement upgrading project in Cape Town comprising 700 backyard dwellers, mainly women, 
who occupied a vacant piece of land in their neighbourhood in April 1998. The process of 
occupation was highly organized from the beginning and occupants designed plots before 
erecting their shacks. In July 2001 basic infrastructure was provided, including access to water, 
sanitation and electricity, as part of the programme of emergency servicing of informal 
settlements. With the assistance of Development Action Group and the Legal Resources Centre, 
the community initiated an internal restructuring and organizational process. In 2003 the City of 
Cape Town proposed to upgrade the informal settlement of Freedom Park as part of a broader 
housing project initiated under the presidential Urban Renewal Programme. The programme 
aimed to build 493 units in order to accommodate 282 families from Freedom Park and 211 from 
the City&#8217;s waiting list. Throughout the participatory planning approach and the Peoples Housing 
Process (PHP), the community has been able to increase the size of homes, with additional 
savings added to the public subsidy, and keep control over the design and quality of new homes. 
In early 2006, an Irish initiative<b>14</b> offered to bridge the savings deficit.  
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur also visited a short-term transitional housing project for abused 
women and children that is being developed in Cape Town. The Saartjie Baartman Centre for 
Women and Children is an innovative one-stop women&#8217;s centre which offers a range of services, 
such as safe accommodation, counselling, job skills training and legal advice to women and 
children who experience domestic and/or sexual violence. Hosting up to 22 mothers and 
30-40 children, the centre aims to assist abused women who do not benefit from housing 
subsidies. In 2006, the Centre collaborated with the Housing and Community Buildings Unit<b>15</b> in 
launching a paper entitled Special Needs Housing: Developing an Approach for Policy 
Guidelines focusing on shelters for abused women and their children, children and youth, people 
living with/affected by HIV/AIDS and second stage housing for abused women and their 
children.<b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur welcomes such initiatives and commends them to the relevant 
authorities, who may want to consider integrating such successful practices more broadly into 
housing policies.

</p>
<p><b>III.  ISSUES OF CONCERN 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur notes the positive measures undertaken by the Government in the 
field of adequate housing. He also notes that, in spite of these measures, more is to be done as a 
significant number of South Africans still do not have access to adequate housing. The Special 
Rapporteur acknowledges that there is a time lag between the introduction of a new 
developmental policy and visible results on the ground. He nevertheless considers that a number 
of actions must be urgently taken to improve access to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Access to land 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur believes there is a link between homelessness and landlessness; he 
has repeatedly drawn attention to the linkages between lack of access to land, evictions, rural and 
urban poverty and the realization of the right to adequate housing. The legacy of apartheid is 
most visible in the land ownership structure in South Africa. The post-apartheid Government 
inherited a highly unequal land ownership structure, created by legislation in the early 
twentieth century and reinforced by apartheid, whereby 75 per cent of the population were 
settled on 13 per cent of the land. 
</p>
<p>30. Despite the various programmes that the Commission on Restitution of Land Rights has 
implemented and the high rate of processing of filed claims (90 per cent of the applications filed 
since 1994 have been settled), the current pace of redistribution of land remains very slow.<b>17</b> The 
State has acknowledged that only 3 per cent of land was redistributed between 1994 and 2006, 
resulting in many remaining landless and thus without prospects for development or poverty 
alleviation.  
</p>
<p>31. The slow pace of land delivery was largely due, according to State officials and civil 
society, to the &#8220;willing buyer, willing seller&#8221; principle for land redistribution. One of the 
overarching obstacles for the implementation of the reform is also said to be that white 
commercial farmers have overvalued the land, making it difficult for the State to meet the costs 
of buying it.<b>18</b> The general speculative rise in land prices is another factor. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>17
</b>  According to the 2005-2006 annual report of the Commission on Restitution of Land, 71,645 
</p>
<p>out of 79,696 claims were settled by 31 March 2006, leaving 8,051 outstanding claims. The 
report notes that 11 per cent of the settled claims were rural and 89 per cent urban. The total 
amount of land involved in settled restitution claims was 1,067,152 ha and ZAR 2.9 bn was paid 
in compensation. However, the observations made on budgets for 2006/07 estimated that the 
restitution programme may spend only ZAR 1.9 billion of the ZAR 2.7 billion allocated budget 
by the end of the financial year (Report of the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture and Land 
Affairs on Budget Vote No. 29, dated 28 March 2006, para. 7.1.8, available at

</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur notes that for land redistribution programmes to be successful they 
should be accompanied by long-term provision of post-settlement support and by policies that 
progressively enable the newly settled communities to access services, and develop livelihoods. 
In some regions of the country, lack of support and the high rates of unemployment, in addition 
to low incomes and the absence of subsidies for transport, could make it impossible for members 
of the newly settled communities to earn their livelihoods. The distance of many new settlements 
from viable work opportunities and community facilities seems problematic. The Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that these obstacles could jeopardize the gains that the community has 
made in recovering their lands. 
</p>
<p>33. In 2005, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous peoples conducted a mission to South Africa and formulated several 
recommendations to help to fill gaps and find durable solutions to improve the human rights 
situation of indigenous peoples in the country,<b>19</b> in particular with regard to their access to land 
and housing. No information was available during this mission on the extent to which those 
recommendations have been considered or implemented. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the importance of considering human rights in the 
implementation of land policies. As noted at the 2005 Land Summit by authorities from all levels 
of the Government, academics and NGOs, land and agrarian reform alone cannot undo the 
injustices of the past, but must contribute to the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Housing policy implementation 
</b></p>
<p>35. In December 1994, a white paper on housing entitled A New Housing Policy and Strategy 
for South Africa was proposed.<b>21</b> It contrasted in many ways with the February 1994 
Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) which sought to deliver 350,000 housing 
units per annum in order to eliminate the housing backlog over a 10-year period. A National 
Housing Subsidy Scheme (NHSS) was established in order to fast track delivery and to provide a 
wide diversity of housing opportunities. As of 2007, more than 2.4 million subsidies have been 
approved for housing construction by the Government. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur noted praiseworthy efforts in this field. However, the 
South African Parliament has noted a number of problems negatively affecting social housing 
policies, including the lack of cooperative governance in housing development; the insufficient 
information-sharing between levels of administration; the lack of integrated housing 
development which ignores the need for social services within housing projects; and poor quality

<p>construction.<b>22</b> The Special Rapporteur observed that the realization of the right to adequate 
housing in South Africa is compromised by the Government&#8217;s fragmented approach to the 
implementation of housing law and policy.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur also noted during his mission that while well-intentioned policies 
have been developed at the national level, few mechanisms seem to be in place to ensure that 
these policies are being implemented. He also noticed the lack of a comprehensive evaluation of 
housing policies. The Special Rapporteur believes that assessing the strengths and weaknesses of 
housing laws and policies at different levels of Government constitutes a useful opportunity for 
all relevant actors to reinforce their positive aspects and address shortcomings. 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur visited a number of housing projects throughout the country and 
saw new houses that had been hastily constructed, poorly planned and designed without any 
consultation with local authorities and residents. These houses were unfortunately inadequate to 
meet the housing needs of their inhabitants. For example, in Wallacedene, Cape Town, the site of 
the landmark Grootboom decision, the Special Rapporteur met with a household that had 
received a one-bedroom RDP dwelling to house a family of eight. Such shortcomings may be the 
result of basing housing policies on the concept of the household. The Special Rapporteur 
encourages the authorities to replace the household approach with a focus on the human rights of 
each individual and family member from the very initial stage of policy design.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur is under the impression that the policies and interventions based on 
the 2004 &#8220;Breaking New Ground&#8221; policy have not been adopted in practice by many authorities 
at the provincial and local levels. Deficits in implementation are exacerbated by the failure at 
local, provincial and national levels to evaluate how housing (and land distribution) programmes 
are meeting the needs of the poor. Yet the success of housing policies should be measured by 
taking into account both quantitative achievements, which include number of houses delivered 
and beneficiaries reached, and qualitative achievements, which should include the quality of 
construction, and building materials, size of the structure, the location of housing and its access 
to water, sanitation and electricity, as well as schools, hospitals and other civic services.  
</p>
<p>40. For housing to be adequate, it must also be affordable. South Africa experienced a 
significant increase in housing prices from 2000 to 2004-2005. It is estimated that house prices 
increased by 92 per cent in contrast with an average increase of workers&#8217; income estimated at

<b>23
</b></p>
<p>  The RDP requires that: &#8220;As a minimum, all housing must provide protection from weather, a 
durable structure, and reasonable living space and privacy. A house must include sanitary 
facilities, storm-water drainage, a household energy supply (whether linked to grid electricity 
supply or derived from other sources, such as solar energy), and convenient access to clean 
water.&#8221; Section 2.5.7, Housing and Services, available at http://www.anc.org.za/rdp/rdp2.html. </p>

<p>8.3 per cent.<b>24</b> The International Monetary Fund estimated in 2005 that South Africa&#8217;s real estate 
prices had increased by 200 per cent between 1997 and the beginning of 2005.<b>25</b> High levels of 
consumer debt in South Africa are also of concern. In this context, the Special Rapporteur is 
worried about the critical shortage of public rental housing stock for low income people and 
notes that market driven price increases are leading to a lack of accessible and affordable rental 
options. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Informal settlements, evictions and resettlement 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Informal settlements 
</b></p>
<p>41. Although race no longer constitutes a legal barrier to residential mobility, there is still a 
spatial segregation of cities based on income levels. In South Africa, economic growth in cities 
has contributed to rapid urbanization and to population movement, both from other regions of the 
country and from abroad. The difficulties in accessing the housing market and lack of affordable 
housing alternatives explain the consolidation of vast areas of informal settlement where large 
numbers of people live in desperately inadequate conditions without access to basic services. 
</p>
<p>42. Official policy recognizes that informal settlement dwellers are one of the most vulnerable 
population groups.<b>26</b> For instance, the In-Situ Upgrading of Informal Settlements programme,<b>27</b> 
which aims at improving and formalizing such settlements, constitutes an important attempt to 
enhance living conditions and reduce poverty by enabling communities to maintain social 
networks and livelihood strategies while improvements are made to their physical environment. 
The Special Rapporteur welcomes this programme and believes that it needs to be still further 
developed and implemented at the local level. Although many municipalities have plans to 
upgrade settlements based on the programme, greater efforts may be needed to ensure these 
plans achieve their main objectives.  
43. The Special Rapporteur visited a number of settlements throughout the country where 
many residents had no access to water, electricity or sanitation. Organizations and individuals 
highlighted the urgent need for social services and facilities. In Durban, for example, the Special 
Rapporteur visited the Kennedy Road and Foreman Road settlements, where no upgrading or

<p>  The programme facilitates the structured upgrading of informal settlements. It applies to in

<p>service provision has taken place. Lack of access to electricity, sanitation and water, and lack of 
protection against hazards such as shack fires, has serious consequences for the health and 
well-being of residents. This situation is compounded by tenure insecurity and the threat of 
forced eviction. It was clear to the Special Rapporteur that these conditions fall far short of safe 
and sustainable living conditions. In spite of this situation, the Durban municipality has often 
been praised for good governance practices, which may suggest that a full and transparent 
rethink is required. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by the meeting with organizations 
that tackle problems in settlements and he believes that there is a need for greater dialogue 
between civil society and the authorities, as well as their greater participation, in order to ensure 
successful implementation of the settlement upgrading programmes.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>44. South Africa has national statutes, codes and policies designed to protect the right to 
adequate housing. They provide for fair procedures for eviction of unlawful occupants and 
prohibit unlawful evictions.<b>29</b> The courts have provided jurisprudence on questions concerning 
property rights, security of tenure, the State&#8217;s obligation to provide housing at least on an 
emergency basis, and the prohibition of evictions leading to homelessness.<b>30</b>  
</p>
<p>45. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur was informed of the Government&#8217;s intention to 
amend the Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act<i>, </i>1998 (PIE 
Act), to facilitate the eviction of illegal occupants, and also that initiatives at the provincial level 
had been taken to pass bills that may also contradict the spirit of the PIE Act. For instance, the 
KwaZulu-Natal Legislature approved the KwaZulu-Natal Elimination and Prevention of 
Re-emergence of Slums Bill, signed into law by the Province Premier on 18 July 2007.<b>31</b> The 
Act refers to the &#8220;control and elimination of slums&#8221; and encourages landowners to prevent 
informal occupation. Where there are existing informal occupations, the Act encourages 
landowners to initiate eviction procedures. 
</p>
<p>46. Subsequent to his mission, in a communication addressed to the authorities 
on 3 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur forwarded a number of concerns in regard to the Act 
and requested additional information. These concerns included the fact that the Act does not 
consider the availability of support to find alternative housing solutions for evictees. Its

</p>
<p>provision stating that: &#8220;In the event of a municipality deciding to make available alternative land 
or buildings for the relocation of persons living in a slum ...&#8221;<b>32</b> seems to suggest that a 
municipality may not have any obligation in this regard, which was deemed necessary for some 
evictions by the Constitutional Court in the Grootboom case<i>. </i>In addition, there seems to be no 
requirement for consultation with the persons that would potentially be affected by these 
decisions, in contradiction of the &#8220;Breaking New Ground&#8221; policy, which promotes a cooperative 
and participatory approach to informal settlement and emphasizes in situ upgrade programmes. 
The Act was criticized by some civil society organizations as being in contradiction of 
constitutional provisions and the interpretation of the right to housing made by the Constitutional 
Court. 
</p>
<p>47. In response to the communication, the authorities informed the Special Rapporteur that the 
progressive elimination of slums, as contemplated in the Act, is intended to operate alongside the 
sustainable housing development process embarked upon by the Government of South Africa 
and KwaZulu-Natal Province, based on the Constitution, the National Housing Act and the 
KwaZulu-Natal Housing Act, No. 12 of 1998 (the KZN Housing Act), so as to ensure the 
replacement of slums with adequate housing and to avoid anyone being rendered homeless as a 
result of the slum elimination programmes to be adopted by municipalities under the provisions 
of the Elimination and Prevention of Re-emergence of Slums Act. It was further indicated that 
the Act does not contain any provision for the forced eviction of slum dwellers. Instead, it 
specifically provides that any eviction pursuant to its provisions must be carried out in 
accordance with the applicable provisions of the PIE Act, the Constitution, and any other 
national legislation protecting the housing or occupational rights of persons.<b>33</b> 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the extensive reply submitted by the Government. He 
believes nonetheless that the consistency of this Act with constitutional provisions, relevant 
Constitutional Court judgements, and international human rights obligations should be examined 
further.  
</p>
<p>49. In this context, the Special Rapporteur notes that there may have been a misunderstanding 
as to how to respect international commitments, such as the Millennium Development Goals, 
that may have led to efforts being directed to the eradication of slums rather than the 
improvement of the lives of slum dwellers. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that such 
legislative developments may weaken substantive and procedural protection concerning 
evictions and increase exemptions for landlords. They may even result in criminalizing people 
facing eviction. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur also received information on evictions taking place in many urban 
and rural areas. In some cases evictions are allegedly carried out in breach of relevant 
international human rights standards. Such evictions have been apparently carried out in the

<p>middle of the night; belongings were destroyed during evictions; evictions took place without 
prior notice and in the absence of any consultation as foreseen by the PIE Act;<b>34</b> there was threat 
and use of violence, for example, in Johannesburg by the police and private security services 
such as Wozani Security (Pty) Ltd, (known as the Red Ants);<b>35</b> and there was an absence of safe 
and reasonable emergency accommodation after evictions rendering people homeless.<b>36</b> 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur visited for example residents of San Jose, a 16-storey building in 
Berea, Johannesburg, one of Johannesburg&#8217;s &#8220;bad buildings&#8221;<b>37</b> said to pose health and safety 
risks to its residents. Residents of San Jose are currently appealing an eviction order and have 
been living without water and electricity since 2002, necessitating the transport of buckets of 
water from a single standpipe on the street every day; the lack of adequate sanitation has resulted 
in the accumulation of a sewage cesspool in the basement of the building. Although the Supreme 
Court of Appeal has recently ruled in favour of the eviction of the building, it also ordered the 
City of Johannesburg to provide those residents who needed it with alternative shelter &#8220;where 
they may live secure against eviction&#8221;. The Court stated that although the residents did not have 
a constitutional right to alternative housing in the inner city, the personal circumstances of the 
residents of the particular buildings concerned would have to be taken into account in 
consultation with them before any relocation could take place.<b>38</b> The case was subsequently 
referred to the Constitutional Court which has overturned the appeal of the Supreme Court of 
Justice and has stated that people living in unsafe buildings may not be evicted without prior

<p>consultation of the residents by the authorities.<b>39</b> The Special Rapporteur welcomes this decision, 
which he believes to be consistent with international legal provisions on the right to adequate 
housing and their interpretation by United Nations bodies.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>52. Backyard shack dwellers<b>41</b> throughout South Africa appear not to enjoy sufficient tenure 
protection. In some cases, once the prime tenant receives a new house (for example, under the 
NHSS) backyard dwellers are evicted, which could be prevented through better regulation of the 
landlord-tenant relationship to prevent exploitation of tenants.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur was disturbed to learn that a significant number of long-term black 
farm dwellers had also been evicted or displaced since 1994. Most land dispossession during the 
apartheid era affected black farmers. Those displaced often settled on white-owned lands, where 
they also worked. A study indicates that the number of those now displaced from such farms is 
over 2 million, of whom 950,000 black farm workers may have been illegally evicted from 
white-owned farms.<b>42</b> Despite new legislation such as the Extension of Security of Tenure Act 
(ESTA) and the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act, designed to extend and secure tenure rights, 
the study also indicates that only 1 per cent of evictions involved any legal process, including 
court judgements, suggesting that the evictees had difficulties in asserting their rights and 
procuring legal representation. The Special Rapporteur believes that improving the security of 
tenure for the most vulnerable in South Africa needs to be addressed urgently. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>3. Resettlement, restitution and post-settlement support 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur observed the problems faced by all levels of Government to 
provide adequate post-settlement support to new settlements and to ensure sufficient access to 
basic services and facilities, including proper sanitation, water, access to schools, and access to 
livelihood options. There seem to be very few follow-up support mechanisms, such as 
community and livelihood support systems, regular maintenance and services repair facilities, 
nor are there meaningful opportunities in the settlements he visited for residents to contribute to 
the development of their communities.

<p>55. The Special Rapporteur visited the township of Platfontein, in the Northern Cape, where a 
community of 4,000 San families were resettled in 2003, after returning from forced 
displacement in Angola and Namibia. Almost no post-settlement support was provided. A large 
number of people still have no access to water within their plots, there is no waste or garbage 
collection and there are critical problems concerning dry sanitation maintenance. Houses showed 
serious failings in construction (leaking roofs, deficient floors). Members of a Kalahari San 
(Bushmen) community, who received a 35,000 hectare plot of land in 1996, also alleged that no 
post-settlement support was provided and the community still has no basic infrastructure. 
Residents appear to have no information on mechanisms that could address their grievances and 
complaints.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur also visited a number of settlements in Durban which, although 
part of RDP housing programmes, do not have access to basic services, such as water and 
sanitation, or to facilities such as schools or health-care clinics within walking distance. He 
visited Welbedacht, a project built by the eThekwini Municipality through the slum clearance 
project which consists of approximately 5,500 units. The residents were relocated to these units 
prior to the connection of water or electricity and many of the units in Welbedacht showed 
critical structural defaults.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur notes that dialogue between communities and the authorities is 
crucial to overcoming the lack of information and consultation of communities, and may lead to 
improved recognition of the needs of such communities. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Building on the mediation provision 
</b></p>
<p>58. Various legal provisions related to the right to housing foresee the establishment of a 
mediation process before evictions take place.  
</p>
<p>59. For instance, Section 7 of the PIE Act specifically provides for a mediation process 
between interested parties. Besides, all respondents have to be served twice with court 
documents prior to an applicant being able to proceed with its application for an eviction in 
court. Relevant government departments are also due to give advance notice of any application 
for an eviction. This allows the potential evictees to approach the legal aid centres for assistance. 
ESTA similarly provides for mediation and makes further provision for arbitrators outside of the 
court system to be appointed in order to determine disputes. For instance, in the Port Elizabeth 
Municipality case,<b>43</b> the Constitutional Court considered the mediation process at some length in 
its judgement.  
60. The Special Rapporteur notes that mediation has a particularly significant role to play, in 
particular in communities which have long been divided and placed in hostile camps. The 
process should enable parties to relate to each other in pragmatic and sensible ways, building up 
prospects of respectful good neighbourliness for the future.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>61. A mediation service could play an extremely valuable role in combating homelessness and 
in providing up-to-date information not only on where evictions may be taking place, but on 
where real need exists for emergency, short-term, medium-term and long-term housing 
development.   
</p>
<p><b>D.  Large development projects 
</b>62. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that development projects are important for 
economic growth. He believes that such projects should not be undertaken at the expense of the 
human rights of the individuals or the environment resulting in contamination of water, forced 
displacements or evictions, or destruction of people&#8217;s livelihoods. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Mining projects 
</b>63. According to official data, mining represents a significant source of national revenues and 
directly employs over 400,000 workers, equivalent to 2.6 per cent of the economically active 
population. In 2002 the mining sector contributed 32.9 per cent to the overall value of exported 
goods. Although mining is an important source of development, it appears to also be a source of 
conflict.<b>44</b>  
</p>
<p>64. South Africa has regulated mining activity through the Mining Scorecard and the 
Broad-based Socio-Economic Empowerment Charter for the Mining Industry (the Mining 
Charter),<b>45</b> which calls for the economic and social responsibility of the mining companies. 
However, some cases reveal that mining projects do not always guarantee the meaningful 
participation of rights holders; the accountability of duty bearers; transparency in both process 
and content; and the necessary special attention to vulnerable groups and discriminatory 
practices.<b>46</b> 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur visited the Limpopo Province where Anglo Platinum&#8217;s PPL 
mining company has large mining operations which have already required the relocation of more 
than 6,000 people and from which 10,000 people are in the process of being relocated. Some 
community members alleged that the relocations were carried out without appropriate 
consultation or information, and without following adequate procedures. Many testimonies 
mentioned violence when police broke into their houses at night to carry out the evictions. The

</p>
<p>Ga-Pila and Mohlohlo communities, living under the threat of eviction, face serious health risks 
caused by exposure to open cast mines and explosions. Twenty-five families, including women 
and children in Ga-Pila, have been living without water and electricity for the last five years. 
Although the community previously had access to schools, clinics and churches, these were 
closed down after mining activity commenced.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur was told that the Government has allegedly still not provided any 
assistance to address this situation, nor has it responded to the various letters sent by all the 
affected communities.<b>47</b>  
</p>
<p><b>2. Football World Cup 
</b></p>
<p>67. The FIFA World Cup will take place in South Africa in 2010. Although the country has 
successfully hosted various other large events in the recent past, 350,000 visitors are expected, 
representing 10 times the number for past events.<b>48</b>  
</p>
<p>68. More than ZAR 70 billion has been budgeted for the building and upgrading of South 
Africa&#8217;s 10 World Cup stadiums and for related supporting infrastructure. Among other 
investments, Johannesburg plans a ZAR 3 billion high-speed train; a refurbished sports stadium; 
and a ZAR 400 million public square.<b>49</b>  
</p>
<p>69. Notwithstanding the positive gains that can be achieved by holding such an event, the 
Special Rapporteur is concerned about the impact the tournament may have on adequate 
housing. The Housing Minister noted that plans to build hundreds of thousands of new low-cost 
homes could be affected by shifting budget demands in the run-up to the World Cup.<b>50</b> There is 
also a genuine concern about the possible displacement and direct or indirect evictions that could 
occur due to infrastructure construction. Reconverting Johannesburg into a world class city<b>51</b> is 
already increasing housing prices and increased demand for construction materials has led to a 
foreseeable shortage of cement.

</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur notes that there is a need for in-depth analysis and further 
information, in particular at the policymaker level, on the impact that this large event could have 
on housing, as well as other social issues. He also notes the need for monitoring the 
commitments to guarantee human rights made by the country during the bidding process. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Provision of public services 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Water 
</b></p>
<p>71. A rights-based legislative framework and public policies aimed at extending access to 
water is in place to empower local communities and reduced inequalities. The 1996 Constitution 
included a Bill of Rights enshrining the right to have access to sufficient food and water 
(section 27). This constitutional right was given legislative content under the Water Services Act 
(1997) and the National Water Act (1998).  Key provisions include: lifeline or social tariffs to 
ensure that all South Africans can afford sufficient water services for adequate health and 
hygiene and stepped tariffs to provide a cross-subsidy from high-volume users to low-volume 
users. In 2001 South Africa became the only country with a free basic water policy.<b>52</b> 
</p>
<p>72. Since 1994, 10 million more people have received access to a tap providing safe water, 
within 200 meters from their home, with coverage rates rising from 60 per cent to 86 per cent. 
By 2006, according to the Government, over 31 million people were served by free basic 
water.<b>53</b> The RDP set medium-term targets to provide 50-60 litres of clean water per person per 
day. The Government has suggested since mid-2001, that all municipalities provide a basic 
minimum of 25 litres of water free of charge per person per day.<b>54</b> The specific wording of the 
ruling party&#8217;s 2000 campaign promise is laudable:  &#8220;ANC-led local government will provide all 
residents with a free basic amount of water, electricity and other municipal services, so as to help 
the poor. Those who use more than the basic amounts will pay for the extra they use&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>73. This is an excellent mandate. The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw this exemplary 
language to the attention of other States as it shows how a human rights-based approach can be 
introduced to the provision of basic services in a context of limited resources. Because of its 
exemplary nature, it is also particularly important to draw lessons from the South African 
experience. In practice, the water policy has faced implementation problems, and pricing policies 
have led to supply cut-offs for non-payment, affecting 275,000 households (an estimated 1.5 
million people) in 2003, according to a leading government official.<b>55</b> UNDP has reported that

<b>54
</b></p>
<p> Actual policy provides for 6,000 litres per household per month, calculated as 25 litres 
per person per day in a household or property of eight people. In multi-dwelling households 
sharing the same municipal account (all on one property), this does not seem to translate to a 
volume of 25 litres per person per day. 
<b>55

</p>
<p>the 25 litre threshold for free basic water is too low for some large households and that supplies 
in some areas have been erratic, forcing households to travel large distances to collect water. 
Besides, this amount falls well below average water needs of 50 per litres per individual per day, 
as calculated by the World Health Organization.  
</p>
<p>74. In 2003 SAHRC made a series of recommendations in order to achieve the progressive 
realization of the right to water: the provision of free basic services and 50 litres per person per 
day to larger families; the provision of water to farm dwellers and HIV/AIDS sufferers; the 
restructuring of the pricing system to cater for the poor, the application of a cross-subsidization 
policy and monitoring of the pricing system of the water boards, and the proper monitoring of 
project and programme implementation as a matter of urgency.<b>56</b>  
75. In 2006, SAHRC reported that the State had adopted policies intended to advance the right 
of access to sufficient water. It also reported that the national Department of Provincial and 
Local Government has been implementing the Municipal Infrastructure Grant programme to help 
municipalities meet their obligations of providing services and speeding up the provision of 
water and sanitation. The Commission highlighted achievements including: the reduction of 
water provision backlogs; the allocation of funds to provinces to reduce sanitation backlogs; the 
promotion of water conservation; increase in the capacity of municipal staff to institutionalize 
the municipal infrastructure grant; and the reduction of rates charged for water in many rural 
areas. 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur notes that it would be very useful to assess the human rights 
impact of the use of prepaid water meters by some municipalities as a means of ensuring that 
water consumption beyond the free basic water allocation is paid for. The human rights principle 
that particular efforts should be made to protect the most vulnerable is particularly pertinent in 
this case. Some studies have revealed the problems involved in using these meters in poor 
communities. The meters allow for disconnection from the service without the user being given 
the requisite legislative notice of disconnection.<b>57</b> Some users have taken the relevant authorities 
to court.<b>58</b> The Special Rapporteur is of the view that redistribution needs to be achieved through 
cross-subsidization by charging higher prices in higher-income neighbourhoods. This would 
allow for a larger supply of free basic water for the benefit of the residents of low-income 
neighborhoods. Residents from low-income areas also correctly argue that testing for 
&#8220;indigence&#8221;<b>59</b>- as favoured by the supplier - would result in stigmatization, inaccuracy and

<p>bureaucratic delay. Other issues for low-income people, such as inadequate sanitation (the 
&#8220;bucket system&#8221;, condominium sewers and pit latrines), should be immediately revisited, given 
the implications for their right to health. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur believes shortage of water and disconnections constitute a 
particular problem for those living with diseases, including cholera and diarrhoea, as well as 
people living with HIV/AIDS. According to the Joint United Nations Programme on 
HIV/AIDS,<b>60</b> almost 20 per cent of the population was infected by or suffered from HIV/AIDS 
in 2005 and although an additional amount of water can be made available for emergency 
situations, the beneficiaries have to be registered on the indigent record. The links between water 
and health suggest the need for a more generous free basic water allowance.<b>61</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Electricity 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the dramatic improvement that the country has made 
regarding access to electricity. Whilst only 36 per cent of the population had access to electricity 
in 1994, this had doubled to 72 per cent of the population in 2007. Nonetheless, large numbers of 
South Africans, in particular those living in poorer conditions, still have no access to electricity, 
while others have inadequate and unreliable supplies (sometimes less than 10 amperes input to 
households, not sufficient for cooking and heating). For instance, the residents of Mandelaville, a 
settlement upgraded by the Johannesburg Social Housing Company (JOSHCO), still have no 
access to electricity one year after they received their new houses. Moreover, houses have been 
built without connections for electricity. 
</p>
<p>79. It is expected that a system similar to the prepaid water meters system will be implemented 
targeting low-income households. The 50 kilowatt hours/month free basic electricity supply 
common in many municipalities and Eskom-supplied districts appears inadequate to provide 
citizens with their constitutional right to a decent home environment free of paraffin and 
dangerous particulates from indoor cooking/heating with dirty energy. 
</p>
<p>80. While the average cost of electricity in South Africa seems to be amongst the lowest 
among large middle income countries, government authorities informed the Special Rapporteur 
that rural households are paying five times the price that big companies do to access electricity. 
In this regard, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the authorities need to encourage 
economic activity, which provides employment and work, but highlights the necessity of 
affordable public service tariffs to enable low-income households to access and maintain 
services, and higher rates to discourage excessive consumption by large users.

</b> Regarding the water policy, the Special Rapporteur recalls the Committee on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights general comment No. 15 (2002) on the right to water (arts. 11 and 12) 
and its guidelines on the importance of ensuring sustainable access to water for all through, 
among others, the principles of economic accessibility and non-discrimination. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/16/Add.3 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Consultation and participation 
</b></p>
<p>81. Over many decades South African non-governmental organizations, community-based 
organizations, trade unions and social movements have played a critical role in the political 
discourse of the country and particularly in sustaining and consolidating the newly born 
democracy, although they have to cope with financial difficulties.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>82. During his visit the Special Rapporteur noted that there appears to be insufficient 
meaningful consultation between all levels of Government, civil society organizations and 
affected individuals and communities. Residents from every community facing possible eviction 
spoke with frustration about the lack of information on resettlement and relocation, as well as 
being denied the opportunity to participate in any stage of resettlement planning and 
implementation. The Special Rapporteur noted that there is a need to strengthen civil society 
networks, in order to share information and actively engage in participatory processes of 
designing and implementing policies aimed at realizing human rights. 
</p>
<p>83. As noted in &#8220;Breaking New Ground&#8221;, programmes aimed at delivering housing and 
creating sustainable human settlements will only succeed if affected people are directly informed 
and where the programmes are responsive and targeted to the specific needs of a given 
community.  
</p>
<p><b>G.  Women and housing 
</b></p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur has consistently noted that women are particularly vulnerable to 
inadequate housing, in particular single women, women with children, women from indigenous 
communities, women with disabilities, migrant women and women with HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the efforts of the South African Government at all 
levels to meet its goal of delivering 30 per cent of housing to women-headed households. 
However, the lack of affordable housing, lack of timely access to public housing, and inadequate 
government provisions for long-term safe housing, particularly in rural areas, means that many 
women are still forced either to remain in, or return to, situations of domestic violence, and 
continue to live in inadequate housing where they risk the safety and health of their children and 
themselves. Such situations violate not only the right of access to adequate housing but the 
human right to be free from violence, which is protected under the South African Constitution. 
The Special Rapporteur draws particular attention to the need for the State to strengthen national 
legal and policy frameworks for protecting women&#8217;s rights to adequate housing and to provide 
avenues for redress where violations occur. He also draws attention to the need to bridge the gap 
between legal and policy recognition of women&#8217;s right to adequate housing and implementation 
by States of national programmes to execute the legal and policy framework, including 
supporting initiatives by civil society groups to the same end.<b>62</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>62
</b>  The Special Rapporteur has presented various reports on women and adequate housing, 
</p>
<p>http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/housing/women.htm.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.3 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur was disturbed to receive the testimony of a woman who, in spite of 
having been in an abusive relationship for many years and having divorced her husband, was 
forced to continue to live with him because she had nowhere else to go. This woman had been on 
the public housing waiting list since 1996 but 10 years later was still waiting.  
</p>
<p>87. Although there are provisions guaranteeing women in South Africa inheritance and 
property rights, the Special Rapporteur was told about rural communities where widows or 
single women living on farms cannot apparently enjoy security of tenure due to gender 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b>H.  Vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the efforts recently undertaken to address the situation 
of some particularly vulnerable groups.<b>63</b> Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur believes that 
there is a critical lack of coordinated countrywide housing and support for people with particular 
housing requirements, including people with disabilities, those living with HIV/AIDS, orphaned 
children and young people, and the homeless. According to official data, the South African 
HIV-positive population is estimated at approximately 5.3 million.<b>64</b>  
</p>
<p>89. The Housing Act 1997 calls for &#8220;the meeting of special housing needs including, but not 
limited to, the needs of the disabled;&#8221; and &#8220;&#8230; the housing needs of marginalized women and 
other groups disadvantaged by unfair discrimination&#8221;.<b>65</b> Accordingly, housing development must 
provide the widest possible choice of housing and tenure options. Despite this legislative 
intention, the Special Rapporteur observed that there is no specific housing programme to 
address these groups. Housing for groups particularly vulnerable to discrimination is integrated 
into the National Housing Policy, and the intention is to allocate 5 per cent of the total houses 
delivered to special needs beneficiaries whose monthly income level is between ZAR 1,500 
and 7,500. This means that those living under this income threshold do not qualify for the 
subsidy and others need to wait several years on the housing lists, where there seems to be no 
provision for priority housing allocation on the basis of such specific requirements. 
</p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur welcomes initiatives that engage relevant groups in the design and 
implementation of housing policies targeting groups particularly vulnerable to discrimination. 
For instance, the draft special needs housing policy of the city of Cape Town is the outcome of a 
process of consultation with relevant organizations and service providers. It also includes input 
and comments from consultative workshops led by the city. In the meantime the first application

</p>
<p><b>IV.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the constitutional and legal emphasis given to the 
right to adequate housing, as well as the achievements of South Africa since the end of 
apartheid. He recommends that Member States study these examples and draw on South 
Africa&#8217;s experience in this field.  
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> The Special Rapporteur believes that South Africa should improve coordination 
amongst all government departments in charge of service delivery such as water, sanitation 
or electricity, and institutions in charge of implementing housing, land, health and social 
services policies, in order to ensure an integrated approach which recognizes the 
indivisibility of the human rights of individuals. 
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> The Special Rapporteur suggests that a clear implementation strategy backed by 
rigorous monitoring and evaluation, and which involves affected communities, should be 
formulated at each level of Government and support organizations, in order to implement 
well-designated policies, such as &#8220;Breaking New Ground&#8221;. 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> Revitalization of urban areas must take place in a way that genuinely promotes a 
socially and economically inclusive society. The redevelopment of urban areas must not be 
left only to market forces, as that could result in the exclusion of poor people from access to 
housing and livelihoods including essential public services. 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> South Africa should provide sufficient legal aid funding for civil and administrative 
law proceedings to ensure that people whose economic, social and cultural rights have been 
breached have proper access to affordable and quality legal representation to enforce their 
rights and seek redress, where appropriate, as provided for in the South African 
Constitution. 
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> The Special Rapporteur believes there is a need to monitor the implementation of 
court judgements that protect the right to housing at all levels of the South African 
judiciary system. Given the mandate of the South African Human Rights Commission 
(SAHRC), it would help achieve progress in the fulfilment of economic, social and cultural 
rights to provide the Commission with the necessary resources to monitor the 
implementation of Court judgements related to the realization of these rights. The SAHRC 
should increase its monitoring and investigative work on the realization and violation of 
economic, social and cultural rights. 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> Given the apparently widespread problem of forced evictions across the country, the 
Special Rapporteur calls for a halt in the introduction of new provincial bills regarding 
eradication of slums and evictions until all national, provincial and local legislation, policies 
and administrative actions have been brought into line with constitutional provisions, </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.3 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p><b>relevant Constitutional Court judgements, and international human rights standards 
that protect the human right to adequate housing and freedom from forced eviction.66 
</b></p>
<p>98<b>. Concerning evictions, the Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to implement 
relevant Constitutional Court judgements on the right to adequate housing and on forced 
evictions and to draw lessons from the human rights principles upheld in these judgments 
for the formulation of national, provincial and local housing law and policies. 
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> The authorities should prosecute all farmers who illegally evict farm workers. At the 
same time human rights education is necessary to ensure that all citizens know about their 
human right to housing and their right to be protected against eviction.  
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> In order to achieve the agreed land reform goals the Special Rapporteur calls for the 
adoption by the Government without delay of the recommendations of the 2005 Land 
Summit. The Special Rapporteur endorses the call for inclusive partnerships in which the 
Government works, in cooperation with social movements, landless people, farming 
communities and other actors, towards holistic agrarian reform.

<p>101.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to ensure that mining projects are in 
line with national regulations, and to assess the impact of mining activity on local 
populations. In situations such as in Limpopo Province, where there appear to be serious 
irregularities and human rights violations, the lease agreement should be reviewed. 
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> There must be commitment across all levels of Government to adequate consultation 
and participation of civil society in planning. This may require considering how to provide 
national and local funding of civil society organizations. South Africa may want to consider 
creating a mediation service carrying out the statutory obligations referred to in the 
Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act and the 
Extension of Security of Tenure Act and expanded to do relevant research, with the 
capacity to inform court judgements on evictions and able to provide up-to-date 
information to those seeking advice on housing issues.  
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> The Special Rapporteur highlights the importance that water has in the fulfilment of 
the right to the highest attainable standard of health, the right to adequate housing and the 
right to adequate food; he believes the prepayment meters may, as implemented currently, 
severely compromise the realization of numerous human rights and be contrary to the 
constitutional provisions guaranteeing the right to housing and the right to water. The 
Government should reconsider this policy and associated financing arrangements, in order 
to further improve its efforts to ensure the equitable access of all to water. The 
Government of South Africa could also consider developing a national water strategy, 
including the establishment of a national water regulator.

<p>104<b>. In pursuit of a continuing increase in comprehensive coverage of civic services, which 
are essential to the realization of the right to adequate housing, including water, electricity 
and sanitation, South Africa may wish to consider allocation of a greater share of the 
central budget to local municipalities. 
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that all possible measures be taken in order to 
ensure equal opportunities in access to housing. There is an urgent need to restructure the 
availability of rental housing for low-income groups, to guarantee security of tenure for 
tenants and to formulate a specific national policy for groups with specific housing 
requirements (special housing needs). 
</b>106.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages South Africa to consider ratifying the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, so as to reflect in its 
international legal obligations the same progressive approach enshrined in its Constitution,  
and to consider carefully the implementation of concluding observations formulated by the 
United Nations human rights treaty bodies, as well as the recommendations made by 
special procedures of the Human Rights Council.
