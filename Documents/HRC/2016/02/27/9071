<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the context of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component 
of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this 
context, receives a large number of communications alleging violations of the right to adequate 
housing and related rights worldwide. Such communications are received from national, regional 
and international non-governmental organizations, as well as intergovernmental organizations 
and other United Nations procedures concerned with the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>2. The present addendum to the annual report of the Special Rapporteur contains, on a 
country-by-country basis, summaries of communications sent by the Special Rapporteur to 
States, responses received from States, observations of the Special Rapporteur, and follow-up 
communications and activities relating to earlier communications, from the period of 
5 December 2007 to 5 December 2008 and replies received for the period of 24 January 2008 to 
6 February 2009. A number of the communications contained in the present report were sent by 
the former Special Rapporteur, Mr. Miloon Kothari. 
</p>
<p>3. Where appropriate, the Special Rapporteur has sent joint urgent appeals or letters with one 
or more special procedures of the Human Rights Council where the allegations raised concerned 
the right to adequate housing as well as rights addressed under other mandates. 
</p>
<p>4. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur sent a total of <b>34 communications</b> 
concerning the right to adequate housing to 25 States. Of these <b>34 communications</b> transmitted, 
<b>17 replies were received from Governments</b>. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur appreciates and thanks the concerned States for these replies. 
However, she regrets that several Governments have failed to respond, or when they have, have 
done so in a selective manner that does not respond to all the questions arising from the 
communication. These communications remain outstanding and the Special Rapporteur 
encourages Governments to respond to every communication, and all concerns raised in each 
communication. 
</p>
<p>6. A large number of the communications in the period under review are related to cases of 
forced evictions. Forced evictions constitute prima facie violations of a wide range of 
internationally recognized human rights and large-scale evictions can only be carried out under 
exceptional circumstances and in full accordance with international human rights law. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that in the majority of cases, state authorities carrying out evictions 
appear completely unaware of the state&#8217;s human rights obligations, in particular the need for 
assessing the impact of evictions on individual and communities, the need to consider eviction 
only as a last resort after having envisaged all other options, meaningful consultation with 
affected communities, adequate prior notification, adequate relocation and compensation. The 
Special Rapporteur reminds all states that eviction should never result in rendering people 
homeless and putting them in a vulnerable situation. In this context, the Special Rapporteur </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>reminds all Governments of the Basic principles and guidelines on development-based evictions 
and displacement that can be used as a tool to prevent human rights violations in cases where 
evictions are unavoidable.<b>1</b>  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the reports that the mandate continue to receive 
in regards to threats, harassment, and imprisonment of human rights defenders, community 
representatives and activists working on the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur believes in the importance of engaging in a constructive dialogue 
with States aimed at implementing and realizing the right to adequate housing. The 
communications sent by the Special Rapporteur have to be understood in this context. In a spirit 
of cooperation, the Special Rapporteur urges all States and other actors to respond promptly to 
the communications, to immediately take appropriate measures, to investigate allegations of the 
violation of the right to adequate housing and related rights and to take all steps necessary to 
redress the situation.  
</p>
<p>9. To the extent that resources available to the mandate permit, the Special Rapporteur 
continues to follow up on communications sent and monitor the situation where no reply has 
been received, where the reply received was not considered satisfactory or where questions 
remain outstanding. The Special Rapporteur also invites the sources that have reported the 
alleged cases of violations, to review cases and responses included in this report, and send, when 
appropriate, follow-up information for further consideration of the cases.

<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>12. On 27 December 2007, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
Right to Food and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people sent a joint allegation letter to the Government of Bangladesh to 
inquire about reports alleging forced evictions and illegal land seizures in the Sadhana Tila area 
and other Jumma indigenous communities in Chittagong Hill Tracks. According to the 
information the Special Rapporteur received, in August 2007, Bangladesh army personnel, led 
by the Dighinala Army Zone Commander, Major Kamrul Hassan, ordered the eviction of the 
Sadhana Tila area, in Dighinala Upazilla, Khagrachari Hill District, an area compromising 
approximately 300 acres of land that houses a Buddhist Meditation Center and Jumma 
indigenous village, with the objective of allowing for the settlement of 800 non-indigenous 
settler families. The settlement plan of Sadhana Tila allegedly involved high-ranking officials of 
the Bangladeshi Army, which have reportedly put pressure on the Baghaichari Mouza No. 50, on 
the Union Council Chairman, and other local elders to agree to the settlement plan. As the local 
Jumma community refused to comply with the eviction order, the military have reportedly forced 
the gradual removal of the Jumma community from their traditional lands. In the meantime, 
military trucks and jeeps have reportedly transported settler families into Sadhana Tila. These 
settlers have reportedly started to clear the jungle around the Buddhist temple and to build their 
houses under the protection and command of the Army and of the police personnel. The Army 
personnel have reportedly been actively involved in the clearing of jungle areas around the 
Kamala Bagan School, near Sadhana Tila Buddhist temple. The army personnel have reportedly 
announced an incentive grant of Taka 50,000 for each settler family who will be willing to settle 
in the area, in addition to Taka 1,000 as monthly allowance. The army personnel have also 
reportedly threatened to cut free food rations to those settlers who do not want to settle in 
Sadhana Tila area. In the meantime, the local administrator of Dighinala has been allegedly 
asked to provide forged land documents to the settlers. It was reported that the case of the 
Sadhana Tila area is part of a wider trend of illegal occupation of the Jumma&#8217;s traditional lands 
in the Chittagong Hill Tracks in Bangladesh since the Caretaker Government declared the State 
of Emergency in January 1997. These cases have reportedly led in many instances to the forced 
eviction of Jumma families, with the active support of members of the security forces. The 
special Rapporteur has received information about different cases in a recent period, including 
the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In March 2007, more than 400 Mro indigenous families were order to their ancestral 
lands in the vicinities of the forcefully evicted from their traditional lands in the 
vicinities of the Ruma military cantonment, in Ruma Upazila Parishad, Bandarban </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>district. This eviction followed the reported irregular purchase of 7,570 acres of land 
belonging to the Mro community from the military, in which neither the Mro leaders 
nor the affected communities were reportedly consulted.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; In May 2007, about one hundred settlers reportedly took possession of a total of 37 
acres of hilly land belonging to nine Jumma families in the village of Betchari, 
Rengkarjya Mouza, Merung District. It is reported that Chongrachari army camp 
commander Subedar Siraj provided protection to the settlers, who have already built 
their houses on the occupied land.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; In June 2007, 12 Jumma families were reportedly evicted by the Military from their 
traditional lands in Dhankupya village, in Khagrachari district, in order to give ground 
to the settlement of at least 200 non-indigenous families. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In early July 2007, a total of 200 allegedly illegal settler families occupied the lands 
belonging to the local Jumma villagers in East Gamaridhala, Dadkuppya Mouza 
(No. 259), Khagrachari District. The settelers were allegedly brought from different 
parts of the district including Bhuachari, Mahalchari, Chongrachari, Manikchari, 
Joysen Para, Kala Pahar, Maischari and Shalbon cluster village. According to the 
reports, the army personnel directly planned and implemented the settlement. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 19 July 2007, Betchari Sub-zone Commander Major Kamrul Hassan reported called 
for an unsolicited arbitration between Jumma communities and irregular settlers in his 
military camp in Bara Merung, Dighinala Upazila, Khagrachari District. As a result of 
his verbal judgment, 5.2 acres of land traditionally belonging to three Jumma villagers, 
but which were not officially recorded, were given way to other three settler families.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; In an operation lasting from 1 to 15 August 2007, a large number of settlers reportedly 
occupied 300 acres of hilly land belonging to 17 Jumma families in Kobakhali Mouza 
(No. 51), Dighinala Thana, Khagracahri District, under the alleged protection of the 
Military. Approximately 85 non-indigenous families have reportedly settled in the area, 
and have now cleared the jungle of the occupied lands and are in process is on to 
construct houses. According to the reports, the Military intends to settle a total of 200 
families.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; According to the information received, in another recent case of land-grabbing, illegal 
settlers have reportedly taken over 59 acres of land belonging to 17 Jumma indigenous 
people in Kobakhali mouza, under Dighinala police station, in Khagracahari district. 
Moreover, in an operation lasting from 1st to 15th August 2007, large groups of settlers 
led by former Union Parishad (UP) member Mohammed Abu Taleb of Hashinchonpur 
village and former UP member Mohammed Kader of Kobakhali bazar took control of 
the hilly lands belonging to Chakma people with the direct assistance of the army, the 
paramilitary forces and the local Village Defence Party (VDP) members. Due to the 
presence of the Bangladesh security forces, which provided protection to the illegal 
setters, the Jummas could not offer any resistance. Presently, works for construction of 
houses in the lands seized from the indigenous peoples are reportedly underway. The 
army has reportedly planned to settle 200 plain settlers&#8217; families in Kobakhali Mouza.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In September 2007, an estimated 250 acres of titled lands belonging to Jumma people in 
North and South Shantipur, Sutokorma and Manikkya villages, Choto Panchari Mouza 
(No. 246), under Latiban Union of Panchari Thana, Khagrachari district, have been 
illegally occupied by non-indigenous settlers. 
</p>
<p>13. It was reported that all these actions may be in violation of article 26 (1) of the 1997 
Chittagong Hill Tracks Accord provides that &#8220;[n]otwithstanding anything contained in any law 
for the time-being in force, no land within the boundaries of Hill District shall be given in 
settlement, purchased, sold and transferred including giving lease without prior approval of the 
[Chittagong Hill Tracks] Council.&#8221; In addition, it was reported that in those cases in which the 
Jumma villages lack a title deed over their traditional lands, the authorities consider them to be 
State land, freely disposing of it to facilitate the settlement of non-indigenous settlers. Concern 
was expressed that these cases may be part of a systematic campaign to support the settlement of 
non-indigenous families in the Chittagong Hill Tracks, with the active support of the security 
forces, with an ultimate view to outnumber the local Jumma indigenous community in the 
region.  
</p>
<p>14. On 3 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the Right 
to Food and Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people sent a joint allegation letter to the Government of Bangladesh to inquire about 
reports concerning the alleged illegal seizure of the traditional lands of Jumma indigenous 
communities in Barbadan, Khagrachari and Merung districts, in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. 
Between March 2007 and the date of this communication, an estimated 4,500 acres of land have 
been reportedly taken away from Jumma individual and communities in at least 16 villages or 
commons belonging to five Unions (Dighinala, Kiang-ghat, Kamalchari, Khagrachari No.1, and 
Maischari,) in Kagrachari district. The names of the villages in which these episodes have 
reportedly taken place are the following: 
</p>
<p> 1. Sadhana Tila Budhist Temple, Dighinala Union 
</p>
<p> 2. East Gamaridhala, Kamalchari Union 
</p>
<p> 3. Tholipara, Non chari, Khagrachari Union (No.1) 
</p>
<p> 4. Headman Para, Noon chari, Khagrachari Union (No.1) 
</p>
<p> 5. Rangapanichara, Kiang-ghat Union

<p> 16. South Joysen Para Community Primary School, Maischari Union 
</p>
<p>15. The mandate holders indicated that similar patterns seem to have taken in other districts. 
By way of illustration, in May 2007, about one hundred settlers reportedly took possession of a 
total of 37 acres of hilly land belonging to nine Jumma families in the village of Betchari, 
Rengkarjya Mouza, Merung District. In the Barbadan district, more than 400 Mro indigenous 
families were reportedly forcefully evicted from their traditional lands in the vicinities of the 
Ruma military cantonment, in Ruma Upazila Parishad, in March 2007, following the alleged 
irregular purchase of 7,570 acres of land. It is reported that the Government is currently in the 
process of acquiring 9,560 acres of land for further expansion of the Garrison. According to the 
allegations, these lands have been illegally and forcibly grabbed by Bengali settlers from 
different cluster villages gathered around army camps. It is reported that army personnel were 
directly involved in all these cases, creating a climate of fear among the local Jumma villagers 
and instigating the settlers to seize their lands. In other cases, army personnel have reportedly 
given grants to settler family willing to build their houses in the area. In other cases, army 
personnel have been allegedly been directly involved in the planning and implementation of the 
settlement. It is also reported that army personnel have actively assisted the settlers in the 
construction of houses in the allegedly seized lands. Finally, in other instances, local 
administrators have been reportedly asked to provide forged land documents to the settlers. In 
many of the reported cases of eviction, the indigenous families have been forced to leave their 
homesteads, as well as their domestic fruit gardens, bamboo and teak orchards, on which they 
traditionally rely for their subsistence economies. It was reported that the cases reported above 
may be in violation of article 26 (1) of the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracks Accord provides that 
&#8220;[n]otwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time-being in force, no land within the 
boundaries of Hill District shall be given in settlement, purchased, sold and transferred including 
giving lease without prior approval of the [Chittagong Hill Tracks] Council.&#8221; In addition, it was 
reported that in those cases in which the Jumma villages lack a title deed over their traditional 
lands, the authorities consider them to be State land, freely disposing of it to facilitate the 
settlement of non-indigenous settlers. Concern was expressed that these cases may be part of a 
systematic campaign to support the settlement of non-indigenous families in the Chittagong Hill 
Tracks, with the active support of the security forces, with an ultimate view to outnumber the 
local Jumma indigenous community in the region. Concern was further expressed that this 
process may be deliberately taking place to coincide with the state of emergency imposed on 
11 January 2007 by the Caretaker Government. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the 
facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on the details, and 
where available the results, of any investigation, and judicial or other inquiries which may have 
been carried out in relation to this case; whether complaints have been lodged; if no inquiries 
were realized, an explanation to that effect; any penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions 
that were imposed on the alleged perpetrators; and if any compensation has been provided to the 
victims or their families. </p>

</p>
<p>16. On 8 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression sent a joint allegation 
letter to the Government of Bangladesh regarding information they received concerning 
Mr. Rabindra Ghosh, the President of the Dhaka Chapter of the Human Rights Congress for 
Bangladesh Minorities (HRCBM). Mr. Ghosh was previously the subject of an urgent appeal 
sent by the then-Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders on 30 August 2005 and an urgent appeal sent by the then-Special Representative 
together with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing and the Independent Expert 
on minority issues, on 10 August 2007. Mr. Ghosh has reportedly been subject to intimidation 
and threats following his investigation of a land conflict in Jaintapur between four individuals 
belonging to a minority group and officials of the Jainta Press Club. Officers at Jainta Station 
allegedly refused to file a complaint on behalf of the four claimants. On 29 April 2008, 
Mr. Ghosh was contacted by a police officer, who warned him not to investigate the matter any 
further; allegedly threatening him with criminal charges and personal injury. Mr. Ghosh claims 
he reported this incident to the Deputy Commissioner of Sylhet, who reportedly did not pursue 
the complaint. Mr. Ghosh subsequently filed a complaint regarding the incident at the Jaintapur 
Police Station. The Special Rapporteurs are concerned that the intimidation and threats to 
Mr. Rabindra Ghosh may be directly related to his activities in defense of human rights, in 
particular land rights and rights of minority groups. In addition to comments on the accuracy of 
the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information if any 
complaint has been lodged; on details, and where available the results, of any investigation and 
judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case; and full details of any prosecutions 
which have been undertaken. 
</p>
<p><b>Responses received 
</b></p>
<p>17. On 4 February 2009, the Government of Bangladesh replied to the joint allegation letter 
sent by the Special Rapporteur on 8 July 2008 which was a follow up to a previous joint urgent 
appeal (for the summary of this urgent appeal, please refer to the Special Rapporteur Report: 
A/HRC/7/16/Add.1). .The Government informed that on 16 April 2008, Mr. Rabindra Gosh 
visited Jaintapur Upazilla to conduct an enquiry into the Police Case No. 19 dated 19.6.2008 
lodged in Jaintapur Police station. As Mr. Rabindra Gosh could not talk with Upazilla Nirbahi 
Officer (Head of Sub-District administration), once back to Dhaka he had a phone conversation 
with him. The Government indicated that allegedly during this conversation each side 
intimidated the other side and that both filed general diary with the Jaintapur Police station 
concerning the threats received. Neither Mr. Rabindra Gosh nor the Upazila Nirbahi Officer did 
proceed any further with their complaints made against each other. The Government further 
informed that the Police case No. 19 dated 19.6.2008, was lodged by Mr. A.K.M. Kudrat Ullah, 
Secretary of Jaintapur Press Club and the accused persons were Ajoy Dev, Apu Dev, Pappa Dev 
and Suckla Rani Dev. The accused had been enjoying a 17 decimal of land since 1980, which is 
owned by the Government and she was alleged to have illegally encroached Government land. 
The Government decided to evacuate illegal occupants of Government lands, including the 
portion of land illegally occupied by Suckla Rani and decided to award this land to the Jaintapur 
Press Club. The accused persons protested while the press club authorities started to erect the 
office premises. This issue ended up in violence and several persons of press club were injured 
by the other group. The Government indicated that this case was investigated and charges were </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>proved against the accused and it is now pending before the court. The Government finally 
assured that it is always aware to uphold, protect, promote and implement the human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of minorities in accordance with the law of the land.  
</p>
<p>18. On 11 April 2008, the Permanent Mission of Bangladesh acknowledged receipt of the 
communication of 3 April 2008 and channeling it to the capital. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted any reply to his communications dated 27 December 2007 and 
3 April 2008.

<p>20. On 3 April 2008 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression sent a joint allegation 
letter to the Government of Brazil regarding information they received concerning the reported 
attack against the human rights defender Mr. Welinton da Silva, member of the Movimento Sem 
Terra (MST) (Movement of Landless Peasants) which is a part of the V&#237;a Campesina network 
that is currently supporting the rights of the communities being affected by the construction of a 
dam in Estreito, Maranh&#227;o. The hydroelectric project requires the flooding of 400 square 
kilometres, affecting the lands and homes of 21,000 people, including the African-Brazilian 
communities of Bico do Papagayo. On 11 March 2008, at 11.30 pm, Mr. da Silva was attacked 
while participating in an on-site demonstration in a quarry in Estreito, Maranh&#227;o, to protest 
against the building of a dam. He was sleeping in the camp of Movimento dos Antingidos por 
Barragens [MAB] (Movement of Dam-affected People), in the workers&#8217; area of the quarry, when 
he was shot in the leg by an individual who reportedly fired gunshots from a passing car. 
Mr. da Silva was taken to the Municipal Hospital in Estreito where he received treatment for his 
injuries. The demonstration at the quarry formed part of protests to mark the International Day of 
Action against Dams and for Rivers, Water and Life, on 14 March. Participants were calling for 
further studies to be undertaken to investigate the impact the project is to have on the River 
Tocantins, as well as for compensation to be given to the communities that are to be displaced as 
a result of the construction of the dam. It is feared that Mr. da Silva has been targeted as a result 
of his human rights activities, in particular his work to defend the land rights of communities in 
Brazil. The Special Rapporteurs are concerned about the physical and psychological integrity of 
Mr. da Silva and other members of the MST. Attacks against defenders working on the 
protection of the environment and land rights in several reports form part of a trend which has 
been detected by the Special Representative both in her report on the visit to Brazil 
(A/HRC/4/37/Add.2) and in some of her thematic reports. &#8220;According to the statistics of 
communications sent by the Special Representative, the second most vulnerable group when it 
comes to the danger of being killed because of their activities in the defense of human rights, are 
defenders working on land rights and natural resources.&#8221; (A/HRC/4/37, para. 45). The mandate 
holders reminded the Government of Brazil of the recommendations of the Special 
Representative contained in her report on the visit to Brazil (A/HRC/4/37/Add.2). In particular, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>in paragraph 102 the Special Representative recommended that &#8220;the State must play a more 
proactive role in mediation of social conflict and in giving legitimacy to interventions by human 
rights defenders to promote and protect economic, social and cultural rights. In particular 
defenders must not be left isolated in their struggle for or support of social justice against 
powerful or influential social entities and economic interests [&#8230;]&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing has repeatedly drawn the attention of the international community to the 
worrying practice of forced evictions worldwide. Forced evictions constitute prima facie 
violations of a wide range of internationally recognized human rights and large-scale evictions 
can only be carried out under exceptional circumstances and in full accordance with international 
human rights law. In view of this, the Special Rapporteur has developed a set of guidelines, 
presented to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/4/18) aiming at assisting States in developing 
policies and legislation to prevent forced evictions at the domestic level. In this context, the 
mandate holders remind the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in his mission 
report to Brazil (E/CN.4/2005/48/Add.3). The mandate holders urge the Government of Brazil to 
take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned 
person are respected and that accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations is 
ensured, and request that the government adopt effective measures to prevent the recurrence of 
these acts. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special 
Rapporteurs requested further information on the details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examination, and judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried 
out in relation to this case; if no inquiries were realized, an explanation to that effect; if a 
complaint has been lodged; on any measures adopted to ensure the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. da Silva and other members of the MST; on the measures adopted to implement 
the recommendations of the Special Representative contained in her report on the visit to Brazil 
and in particular the recommendation of paragraph 102 (A/HRC/4/37/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>21. On 21 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to food sent a joint allegation letter as regards of information received concerning the 
forcible eviction of 300 families belonging to the rural communities known as Riacho Grande, 
Salina da Brinca, Jurema and Melancia, in the municipality of Casa Nova, state of Bahia. These 
families claim to be established in and cultivating, the lands they were evicted from for decades. 
According to the information received, in the early morning of 6 January 2008, agents of the 
civil, military and federal police, under the supervision of a judicial officer, proceeded to 
implement a judicial order to evict the families belonging to the communities of Riacho Grande, 
Salina da Brinca, Jurema and Melancia from the lands they claimed to be established in for 
decades under the regime of Fundo de Pasto, a traditional and legally recognized form of living 
in which the use and cultivation of the land is performed on a communal basis. Reportedly, the 
police acted violently, destroying houses, plantations, fences and stables, besides demanding the 
immediate withdrawal of all beehives maintained by the families to produce and sell honey. In 
addition, it was reported that private security guards hired by two entrepreneurs who claimed 
title over the lands participated in the destruction of the small farmers&#8217; facilities. Also, it was 
alleged that even after the incident the private security guards continued to go to the area and to 
systematically destroy any trace of occupation of the land by these families. Faced with this 
situation, on 16 March 2008, the affected families made an attempt to reoccupy their alleged 
traditional lands in order to avoid the continuous destruction of their indispensable means of 
living. It was reported that on 17 March 2008 they were violently repressed by the private 
security guards, who were heavily armed. The guards started shooting indistinctly and harassing </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>the people. Women and children were beaten up and four children were used as human shields. 
A woman that was photographing some of the abuses perpetrated was aggressed and had her 
camera destroyed by the guards. Later on the same day the police arrived to contain the violence 
and to re-establish public order. 
</p>
<p>22. According to the information received, for over a century the traditional communities were 
settled in the same area. The dispute over those lands started in 1980, when they were 
supposedly acquired by a private company despite the fact that the aforesaid communities 
occupied and cultivated the lands long before that date. The company was established and 
became operational in a great part of the lands, which caused the families to lose part of the lands 
where they raised animals and cultivated. Notwithstanding the presence of the company, the 
families continued to occupy and earn their livelihoods from the lands that were not seized by 
the company. A few years later, the company went bankrupt and the communities reoccupied the 
totality of the lands. Even though the former Land Institute of Bahia (INTERBA - Institute de 
Terras da Bahia) measured and delimitated part of the land at that time, its work was never 
completed. Additionally, numerous requests were made by the families to the National Institute 
for Land Settlement and Agrarian Reform (INCRA - Instituto Nacional de Coloniza&#231;&#227;o e 
Reforma Agr&#225;ria) to come up with a reasonable solution, which, unfortunately, did not occur. It 
appears that after the company went bankrupt, the Bank of Brazil became its main creditor, 
having financed many of the company&#8217;s projects. The bank ended up ceding its credit to two 
entrepreneurs. As the lands were given as a guarantee for the bank loans, the two entrepreneurs 
initiated a judicial procedure claiming title of ownership over the disputed lands. The judge of 
first instance confirmed their title and, as a consequence, rendered the order to evict the families 
that occupied the lands. The families claim the judgment to be null and void, particularly because 
due process was not observed in the proceedings. A representative of the Office of the 
Prosecutor was not notified to intervene, which should be mandatory in cases were collective 
rights are at stake. The Special Rapporteurs added that although they aware of the recently 
adopted judicial decision to reintegrate the families into the disputed lands, concern is still 
expressed for the living conditions of these families, in particular, their right to adequate housing 
and food. Allegedly, many houses and facilities needed for the families&#8217; livelihoods were 
destroyed. In addition, they expressed concern for the security of the evicted families during and 
after the reintegration procedure, especially for the possible presence of private security guards 
in the area. The Special Rapporteurs referred to the General Comment No. 4 of The Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which stresses that the right to housing should not be 
interpreted in a narrow or restrictive sense such as merely having a roof over one&#8217;s head; rather, 
it should be seen as the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity. It is also stated in 
this document that all persons should possess a degree of security of tenure which guarantees 
legal protection against forced eviction, harassment and other threats. In addition to comments 
on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further 
information on the legal status of the lands or, if it is the case, the stage of the judicial 
proceedings that are in place to settle the dispute over the lands; the measures adopted to 
guarantee the security of the families during and after the implementation of the reintegration 
order, especially in respect to the presence of private security guards in the area; the measures 
adopted in order to provide the families concerned with shelter and livelihood and indications on 
whether the Government is undertaking the necessary measures in order to provide the families 
concerned with reparation for their losses. </p>

<p>23. On 13 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government 
of Brazil to inquire about reports that, on October 23rd of that year, 1.000 families 
(approximately 6,000 people including a number of children and elderly people) were forcibly 
evicted by the Military Police, from the area they had occupied since early September of that 
year. The 170.000 square meters corresponded to Varuna Real Estate Ventures, an enterprise 
belonging to the economic group Construtora C.R. Almeida. According to reports received, the 
eviction was executed following a decision by the 19th Civil Chamber of the Central Court of 
Curitiba granting the reinstatement of possession to the enterprise Varuna Real Estate Ventures. 
Reportedly, in its decision, the Court had not requested any alternative or temporary shelter for 
the occupants. Previous to this Court decision, in September 2008, the residents and housing 
movement supporters - such as the UNMP (National Union for Popular Housing) and the CMP 
(Center for Popular Movements) - would have allegedly sent several official communications to 
the concerned organs of the Curitiba Municipality and the Paran&#225; State, requesting them to 
mediate in order to reach a solution. However, it was reported that nor the Municipality, neither 
the Paran&#225; State authorities would have entered into dialogue with the residents in order to find 
an alternative solution to the forced eviction. During the forced eviction, the Military Police, 
including officials from the Shock Battalion, would have allegedly used against the residents&#8217; 
peaceful protest tear gas, rubber bullets and trained dogs. It was reported that more than fifteen 
people would have resulted injured by the action of the Military Police, among them an eight 
years-old boy, and a filmmaker - Mr. Anderson Leandro from &#8220;Quem TV,&#8221; who would have 
been shot in the face. It was further alleged that the persons affected by the forced eviction 
would be in very precarious conditions and it seems that no temporary location would have been 
provided to the majority of them and as a consequence they would have been rendered 
homelessness. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special 
Rapporteur requested further information on the measures that have been taken to ensure that the 
eviction was in accordance with Brazil&#8217;s obligations under international human rights law, in 
particular, information on any consultation undertaken with those affected; measures foreseen by 
the authorities to ensure that the eviction do not result in homelessness of the affected persons; 
on details on what was foreseen in terms of relocation of the affected people and if relocation 
sites have been designated, on the exact location, including on the quality of land and access to 
public services and livelihood; if any assistance, financial or otherwise was provided in relation 
to the evictions from the occupied area in the Fazendinha Neighborhood in Curitiba. She also 
requested information on the current situation of the families affected by the eviction, including 
information on the persons who were rendered homeless; details, and, where available, the 
results, of any investigation, which may have been carried out in relation to the use of undue 
force by law enforcement official during the eviction.

<p>25. On 20 March 2008 The Special Rapporteur together with the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers sent a joint 
urgent appeal to the Government of Cambodia regarding information they had received 
regarding Mr. Pring Pov, aged 40, a police officer in the town of Kep. According to the 
information received: &#8220;On 19 February 2008, he was arrested without a warrant by his superior, 
Mr. Ing Sam Ol, Police Commissioner of Kep, and charged with &#8216;disobeying orders from his 
superiors&#8217;. This stemmed from his refusal to vacate his land without compensation for the benefit 
of a senior government official, Eng Marie. The arrest was carried out on the order of the 
National Police Commissioner, General Hok Lundy. After his arrest, Mr. Pov was transferred to 
the Police Discipline Unit located in Samaki village, Trapeang Krasaing commune, Russey Keo 
district, where he has been detained ever since. When his wife, Ms. Yin Neang, visited him on 
20 February, he had open wounds on his wrists and ankles because he was shackled all night, as 
well as bruises on his chest. Despite his worsening mental and physical condition, 
General Hok Lundy has denied Mr. Pov a visit by a medical doctor, even after his wife brought a 
doctor to the detention facility herself. The legally permitted period of police custody of 72 
hours, within which a detainee must be brought before a court to be charged, in accordance with 
article 96 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, has been exceeded. Mr. Pov was denied his right to 
access to legal counsel within the first 24 hours after his arrest in violation of article 92 of the 
Code. Medical treatment of prisoners in police custody is left to the discretionary power of the 
prosecutor and the custody officer, according to article 99 of the Code. It was reported that the 
Cambodian police have no jurisdiction over land disputes. Only the municipal or provincial 
National Cadastral Commissions for unregistered land, the courts of law for registered land, and 
the National Authority for the Resolution of Land Disputes for unclear or politically related 
disputes are competent in such matters. Concerns were expressed for the state of health of 
Mr. Pring Pov. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the 
Special Rapporteurs requested further information if any complaint has been lodged by or on 
behalf of the alleged victim; on the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case; on the 
legal basis for the arrest and detention of Mr. Pring Pov and how these measures are compatible 
with applicable international human rights norms and standards as stipulated, inter alia, in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>26. On 3 April 2008 the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the right 
to food and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people, sent a joint allegation letter regarding information received on the alleged 
illegal seizure of the lands traditionally belonging to the indigenous Jarai people in Kong Yu and 
Kong Thom villages, Pate commune, O&#8217;Yadao district, in Ratanakiri province. The reported 
situation concerns over 500 hectares of traditional lands belonging to approximately 65 Jarai 
villagers, which have been reportedly seized by irregular means by an entrepreneur, 
Ms. Keat Kolney. Information was transmitted to the Special Rapporteurs concerning the alleged 
land-grabbing and illegal sale of indigenous Jarai land. According to the information received, in 
March 2004, four Pate commune officials and the Kong Yu village chief made several attempts </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>to persuade villagers from Kong Yu to sell their communal land to a buyer from Phnom Penh. 
The villagers refused to sell the land, stating that it was required for farming and the future needs 
of the community. On the last occasion, local officials reportedly claimed the land was State land 
and did not belong to the villagers, and said it was required to provide land to disabled soldiers 
from Prime Minister Hun Sen&#8217;s army. The villagers understood that they did not have a choice, 
and agreed to donate an area of 50 hectares for this purpose. According to the reports, in 
August 2004, Ms. Keat Kolney, an entrepreneur, visited Kong Yu with the O&#8217;Yadao district 
governor, Pate commune chief and the village chief, and distributed envelopes with money and 
gifts of sarongs to each family. Before receiving the money and gifts, the villagers were asked to 
thumbprint documents which they could not read, as the majority of villagers in Kong Yu and 
Kong Thom do not speak, read or write Khmer. Following the ceremony, the commune and 
village chiefs took the envelopes from the villagers. The next day, the village chief reportedly 
delivered an amount of money to each family, widow and single person in Kong Yu. The 
villagers reportedly understood that the money and the gifts had been given as sign of gratitude 
for the donation of 50 hectares to disabled soldiers, agreed in March 2004. However, they were 
subsequently informed that they were the payment for the sale of 500 hectares of land to 
Ms. Keat Kolney. These 500 hectares included 180 hectares of land that was managed and used 
by Kong Thom villagers, pursuant to a longstanding agreement between the two villages. It was 
reported that, shortly afterwards, personnel working for Ms. Keat Kolney started clearing the 
land to create a rubber plantation, destroying villagers&#8217; crops. Since then, the company has 
denied villagers access to the land, preventing its use as a grazing area for cattle and for planting 
further crops. It was reported that all these actions are in violation of articles 23 to 28 of the Land 
Law, which recognize the rights of indigenous communities to collective ownership of their 
lands. According to Article 265 of the Land Law, it is a penal offence for an authority to commit 
an infringement against the land rights of an indigenous community. Further, it is reported that 
the alleged sale of the land to Ms. Keat Kolney is invalid under the Contract Law due to fraud. 
Information received also mentioned legal action against Ms. Keat Kolney and alleged 
intimidation on indigenous villagers and their lawyers. According to the information received, 
since October 2004, representatives of Kong Yu village have sought assistance from 
non-governmental organizations (NGO) in order to obtain the return of the land irregularly 
seized from them. Since 2005, Kong Yu villagers have been represented by lawyers from the 
Community Legal Education Center (CLEC) and Legal Aid of Cambodia (LAC). 
</p>
<p>27. In October 2004, Kong Yu representatives reportedly filed a complaint with the local 
administrative office in Ratanakiri, requesting the dissolution of the Pate commune council due 
to its role in facilitating the fraudulent deal. In January 2007, six representatives from Kong Yu 
and six representatives from Kong Thom, whose names are on file with the Special Rapporteur, 
filed a civil complain with the Ratanakiri provincial court, seeking the cancellation of the 
contract of sale on the basis of fraud, and the return of the land. The villagers sought the return of 
450 hectares of land, as they had agreed to give 50 hectares to disabled soldiers. Also in 
January 2007, the 12 village representatives filed a criminal complaint with the Ratanakiri 
provincial prosecutor, requesting that Ms. Keat Kolney, the former Kong Yu village chief, five 
Pate commune officials, the O&#8217;Yadao district governor and two others be charged with fraud, 
forgery of private documents, corruption, bribery and infringement of the land rights of 
indigenous communities. Reportedly, the Provincial Prosecutor has investigated the complaint, 
questioning Ms. Keat Kolney and others, but has not yet decided whether to pursue criminal 
charges against the above-mentioned individuals. In June 2007, Ms. Keat Kolney filed a criminal </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>complaint against the 12 village representatives, their lawyers from CLEC and LAC, and two 
representatives of Ratanakiri-based NGOs. She requested the Ratanakiri provincial prosecutor to 
investigate the case and pursue charges of fraud, defamation, incitement leading to the 
commission of a crime, incitement not leading to the commission of a crime and complicity in an 
offence. The Provincial Prosecutor is reportedly investigating this complaint. In July 2007, the 
former Kong Yu village chief, named in the villagers&#8217; criminal complaint, and a representative 
of Ms. Keat Kolney&#8217;s company, the Progressive Farmers Association, brought the village 
representatives to the provincial court for questioning by the Prosecutor&#8217;s clerk, in connection 
with the criminal complaint filed by Ms. Keat Kolney. They remained during the questioning, 
and the former village chief translated when the villagers did not understand questions in Khmer. 
He reportedly asked them to speak in favor of the company, threatening them that they would 
otherwise not be able to return home. The villagers&#8217; lawyers subsequently requested the formal 
annulment of the statements made to the Prosecutor&#8217;s clerk. However, it is reported that these 
statements have been submitted as evidence in the civil case by Ms. Keat Kolney&#8217;s lawyer. In 
November 2007 and January 2008, the prosecutor himself questioned the village representatives 
with their lawyers present. The lawyers and NGO representatives have not yet been called for 
questioning. Concern has been expressed about the prospect of the villagers facing criminal 
charges as a result of their efforts to seek an effective remedy in relation to this case, and the 
proper and equitable application of the law and legal process. Alleged restrictions on 
communities, lawyers and civil society organizations defending human rights were also 
mentioned in the information the Special Rapporteurs received. It was reported that since the 
villagers filed their action against Ms. Keat Kolney, freedoms of assembly and movement have 
been restricted in and around Kong Yu on a number of occasions. In February 2006, 
approximately 200 Kong Yu villagers gathered at the Pate commune office in order to voice their 
concerns and seek information on the company clearing their land. Commune officials reportedly 
accused the villagers of holding a demonstration and causing unrest, and threatened village 
leaders with arrest if any further demonstrations were held. In September and November 2007, 
local police reportedly prevented representatives from the NGOs Cambodian Center for Human 
Rights and the Voice of Democracy from holding public forums in the village, citing security 
concerns. On 23 October 2007, after spending the day with their clients in Kong Yu village, 
lawyers from CLEC and LAC were reportedly denied re-entry to the village that night by district 
police, citing security concerns. The lawyers were admitted to the village after an intervention by 
a Secretary of State in the Ministry of Interior, but were only permitted to sleep in the pagoda. In 
December 2007, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for human rights in 
Cambodia visited Kong Yu during an official mission to Cambodia. The O&#8217;Yadao district chief 
came to the village accompanied by armed gendarmes, and asked the Special Representative and 
staff from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights whether they had been 
granted authorization by provincial authorities to visit the village. 
</p>
<p>28. According to the reports, there have also been increasing numbers of accusations by 
authorities and the media that NGOs are &#8216;inciting&#8217; communities to protest or complain about the 
violation of their rights. In this case, Cambodian media outlets have accused CLEC, LAC and 
other NGOs of inciting the villagers of Kong Yu and Kong Thom to take legal action against 
Ms. Keat Kolney, for politically-motivated reasons. It was reported that these restrictions on 
freedoms of assembly, movement and expression have no basis under Cambodian law, and it is 
noted that the Constitution guarantees the enjoyment of these freedoms. In June 2007, 
Ms. Keat Kolney lodged a complaint with the Bar Association of the Kingdom of Cambodia </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>against 7 lawyers from CLEC and 3 lawyers from LAC. Ms Keat alleged that the lawyers incited 
the villagers to file complaints against her, encouraged them to defame her, and gave false 
information to the media. Reportedly, the Bar Association has initiated inquiries concerning the 
10 lawyers, but has not yet taken a decision in relation to this complaint. The Special 
Rapporteurs referred to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the 
General Assembly on 13 September 2007, and reminded the Government of repeated statements 
by the Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing to drawn the attention of the 
international community and the Government, to the fact that forced evictions constitute prima 
facie violations of a wide range of internationally recognized human rights. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteurs reminded the recommendations contained in his mission report to Cambodia 
(E/CN.4/2006/41/Add.3) as well as the Basic principles and guidelines on development-based 
evictions and displacement (contained in document A/HRC/4/18). In addition to comments on 
the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information 
on the actions that have been taken to implement and enforce the provisions of the Land Law, 
including the actions taken to ensure that indigenous communities are able to enforce their 
rights; in the event that the alleged perpetrators are identified, full details of any prosecutions 
which have been undertaken; if penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions has been imposed 
on the alleged perpetrators; on details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation 
to this case (if no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, explanations to 
that regard were requested); on action that the Government is taking to ensure that lawyers can 
carry out their work without undue interference. 
</p>
<p>29. On 28 April 2008 the Special Rapporteur together with Special Rapporteur on the right to 
food the sent a joint allegation letter regarding information received on the forced eviction and 
blockade of food and medicine to families living in Kro-Year commune, Santuk district, 
Kompong Thom province. According to information received, hundreds of poor landless 
families came to settle in Banteay Rogneang village in Kro-Year commune from 2005. In 
November 2006, 357 families, including disabled war veterans and widows, submitted a request 
to Kampong Thom provincial authorities for a social land concession of 800 hectares. In 
June 2007, provincial authorities advised the families to complete a form requesting a social land 
concession at the commune office. At the beginning of January 2008, the number of families 
living in Banteay Rogneang had grown to over 1,000 families. The Kampong Thom provincial 
governor allegedly stated that the families were required to leave the area as an economic land 
concession had been granted to the Tan Bien company, and that they would be relocated to land 
in Trapeang Russey village. However, the families have reportedly refused to move to this land 
as it is a very small area not suitable for cultivation and containing leeches. Reportedly, on 
10 January 2008, armed police, military police and military personnel, led by Forestry 
Administration officials, started controlling the only road access to the village, allegedly 
allowing the settlers to leave the area but preventing their re-entry, and stopping anyone 
attempting to bring food or medical supplies into the area. It is alleged that this blockade was 
intended to force the communities out of their homes. As a result of the blockade, it is reported 
that a large majority of the families were forced to leave the area, and 160 to 170 families 
remained in the restricted area. Moreover, it is alleged that the security officers have threatened 
to burn down some houses if families do not leave their homes and lands. According to the 
information received, three people of the communities were arrested on 13, 15 and 
20 January 2008 and released after being forced to sign an agreement to accept alternate land or </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>other forms of compensation in exchange of the land they had. It is reported that other people 
have been forced to sign similar agreements. According to information received, the blockade 
was discontinued in mid February, and hundreds of families who had left the area returned to 
Banteay Rogneang village. On 6 or 7 March 2008, the blockade was reinstated for a week. This 
decision was allegedly taken by the Santuk district police chief upon the orders of the Kompong 
Thom provincial governor. Reportedly, the blockade of food and medicine had grave 
consequences for the health and well-being of the community. It is reported that families 
suffered food shortages leading to malnutrition, and that a number of individuals fell gravely ill 
from malaria and were unable to access medication. In addition to comments on the accuracy of 
the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on legal basis 
on which the evictions were carried out, and whom decided the evictions; whether appropriate 
consultation with the communities and affected persons was undertaken; whether alternative 
solutions to the evictions and displacements of these communities have been studied; whether 
the communities and affected persons were given adequate and reasonable prior notice before the 
eviction; whether the communities and affected persons had the opportunity to seek redress 
without sanction, whether judicial recourse was made available to the affected persons, if any 
access to due process for the poor and people with low income of these communities has been 
foreseen. They requested further information on whether any complaints have been lodged; 
whether sufficient information was provided to those affected by the evictions; whether the 
communities and affected persons were offered compensation for the loss of their houses and 
livelihood; and further details on any measures that have been foreseen to ensure that the 
evictions do not result in homelessness of the affected persons, details on relocation of the 
affected people.

<p>30. On 13 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders sent a joint allegation letter to the 
Government of Cambodia concerning information received regarding the arrest and detention of 
community representatives and citizens facing forced eviction in Sihanoukville&#8217;s Mittaheap 
District and in Dey Krahom in Phnom Penh. They recalled the situations brought to the attention 
of the Royal Government of Cambodia by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing in 
previous communications (dated 30 September 2005, 11 November 2005, 5 May 2006 and 
5 February 2007) and raised further concerns regarding the pursuit of criminal charges against 
community members facing eviction. Concern was expressed regarding the reported increase in 
forced evictions throughout Cambodia and the conduct of the evictions and resettlement. 
According to information received, more than 11,000 families have been forcibly evicted in the 
Municipality of Phnom Penh between 1998 and 2003. Since then, forced evictions have 
reportedly displaced over 30,000 people in the capital. So far in 2008, around 150,000 
Cambodians across the country were known to be at risk of being forcibly evicted as a result of 
development projects, land disputes and land grabbing. A pattern of violation of rights has been 
alleged during the conduct of these forced evictions and resettlement: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There has been a systematic lack of due process and procedural protections, including 
establishing the legal basis of evictions, consultation with affected communities; 
adequate notice of pending evictions, and access to legal remedies and assistance. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Compensation, if offered, is far below the market value of the properties that the 
communities are vacating and there is a lack of effective remedies for communities 
facing eviction. Resettlement sites, typically located in remote and undeveloped areas 
far from the city, rarely provide basic services and infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In many cases, police and/or military use excessive force or threaten to use unnecessary 
force in order to remove residents and destroy their homes and other material 
possessions.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; NGOs have been subject to campaigns of harassment and intimidation in relation to the 
forced evictions.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Human rights activists have been denied access to sites of human rights violations and 
are subject to similar campaigns of harassment and intimidations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Lawyers acting for clients in land disputes have been subject to criminal investigation. 
</p><p>31. Concern was particularly expressed regarding the alleged pursuit of criminal charges 
against community members facing eviction. It has been alleged that certain community 
representatives and citizens have been targeted by authorities with criminal sanctions. These 
sanctions have been used to intimidate and silence community representatives as well as ordinary 
villagers from exercising their democratic right to demonstrate over land disputes in regards to 
the forced evictions. It was also alleged that the authorities and courts have failed to protect these 
community representatives and citizens from the reported misuse of the criminal justice system. 
It was alleged that the court has failed to deliver justice equally and expeditiously to community 
representatives and citizens, including the poor and marginalized. This includes the alleged 
unwillingness of the court to throw out cases that have no merit immediately. According to 
information provided, the number of individuals arrested and detained because of their 
involvement in land disputes has more than doubled since 2005. During 2005, 53 poor persons 
involved in land disputes were arrested and detained. During 2006, 78 persons were arrested and 
detained. By 2007, this number had increased to at least 121 persons. In the first six months of 
2008, at least 33 villagers were arrested and detained. In the majority of cases, people were 
reportedly charged with criminal offences with little evidence behind the charges, the arrests 
preventing them from acting to defend the land under dispute or protest against perceived 
violations of their rights. In this context, the mandate holders discussed two cases which 
illustrate these concerns. On 20 April 2007, 105 families were forcibly evicted from 
Sihanoukville&#8217;s Mittapheap District. It was reported that hundreds of armed police and military 
personnel used excessive force to evict the families, injuring 18 people, burning houses, 
destroying property and looting material possessions. This case was the object of a 
communication by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on the right to food on 7 June 2007, for which no 
response has been received to date. Additional information received indicates that following the 
eviction, 14 villagers were charged with battery with injury and wrongful damage to property, or 
complicity in these crimes. At the trial on 4 and 5 July 2007, the prosecution allegedly did not 
produce evidence linking the defendants to the alleged crimes, and police officers who testified 
for the prosecution were allegedly unable to confirm that any of the defendants had in fact 
committed assault or caused damage. Yet the trial judge convicted 9 men, and sentenced 7 men 
to 75 days imprisonment and 2 men (one of them convicted in absentia) to 8 months </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>imprisonment, to be suspended after 4 months served. The remaining 5 defendants were 
acquitted and released. The court reportedly refused to examine the merits of the eviction, and 
allegedly no action was subsequently taken against police and military in relation to the physical 
violence and destruction of property during the eviction. The seven villagers who were sentenced 
to 75 days imprisonment had largely served their sentence in pretrial detention and were due for 
release on 7 July 2007. The second man who received a 4-month custodial sentence (and a 
4-month suspended sentence) was due for release on 20 August 2007. However, all 8 men 
remained in custody due to an appeal by the provincial prosecutor against their sentences, lodged 
on 5 July 2007. It was reported that there were excessive delays prior to the appeal being heard 
by the Appeals Court on 3 April 2008, when the Court upheld the original sentences imposed by 
the trial judge. Thus, when the 8 men were released from prison on 10 April 2008, 7 men had 
been detained for close to 9 months in excess of their sentence, and one man had been detained 
for 7 and a half months in excess of his sentence. Similarly, it was reported that over 100 
families are facing forced eviction from Dey Krahom in central Phnom Penh. Since late 2003, a 
private company named 7NG has been negotiating with community members to exchange their 
land for an apartment on the outskirts of the city, enabling 7NG to redevelop the site. The 
majority of the community has agreed to exchange their land for apartments, but it is reported 
that over 100 families still remain in Dey Krahom. It was alleged that 7NG, acting either through 
the police and military police or directly through its officials, has been involved in intimidatory 
action, such as violent incidents within and against the community, reportedly intended to push 
the remaining families to sell their houses to the company. It was also reported that 7NG is 
offering to buy families&#8217; land at prices well below the market rates, and that some families have 
accepted out of fear of eviction. In this context, it was reported that at least 14 community 
representatives and community members from Dey Krahom are facing criminal charges, which 
are allegedly not well founded and may have been pursued to discourage community members 
from resisting eviction or organizing against eviction. It is reported that a number of community 
leaders face multiple charges. It is reported that three people were found guilty of battery with 
injury and sentenced to 2 month suspended sentences; a woman was convicted with battery with 
injury and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment and a further 18 month suspended sentence; five 
people are charged with wrongful damage to property; one person is charged with robbery; five 
people are charged with destruction of police property; eight people are charged with destruction 
of commune property; at least three people are charged with wrongful damage to property and 
battery with injury; and five people are charged in relation to an incident where a truck was set 
on fire on the night of 7 January 2008. In all of these cases, it was alleged that there is an 
insufficient factual basis to support the charges, or evidence to link the individuals to the crimes 
of which they are accused. In many cases, eyewitnesses have denied that the alleged crimes took 
place, or that the accused people were involved. It was further reported that 7NG filed a civil 
action against 58 families for breach of contract, alleging they had agreed to exchange their land 
for an apartment, but had failed to comply with the contract. The concerned families either 
denied placing their thumbprints on the contracts, or alleged they were coerced into doing so. It 
is reported that the court arbitrated in favor of 7NG on 8 November 2007 and gave the families 
three weeks to vacate their houses. The mandate holders referred to the recommendation made in 
this report by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General that &#8220;no one should be 
imprisoned in relation to protecting their rights to land and housing and anyone detained in this 
context should be released&#8221;. In the context of the events reported in the present letter, the 
mandate holders urged the Government of Cambodia to take all necessary measures to guarantee 
that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned persons are respected and accountability of </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>any person guilty of the alleged violations ensured. They also requested that the Government 
adopt effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts. In addition to comments on the 
accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on 
the measures taken to ensure that the evictions are in accordance with Cambodia&#8217;s obligations 
under international human rights law; on the measures taken to ensure that private companies 
such as 7NG respect international law in the dealings with communities; on the measures taken 
to ensure equal access to the courts for communities and their representatives affected by forced 
evictions, in particular in the Dey Khrom case; on details, and, where available, the results of any 
investigation and judicial or other inquiries into the criminal proceedings of the 14 villagers into 
Sihanoukville&#8217;s Mittapheap District; and an explanation if no inquires have taken place or if they 
have been inconclusive; on measures taken to ensure the ability of non-government 
organizations to conduct their activities.

<p><b>Observations

<p>33. Le 19 septembre 2008, la Rapporteuse Sp&#233;ciale sur le droit au logement a adress&#233; une 
lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation au Gouvernement au sujet d&#8217;expulsions forc&#233;es dans le quartier de 
Ntaba-Nlongkak, dans la Commune de Yaound&#233; 1er. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 31 juin 
dernier, la Communaut&#233; Urbaine de Yaound&#233; aurait signifi&#233; &#224; la population du quartier de 
Ntaba-Nlongkak (Commune de Yaound&#233; 1er) l&#8217;ordre de quitter leurs habitations au plus tard le 
8 juillet 2008. Le 1er juillet 2008, une &#233;quipe de la Communaut&#233; urbaine de Yaound&#233; se serait 
rendue &#224; Ntaba-Nlongkak et aurait appos&#233; des croix sur les habitations devant &#234;tre d&#233;truites dans 
les 8 jours suivants. Etant inform&#233;s que des habitations dans d&#8217;autres districts de Yaound&#233; 
(Etetak, Mballa II, Tsinga, et Nkolbisson) auraient aussi &#233;t&#233; ras&#233;es par la municipalit&#233;, les 
habitants des maisons concern&#233;es auraient transport&#233; et d&#233;pos&#233; leurs effets personnels &#224; 
l&#8217;ext&#233;rieur des habitations au bord de la route. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les all&#233;gations re&#231;ues, le mardi 29 juillet, 
la Communaut&#233; Urbaine de Yaound&#233; aurait proc&#233;d&#233; aux d&#233;molitions des dites maisons. Ces 
expulsions forc&#233;es auraient laiss&#233; sans-abris plus de 5.000 personnes, incluant un grand nombre 
d&#8217;enfants. La scolarisation de ces derniers serait en cons&#233;quence tr&#232;s fortement perturb&#233;e. Le 
quartier Ntaba-Nlongkak est form&#233; de constructions informelles appartenant &#224; des familles 
d&#233;munies qui vivent sur ce lieu depuis 40 ans. Il se situe le long de l&#8217;un des grands boulevards 
reliant le centre urbain de Yaound&#233; au si&#232;ge de la Pr&#233;sidence de la R&#233;publique du Cameroun. 
Cette localit&#233; ferait partie des zones mar&#233;cageuses relevant du domaine administratif de l&#8217;&#201;tat. 
Les expulsions forc&#233;es auraient pour effet de marginaliser et d&#8217;appauvrir davantage des 
communaut&#233;s vivant d&#233;j&#224; dans des conditions pr&#233;caires. La Rapporteuse Sp&#233;ciale a mentionn&#233; 
l&#8217;article 45 de la Constitution du Cameroun qui indique que les trait&#233;s et accords internationaux 
r&#233;guli&#232;rement approuv&#233;s ou ratifi&#233;s ont, d&#232;s leur publication, une autorit&#233; sup&#233;rieure &#224; celle des 
lois nationales. Les expulsions forc&#233;es constituent des violations <i>prima facie</i> de nombreux droits 
de l&#8217;Homme reconnus internationalement et les expulsions massives ne peuvent s&#8217;effectuer que 
dans des circonstances exceptionnelles et en total respect du droit international en la mati&#232;re. La </p>

<p>34. Le 11 Novembre 2008, le Gouvernement de la R&#233;publique du Cameroun a adress&#233; une 
r&#233;ponse &#224; la Rapporteuse Sp&#233;ciale &#224; la suite de sa lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation dat&#233;e du 18 Septembre 2008, 
contenant les informations suivantes : &#171; Dans le cadre de l&#8217;am&#233;nagement de la ville de Yaound&#233; 
et guid&#233;e par le triple souci de respecter les normes nationales d&#8217;urbanisation, de pr&#233;server les 
zones &#224; &#233;cologie fragile et surtout de s&#233;curiser les personnes install&#233;es dans les zones &#224; risque, la 
Communaut&#233; Urbaine de Yaound&#233; a identifi&#233; 13 vall&#233;es inondables dans ladite ville dont Ntaba, 
et a sollicit&#233; du gouvernement une d&#233;claration d&#8217;utilit&#233; publique des travaux relatifs &#224; la 
protection des populations contre les risques d&#8217;inondation. Le 1er f&#233;vrier 2001, le Ministre de 
l&#8217;Urbanisme et de l&#8217;habitat a fait droit &#224; cette demande, prenant un arr&#234;t&#233; No. 
0010/Y/144/MINDUH/D200 d&#233;clarant d&#8217;utilit&#233; publique les travaux relatifs &#224; la protection des 
populations contre les risques d&#8217;inondations dans les 13 vall&#233;es de la ville de Yaound&#233;. Le 
quartier de Ntaba qui fait partie de ces zones &#224; risques est une enclave situ&#233;e dans les bas-fonds 
mar&#233;cageux de la vall&#233;e de Djoungolo et comporte sociologiquement des populations d&#8217;origines 
diverses vivant dans une insalubrit&#233; et une promiscuit&#233; insoutenables. Ces populations subissent 
des inondations r&#233;currentes dans la zone, dont l&#8217;une, la plus grave a &#233;t&#233; enregistr&#233;e en mars 2008 
&#224; la suite de la crue des eaux du Mfoundi. &#187; Les &#233;l&#233;ments fournis par le Gouvernement apportent 
les r&#233;ponses suivantes aux questions de la Rapporteuse Sp&#233;ciale : 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sur la premi&#232;re question : en avril-mai 2001, la Communaut&#233; Urbaine de Yaound&#233; a fait 
r&#233;aliser une &#233;tude sur l&#8217;&#233;tat des lieux des zones d&#8217;occupation ill&#233;gale par le Groupe de 
Recherche Technologique (GRET) et en janvier 2002, elle a confi&#233; &#224; une &#233;quipe de </p>

  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>sociologues, une &#233;tude anthropologique <i>in situ</i> qui a r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; que les pancartes et les 
avertissements de l&#8217;administration n&#8217;avaient aucun effet dissuasif que les occupants de 
la zone. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sur la deuxi&#232;me question : Comme il a &#233;t&#233; signal&#233; dans la r&#233;ponse pr&#233;c&#233;dente, les 
populations ont &#233;t&#233; approch&#233;es et sensibilis&#233;es dans le cadre des &#233;tudes susmentionn&#233;es 
et &#233;taient de ce fait conscientes, depuis plusieurs ann&#233;es, de l&#8217;ill&#233;galit&#233; de leur 
occupation et des risques auxquels elles &#233;taient expos&#233;es du fait de la fragilit&#233; 
&#233;cologique du site. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sur la troisi&#232;me question : En 2000, des mises en demeure ont &#233;t&#233; servies aux 
populations et des panneaux indiquant &#171; Zone mar&#233;cageuse - construction interdite &#187; ont 
&#233;t&#233; implant&#233;s sur le site. Le 30 juin 2008, des significations aux fins de d&#233;molir ont &#233;t&#233; 
servies aux populations. Le 1er Juillet 2008, des crois ont &#233;t&#233; appos&#233;es sur les 
habitations qui ont &#233;t&#233; d&#233;molies le 29 Juillet 2008. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sur la quatri&#232;me question : En droit camerounais les recours devant le juge administratif 
sont ouverts &#224; toute personne estimant qu&#8217;un acte de l&#8217;administration lui a fait grief. Le 
juge judiciaire peut &#233;galement &#234;tre saisi lorsqu&#8217;il s&#8217;agit d&#8217;une voie de fait, c&#8217;est-&#224;-dire 
un acte dont l&#8217;irr&#233;gularit&#233; est tellement manifeste qu&#8217;on ne peut le rattacher &#224; l&#8217;activit&#233; 
de l&#8217;administration. Il appartient donc aux habitants concern&#233;s d&#8217;exercer lesdits recours 
s&#8217;ils le jugent n&#233;cessaire. Par ailleurs, toute personne d&#233;munie peut demander le 
b&#233;n&#233;fice de l&#8217;assistance judiciaire pour toute action en justice conform&#233;ment au d&#233;cret 
No 76 - 521 du 09 novembre 1976 portant r&#232;glementation de l&#8217;assistance judiciaire.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sur la cinqui&#232;me et la sixi&#232;me question : Les mesures de relogement et de compensation 
n&#8217;ont pas &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;vues pour les habitants de Ntaba dans l&#8217;hypoth&#232;se d&#8217;une expulsion, car 
conform&#233;ment &#224; la l&#233;gislation en vigueur (loi No 85/09 du 04 juillet 1985 relative &#224; 
l&#8217;expropriation pour cause d&#8217;utilit&#233; publique et aux modalit&#233;s d&#8217;indemnisation), des 
personnes ne disposant pas de titre foncier ou de permis de b&#226;tir ne pouvaient r&#233;clamer 
aucune indemnisation, nul ne pouvant au demeurant se pr&#233;valoir de sa propre turpitude. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sur la septi&#232;me question : Le Minist&#232;re des Affaires sociales et le Minist&#232;re de la 
Promotion de la Femme et de la famille ont pris un certain nombre de mesures pour 
prot&#233;ger les enfants. De plus, certaines organisations non gouvernementales comme la 
Crois Rouge camerounaise ont apport&#233; une aide aux enfants victimes de cette 
situation. &#187;

<p>35. On<b> </b>5 March 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers sent a 
joint allegation letter to the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, regarding 
information they received in relation to Mr. Zheng Enchong, a human rights lawyer in Shanghai. 
Mr. Zheng Enchong has been the subject of three communications sent by mandate holders; an </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative, together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions on 16 March 2004, an urgent 
appeal sent by the Special Representative, together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers on 20 July 2006, and an urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Representative, together with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living on 
27 July 2007. The mandate holders, authors of this current communication, acknowledged 
receipt of the response of the Government of the PRC dated 18 December 2007, however, it does 
not entirely dispel their concerns regarding the situation of Mr. Zheng Encong, as illustrated by 
the new information they received. On 16 and 17 February 2008, Mr. Zheng Enchong was 
reportedly assaulted by police officers who were following him and his wife, Ms Jiang Meili. 
Later on 17 February 2008, he was summoned to the police station and detained for over 12 
hours, during which time he was beaten by unidentified men. The police reportedly questioned 
Mr. Zheng Enchong about legal aid he recently provided to petitioners and victims of land grabs. 
The questions also focused on an interview Mr. Zheng Enchong had given to the Epoch Times 
on 12 February 2008, in which he discussed the corruption case of Shanghai tycoon 
Mr. Zhou Zhengyi and the possible involvement of former Chinese Communist Party leader 
Mr. Huang Ju. On 19 February 2008, the interview to the Epoch Times was published and the 
following day, Mr. Zheng was again arrested. While in detention, he was once more beaten by an 
unidentified person, sustaining injuries as a result, before being released that evening. Concern 
was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Zheng Enchong may be directly related to his 
activities in defense of human rights. In view of allegations of ill-treatment, further concern was 
expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Zheng Enchong. The mandate 
holders requested clarification of the circumstances regarding the case of the person named 
above. The mandate holders stressed that each Government has the obligation to protect the right 
to physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs 
requested further information on whether a complaint has been lodged, on the legal grounds for 
the arrest, detention and questioning of Mr. Zheng Enchong, and how these measures are 
compatible with international norms and standards; on details of any prosecutions which have 
been undertaken against the officers who allegedly assaulted Mr. Zheng Encong; and regarding 
any penal, disciplinary or administrative sanctions imposed on the alleged perpetrators.

<p>36. On 28 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, and the members of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention sent a joint 
urgent appeal to the People&#180;s Republic of China regarding Mr. Ye Guozhu. Mr. Ye has already 
been the subject of a joint communication sent by the then Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the then 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
5 April 2005, which regrettably went unanswered. On 22 July 2008, Mr. Ye Guozhu was taken 
away from Chaobai Prison in Tianjin by officers of the Beijing Public Security Bureau (PSB), 
Xuanwu Sub-division, where he has been serving a prison sentence that was due to come to an </p>

</p>
<p>end on 26 July 2008. His brother received a call from the prison authorities at around 4 pm on 
22 July, explaining that it would not be necessary for him to come and pick up his brother on 
26 July. Mr. Ye&#8217;s brother immediately called the police in Xuanwu, who initially denied any 
knowledge of Mr. Ye Guozhu&#8217;s whereabouts, however, later admitted that Mr. Ye had been 
transferred from Chaobai Prison. The authorities refused to disclose Mr. Ye&#8217;s place and 
envisaged duration of detention. Mr. Ye Guozhu was active in assisting petitioners to file 
complaints with the central government against forced evictions. After he had applied for 
permission, in August 2004, to organize the so called &#8220;September 18 10,000 People March&#8221; he 
was sentenced by the Beijing Intermediate People&#8217;s Court to four years in prison for &#8220;disturbing 
the social order&#8221;. He was reportedly ill-treated while in detention. In view of his reported 
incommunicado detention at an undisclosed place of detention grave concerns were expressed as 
regards Mr. Ye Guozhu&#8217;s physical and psychological integrity. Further concern was expressed 
that Mr. Ye&#8217;s continued detention beyond the reported release date might be solely connected to 
his previous activities in defence of human rights and the upcoming Olympic Games. In addition 
to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested 
further information on any complaint lodged by or on behalf of Mr. Ye Guozhu; on the legal 
basis for the continued detention of Mr. Ye Guozhu and how these measures are compatible with 
international norms and standards as contained, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders; and on the current whereabouts of 
Mr. Ye Guozhu.

</p>
<p>masivo de comunidades ind&#237;genas al interior del Departamento de Nari&#241;o, que habr&#237;an generado 
m&#225;s de 10,000 desplazados internos. El &#250;ltimo desplazamiento forzado de gran magnitud habr&#237;a 
sido el de poblaci&#243;n ind&#237;gena Aw&#225; del Resguardo de Inda Sabaleta, Corregimiento de Llorente, 
Municipio de Tumaco (1). Adem&#225;s, como otra consecuencia del conflicto, se habr&#237;an reportado 
numerosas muertes entre los integrante de las comunidades Aw&#225;, tanto como resultado de 
accidentes causados por minas antipersonas (2), como por asesinatos selectivos cometidos por 
actores armados ilegales (3). Las informaciones recibidas por el Relator Especial mencionaron 
desplazamientos en el Resguardo Inda Sabaleta. La semana del 17 de septiembre de 2007 se 
habr&#237;a producido un desplazamiento masivo de los pobladores del Resguardo Inda Sabaleta, en 
particular de las veredas de Sabaleta, Pilvicito, Inda Bajo, Nortal y La Victoria, como resultado 
del enfrentamiento entre efectivos del Ej&#233;rcito colombiano y las Fuerzas Armadas 
Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ej&#233;rcito Popular (FARC-EP). Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 
d&#237;a 17 de septiembre, aproximadamente a las 6.00 a.m., habr&#237;an comenzado los enfrentamientos 
entre las tropas pertenecientes a la Brigada 29 del Ej&#233;rcito Nacional y el Frente 29 de las 
FARC-EP, en inmediaciones de la comunidad de Pilvicito, en el Resguardo Inda Sabaleta. En la 
carretera de acceso al resguardo Inda Sabaleta se habr&#237;an estacionado una tanqueta y dos 
camiones. Alrededor de las 6.40 a.m., ante la escalada del combate (en el que se habr&#237;an 
producido muertos), la fuerza p&#250;blica habr&#237;a obligado a tres familias Aw&#225; de la vereda Sabaleta a 
abandonar sus casas. Otras familias Aw&#225; habr&#237;an abandonado voluntariamente sus casas ante el 
temor de verse afectados por los enfrentamientos. El d&#237;a 19 de septiembre, alrededor de las 
4.30 a.m., 1.018 Aw&#225; de las veredas de Sabaleta, Pilvicito, Inda Bajo, Nortal y La Victoria 
(incluyendo 488 menores de edad, 261 mujeres y 20 mujeres en estado de embarazo) habr&#237;an 
llegado al centro educativo de la comunidad Inda Sabaleta, donde se habr&#237;an instalado con sus 
escasas posesiones. Se alega que ulteriormente el n&#250;mero de refugiados habr&#237;a alcanzado 
aproximadamente las 1.380 personas. Seg&#250;n las alegaciones, a partir del 23 de octubre de 2007, 
la poblaci&#243;n habr&#237;a comenzado a retornar a sus hogares. Actualmente la poblaci&#243;n en el centro 
educativo ascender&#237;a a algo m&#225;s de 200 personas de las cuales el mayor porcentaje continuar&#237;a 
siendo ni&#241;os y ni&#241;as. Seg&#250;n las alegaciones, la respuesta del Comit&#233; Municipal de Atenci&#243;n a la 
Poblaci&#243;n Desplazada de Tumaco, autoridad responsable del sector salud, habr&#237;a sido hasta la 
fecha muy insuficiente. De acuerdo con un estudio realizado en noviembre de 2007 por una 
misi&#243;n conjunta del Instituto Departamental de Salud de Nari&#241;o, el Instituto Colombiano de 
Bienestar Familial, el Programa Mundial de Alimentos, la Oficina de las Naciones Unidas de 
Coordinaci&#243;n de los Asuntos Humanitarios (OCHA) y la Organizaci&#243;n Mundial de la Salud 
(OMS), las personas que a&#250;n se encuentran refugiadas en el centro educativo del Resguardo Inda 
Sabaleta se encontrar&#237;an en condiciones de extremo hacinamiento. La situaci&#243;n de salud de la 
poblaci&#243;n ind&#237;gena de Inda Sabaleta se ver&#237;a todav&#237;a amenazada por unas condiciones de higiene 
deficientes, tanto en los lugares de preparaci&#243;n de alimentos, como en aquellos destinados para 
la disposici&#243;n final de basuras. Las condiciones de saneamiento b&#225;sico y agua potable ser&#237;an 
igualmente deficientes. Se alega adem&#225;s un grave problema de desnutrici&#243;n cr&#243;nica 
especialmente en el grupo de ni&#241;os y ni&#241;as. Actualmente la alimentaci&#243;n que se estar&#237;a

condiciones, el d&#237;a 10 de octubre de 2007 habr&#237;a fallecido la ni&#241;a Carol Narv&#225;ez, de 6 meses de 
edad. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas por el Relator Especial, unos miembros de comunidades

<p>&#8226; El d&#237;a 15 de julio a las 10:30 a.m., en el mismo municipio, habr&#237;a igualmente perdido la 
vida el Sr. Arcenio Canticus al pisar una mina antipersonal cuando se dirig&#237;a a trabajar 
en su parcela. Se alega que sus hijos, Andres Canticus, de 8 a&#241;os de edad, y German 
Canticus, de 12 a&#241;os, tambi&#233;n habr&#237;an perdido la vida al pisar una mina antipersonal

habr&#237;an desplazado a sus labores de campo. 
</p>
<p>40. Las informaciones recibidas por el Relator Especial mencionaron tambi&#233;n asesinatos 
selectivos de l&#237;deres de las comunidades ind&#237;genas. Asimismo, la extensi&#243;n del conflicto armado 
en las tierras tradicionales del pueblo Aw&#225; habr&#237;a dado lugar al asesinato sistem&#225;tico de l&#237;deres 
de las comunidades a manos de los grupos armados ilegales. As&#237;, seg&#250;n las alegaciones, desde 
principios de 2007 se habr&#237;an producido 23 asesinatos de miembros de las comunidades Aw&#225; en 
el Departamento de Nari&#241;o. En particular, se alega que en el a&#241;o 2007, habr&#237;an sido asesinados 
ocho miembros de las comunidades ind&#237;genas pertenecientes al Cabildo Mayor Aw&#225; de Ricaurte 
(CAMAWARI), una organizaci&#243;n con presencia en 11 resguardos que tiene como objetivos la 
difusi&#243;n de la cultura del pueblo awa y la defensa de sus derechos. Los &#250;ltimos asesinatos de 
miembros de dicha organizaci&#243;n habr&#237;an sido los del Sr. Vicente Nastacuas, el pasado 24 de 
octubre de 2007, dentro del resguardo de Magui, a manos de miembros de la Columna Mariscal 
Antonio Jos&#233; de Sucre de las FARC, y el de la Sra. Esther Nastacuas, el pasado 3 de agosto de 
2007, en la comunidad de Quembi, del Resguardo de Nulpe Alto R&#237;o San Juan, en condiciones 
a&#250;n no clarificadas.

<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>43. On 11 December 2007, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food, sent a joint allegation letter regarding the human rights situation 
of the Mursi and the Suri, Dizi, Me&#8217;en, Nyangatom, Guji, Core, Chai, Tirma, Bodi, Kwegu, 
Hamar, Banna, Aari communities, in and around the Omo, Mago and Nech Sar National Parks, 
located in South Ethiopia. The alleged human rights violations occurred in theses indigenous and 
minorities communities and allegedly caused by the Omo, Mago and Nech Sar National Parks, 
were the subject of a joint communication sent to the Government on 15 August 2006 by the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous 
people, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the Human Rights 
of Internally Displaced Persons. The Special Rapporteurs referred to the information they 
continued to receive, particularly regarding the adoption on 21st August 2007 of the 
Development Conservation and Utilization of Wildlife Proclamation No 541/2007, concerning 
all National Parks in Ethiopia. Reportedly, the Mursi and the Suri, Dizi, Me&#8217;en, Nyangatom, 
Guji, Core, Chai, Tirma, Bodi, Kwegu, Hamar, Banna, Aari communities, consisting of 
approximately 130 000 persons, are semi-nomadic people. Their traditional lands and territories 
are, today, in and around the Omo, Mago and Nech Sar National Parks. Although the bordering 
process began only last year, the Omo National Park (4,068 sq. km.) was designated in 1966 and 
the Mago National Park (2,162 sq. km.) in 1978. According to the information received, the 
affected communities traditionally practice rain-fed cultivation, cattle herding, as well as hunting 
and fishing. For climatic reasons and for the necessity of the traditional agriculture and cattle 
breeding, these communities move in and out the boundaries of these National Parks. For 
example, as the weather in the region is very dry, these communities gather, cultivate and 
shepherd their cattle within the boundaries of the parks due to their fertility and the proximity of 
water sources. It was also alleged that 75 percent of the total Mursi&#8217;s food supplies used to come 
from land now included in these parks. The Mursi depend on three main subsistence activities: 
flood retreat cultivation, rain-fed cultivation and cattle herding. Their diet depends mostly on the 
products they grow on this land while cattle, apart from being an important source of milk 
(especially for children) and meat, are a vital standby at times of crop failure, when they can be 
exchanged for grain in the highlands. Because of their relatively small number of cattle, the low 
and unpredictable local rainfall and the wide annual fluctuation in the level of the Omo flood, the 
Mursi must integrate all three of these sources of subsistence by means of a complex cycle of 
seasonal movements. This mix of subsistence activities, and the seasonal movement of people 
and cattle, has reportedly been the main condition both of Mursi survival and of the sustainable 
use of renewable resources in this area. Moreover, according to the information received, there 
are two harvests each year, one along the banks of the two permanent rivers, Omo and Mago, 
where fertile silt is deposited by the annual flood, and one in forested areas further away from 
the rivers which are cleared for rain-fed, shifting cultivation. Planting takes place on the banks of 
the Omo and Mago in October and November, after the flood has receded and the banks have 
been cleared of vegetation that had grown up since the previous season. The harvest comes in 
January and February. River-bank land is the most valuable agricultural resource the Mursi 
possess. The unpredictability, caused by the weather and floods, coupled with the limited area 
available for flood retreat cultivation makes cattle a vital resource for the Mursi and they </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 30 
 
</p>
<p>attribute overwhelming cultural importance to cattle. Every significant social relationship - most 
notably marriage - is marked and validated by the exchange of cattle. The Development 
Conservation and Utilization of Wildlife Proclamation No 541/2007 adopted on 
21st August 2007 reportedly aims at strengthening some of the provisions already included in the 
Agreement signed on 4th November 2005 between the Government and the Southern Nations, 
Nationalities and Peoples Regional State, and African Parks (Ethiopia) PLC concerning the 
management of the Omo Nationals Parks. The Government reportedly transferred the 
management of all Nationals Parks to African Parks (Ethiopia) PLC, a private company and a 
subsidiary of Stichting African Parks Foundation (&#8220;African Parks&#8221;), a Netherlands-based 
organization that manages conservation of parks throughout Africa. The African Parks (Ethiopia) 
PLC management for the Omo National Park has been effective since January 2006 after the 
signing of the 4th November 2005 Agreement, whereas in February 2004, African Parks 
Foundation signed an agreement with the Government allowing it to manage the Nech Sar 
National Park on a 25 year lease. The 2005 Agreement reportedly provided employees of the 
African Parks powers of law enforcement similar to those of public officials. It was also alleged 
that, through Proclamation No. 541/2007, restrictions and regulations have been imposed on the 
Mursi, Suri, Dizi, Me&#8217;en, Nyangatom, Guji, Core, Chai, Tirma, Bodi, Kwegu, Hamar, Banna, 
Aari communities regarding the use and enjoyment of their ancestral lands. These restrictions 
and regulations reportedly prevent them from fishing and hunting without a permit. This 
Proclamation also established an &#8220;anti-poaching&#8221; fund, a no tree felling policy, and entrance 
fees. It also provided for the control of visitor use and included the construction of a fence in and 
around the Park. It appears that the same restrictions have been applied to the Nech Sar National 
Park, also managed by the African Parks (Ethiopia) PLC. It was alleged that the December 2006 
report of the African Parks Foundation identified as one of the &#8220;illegal activities&#8221; in the Omo 
National Park the Mursi traditional livelihood practices like clearing of land for cultivation or 
hunting. According to the information received, the Development Conservation and Utilization 
of Wildlife Proclamation No 541/2007 adopted the 21st August 2007 was signed and managed 
without the free, prior and informed consent of the Mursi and others affected communities. 
According to these allegations, a &#8220;demarcation ceremony&#8221; was held in the Omo National Park in 
March 2005, at which members of various local groups were asked to sign (with their 
thumbprints) documents describing the park boundaries. In July 2005, game guards, that are 
employees of the Mago National Park, visited the Mursi settlement of Maganto (known to the 
government as Hailu Wuha) and allegedly persuaded three men to put their thumbprints on a 
document defining the Mago Park boundaries. As a result, the Mursi and the other affected 
communities living in the Omo and Mago Parks reportedly became illegal squatters on their own 
land. The lacks of sufficient information in the languages of the affected communities and 
sufficient time for prior and informed consent according to tribal customs have also reportedly 
affected the process. It also appears that the Development Conservation and Utilization of 
Wildlife Proclamation No 541/2007 is in contradiction with the Constitution whose Article 40 
proclaims that &#8220;Ethiopian pastoralists have the right to free land for grazing and cultivation as 
well as the right not to be displaced from their own lands&#8221;. In addition Article 32 stipulates that 
&#8220;Any Ethiopian or foreign national lawfully in Ethiopia has, within the national territory, the 
right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence (&#8230;)&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur 
mentioned interdictions of hunting and others traditional subsistence practices in all national 
parks. According to the information received, the Development Conservation and Utilization of 
Wildlife Proclamation No 541/2007 created different categories of &#8220;wildlife conservation area&#8221;. 
One category is &#8220;wildlife reserves&#8221; &#8220;designated to conserve wildlife where indigenous local </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 31 
 
</p>
<p>communities are allowed &#8220;to live together with and conserve wildlife&#8221;. Another category created 
by this Proclamation is called &#8220;national parks&#8221; where local communities are not allowed to &#8220;live 
together with and conserve wildlife&#8221;. According to the information received, hunting, fishing, 
clearing of land, tree feeling in the Omo, Mago and Nech Sar Nationals Parks without specific 
authorizations are proscribed. Article 8 of the Proclamation No 541/2007 states that, &#8220;No person, 
other than the Ministry or the concerned regional organ in the discharge of their duties, may hunt 
any game animal unless he is in possession of a hunting permit.&#8221; Further, according to Article 15 
of the Proclamation states that &#8220;a wildlife anti-poaching officer shall have the following powers: 
</p><p>1. to require any person who is in possession of wildlife or wildlife products to show the permit 
authorizing such possession; 2. to enter and search any private landholding, building, tent, (&#8230;) 
as well as search bags or sealed items, without court order, where there are sufficient grounds to 
believe that wildlife or wildlife products are kept illegally; 4. where a person is found 
committing an offence in violation of Article 16 of this Proclamation, to detain, without any 
court order, and handover him to the appropriate law enforcing body.&#8221; In addition, and 
concerning the penalties in case of violations of the provisions of this Proclamation, Article 16 
states that &#8220;(1) Unless it entails higher penalty under the criminal law: (a) any person who 
(i) commits an act of illegal wildlife hunting or trade; (ii) carries out unauthorized activities 
within wildlife conservation areas or causes, in whatever way damage therefore, or; iii) is found 
in possession of wildlife or wildlife products without having a permit, shall be punished with 
fine not less than Birr 5,000 and not exceeding Birr 30,000 or with imprisonment not less than 
one year and not exceeding five years or with both such fine and imprisonment&#8221;; (b) any person 
who commits other offences in violation of the provisions of the Proclamation or regulations or 
directives issued hereunder shall be punished with fine not less than Birr 500 and not exceeding 
Birr 3 000 or with imprisonment not less than one month and not exceeding six months or with 
both such fine and imprisonment.&#8221; According to the provisions of the Proclamation, occupation 
and use of land for flood retreat or rain fed cultivation by the Mursi, Suri, Dizi, Me&#8217;en, 
Nyangatom, Guji, Core, Chai, Tirma, Bodi, Kwegu, Hamar, Banna, Aari peoples, in and around 
the boundaries of the Omo, Mago, and Nech Sar National Parks, may constitute an 
&#8220;unauthorized activity which could lead to imprisonment or imposition of a fine. Such 
interdictions may have a negative impact on the ability of the Mursi and others affected 
communities to maintain their usual access to sufficient and adequate food and threaten their 
physical and food security. In addition the &#8220;no tree felling&#8221; policy may especially affect those 
groups that practice shifting cultivation such as the Suri, Dizi, and Me&#8217;en as it may be more 
difficult for these groups to clear new river bank sites for cultivation. Hunting is a very 
significant part of the economies of these communities, and as a result, the restrictions on 
hunting may also contribute to reduce their usual access to food. The Special Rapporteur also 
referred to limitations imposed on the communities&#8217; freedom of movement Freedom of 
movement of Mursi, Suri, Dizi, Me&#8217;en, Nyangatom, Guji, Core, Chai, Tirma, Bodi, Kwegu, 
Hamar, Banna, Aari communities living in and out the Omo, Mago, Nech Sar National Parks, is 
allegedly threatened by the provisions of this Proclamation which allow African Parks to charge 
entrance fees, without making any exception for indigenous people, and grant the company 
authority to construct a fence in and around the parks. Reports indicate that there are plans to 
build a fence around Nech Sar National Park and employ other measures to strictly limit the 
communities&#8217; ability to move, hunt and cultivate land freely in and out of the area. The 
restrictions of movement may have a negative impact on these communities because their 
subsistence food and their social organization depend on their ability to move on their ancestral 
lands. These groups combine cattle herding with both flood-retreat and rain-fed cultivation. </p>

</p>
<p>Because of the spatial distribution of agricultural and grazing land, and because of the 
unreliability of rainfall in this semi-arid environment, the successful utilization of these resources 
requires regular seasonal movements, over relatively short distances, by most members of these 
groups. In regard to the situation described above, the Special Rapporteurs draw the 
Government&#8217;s attention on the elements contained in the Basic principles and guidelines on 
development-based evictions and displacement contained in the most recent report of the Special 
Rapporteur on adequate housing (A/HRC/4/18), aiming to clarify certain State obligations in this 
context. He also referred to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
adopted by the General Assembly on 13 September 2007, and on the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination General Comment XXIII on the Rights of indigenous 
peoples. The Committee calls upon States parties &#8220;to recognize and protect the rights of 
indigenous peoples to own, develop, control and use their communal lands, territories and 
resources&#8221; (51&#186; period of session, 1997, HRI/GEN/1/Rev.7, paragraph 5). The Special 
Rapporteur mentioned the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural rights and particularly 
the General Comment 14 concerning the right to the highest attainable standard of health, and 
added that the right to food and water is protected by international human rights law, referring to 
the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food following his visit to Ethiopia in 
February 2004 (E/CN.4/2005/47/Add.1, 8 February 2005) which recommended, inter alia, that 
land tenure must be secured to ensure that people have secure rights over their own land and that 
all government programme and policy designs should ensure appropriate levels of participation, 
non-discrimination, transparency and accountability. In addition to comments on the accuracy of 
the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on the extent 
to which provisions of the Development Conservation and Utilization of Wildlife Proclamation 
No 541/200 have already been applied to individuals belonging to the Mursi Suri, Dizi, Me&#8217;en, 
Nyangatom, Guji, Core, Chai, Tirma, Bodi, Kwegu, Hamar, Banna, Aari communities since its 
entry into force; the short and long-term measures planned and/or taken by the relevant 
authorities to ensure that the Mursi Suri, Dizi, Me&#8217;en, Nyangatom, Guji, Core, Chai, Tirma, 
Bodi, Kwegu, Hamar, Banna, Aari communities are able to maintain their usual access to 
traditional livelihoods and their freedom of movement in and around the Omo, Mago and Nech 
Sar National Parks.

<p><b>Observation 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted any reply to this communication.  
</p>
<p><b>Greece 
</b></p>
<p><b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>45. On 26 August 2008, the Government of Greece sent a reply in response to a joint 
communication dated 20 July 2007 sent by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, the 
Independent Expert on Minority Issues and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of 
racism, concerning alleged forced evictions of Roma in Patras and other locations in Greece. The 
summary of this joint communication is contained in the communication report 
A/HRC/7/16/Add.1 paragraph 50.<b> </b>The Government&#8217;s reply contains the following information: 
&#8220;The integration of Roma into the society is a very complex, multi-faceted social problem which 
all European countries with a Roma population face. It can only be solved through the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 33 
 
</p>
<p>application of consistent efforts, financial support and a constructive attitude from all sides 
involved, including local societies and the Roma. Greek Roma, or Greek Gypsies, which is the 
term used in Greece by themselves in most cases are not registered separately from other Greek 
citizens, either during the national census, or in the municipal rolls. As a result, there is no 
precise official number of Roma populations as such. Some studies drawn up with a view to 
designing and implementing social actions and programs for the Roma indicate a population of 
approximately 250,000 to 300,000 persons all over Greece. Roma living in Greece are largely an 
integral part of the Greek population and they are protected against all forms of discrimination, 
by the Greek laws and the Constitution. They enjoy the same civil and political rights, they 
participate in Greek society, they organize themselves in associations, political parties, etc. 
Regarding the questions raised by the above-mentioned joint letter please be informed of the 
following: 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Facts regarding the alleged forced evictions in Patras 
</b></p>
<p>46. According to recent data (field visit held on 14/04/2008 by the Public Health Directorate of 
the Region of Western Greece), the Municipality of Patras has one Roma settlement at the 
Riganokampos area, where 20 shacks and one prefabricated house exist. The members of the 
field visit team met with the people of the settlement who stated that those who have been 
granted a housing loan are already looking for a proper house to buy in order to move from the 
settlement. Based on the statistical data of the housing loans program (operated by the Ministry 
of the Interior) and the terms of the identification documents submitted (i.e. identity card, 
certificate of marital status, etc.) from 2002-2006, a total of 50 loans have been granted to an 
equal number of families residing permanently at or being registered with the Municipality of 
Patras. In 2007-2008, (second operation phase of the program), another 34 loans were also 
processed. Therefore, the number of families to have been granted a housing loan through the 
Municipality of Patras runs, to date, to a total of 84 families. It is necessary to note that the 
Ministry has issued and maintains a database with all necessary individual administrative 
documents for the qualification of the above-mentioned beneficiary families. We should take 
into consideration the fact that each application doesn&#8217;t always stand for one independent family. 
It should be pointed out that, for various reasons, many Roma/Gypsy families submitted more 
than one applications for housing loans per family (e.g. one application by the husband and 
another by the wife), not always to the same authorities, sometimes in spite of the fact that they 
have already been granted a housing loan (from the same project) in the past. Furthermore, in 
view of presenting quantity data on the number of the loans granted to Greek Gypsies, since the 
beginning of the program (2002-2008) and bearing in mind that the reference to the Roma 
&#8220;living in the greater area of Patras&#8221; lacks a precise geographical definition necessary for the 
retrieval of any such data, we herewith present the following statistical analysis based on 
research criteria related to &#8220;Patras greater area&#8221; and in particular: 
</p>
<p>47. Greek Gypsies with an affiliation to Patras (residing in or registered in) who applied for a 
loan at the Municipality of Patras or other municipalities, whether at the time of the submission 
of their application they were registered with the municipal rolls of Patras or other municipalities 
(ref. table 1). 
</p>
<p>48. Greek Gypsies who submitted their application to a Municipality belonging to the greater 
area of Western Greece, bearing in mind that neither the loan nomination, nor any other 
provision restricts the settlement or even the use of the loan to the settling down to a particular </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p>region of the Greek territory. This has also been apparent from table 1, where it is shown that 
citizens of non-neighboring or adjacent municipalities to the Municipality of Patras submitted, 
however, their applications to the latter. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; According to the relevant figures it is noted that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 881 families registered in the municipal rolls of a municipality in the Region of Western 
Greece applied successfully for a loan to a number of municipalities within or out of 
that region (45 municipalities, including Patras). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 866 families applied and got nominated for a loan through 33 different municipalities of 
Western Greece Region (including the Municipality of Patras). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In Achaia Prefecture alone to which the Municipality of Patras belongs, 285 beneficiary 
families submitted an application to a Municipality falling within that territory. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Finally, it is stated that the above-mentioned Housing Loans Program addresses housing 
needs of all Greek Gypsies residing in the Greek territory, regardless of their religion or 
beliefs, and, to date, has granted a total of 6.984 loans to an equal number of gypsy 
families (beneficiaries). Among them, a total of 5.689 beneficiaries have disbursed their 
loans from the banks cooperating with the Program. The disparity between the loans 
granted and the disbursements is explained by the fact that the disbursement is 
processed upon the beneficiaries&#8217; responsibility and initiative. Practically, this means 
that the disbursal of the loan depends on the submission of the proper documentation for 
the house to be purchased/built/completed, by the interested persons to the bank. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Facts regarding alleged pattern of forced evictions of Roma in Greece 
</b></p>
<p>49. In the case of the Roma/Gypsies that used to live in shanks at the banks of Gallikos river, 
the solution has been given, as already pointed out in the Special Procedures&#8217; mandate holders&#8217; 
letter, by relocating them to a former military barracks (Gonos military camp). The municipal 
authorities have been improving the living conditions both in the camp and in the wider area 
outside the camp by performing infrastructure works (roads, electricity, medical - social services, 
playgrounds, etc.) In the case of the 200 Roma/Gypsies that used to live in shanks at the Olympic 
complex in Maroussi, Athens, they were relocated to rented homes where the rent was paid by 
the Municipality of Maroussi for an initial period of time and not indefinitely since lifetime 
payment of financial rental benefits to the Roma (in addition to those provided as social benefits 
for the whole population and, therefore, to the Roma too) only leads to a dangerous distortion of 
the State&#8217;s obligation toward the fighting against social exclusion and the equal treatment for all. 
Let alone that, in parallel, a housing loan program, guaranteed by the State budget, was offered 
to those interested; as a result, 21 out of the 34 applications submitted, were approved by the 
banks, that is, to all interested individuals that submitted the relevant documentation. As regards 
the case of the area of Votanikos, central Athens, where Albanian speaking Roma have settled 
arbitrarily on private property, a special Committee has been set up, by decision of the Secretary 
General for the District of Attica, due to the seriousness of the said case (the Roma/Gypsies 
being recognized as a socially vulnerable group). The Committee was set up under article 2 of 
the Amendment CP/23641 of the Sanitary Provision A5/696/25.4.83 on the organized settlement 
of itinerant populations (Official Gazette of the Hellenic Republic 973/B/15.7.03). The </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 35 
 
</p>
<p>Committee, in its meeting of 5.3.08 expressed the view that the importance of the matter calls for 
the preparation of a study which, upon consideration of the specifications of the relevant 
ministerial decree as well as other sanitary parameters, shall recommend appropriate areas for the 
relocation of the Roma in question. Furthermore, the Municipality of Athens undertook to 
cooperate with the Union of Municipalities of the Wider District of Attica to prepare a draft 
recommendation for finding areas for the rehabilitation of the Roma. On a more general note, the 
case of Patras served as a priority and at the same time as a case study. In this context, with 
regard to the funds allocated for the establishment of a settlement for itinerant populations 
(regardless of nationality and thus for Albanian Roma too), bearing in mind that, to date, the 
effort made by the local and regional administration in western Greece didn&#8217;t achieve the 
desirable results, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Interior called for a [second] meeting 
in January 2008 (the first one took place in Nov. 2007) among the local relevant authorities 
(Region of Western Greece, Municipality of Patras) in order to speed up the process for the 
rehabilitation of the Romas in the wider area of Western Greece, The meeting&#8217;s scope was to 
renew the commitment undertaken by the local authorities in the past towards permanently 
addressing the situation. To this end, it was made clear that cooperation among all parties 
involved is necessary for maintaining as well as enhancing the efforts and measures of a 
temporary nature undertaken already (e.g. subsidy of rent, provision of school and social aid, 
etc.) It was also stressed that central administration remains supportive to the proposals the 
parties are going to come up with, on the condition that there will be full consensus by all parties 
concerned (i.e. the local authorities and the gypsies residing in the area.) In this context, the 
Ministry of Interior reiterated its commitment to grant the amount of 320.000&#8364; for the 
construction of the necessary infrastructures for the establishment of the above-mentioned 
settlement for temporary residing of itinerant populations. It is also worth noting that the 
Committee established to this end at regional level did not yield the results expected, since the 
proposals put forth by local authorities were not met with consensus by the parties concerned. 
Another meeting with similar objectives took place, late 2007, upon the initiative of the National 
Committee of Human Rights, where all parties concerned participated, such as Roma 
representatives, NGOs and representatives from central and local government. The local 
government bears the responsibility for addressing its local issues, based on the principles of 
subsidiarity and citizen&#8217;s proximity. To this end, we note the recent legislative reform on local 
government responsibilities (article 75, Law 3463/2006) with regard to the living conditions of 
their citizens. In this context, the central government undertakes all necessary financial and 
legislative measures for the proper support of the proposals made by local authorities. It should 
be made clear that the Ministry of the Interior stands ready to support with the necessary funds 
the commitments undertaken already by the local authorities, as well as their proposals aiming at 
the improvement of the existing living conditions in the area and at permanently addressing the 
rehabilitation issue in question. 
</p>
<p>50. In any case, as regards the implied alleged systematic infringement of the right to adequate 
housing and the existence of discriminatory acts or even failure to act due to discrimination, we 
would like to emphasize the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) Article 21&#167;4 of the Greek Constitution stipulates that |obtaining a house for those 
who lack of or who are inadequately housed is under the special care from the State.&#8221; However, 
this doesn&#8217;t imply &#8220;neither that everyone may demand from the State to provide him a house, nor 
that if someone doesn&#8217;t possess a house may by right occupy a private or public land&#8221; (see 
Chapman v. United Kingdom (2001) of the European Court of Human Rights). In other words, </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 36 
 
</p>
<p>the obligation of the State should not be confused with the alleged right to encroach on other 
parties&#8217; rights whether these parties are individuals or the public sector. The Court goes on to say 
that &#8220;&#8230;even if [it involves people] of a particular racial origin or of other special characteristics, 
any such rights couldn&#8217;t be legally recognized. Claiming the right to housing, state subsidy or to 
encroach on foreign property on the pure basis that the claimant is for example of Rom origin 
constitutes a mere infringement of the principle of equal treatment for all at the expense of all the 
others.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> (b) Detailed data on the projects implemented by the state to the benefit of the socially 
vulnerable group of Greek Gypsies have been supplied by previous communication (our Note 
Verbale ref. 6171.13/45/A5 1586 dated 28 July 2006). Nevertheless, selective reference to 
specific problematic situations by some seems to be part of an effort to try to establish an overall, 
deliberate, discriminatory attitude toward the group in question. For instance, the decrease of the 
number of homeless people in particular settlements, such as the one in Patras, is often leading 
one to the hasty conclusion that this is the result of a racist policy and not the possible effect of 
the improvement of their living conditions (e.g. through the use of the housing loans offered and 
the transition to a different living status). 
</p>
<p> (c) Further on, while talking about insufficient state measures, it is worth mentioning the 
implied request for multiple parallel settlements for those deciding to be travelling within the 
territory (itinerant populations) due to temporary work as well as the selective reference to 
people who although already qualifying for a loan, they are presented as abandoned (by the state) 
to reside in settlements. Yet, the picture is slightly different if one takes into account, as an 
indication, the fact that names of representatives [and residents] of Riganokampos settlement (in 
Patras, Prefecture of Achaia), Ms. Maria Vasilari and Ms. Eleftheria Georgopoulou seem to be 
identical with particular name data of beneficiaries qualified for housing loans in neighboring 
municipalities also, both in the Prefectures of Achaia and Ilia. 
</p>
<p> (d) With regard to &#8220;forced evictions&#8221; in Greece, it is worth mentioning that eviction is 
closely related to the title-right to property. In that sense according to article 17&#167;2 of the Greek 
Constitution, and article 1&#167;2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
article 1 of the first Optional Protocol of the European Convention on the Protection of Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms &#8220;&#8230;nobody may be deprived from his property unless for 
reasons of public interest which has been adequately proved as provided by law and on the 
precondition of former adequate compensation.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> (e) In this context, it is inaccurate to use the term &#8220;unlawful eviction&#8221; when the relevant 
administrative act of expulsion comes in response to the unlawful occupancy of land and to the 
arbitrary and illegal settlement in tracts of land that are not owned by the occupants. Eviction, in 
the sense of the law, may be lawful in cases of: a. lack of property titles, b. illegal settlement in 
an area or c. of works of public interest concerning the property in question. In any case, the 
same legal framework applies to all citizens residing in the Greek territory, including Greek 
gypsies. It is evident that all citizens, including Greek Gypsies, have the right to appeal against 
administrative decisions before the courts. The cases in question refer to situations of lawful 
eviction or administrative removal from private or public lands. In such cases, anyhow, the 
Ministry of Interior tries to properly relocate the persons concerned, if possible in prior 
agreement with local authorities and those concerned, with a view to their permanent relocation. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 37 
 
</p>
<p> (f) With regard to police behavior, it is to be noted that standard orders from the 
Hellenic Police Headquarters to all regional police departments are for absolute respect of one&#8217;s 
personality and their human rights and of equal treatment of all regardless of racial or ethnic 
origin, religious beliefs, disabilities, age or sexual orientation. Those orders are based on article 4 
of the Greek Constitution, they are within the framework of Law 3303/2005 on &#8220;equal treatment 
regardless of racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, disabilities, age or sexual orientation&#8221; and 
article 5&#167;3,4 of the Presidential Degree 254/2004 on &#8220;Policemen Professional Ethics Code.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>51. In conclusion, the success of the measures undertaken by the State should not be reduced 
to mere budget allocations or to participation in decision-making bodies; it necessitates the 
political will of all parties concerned, as well as the unanimous action from a wide range of 
Roma collective bodies. In light of those mentioned above, the state does not wish to deny its 
own obligations and responsibilities and does not consider that all measures taken so far have 
yielded the anticipated results. It fully recognizes the need for combating any form of social 
exclusion and it deploys considerable efforts to this end. However, a number of positive 
measures and actions have been implemented (see annexes to original letter for further 
information). The attached Integrated Action Plan has entered, since 2005, its second phase of 
the implementation process. The overall aim is to encourage and promote Romas/Gypsies; 
inclusion in the Greek society, in terms of equity and active participation in all aspects and 
spheres of daily life.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>India 
</b></p>
<p>52. On 29 February 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences sent a joint allegation letter to the 
Government of India concerning reports they have received regarding violence against Dalit 
women. Dalit women and men suffer descent based discrimination in various aspects of their 
lives and are also victims of violence and untouchability practices arising out of the caste system. 
Despite the formal abolition of &#8220;Untouchability&#8221; by article 17 of the Indian Constitution, de facto 
discrimination and segregation of Dalits persists, in particular in rural areas, in access to places 
of worship, housing, hospitals, education, water sources, markets and other public places. Dalit 
women are confronted with discrimination, exclusion and violence to a larger extent than men. 
Lands and properties in particular are issues of conflicts over which Dalit women have faced 
evictions, harassment, physical abuses and assaults. Dalits women are often denied access to and 
are evicted from their land by dominant castes, especially if it borders land belonging to such 
castes. They are therefore forced to live on the outskirts of villages, often on barren land. 
Violence against Dalits is also caused due to land or property disputes. Reportedly, on many 
occasions, cases of violence against Dalit women are not registered. Adequate procedures are not 
taken by the police. The following specific cases have been brought to the attention of the 
Special Rapporteurs. They outline the impunity that seems to prevail with respect to ensuring 
protection and redress for Dalit women victims of violence linked to their rights to adequate 
housing and property: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 25 August 2005, Mrs. Karamjeet Kaur, wife of Rashpal Singh, and her family 
bought a plot on Muktasar road. They built a house and started to live there. On 
28 August 2005, Amrik Singh (Police official), Davinder Singh (police official), 
Kuldeep Singh, Darshan Singh and Rachal, Singh abused the victims with filthy words 
and Caste names. They accused the family of illegally inhabiting the plot. They broke </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 38 
 
</p>
<p>the walls of the house and took all the goods from the family. Mrs. Karamjeet Kaur was 
beaten and hospitalised. The victim tried to file a complaint at the police station, but the 
police refused to file a complaint and to take any other action. 
</p>
<p>53. Mrs. Fulwa Dewi, wife of Hardev Paswan, owns a field where she was growing crops. 
On 16 November 2005, Rajdev Yadav, Lalder Yadav, Urmila Devi, Siyamani Devi and 
Saguni Yadav beat her up and stole her crops. On 13 December 2005, Mrs. Fulwa Dewi filed a 
complaint with the local police. The accused were arrested but were immediately released on 
bail. The Special Rapporterus recall Article 4 (b) of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Elimination of Violence against Women, as well as the Concluding Observations of The 
Committee on Racial Discrimination (CERD), in 2007, paragraph 20, which recommended that 
the Government of India &#8220;ensure that Dalits, including Dalit women, have access to adequate 
and affordable land and that acts of violence against Dalits due to land disputes are punished 
under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (1989).&#8221; In 
addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs 
requested further information on the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, 
medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the individual 
cases mentioned; details of any prosecutions against the perpetrators which have been 
undertaken and if any sanctions have been imposed on the alleged perpetrators; and whether the 
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (1989) has been used to

</p>
<p>54. On 5 March 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences sent a joint allegation letter to the Government of 
India regarding information they received concerning Mrs. Shobhavati Devi in Baulia village, 
Shivdaspur, Post Manduvadih, Varanasi, and Mrs. Ramashree, in Tahirpur village, Shahabad, 
Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh, two members of the Dalit caste.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 8 December 2005, around 11 a.m., approximately 30 persons, including 6 police 
officers in uniform (3 police women, 2 police men and the sub inspector), reached 
Mrs. Shobhavati Devi&#8217;s house, in Baulia village, Shivdaspur, Post Manduvadih, 
Varanasi. The assailants started abusing and assaulting the Dalit women and children, 
and demolishing Ms. Devi&#8217;s house. The reason seems to have been a land dispute. In 
reaction, the victims, their family members, and friends demonstrated and blocked the 
road at the Balia Chauraha. They were nearly 100-150 people. The Station Officer 
(Police station-Manduadih) and other police personnel came to the spot, but no action 
was taken. On 25 December 2005, Ms. Devi tried to lodge a complaint against three of 
the perpetrators, who were identified: Ramesh Gupta, Sontosh Gupta and Rajesh Gupta. 
The police neither registered it nor took any further action. The complaint was finally 
registered on 25 February 2006, only after the intervention of the District Court 
Varanasi where Ms Shobhavati Devi filed a case. While registering the complaint 
factual details of the case were contorted and the gravity of the incident was allegedly 
diminished. The victim was reportedly threatened to make her withdraw her complaint. 
The perpetrators were arrested, and on 20 April 2007 Ms Shobhavati Devi was given 
6250 Rupees as compensation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 15 November 2006, around 7 a.m., five policemen raided Mrs. Ramashree&#8217;s house, 
in Tahirpur village, Shahabad, Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh. One of them beat Mahendra, the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 39 
 
</p>
<p>victim&#8217;s husband. When Mrs. Ramashree asked for the reason, the policeman 
immediately hit her in her womb (she was pregnant at that time) and verbally abused 
her with caste names. The victim sustained many injuries on her back, cheeks, stomach 
and vagina, and she lost her child as a result of the beating. Two of the perpetrators 
were reportedly identified as Shyam Sharani Tiwari and Upadhya, who were both 
wearing uniforms. On 18 November 2006, the incident was reported to the local police 
station. One of the assailants was working there and refused to file a complaint. The 
assailant tried to persuade Mrs. Ramshree to withdraw her statement. He threatened to 
use his powers as a police officer against her. A suit was also filed against 
Mrs. Ramashree by the police officer Shyam Sharani Tiwari, who accused her of 
making wine and to own tools to produce alcohol. Mrs. Ramashree was sent to jail and 
brutally beaten. Allegedly, the above-mentioned women were not offered proper 
judicial remedies due to the fact that they belong to the Dalit caste. It was reported that 
on many occasions, cases of violence against Dalit women are not registered by the 
police. Even if the cases are reported to the police, and the perpetrators arrested, they 
are usually released on bail and women&#8217;s access to justice is thus limited. It was also 
reported that the Indian government adopted the &#8220;Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled 
Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act&#8221; in 1989, to prevent atrocities against Scheduled 
Castes and Tribes. According to this act, in cases of violence against Dalits, including 
violence against women, the police are obliged to register the case. However, the police 
often refuse to register the case under this act, as it imposes high prison sentences and 
fines. It was alleged that the police may not agree with the purpose of the act and may 
try to protect the perpetrators (as their fellow caste members) by not registering cases at 
all, or registering them under a different act. The Special Rapporteurs reminded the 
Government of India of Article 4 (c and d) of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Elimination of Violence against Women. In addition to comments on the accuracy of 
the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on 
details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical examinations, and 
judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to all individual cases mentioned; on 
any prosecutions which have been undertaken or any sanctions imposed on the alleged 
perpetrators that have been identified in the two cases; whether reparation, including 
compensation, has been provided to the victims or the family of the victims, when not 
specified in the above summary; on additional information as to how the 
implementation of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, as well as the Supreme 
Court judgment highlighted above, serve to prevent and redress violence against Dalit 
women, and ensure that acts of violence are thoroughly investigated, prosecuted and 
punished.

<p>55. On 29 April 2008, the government of India sent a response to the joint communication 
dated 29 February 2008, concerning cases of alleged violence against Dalit women in India. In 
this regard, the Government of India noted that the said communication did not include any 
information on the places of occurrence of these cases. The government of India requested that 
details pertaining to the place of occurrence (village/district/State) concerning each case be 
provided to facilitate investigations by Indian authorities. </p>

<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>57. On 20 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government 
of Iraq regarding information received concerning the danger of collapse of the Mosul Dam on 
the Tigris River in Ninawa Province and the potential loss of lives and property, including 
housing, of a large number of Iraqi citizens. According to the information received, the integrity 
and structure of the Mosul Dam is threatened by its weak foundation. This is allegedly because 
of the continuous deterioration of materials, including Gypsum and Anhydrite. The information 
received stated that this has resulted in cracks and leaks which constantly reappear and must be 
repaired to strengthen the foundations. The information also stated that persistent digging of 
trenches nearby has also threatened the integrity of the dam. The Special Rapporteur received 
information stating that measures had been taken by the Government to address the threat 
presented by the possible collapse of the Mosul Dam, including the injection of concrete and 
cement at the base. Nevertheless, on the basis of the information provided, she understood that 
these measures were remedial only. Allegedly, the Mosul Dam still remained in a critical state 
and close to collapse.  Furthermore, according to the information received, the Governor of 
Ninawa had requested that all water be immediately drained from the Mosul Dam in order to 
prevent a humanitarian catastrophe. It was alleged that this measure was refused by dam 
manager Abdul Khalik Thanoon Ayoub and Iraqi Minister of Water Resource Abdul Latif 
Rashid. Reportedly, the threatened collapse of the Mosul Dam would be a humanitarian disaster 
of epic proportions. The collapse of the Mosul Dam would allegedly trigger a 20 metre wave 
upon the city of Mosul that would flood much of the lands and roads from Mosul to the city of 
Baghdad. Also, the collapse of the Mosul Dam would allegedly endanger around the lives of 
about 500,000 residents and destroy villages and livelihoods. The Special Rapporteur noted 
concern on the basis of the facts provided, failing to take sufficient measures to prevent the 
collapse of the Mosul Dam would lead to a fundamental breach of these obligations under 
international law, particularly in relation to the massive loss of life and the associated loss of 
property, including shelter, as alleged by the facts provided. According to the information 
provided, an emergency plan had been prepared in the context of a disaster in respect of the 
Mosul Dam. In the context of the alleged emergency plan, adequate consultation should be 
carried out with the affected residents with respect to the emergency plan. Furthermore, if the 
allegations have any basis, all residents who are affected by the developments regarding the 
Mosul Dam should be kept fully informed as long as their interests are affected. The importance 
of respecting human rights obligations in international law during all stages of disaster 
management, including prevention, was stated by the former Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing, for instance at the 7th session of the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/7/16 at 106). In 
addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur 
requested further information whether any complaint been lodged by residents affected by the 
alleged insecurity of the Mosul Dam; if information was provided on the situation of the dam to 
the population; and if the population received any instruction or training in the event of a </p>

at this stage and in the future, to ensure the integrity of the Mosul Dam and the safety of the 
neighbouring residents.

<p>59. On 16 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government of 
Israel regarding information received concerning ongoing demolitions of houses and forced 
evictions carried out by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in several villages of the West Bank. 
According to the information, the IDF carried out house demolitions in the West Bank in the 
following locations: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Al-Haddidiya, near Ro&#8217;I settlement, Jordan valley: Reports received claim that on 
23 August 2007, the Israeli military forces demolished three barns and destroyed one 
house along with two sheds. It is also reported that on 6 February 2008 the IDF 
destroyed four residential structures housing 36 people, including some 20 children, and 
the adjacent animal sheds. It is reported that the families which were subsequently 
displaced have been living there for over 50 years. On 11 March 2008, four residential 
structures along with the adjacent animal pens were destroyed. A total of 34 persons 
were deprived of shelter, including 26 children. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Furush Beit Dajan, near Hamra settlement, Jordan Valley: On 11 March 2008, five 
residential structures were demolished leaving 31 people without shelter, including at 
least 16 children. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Al Jiftlik, Jericho: On 11 March 2008, one residential structure housing nine people 
including seven children was demolished.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Arab ar-Ramadin, Qalqiliya: On 11 March 2008, two structures - the tent in which the 
family stored their fodder, and the living tent - were demolished leaving 10 persons 
including 6 children without shelter.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ad Deirat, near Karmel settlement, Hebron: On 19 March 2008, three residential 
structures sheltering at least 20 people including 14 children were demolished. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Umm Lasafa, near Karmel settlement, Hebron: On 19 March 2008, a house of 6 people 
was demolished. It is alleged that settlers from the nearby Karmel settlement have taken 
over by force around 400 dunams of land from the indigenous Bedouin villagers.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 42 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Qawawis and Imneizil, Hebron: On 19 March 2008, three structures and an animal pen 
were destroyed affecting 13 persons including 9 children. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Hizma, surrounded by the settlements Pisgat Ze&#8217;ev, Geva Binyamin and Almon, 
Jerusalem: On 20 March 2008, two houses, one of which was an incomplete structure, 
were destroyed affecting at least 5 persons. It is further reported that in January 2008 
land was confiscated from Hizma and neighboring Beit Hanina to build 1,200 housing 
units for the Psigat Ze&#8217;ev settlement. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Al Jib, west of Bir Nabala settlement and east of Giv&#8217;at Ze&#8217;ev settlement, Jerusalem: On 
20 March 2008, two residential structures were destroyed leaving 22 persons without 
shelter. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Anata, Jerusalem: On 2 April 2008, one house sheltering 15 persons was destroyed. 
</p>
<p>60. In the above-mentioned cases, the affected persons reportedly received eviction and 
demolition orders which failed to specify the date when demolitions were to be carried out. It is 
further reported that the families were allegedly given no time to remove their belongings as the 
IDF came to demolish their homes without prior warning. They were allegedly not provided 
alternative housing and are actually homeless. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the 
facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further information on the grounds to 
conduct such demolitions; on the legal framework governing decisions in this regard; whether 
the communities and affected persons were given adequate and reasonable prior notice before the 
eviction; whether the communities and affected persons were given adequate and reasonable 
time to withdraw their belongings before the destruction of their residences; on the measures that 
have been foreseen by the authorities to ensure that the evictions do not result in homelessness of 
the affected persons and the relocation of the affected people.

<p>62. On 21 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government of 
Japan regarding the planned privatization of Miyashita Public Park and the plight of 34 homeless 
people living in the park in tents. Miyashita Park is a public park in the centre of Tokyo (Shibuya 
Ward). At the present moment, the City of Shibuya-ku is moving ahead with plans to fully 
renovate Miyashita Park and make it a park for the Nike Corporation. The Nike Corporation has 
been granted permission by the City to renovate the park at its own cost at 450 million yen with a 
naming right fee of approximately 150 million yen per year. The Nike Corporation plans to 
convert the park into a space expressly for sports enthusiasts and to charge a fee for each future 
user of the park. Local residents and park frequenters have not been informed or consulted on the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 43 
 
</p>
<p>plans for the privatisation of Miyashita Park, a public space which has been for many years a 
focal point for citizen activities and gatherings. Neither the ward assembly nor the city planning 
council has been consulted regarding the park and almost no information about the changes can 
be found in the materials provided to the public. Moreover, 34 homeless peoples are currently 
living in tents in Miyashita Park. The proposed renovation of the park means that the homeless 
people will no longer be allowed to make their sleeping arrangements in the park. There has 
allegedly been no effort by authorities to find any alternative accommodation to this date. The 
Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Japan that consultation is an essential part of the 
right to adequate housing, and, in this context, consultation of the users and neighbors of the park 
by urban planners and governing authorities is important. Public spaces such as Miyashita Park 
play an important role in the adequacy of housing as providing a free and open space for 
recreation and cohabitation in urban society. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur emphasized that 
homelessness frequently results in the denial also of a number of other congruent rights linked to 
adequate housing, such as the right to food, right to water, right to health, right to education and 
the right to an adequate standard of living. These are enshrined in the Covenant as well as 
expressed in the fundamental principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs 
requested further information on consultations carried out in relation to the planned privatization 
and development of Miyashita Park; if any objection has been raised - in writing or otherwise - 
in relation to the privatisation of Miyashita Park; on the situation of the homeless people living 
in Miyashita Park, including information on any planned resettlement. 
</p>
<p><b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>63. On 20 December 2008, the Government of Japan sent a reply to the Special Rapporteur in 
response to the communication dated 21 August 2008, in which he replied to all questions as 
follows:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>1</i>. <i>Are the facts alleged in the above summary of the case accurate?</i>  
 With regard to the alleged facts in your inquiry, they are incorrect on all counts 
except that &#8220;Miyashita Park is a public park in the centre of Tokyo (Shibuya Ward),&#8221; for 
the following reasons: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The repairs of Miyashita Park currently proposed by a private enterprise are repairs to a 
municipal park meant for the improvement of its accessibility to park users and its 
environment. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There has been no proposal for naming rights for the park to the amount of 
150 million yen per year, nor has any decision been made about leasing naming rights. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It is beyond the purview of the ward to be aware of the expenses of repair to a park 
undertaken by a private enterprise, and the ward has not given permission for repairs to 
be made to the park. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Even if this repair plan is put into practice, park users will not be required to pay an 
admission fee. Regarding the use of its facilities, it will be examined in detail in the 
future.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 44 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; After formulating a repair proposal plan for the facilities of Miyashita Park, Shibuya 
Ward will explain the proposed plan to the Ward Assembly, its residents and park users 
immediately to gain their understanding and move forward. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; As to the provision of housing to homeless people in Miyashita Park, please refer to the 
answer to Question 4 below. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Concerning Miyashita Park serving as &#8220;adequate housing&#8221; for homeless people, let us 
refer to the decision by the Supreme Court of Japan that a public park cannot be used 
for an address (Sup. Ct. Oct. 3 2008) and point out that Shibuya Ward is of the view that 
the park is illegally occupied. However, due to humanitarian considerations, Shibuya 
Ward has not carried out forceful removals and instead, as outlined in the answer to 
Question 4, has been encouraging transition by the homeless to apartment living. 
</p>
<p><i>Please indicate what consultation, if any, has taken or will take place in relation to the 
planned privatization and development of Miyashita Park. 
</i> Please refer to (e) of the previous answer. 
</p>
<p><i>2. Has there been any objection raised - in writing or otherwise - in relation to the 
privatization of Miyashita Park? 
</i> A written petition of objection dated August 11 2008 was received from &#8220;The 
Coalition to Protect Miyashita Park from Becoming Nike Park.&#8221; Also, from July 3 to 
September 12, ten individuals, including residents from outside Shibuya, expressed their 
respective views in the form of eight e-mails, one letter and one fax. 
</p>
<p><i>3. Please provide information on the situation of the homeless people living in 
Miyashita Park, including information on any planned resettlement. 
</i> As of October 1 2008, about 25 homeless people live in the municipal Miyashita 
Park. Since 2006, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and local wards have carried out 
the cooperative &#8220;Assistance Project for Transition to Community Life,&#8221; helping homeless 
people to find apartments and employment. Moreover, for those who have remained in 
streets and parks, the municipalities have carried out onsite counseling three times a 
month, explaining the welfare system and encouraging moves into &#8220;Emergency Interim 
Protection Centers.&#8221; Through such approaches, the number of homeless people in 
Miyashita Park, which totaled 101 at the project&#8217;s inception, has largely decreased.&#8221;

<p>64. On 21 February 2008 the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government of 
Kyrgyzstan concerning information about alleged deaths due to severe cold weather in 
Kyrgyzstan. During the 2007-2008 winter period, it has been alleged that more than 120 persons, 
most of them homeless, have died from cold across the country. The situation has been reported 
to be particularly critical in Bishkek where more than 50 people have allegedly died. The </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 45 
 
</p>
<p>information received indicates that the number of homeless persons in Bishkek is growing and 
exceeds the capacity of emergency centers currently operating in the capital. It was reported that 
until the beginning of February 2008, only one government supported emergency centre 
(&#8220;Kolomto&#8221;) was functioning in the Pervomaysky district of Bishkek. While the normal capacity 
of this center is for 50 persons, it is reported that it currently accommodates 78 people. 
According to information received, the Bishkek Mayor&#8217;s office announced that an additional 
facility in Leninsky district (near Fuchik Park) would be opened at the beginning of February to 
provide food to homeless people. Further information indicates that at least one further shelter 
provides accommodation in the Bishkek area for homeless people. Yet, it is reported that these 
additional centers could not accommodate the housing needs of the homeless population living in 
Bishkek. Concerns have also been expressed than because of the weather and the lack of a 
sufficient number of equipped shelters, the life of more people may be at stake in Bishkek as 
well as in other regions of the country. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of 
the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further information on the number of persons 
that have died due to the cold and weather conditions in the past 4 months in Bishkek and in the 
rest of the country; on the measures taken by the authorities to address this issue, including 
preventive measures to avoid such deaths; on the manner that the authorities assess the needs of 
homeless and inadequately housed persons throughout the country; on statistics, indicators and 
other available figures use to determine the number of homeless people and the number of 
people that are living in inadequate housing, in particular in regard to heating, in Kyrgyzstan; 
and on the type and number of shelters for the homeless that are in use in Bishkek and the rest of 
the country, and whether these shelters accessible to women and children.

Las alegaciones indican que las autoridades del Estado de Oaxaca no han querido ejecutar la

<p>67. En una carta de 5 de noviembre de 2008, el Gobierno de M&#233;xico inform&#243; que las 
comunidades de Chalcatongo de Hidalgo y de Santo Domingo Ixcatl&#225;n, perteneciente al distrito 
de Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca, confrontan antiguos problemas por la posesi&#243;n y reconocimiento de una 
superficie de 1,356-93-70 hect&#225;reas, conflicto que jur&#237;dicamente ya fue resuelto a favor de la 
comunidad de Santo Domingo Ixcatl&#225;n por una sentencia del Tribunal Unitario Agrario del 
Distrito 46, dictada el 8 de agosto de 1998, dentro del expediente de conflicto por l&#237;mites n&#250;mero 
03/95. Sin embargo, la sentencia se encuentra pendiente de ejecutar debido a la oposici&#243;n que 
presentan los habitantes de la comunidad de Chalcatongo de Hidalgo, quienes nunca han estado 
de acuerdo con el fallo. Pese a que dicho conflicto ha sido ya objeto de una soluci&#243;n jur&#237;dica, el 
intento de ejecuci&#243;n de la sentencia ha contribuido al resurgimiento de confrontaciones entre 
pobladores de ambas comunidades. Con respecto a la pregunta de si son exactas las alegaciones, 
el Gobierno respondi&#243; que en relaci&#243;n a los hechos suscitados los d&#237;as 9, 10 y 11 de mayo de 
2008, si hubo una quema de 14 casas en la comunidad de Chalcatongo, Oaxaca, afectando con 
ello a 86 personas. Estos hechos fueron ocasionados con motivo de las mismas disputas entre las 
comunidades por la superficie de 1,356-93-70 hect&#225;reas. En cuanto a informaci&#243;n sobre 
investigaciones iniciadas, el Gobierno inform&#243; que, con motivo de estos hechos, la Procuradur&#237;a </p>

<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>68. On 8 September 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions sent a joint allegation letter regarding allegations 
received about forced evictions and demolitions of houses in Gosa Sariki and Toge between May 
and June 2008, as well as threats of further evictions and demolitions in Abuja. They also called 
attention to allegations received regarding lethal use of force by the police in confronting 
protests related to these forced evictions. Reports indicate that in May 2008, a number of homes 
in the Gosa Sariki village alongside the Nnamdi Azikiwe airport road in the Federal Capital 
Territory (FCT) of Abuja were demolished by bulldozers and residents were made homeless. 
According to the information received, forced evictions and demolitions were conducted with 
inappropriate or no prior notice. It is alleged that officials from the Department of Development 
Control and the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) visited residents of the Gosa 
Sariki village on 5 May 2008. They informed them that homes up to 150 metres from the airport 
road in the village were to be demolished the next day. However, it is further alleged that on 
6 May 2008, bulldozers demolished homes in the Gosa Sariki village up to 300 metres from the 
airport road, thus a significant proportion of residents who had received no information were 
faced with the destruction of their homes. It is also alleged that many residents in the Gosa Sariki 
village lost their personal belongings as they were not given adequate time by FCDA officials to 
recover their possessions before their houses were bulldozed. Reportedly the same situation 
occurred in Toge in June 2008, where houses and personal belongings were destroyed by 
bulldozers with insufficient or no prior notice. Reports indicate that, as a consequence of these 
forced evictions, many families and individuals are now homeless, without shelter and living in 
the open air. In both cases, no adequate consultations had previously taken place with the 
affected communities and individuals. The absence of adequate relocation, accommodation or 
compensation has allegedly further impoverished inhabitants of these areas that were already 
living in poverty. The majority of the constructions that were demolished in Gosa and Toge were 
reportedly housing structures of 1 to 3 rooms, stalls and shops where some community members 
sold their wares. It is alleged that many residents consequently lost their livelihoods, including 
those who operated small businesses from houses or in shops that were demolished. In the case 
of Toge, residents allegedly obtained a court injunction in early June 2008 preventing the 
demolition of their homes, which was served on the FCDA. A hearing was allegedly scheduled 
at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory to decide on the issue of the demolitions. 
However, the information states that this injunction was ignored by the FCDA, which carried out 
the demolition of homes on 13 June 2008 regardless of the court injunction. In addition, the 
information received alleges that the forced evictions and demolitions were carried out with 
disproportionate use of force, including the use of violence. The allegations state that a large 
police presence was brought into the community during the demolition process which targeted 
protestors against the demolitions with violence. It is alleged that four protestors (Issa Buruku, 
Kabiru Abubakar, Dan Asebe and Ismaila Abdullahi) were shot, with three being injured and one </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 49 
 
</p>
<p>killed. Two of the injured are still allegedly in a critical condition. According to the reports 
received, the police allegedly denied culpability during a police investigation. Reportedly, these 
evictions are justified by the FCDA as being part of the belated implementation of the 1979 
Abuja Master Plan. Allegedly, the implementation of this plan has led to a pattern of forced 
evictions and demolitions of informal settlements without consultation or compensation since 
</p><p>2003. Evictions and demolitions in Abuja communities and other informal settlements, including 
in the Municipality of Gwagwalada, have reportedly taken place since 2003/2004, by the Federal 
Capital Development Authority. Excluding the most recent wave of evictions and demolitions, it 
is alleged that the total number of dispossessed and homeless people amounts to an estimated 
800,000 persons. The Special Rapporteurs reminded the Government of Nigeria that this 
situation was already the subject of a communication by the previous Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing on 9 June 2006. Regretfully, no response to this communication had been 
received, at the date of this current communication. It has been alleged that a number of the 
residents in Gosa Sariki and Toge forfeited their rights to alternative measures such as 
compensation because they were squatting in houses that were not built legally. Regardless of 
the truth of the allegation, in General Comment No.7 it is recognized that &#8220;where eviction is 
considered to be justified, it should be carried out in strict compliance with the relevant 
provisions of international human rights law and in accordance with general principles of 
reasonableness and proportionality&#8221; (Paragraph 14). General Comment No.7 also indicates that 
&#8220;state parties shall ensure, prior to carrying out any evictions, and particularly those involving 
large groups, that all feasible alternatives are explored in consultation with the affected persons, 
with a view to avoiding, or at least minimizing, the need to use force. Legal remedies or 
procedures should be provided to those who are affected by eviction orders&#8221; (Paragraph 13). 
With particular concern for the rights of all residents of Abuja, the Special Rapporteurs urged the 
government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the 
aforementioned persons are respected at the present and in the future. They also requested that 
the government, upon consideration of the legality of these actions, adopt effective measures to 
prevent the recurrence of acts found to be in contradictions of obligations under international 
human rights law to which Nigeria is a party. This includes taking all necessary measures to 
guarantee that rights and freedoms are protected and accountability of any persons guilty of any 
alleged violations are ensured. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the 
allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on any notice provided to 
residents of the alleged evictions and demolitions of houses in the Gosa Sariki or Toge 
communities and to the alleged evictions and demolitions scheduled for Abuja in August and 
September 2008; on any consultation of residents in relation to the alleged evictions and 
demolitions in the Gosa Sariki or Toge communities and on the proposed consultation of 
residents in relation to the alleged evictions and demolitions scheduled for Abuja in August and 
September 2008; on any arrangements for the present or future resettlement of residents affected 
by alleged evictions and demolitions in the Gosa Sariki or Toge communities and on the 
proposed arrangements for the future resettlement of residents in relation to the alleged evictions 
and demolitions scheduled for Abuja in August and September 2008; on any compensation 
provided to residents affected by alleged evictions and demolitions in the Gosa Sariki or Toge 
communities and on the compensation planned in respect of the future resettlement of residents 
in relation to the alleged evictions and demolitions scheduled for Abuja in August and 
September 2008; on any legal or other remedies available to those residents allegedly affected by 
evictions and demolitions in the Gosa Sariki or Toge communities and whether or not use has 
been made of these remedies; on court proceedings in relation to the alleged forced evictions and </p>

</p>
<p>demolitions in Toge or any related proceedings (in the event that an order/verdict has been 
announced, whether it has been implemented) and on the implementation of the High Court 
injunction of June 2003; and detailed information of, and where available the results, any 
investigation, medical examination and judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried 
out in relation to the four alleged protestors Issa Buruku, Kabiru Abubakar, Dan Asebe and 
Ismaila Abdullahi during the forced evictions and demolitions affecting the Toge community.

<p>70. El 8 de abril de 2008, el Relator Especial, junto con el Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n 
de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas y el Relator Especial 
sobre una vivienda adecuada como elemento integrante del derecho a un nivel de vida adecuado 
y sobre el derecho de no discriminaci&#243;n enviaron una Acci&#243;n Urgente al Gobierno de Panam&#225; 
con relaci&#243;n a los supuestos desalojos forzosos y otros abusos sufridos por los miembros de la 
comunidad Charco La Pava, del pueblo ng&#246;be, en el Distrito de Changuinola (Provincia Bocas 
del Toro). Hicieron referencia a las diversas alegaciones recibidas por los Relatores Especiales 
durante los &#250;ltimos meses en relaci&#243;n con el impacto de la construcci&#243;n de represas en el &#225;rea del 
Bosque Protector Palo Seco sobre la vida de las comunidades ng&#246;be y naso. Explicaron que 
dichas alegaciones estaban siendo analizadas actualmente por los Relatores Especiales y ser&#225;n 
transmitidas pr&#243;ximamente al Gobierno de Panam&#225; para su consideraci&#243;n. Con relaci&#243;n a dichas 
alegaciones, solicitaron al gobierno la atenci&#243;n urgente las informaciones que hayan recibido con 
relaci&#243;n a los supuestos desalojos forzosos y otros abusos sufridos por los miembros de la 
comunidad Charco La Pava, del pueblo ng&#246;be, en el Distrito de Changuinola, en relaci&#243;n con los 
trabajos de construcci&#243;n del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico CHAN 75. A finales de 2007, la empresa 
EAS-Changuinola dio inicio a las obras de construcci&#243;n del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico CHAN 75, 
las cuales implicar&#225;n las inundaciones completas de la Comunidad Charco La Pava y otras 
comunidades ng&#246;be aleda&#241;as, sin contar con el consentimiento de dichas comunidades. El 3 de 
enero de 2008, comenzaron las primeras detonaciones para el desmonte de los terrenos, as&#237; como 
la entrada del personal de la empresa en las tierras de la comunidad Charco La Pava. Dichos 
trabajos generaron las protestas de los miembros de la Comunidad, que habr&#237;an sido reprimidas 
por efectivos de la Polic&#237;a Nacional. Se denuncia el uso excesivo de la fuerza en contra de la 
poblaci&#243;n civil desarmada, incluyendo en contra de mujeres y ni&#241;os, as&#237; como la detenci&#243;n de un 
alto n&#250;mero de personas. Desde mediados de febrero de 2008, la Polic&#237;a Nacional habr&#237;a 
establecido dos retenes a la entrada de la Comunidad Charco la Pava, impidiendo la libre 
circulaci&#243;n de los miembros de la Comunidad, as&#237; como la entrada de personas ajenas a la 
misma, incluyendo periodistas y observadores de organizaciones no gubernamentales. En uno de 
los retenes, la Polic&#237;a habr&#237;a asimismo instalado un faro de luz, encendido las 24 horas del d&#237;a, 
para controlar en todo momento las actividades de los miembros de la Comunidad. El d&#237;a 28 de 
marzo de 2008, la Gobernadora de la Provincia Bocas del Toro, Sra. Ester Mena Chiu, 
acompa&#241;ada del Representante Regional de la Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente (ANAN), 
Sr. Valent&#237;n Pineda, de la Ing. Thais Mej&#237;a, empleada de AES, y de dos miembros de la Polic&#237;a </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1

</p>
<p>Nacional, se habr&#237;a personado en Charco La Pava y convocado a una reuni&#243;n con los miembros 
de la Comunidad. En dicha reuni&#243;n, la Gobernadora habr&#237;a supuestamente conminado a dichos 
miembros a que abandonaran voluntariamente sus hogares para permitir la continuidad de los 
trabajos de construcci&#243;n de la represa, y que de lo contrario se emplear&#237;a la fuerza policial para 
desalojarlos. En este contexto, los Relatores Especiales han recibido una serie de alegaciones 
espec&#237;ficas relativas a los supuestos desalojos y otros abusos sufridos por miembros de la 
Comunidad Charco La Pava que se han opuesto a la construcci&#243;n del proyecto. Se denuncian el 
uso excesivo de la fuerza en contra de estas personas; amenazas e insultos; irregularidades 
administrativas en la tramitaci&#243;n de los desalojos, as&#237; como la destrucci&#243;n de vivienda y de 
cultivos. En algunos de los casos reportados, se denuncia asimismo que las personas en cuesti&#243;n 
se han encontrado en situaci&#243;n de indefensi&#243;n debido a su limitada comprensi&#243;n del idioma 
castellano. En ninguno de los casos reportados las supuestas v&#237;ctimas habr&#237;an recibido 
compensaci&#243;n o indemnizaci&#243;n alguna. El caso de la Sra. Ana Castillo: El 3 de enero de 2008, 
los cultivos existentes en la finca de la Sra. Ana Castillo habr&#237;an sido destruidos por excavadoras 
manejadas por personal de la empresa AES-Changuinola, bajo las &#243;rdenes de los Ingenieros 
Rodolfo Ayarza y Lidami Morales, custodiadas por efectivos de la Polic&#237;a Nacional. Al acercarse 
al personal de la empresa para solicitarles que detuvieran la destrucci&#243;n de los cultivos, la 
Polic&#237;a, sin mediar aviso, habr&#237;a comenzado a golpearla. Seg&#250;n las alegaciones, la Sra. Castillo 
habr&#237;a sido desnudada y arrastrada en dicho estado hasta el veh&#237;culo que la condujo al Cuartel de 
la Polic&#237;a de Changuinola. En dicho cuartel, a cargo del Jefe de Polic&#237;a Jos&#233; Manuel R&#237;os, la 
Sra. Castillo habr&#237;a sido objeto de insultos y amenazas para que firmara un acuerdo con la 
empresa constructora y abandonara su vivienda. Los hijos de la Sra. Castillo, Anselmo Santos, 
Didier Santos, e Irene Santos, todos ellos menores de edad, habr&#237;an sido tambi&#233;n supuestamente 
trasladados al cuartel, insultados y golpeados. El 28 de marzo de 2008, la Sra. Ana Castillo 
habr&#237;a participado en la reuni&#243;n con la Gobernadora de Bocas del Toro, donde se le demand&#243; 
expresamente que abandonara su casa y aceptara negociar con la empresa. Durante dicha 
reuni&#243;n, agentes de la Polic&#237;a Nacional pistola en mano habr&#237;an conminando a la Sra. Castillo a 
que firmara un documento de acuerdo y a que abandonara su hogar. El 30 de marzo de 2008, se 
habr&#237;an reanudado los trabajos en los terrenos propiedad de la Sra. Castillo, comunic&#225;ndosele 
verbalmente que iba a ser desalojada de su casa. El caso del Sr. Francisco Santos: El 3 de enero 
de 2008, empleados de la empresa AES, acompa&#241;ados de efectivos de la Polic&#237;a Nacional, 
habr&#237;an comenzado a detonar explosivos en la finca privada del Sr. Francisco Santos. Al 
descubrirlo, el Sr. Santos se habr&#237;a dirigido a los empleados de la empresa para solicitarles que 
no destruyeran sus cultivos. En dicho momento, y sin mediar palabra, el Sr. Santos habr&#237;a 
comenzado a ser golpeado e insultado por la Polic&#237;a. El Sr. Santos habr&#237;a ca&#237;do al suelo, donde 
habr&#237;a continuado a recibir golpes, y posteriormente trasladado al cuartel de Polic&#237;a de 
Changuinola. Los hijos del Sr. Santos, Venero Santos y Abel Santos, que tambi&#233;n habr&#237;an 
conminado a los empleados de la empresa a detener los trabajos, habr&#237;an sido tambi&#233;n golpeados 
y detenidos por la Polic&#237;a. El 13 febrero de 2008, empleados de la empresa AES Changuinola, 
acompa&#241;ados de efectivos de la Polic&#237;a Nacional se habr&#237;an vuelto a personar en la finca del 
Sr. Santos para dar comienzo a los trabajos de remoci&#243;n y excavaci&#243;n de tierras, destruyendo 
todos los cultivos de su propiedad y presentando una orden de desalojo. El Sr. Santos habr&#237;a sido 
forzado por la Polic&#237;a a firmar un documento del que desconoc&#237;a el contenido, debido a que no 
sabe leer ni escribir. El 28 de marzo de 2008, la Gobernadora de la Provincia de Bocas del Toro, 
acompa&#241;ada de personal de la empresa AES y de dos miembros de la Polic&#237;a Nacional, se habr&#237;a 
personado en la residencia del Sr. Santos, orden&#225;ndole que desalojara su vivienda. Al d&#237;a 
siguiente, los cultivos de la propiedad del Sr. Santos habr&#237;an sido completamente destruidos por </p>

</p>
<p>efectivos de la empresa. El caso de la Sra. Amalia Abrego: El 3 de enero de 2008, la Sra. Abrego 
se encontraba observando los trabajos de detonaci&#243;n junto con otros miembros de la comunidad 
cuando fue insultada y golpeada por la Polic&#237;a, desnudada y arrastrada en ese estado. La 
Sra. Abrego habr&#237;a sido posteriormente detenida y trasladada, junto con sus tres hijos menores, al 
Cuartel de Polic&#237;a, donde habr&#237;a sido objeto de insultos. El 29 de marzo de 2008, en el curso de 
la reuni&#243;n con la Gobernadora de la Provincia de Bocas del Toro, la Sra. Amalia Abrego habr&#237;a 
sido informada que deb&#237;a abandonar su residencia. El caso del menor Iv&#225;n Miranda: El menor 
Iv&#225;n Miranda, de 10 a&#241;os de edad, habr&#237;a sido golpeado en la nariz el 3 de enero de 2008, 
cuando trataba de levantar a su madre y a su hermana de 8 a&#241;os del suelo. El menor habr&#237;a sido 
trasladado, junto con el resto de su familia, a un cuartel de la Polic&#237;a Nacional, donde habr&#237;a sido 
objeto de golpes, insultos y amenazas, sin haber recibido atenci&#243;n m&#233;dica. El menor Iv&#225;n 
Miranda sufrir&#237;a todav&#237;a las secuelas del golpe recibido y, en la medida en que la Polic&#237;a 
impedir&#237;a su salida de la Comunidad, no habr&#237;a recibido todav&#237;a una atenci&#243;n m&#233;dica adecuada. 
El caso del Sr. Ernesto L&#243;pez: El Sr. Ernesto L&#243;pez habr&#237;a recibido en enero de 2008 la orden 
verbal de desalojo de su vivienda por parte de la Polic&#237;a. Los cultivos de la finca del Sr. L&#243;pez 
habr&#237;an sido destruidos, careciendo de medios de subsistencia y temiendo por su desalojo 
inminente. El caso del Sr. Manuel L&#243;pez: El 3 de enero de 2008, cuando intentaba levantar a un 
ni&#241;o que hab&#237;a ca&#237;do al suelo en el curso de los enfrentamientos con las fuerzas del orden, el 
Sr. Manuel L&#243;pez habr&#237;a sido arrastrado por efectivos de la Polic&#237;a Nacional, quienes habr&#237;an 
comenzado a golpearlo mientras se encontraba en el suelo. El Sr. L&#243;pez habr&#237;a sido trasladado al 
Cuartel de Changuinola y de ah&#237; al centro m&#233;dico m&#225;s cercano, donde le habr&#237;an hecho firmar un 
documento sin haber recibido atenci&#243;n alguna. En la estaci&#243;n policial, el Sr. L&#243;pez habr&#237;a sido 
objeto de insultos y golpes. El viernes 28 de marzo, el Sr. L&#243;pez habr&#237;a sido notificado 
verbalmente por la Polic&#237;a de la necesidad de que desalojara su residencia. El caso de la 
Sra. Isabel Becker: En octubre de 2007, la Sra. Becker habr&#237;a sido supuestamente presionada 
para firmar un contrato redactado en espa&#241;ol tras haber pasado m&#225;s de 10 horas contra su

<p>72. On 29 January 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Representative of the 
Secretary-General on internally displaced persons and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of racism sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of the Russian Federation, 
concerning reports received regarding 147 Chechen families who have been displaced to 
Ingushetia and Dagestan returned to the Chechen capital of Grozny. At the time of this 
communication, they reportedly had not yet found a durable solution and were at risk of being 
forcefully evicted from their place of living. On 10 January 2008, these 147 families who were 
living in a temporary accommodation centre at 4 Vyborgskaia Street in Grozny were reportedly 
told by officials that they had to leave their accommodation at short notice. According to the 
information received, some inhabitants have been told they should leave before the end of the 
month, and officials allegedly threatened to cut off the electricity and gas if they do not leave. It 
was reported that inhabitants of many other temporary accommodation centers in Grozny were 
also being told to leave. Those affected have reportedly not been consulted and no adequate 
alternative accommodation has been foreseen for their relocation. Especially during wintertime, 
access to adequate housing is extremely important particularly for the vulnerable groups among 
the internally displaced such as young children, elderly and disabled people.  
</p>
<p>73. On 21 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Rapporteur on human rights defenders sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of the 
Russian Federation, concerning reports received regarding Ms Carine Cl&#233;ment, 
Mr. Mikhail Beketov and Mr. Sergei Fedotov. Ms Carine Cl&#233;ment is a Moscow-based French 
sociologist, and the director of the Institute of Collective Action. Ms Cl&#233;ment is very active on 
housing rights and trade unions. Mr. Mikhail Beketov is a journalist and editor-in-chief of the 
Kimkinskaia Pravda newspaper, and is involved in the protection of environmental rights. 
Mr. Serguei Fedotov is the leader of a group supporting disenfranchised small landowners in the 
suburbs of Moscow. On 13 November 2008 Ms Carine Cl&#233;ment was attacked near the Bilingua 
Club in downtown Moscow, on her way to a roundtable. Two unidentified man ran up to her 
from behind, and stabbed her in the thigh with a syringe containing an unidentified substance. 
On 12 November 2008, another assailant attacked Mrs. Carine Cl&#233;ment near her house. He 
insulted her and spat on her. Mrs. Cl&#233;ment filed a complaint with the police and went to the 
hospital for medical treatment. On 13 November 2008, Mr. Mikhail Beketov was found by a 
neighbour in his courtyard of his home in the Khimki district of Moscow. Mr. Beketov was 
severely beaten and was unconscious when he was taken to the hospital. He sustained a head 
injury, multiple broken bones, and other serious injuries. On 13 November 2008, 
Mr. Sergei Fedotov was attacked by two young men with baseball bats and pepper spray. 
Concern was expressed that the attacks on these human rights defenders working on economic 
and social rights, including on the right to adequate housing, in the Russian Federation may form 
part of a broader intimidation campaign. Further concern was expressed that the assaults on these 
defenders may be solely connected to their activities in the defense of human rights. In addition </p>

<p>75. On 5 August 2008 the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government of 
Sri Lanka, concerning reports of mass forced evictions and demolitions of houses in 
Kompannaweediya, Colombo on 18 July 2008 and the threat of further forced evictions and 
demolitions in Kompannaweediya as well as in the Mahawatha area in Colombo. Concerning the 
situation in Kompannaweediya area, according to the information received, on 18 July 2008, 
armed police carried out forced evictions, affecting around 1770 residents of the 
Kompannaweediya area, including many children. These people were reportedly legal and 
long-standing residents in the area and had paid rates and taxes to the relevant authorities. The 
information received indicates that 47 houses were demolished and that the police engaged in 
disproportionate force including violence and the use of tear gas, against residents who were 
resisting the evictions. It is also alleged that during these events, one man was arrested. In 
response to a notice received on 11 July to vacate the area, community representatives petitioned 
the Supreme Court to halt the planned evictions. The notice cited security concerns in advance of 
the upcoming South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit. Although 
the Supreme Court issued an order on 18 July to maintain the status quo until 22 July, the police 
still carried out the evictions on 18 July. Later, the police asserted that they were unaware of the 
order, and ceased the evictions once they were informed of the order. 900 houses remain intact 
pending the outcome of the court case. Many people did not have time to recover possessions 
before the evictions took place. The affected residents have been assigned temporary alternative 
housing which is inadequate, as it reportedly lacks water, sanitation and electricity, and some of 
the housing was not even finished before the evictions were carried out. The information 
received alleges that there was no meaningful consultation about alternatives. The residents, who 
are reported to live in a situation of extreme poverty, are now in a heightened state of 
vulnerability and insecurity and many continue to live under the threat of eviction. Concerning 
the situation in the Mahawatha area, Colombo according to the information received: 400 
families living along the railway line in the Mahawatha area of Colombo were ordered to vacate 
their houses by 28 July or 4 August (depending on when they received the letter of notice). In 
total, around 2,000 people would be affected by such evictions, including about 1,200 children. It 
is reported that the authorities did not consult the residents prior to delivering the eviction 
notices, and no alternative accommodation or compensation was offered. The residents have </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 55 
 
</p>
<p>lived in the area for several decades and there is concern that these residents, who already live in 
a situation of extreme poverty, will be rendered homeless if these evictions take place. 
Furthermore, it is alleged that a community leader who was organizing the community to oppose 
the evictions was abducted on 21 July. He was subsequently released but reportedly coerced to 
drop charges he had planned to bring before the court. Additionally, a court case has been lodged 
with the Supreme Court on 31 July concerning these evictions. Although 14 petitioners 
originally joined in this case, they reportedly received threats, which led the majority of them to 
withdraw their names. Serious concern is expressed for the safety of persons attempting to claim 
their rights. It has since been reported that the Supreme Court found no violation of international 
law and it considered that the residents had been given enough notice according to national law. 
On humanitarian grounds, it ordered the Attorney General to inform the railway authority to give 
the residents more time before imposing the evictions, but it is unclear how much time will be 
allowed. Additionally, alternative accommodation has still not been organized, and no 
compensation has been offered, according to the information received. In the context of the 
allegations, the Special Rapporteur emphasized that forced evictions without adequate 
resettlement and without compensation make it impossible for impoverished citizens to have 
access to the basic necessities of life such as the right to food, the right to housing, the right to 
education and the right to an adequate standard of living. In the case of the forced evictions in 
Kompannaweediya, it has been alleged that the resettlement of affected residents in the Mutwal 
area is inadequate, lacking basic facilities such as water and sanitation. In the case of the 
proposed forced evictions in Mahawatha, it has been alleged that the affected families will be 
rendered homeless, as no resettlement plan has been prepared. It has also been alleged that 
neither group of residents have received adequate compensation, nor are plans in place to 
compensate them. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the 
Special Rapporteur requested further information on the grounds on which such forced evictions 
and demolitions were conducted, on the legal framework governing decisions in this regard; if 
there was any impact assessment carried out prior to the evictions; if the affected individuals and 
communities were consulted before the evictions were planned; if the communities and affected 
persons, in the view of the Government, were given adequate and reasonable prior notice before 
the eviction; if the communities and affected persons were given adequate and reasonable time to 
withdraw their belongings before the destruction of their residences; on the measures that have 
been foreseen by the authorities to ensure that the evictions do not result in homelessness of the 
affected persons and to relocate of the affected people. The Special Rapporteur also requested 
clarification on whether force was used during the evictions that took place on 18 July in 
Kompannaweediya, including details about any arrests of individuals, and charges against them; 
if there has been any investigation, medical examination, judicial or other inquiry into the 
allegations mentioned above; details about the case before the Supreme Court concerning the 
evictions in Kompannaweediya, including any subsequent decision about the 900 remaining 
houses and about the court case concerning the evictions at Mahawatha, and to what extent the 
verdict has been implemented; on the steps taken to ensure that persons attempting to claim their 
rights are not threatened or harassed in any way, and that their rights are protected; and in the 
event that any alleged perpetrator(s) were identified, the full details of any prosecutions which 
have been undertaken; any sanctions that have been imposed on the alleged perpetrator. 
</p>
<p>76. On 13 November 2008 the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the government 
of Sri Lanka concerning information received regarding the planned eviction of families from at 
least 11 tsunami transitional shelter sites in Moratuwa and Ratmalana Divisions: &#8220;The affected </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 56 
 
</p>
<p>tsunami transitional shelter sites are Sunandopananda Vidyalaya, Roman Catholic School, 
Lunawa Rest House, Koralawella Playground, Sugatha Dharmadara Vidyalaya, Salu Sala, 
Molpe Sobitha School, Jagapura in the Moratuwa DS Division (Common Building) and 
Karmantha Pura and Kotalawala (Common Building) in the Ratmalana DS Division. Reports 
received indicate that the transitional shelter scheme under the Tsunami Housing Policy has been 
an effective and widely used means of temporarily providing shelter and other basic services to 
families affected by the devastating effects of the Tsunami in Sri Lanka in December 2004. It is 
reported that, since early 2008, many families have been able gain access to adequate housing 
through grants from the Government of Sri Lanka. The information received indicates that the 
Tsunami Housing Policy allegedly entitles everyone who lost a house in the disaster to receive a 
ready built house or a cash grant to build a house, regardless of the shelter they had in the past. It 
is alleged that the Tsunami Housing Policy awards a single grant to a household without 
considering the number of people constituting the household. Therefore, according to the 
information provided, the assistance given to large households has been insufficient and 
extended families were allegedly forced to remain in the transitional shelters. Additionally, the 
Tsunami Housing Policy allegedly states that tenants are not eligible to receive housing 
assistance. The Tsunami (Special Provisions) Act (2005) allegedly states that rent agreements 
between landlord and tenant remain valid even if that house was completely destroyed during the 
Tsunami. The information provided indicates that tenants are disqualified from housing 
assistance because of their old agreements yet are often unaware of their rights or unable to 
enforce them in respect of their agreements with their old landlord. Reports received also 
indicate that no adequate consultation was conducted with the affected families at any stage. 
Additionally, these groups of people were reportedly not provided with any arrangements for 
relocation or assistance and are consequently facing loss of shelter and destitution. Reportedly, 
extended families and tenants form the majority of the residents who have been served notice of 
eviction for 10 October 2008 from the above listed transitional shelters. Additionally, some 
groups of people were subject to a de facto eviction when basic services such as the electricity 
supply and sanitation facilities in some of the shelters were discontinued on 10 September 2008. 
According to the information provided, the planned evictions will impact upon around 499 
families in 10 of these shelter sites (excluding the Kotalawala (Common Building)). It is reported 
that a directive stating that members of extended families and former tenants are eligible for 
assistance that was issued by your Excellency&#8217;s Government to all Divisional Secretaries has not 
been followed in this respect. It is reported that the Salu Sala Shelter is one of the transitional 
shelters in Moratuwa which is affected by the eviction notice awarded by the Divisional 
Secretary of Moratuwa. Allegedly, around 90 families of those remaining in Salu Sala 
Transitional Shelter were tenants or members of extended families and have not received any 
assistance or offer of relocation from the government. It is alleged that the only group in the Salu 
Sala transitional shelter site who had received an offer of relocation were another 11 families 
also occupying the shelter because the alternative housing already provided to them was 
inadequate and lacked basic facilities such as water and sanitation; however, it is alleged that 
there have been long delays with these grants. As referred to above, the Government Agent of 
Colombo has allegedly issued a directive to all Divisional Secretaries under his authority, stating 
that all renters and extended families affected by the Tsunami are eligible to receive grants from 
the Government of Sri Lanka in order to buy land and build houses. However, it seems that the 
directive has not been followed by the Divisional Secretary of Moratuwa. Additionally, some 
community representatives who allegedly met with the Divisional Secretary were arrested and 
now allegedly face court proceedings and possible criminal charges because of their attempt to </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 57 
 
</p>
<p>advocate on behalf of their community on these issues. While the action of the authorities to 
address the plight of victims of the Tsunami is commendable, the alleged facts of the &#8220;de facto&#8221; 
eviction of families through the discontinuing of basic services in some transitional shelters in 
the Moratuwa and Ratmalana divisions and the proposed eviction of the others remaining in 
these transitional shelters may be a matter of concern regarding the obligations of Sri Lanka to 
the right to adequate housing. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the 
allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further information if any complaint has been 
lodged; on details, and where available the results, of any investigation, medical examinations, 
and judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to this case; in the 
event that the alleged perpetrators were identified, full details of any prosecutions that have been 
undertaken and sanctions that have been imposed on the alleged perpetrators; and whether 
compensation has been provided to the victim or the family of the victim.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>77. On 4 September 2008<b> </b>the Government of Sri Lanka sent a response to the communication 
dated 5 August 2008. The Government provided information on the alleged mass forced 
evictions and demolitions of houses in Kompannaweediya (Slave Island) as well as in the 
Mahawatha area in Colombo. According to this information: &#8220;Some families have been living in 
unauthorized structures built on government owned reservation lands in Glenic Street and houses 
in Kompannaweediya (Slave Island) as well as in the Mahawatha area in Colombo. The Urban 
Development Authority, the Government body authorized to deal with such issues, issued 
advance notice on them to vacate the areas. The areas under reference are situated within the 
High Security Zone in Colombo and the Government has already initiated a project to construct 
1,000 houses in Dematagoda, a suburb in Colombo at a cost of Rs 1 million for each dweller of 
Slave Island and the work is due to be completed by the end of March next year. When these 
dwellers did not comply with the notice, the Urban Development Authority using the powers 
vested on it by statute, started to demolish the unauthorized structures, the Urban Development 
Authority had informed the dwellers of the demolition of their unauthorized constructions well in 
advance. According to the Urban Development Authority, these people had given their consent 
in writing to move to a new place provided by the Government. However, a tense situation 
occurred when the demolitions began and the Police were compelled to use minimum force to 
manage the unruly crowds in order to maintain law and order. The dwellers had also petitioned 
the Supreme Court in a fundamental rights case against their eviction from unauthorized lands. 
The Supreme Court dismissed the petition on 19 August 2008. By this time, all but 21 families 
had moved into the new place provided by the Government. Following the dismissal of the 
Fundamental Rights case, the balance occupants in Glennic Street agreed either to accept 
temporary houses in Totalanga area in Colombo, or receive one year rental fees until the 
Dematagoda housing complex is ready for occupation. The Urban Development Authority gave 
more time to the occupants to vacate in view of the forthcoming Ramazan festival. Already 154 
families had moved to the temporary shelters at Thotalanga, while 155 families obtained a sum 
of Rs. 101,000 each including one year&#8217;s rental of Rs 96,000 plus an allowance of Rs 5,000 
provided to transport their belongings.&#8221;

<p>79. On 8 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on Torture sent a joint allegation 
letter to the Government of Sudan concerning reports received regarding attacks against the 
civilian population of the villages Logurony and Iloli in Eastern Equatoria State by the Sudan 
People&#8217;s Liberation Army, which resulted in the killing and beating of civilians and destruction 
of dwellings and livelihoods on 4 June 2008 and in the following days. The villages of Logurony 
and Iloli, located near Hiyala, in Torit county, Eastern Equatoria State, Southern Sudan, have a 
history of occasionally tense relationships, due primarily to cattle raiding incidents. At the 
beginning of June 2008, the Governor of Eastern Equatoria State dispatched the Sudan People&#8217;s 
Liberation Army (SPLA) to the two villages, apparently with orders to carry out arrests and 
disarm the population. On 4 June 2008 at around 4 a.m. in the morning, SPLA forces surrounded 
Logurony. While it was still completely dark, they started shooting, at first aiming in the air. The 
villagers, who were on high alert due to an expected attack from Iloli, returned fire. Only when it 
became light, they realized that they had killed SPLA soldiers. Fearing retaliation by the SPLA, 
they fled into the bush. SPLA soldiers shot at Logurony villagers, reportedly killing four: 
Tome Marcello, the headmaster of the primary school; Ogesa Orlando, a police officer; 
Oreste Ogubung, and Origo Agala. They also started burning down the village. Two elderly 
people, Ojeno Itak and his wife Amisia Itak, died in their dwelling during the fire. On 
21 June 2008, another elderly woman, Anisa Anohira Oteng, succumbed to the burn injuries 
sustained at the hospital to which she had been taken by SPLA soldiers. Also on 4 June 2008, 
SPLA forces (reportedly counting 300 men) surrounded Iloli. The soldiers took the inhabitants 
outside the village and then started burning down the village, which killed one woman, 
Abung Elizabeth. The SPLA also arrested five men and tied their hands behind their backs. 
When news of the SPLA members killed in Logurony reached Iloli, the SPLA Operational 
Commander came to Iloli and allegedly ordered the soldiers to execute those arrested. The five 
men were led back to Iloli. Three men, named Bertino Odiongo, Angelo Otuno Ogede and 
Francesco Asai Omudek, were executed on the spot in front of the remaining village community. 
One of those arrested was injured but managed to escape. The fifth man was beaten by the 
soldiers and chased away. The population started running towards the bush. The SPLA opened 
fire on them, injuring another man. The bodies of two children, aged 5 and 6 (Ramonok Joseph 
and Omode Leone), were found in the bush surrounding the village on 9 June 2008, as were the 
mortal remains of a woman suffering from epilepsy (Kelenga Obong), who probably did not 
survive the stress resulting from her flight. Iloli village was burned to the ground. Soldiers 
gathered the remaining Iloli and Logurony villagers, approximately one thousand persons, and 
brought them to the SPLA barracks in Ramshel. There they spent the remainder of the day under 
the trees. Women were reportedly beaten with sticks. In the evening of 4 June 2008 they were 
released, apparently on orders of the Torit County Commissioner. Twelve male villagers, five 
from Logurony and seven from Iloli, however remained in SPLA detention until 7 June 2008 
(one of them seven days longer). Some were allegedly held in a tukul, while others were kept in 
a hole in the ground. All were beaten on their head and stomach with gun barrels and other 
wooden and iron objects. Two Logurony detainees sustained severe head injuries, while another 
had whipping marks on his buttocks. These men did not report the ill-treatment to the police as 
they feared rearrest by the SPLA. On 10 June 2008, a young man from Hiyala was arrested on </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 59 
 
</p>
<p>suspicion of involvement in the shooting that led to the death of SPLA soldiers. He was taken to 
the SPLA barracks and severely beaten. He was released following a meetings between the 
Hiyala Head Chief and the SPLA, and had to be taken to Hiyala Hospital for medical treatment. 
SPLA retaliation against the civilian population of Logurony, Iloli and Hiyala continued in the 
days following 4 June 2008. On 6 June 2008, SPLA men shot at Hiyala villagers who were 
working in the field. A man and a woman were killed (Oronjo Safarino and Odiongo Salvatore), 
another woman injured. On 7 June 2008, Omudek Alajut, a man from Iloli, returned to the 
village, was apprehended by SPLA soldiers, tied up and executed on the spot. On 10 June 2008, 
Omunong Ohisa Ernaldo and Oreste Ohuro, two Logurony villagers, were found shot dead near 
Hiyala village square. These events resulted in major displacement from Iloli and Logurony 
villages. Approximately 2,800 inhabitants of Logurony and approximately 1,500 of Iloli were 
displaced. Their dwellings were destroyed and they lacked the materials to rebuild them. 
Moreover, on 4 June 2008, the SPLA seized the cattle belonging to the Iloli and Logurony 
villages, on which the population relied for their livelihood. Additionally, SPLA soldiers 
destroyed or took away the solar panels operating the Iloli water boreholes. Government 
representatives from Eastern Equatoria State have visited the area and submitted reports to both 
the President and Vice-President of the Government of Southern Sudan. The Eastern Equatoria 
State authorities and the Ministry of SPLA Affairs have announced that a high-level Committee 
will be investigating the incidents. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the 
allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information on the authority that decided 
to entrust the SPLA (instead of the Southern Sudan Police Service) with an operation aimed at 
ending cattle rustling and other disputes between two villages, and the grounds for doing so; 
information on the orders of engagement of the SPLA units dispatched to Loguronyi and Iloli; 
details on the proceedings and results of the investigation by the high-level committee reportedly 
announced by the Ministry of SPLA Affairs; details of any disciplinary measures imposed on, 
and criminal prosecutions against persons found to be responsible, as perpetrators or as 
responsible commanders, for the alleged extrajudicial executions and rapes of women; details of 
any measures taken to ensure that complainants, witnesses and family members of the victims 
are not subject to any intimidation or retaliation; information on measures adopted to ensure that 
law enforcement forces in Southern Sudan comply with the UN Basic Principles on the Use of 
Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials; whether any compensation was, or is intended to be, 
provided to the rape victims and the families of the victims of killings by SPLA forces; and 
information on the steps taken by your Government to restore adequate housing and access to 
adequate food and water to the populations of Logurony and Iloli and whether any compensation 
was intended to be provided to the families whose housing was destroyed by the SPLA forces 
and whose cattle has not been returned.

<p>80. On 12 March 2008, the following information was provided by the authorities of the Sudan 
to the Special Rapporteur in regard to a number of communications, the last one dated 
21 August 2007 related to hydroelectric constructions in the area of Merowe and Kajbar: &#8220;I 
should like to thank the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing for his report and we should 
like to affirm that the Government of the Sudan respects and earnestly endeavors to ensure the 
right of every citizen to adequate housing. With regard to the comments on the Merowe Dam and 
its impact on the inhabitants of the Amri and Manasir districts, clearly, the Government of the 
Sudan has done everything to pay adequate compensation to the affected persons, to create 
alternative agricultural projects for them and to provide then with suitable housing. In this </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 60 
 
</p>
<p>connection, the State carried out a general census of the two areas in order to verify the number 
of families and family members and assess the potential damage to property, such as trees, 
agricultural harvests and homes. The census was carried out in 1999, before the preparatory 
work on construction of the dams began. On the basis of the results, two zones were identified 
that were not very far from the areas that would be affected by the construction of the dam basin. 
Suitable housing was built in specially constructed villages and supplied with electricity and 
water services. Moreover, an agricultural project was set up and all related project works were 
completed. In addition, roads, schools, a hospital and health centers were constructed in the 
villages. In 2006, a second census was carried out to quantify all the additions that citizens had 
made to their existing property. Lists were issued of persons entitled to compensation and of the 
compensation amounts, and appeal boards were set up by the Ministry of Justice to hear 
challenges against compensation decisions. By law, the appeal boards&#8217; decisions can be 
challenged before an arbitration body presided over by a judge with a member representing the 
Department of Dams and another representing the aggrieved party. After all these procedures 
were carried out and compensation was paid to the rightful beneficiaries, the persons were 
transferred to the new areas, where they settled and began to cultivate their new land. The State 
bears the cost of all agricultural inputs and facilities for the land for a period of two years. The 
State has taken all possible measures to enable the affected individuals to receive compensation 
and to provide then with housing and agricultural land. The situation has stabilized and life 
continues as normal in these villages. As for Manasir, an agreement was reached with 
representatives of the affected population granting the latter the right to choose whether to take 
up the projects prepared by the Department of Dams or to take the local option requested by 
some of the affected persons. This is how things stand at present. With regard to the Kajbar 
Dam, preliminary feasibility studies on the technical and economic aspects of the project are 
being carried out at present. At the same time, the authorities are endeavoring to devise 
satisfactory solutions in consultation with the inhabitants of the affected area. The distinguish 
council cannot be unaware of the considerable importance of the construction of dams for the 
energy supply and expansion of agriculture and the impact that this will have on economic and 
social conditions throughout the country. On the other hand, those adversely affected by 
construction of these dams will not under any circumstances be sacrificed to the public interest. 
The Stage will consult the affected populations on the amounts of compensation to be awarded 
and on the areas to which there may be moves. The role of the State is to supply all necessary 
facilities for these areas so that these populations can have access to adequate housing and 
high-quality health, educational and agricultural services.&#8221;

<p>82. Le 28 d&#233;cembre 2007, le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial a adress&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation concernant la 
situation du logement &#224; Gen&#232;ve ainsi que des cas d&#8217;expulsion pass&#233;s ou &#224; venir. Le Rapporteur 
Sp&#233;cial a remerci&#233; les Autorit&#233;s Suisses pour leur lettre dat&#233;e du 9 novembre 2007 en r&#233;ponse &#224; 
sa communication du 24 ao&#251;t 2007 concernant cette question. Il a ajout&#233; que durant cette </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 61 
 
</p>
<p>p&#233;riode, des rapports et t&#233;moignages additionnels de diff&#233;rentes sources non-gouvernementales 
lui sont parvenus. Au vu des informations re&#231;ues, le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial requiert des pr&#233;cisions 
concernant les all&#233;gations re&#231;ues. En premier lieu le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial a demand&#233; des 
pr&#233;cisions sur les notifications et avis d&#8217;expulsion qui lui ont &#233;t&#233; rapport&#233;es. Selon les all&#233;gations 
re&#231;ues, les r&#233;sidents du Rhino auraient &#224; plusieurs reprises demand&#233; aux autorit&#233;s de la Ville et 
du Canton de confirmer ou d&#8217;infirmer les rumeurs selon lesquelles l&#8217;&#233;vacuation du b&#226;timent 
serait imminente. Les autorit&#233;s auraient refus&#233; de r&#233;pondre &#224; cette requ&#234;te. Il semble que ce 
manquement ait &#233;t&#233; admis publiquement par le magistrat en charge du logement suite &#224; ces 
&#233;v&#232;nements. De plus, il a &#233;t&#233; all&#233;gu&#233; que le d&#233;ni du droit &#224; un avis d&#8217;expulsion avait pour but 
d&#8217;emp&#234;cher un recours des r&#233;sidents du Rhino devant un tribunal qui aurait pu aboutir &#224; ordonner 
une suspension de l&#8217;expulsion jusqu&#8217;&#224; la fin des proc&#233;dures en cours devant le tribunal des baux 
et loyers. Comme les autorit&#233;s genevoises le d&#233;crivent, un avis de la police cantonale a &#233;t&#233; 
placard&#233; le 19 octobre 2005. Mais suite &#224; cela, des recours devant plusieurs juridictions ont &#233;t&#233; 
ouvertes. L&#8217;expulsion aurait ainsi eu lieu deux ans plus tard, sans pr&#233;avis suite &#224; la d&#233;cision 
administrative, et alors qu&#8217;une proc&#233;dure judiciaire &#233;tait encore en cours. La d&#233;cision du 
Tribunal des baux et loyers ne serait intervenue que le 3 septembre 2007, soit environ 6 semaines 
apr&#232;s l&#8217;&#233;vacuation. Durant l&#8217;op&#233;ration d&#8217;&#233;vacuation, le chef de police pr&#233;sent sur les lieux aurait 
d&#233;clar&#233; aux r&#233;sidents et observateurs qu&#8217;il ne s&#8217;agissait pas d&#8217;une &#233;vacuation mais d&#8217;un contr&#244;le 
d&#8217;identit&#233; (cette m&#234;me m&#233;thode aurait &#233;t&#233; utilis&#233;e durant l&#8217;&#233;vacuation du squat de la Tour). Il 
semblerait que, simultan&#233;ment &#224; cette op&#233;ration, le procureur g&#233;n&#233;ral tenait une conf&#233;rence de 
presse dans laquelle il indiquait que l&#8217;&#233;vacuation des r&#233;sidents du Rhino &#233;tait en cours. Aucun 
repr&#233;sentant ou observateur des autorit&#233;s, &#224; part les forces de police, n&#8217;aurait &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent sur les 
lieux durant l&#8217;op&#233;ration. Je vous serai reconnaissant de bien vouloir m&#8217;indiquer si les faits ci-
dessus sont av&#233;r&#233;s, et si oui, les raisons d&#8217;une telle d&#233;cision. Sur cette question de la notification 
d&#8217;une expulsion, le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial a relev&#233; la r&#233;ponse du Conseil d&#8217;Etat &#224; une interpellation 
urgente (IUE 464-A), qui reconnait en substance que l&#8217;&#233;vacuation du squat de la Tour avait &#233;t&#233; 
effectu&#233;e sans avertissement pr&#233;alable. Elle a &#233;galement constat&#233; comme positive l&#8217;attitude du 
Conseil d&#8217;Etat qui juge ce genre de notification &#171; non-obligatoire &#187; mais souhaitable &#224; l&#8217;avenir. 
Comme d&#233;crit par le Comit&#233; des droits &#233;conomiques, sociaux et culturels dans son commentaire 
g&#233;n&#233;ral n&#176;7 (paragraphe 15) ou dans les Principes de base et directives concernant les expulsions 
et les d&#233;placements li&#233;s au d&#233;veloppement (ci-apr&#232;s les Principes concernant les expulsions), 
toute d&#233;cision li&#233;e &#224; une expulsion doit &#234;tre annonc&#233;e par &#233;crit, dans la langue locale, &#224; toutes les 
personnes concern&#233;es, suffisamment &#224; l&#8217;avance. L&#8217;avis d&#8217;expulsion doit contenir une 
justification d&#233;taill&#233;e de la d&#233;cision, concernant notamment: a) l&#8217;absence de solution de 
remplacement raisonnable; b) tous les d&#233;tails de la solution propos&#233;e; c) lorsque aucune autre 
solution n&#8217;existe, toutes les mesures prises et pr&#233;vues pour minimiser l&#8217;impact n&#233;gatif des 
expulsions. De plus, un avis d&#8217;expulsion en bonne et due forme devrait autoriser et aider les 
int&#233;ress&#233;s &#224; dresser un inventaire pour &#233;valuer leurs biens immeubles, leurs investissements et 
leurs autres biens mat&#233;riels qui pourraient subir un dommage. Les personnes vis&#233;es par 
l&#8217;expulsion devraient &#233;galement avoir la possibilit&#233; d&#8217;&#233;valuer et de signaler les pertes non 
mon&#233;taires &#224; compenser. Le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial a &#233;galement demand&#233; des pr&#233;cisions sur le 
traitement des biens des personnes expuls&#233;es. Les informations re&#231;ues font &#233;tat d&#8217;un manque de 
diligence envers les biens des personnes &#233;vacu&#233;es durant et apr&#232;s l&#8217;&#233;vacuation. Les rapports 
indiquent que certaines personnes ont re&#231;u des factures t&#233;l&#233;phoniques internationales ayant &#233;t&#233; 
effectu&#233;es apr&#232;s l&#8217;&#233;vacuation et que des objets de valeur auraient &#233;t&#233; d&#233;truits ou auraient 
disparus. Les informations indiquent qu&#8217;aucune des plaintes adress&#233;es aux autorit&#233;s &#224; cet &#233;gard 
n&#8217;ont pour l&#8217;instant re&#231;u de r&#233;ponse, et que dans certains cas, la police a refus&#233; d&#8217;enregistrer les </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1

</p>
<p>plaintes. Suite &#224; l&#8217;expulsion, les effets personnels et les meubles des habitants de Rhino auraient 
&#233;t&#233; entrepos&#233;s par des d&#233;m&#233;nageurs mandat&#233;s par le propri&#233;taire des immeubles &#224; l&#8217;entreprise 
Swisslogistics SA, soci&#233;t&#233; administr&#233;e par un des avocats des propri&#233;taires de l&#8217;immeuble. Selon 
des all&#233;gations re&#231;ues, les personnes expuls&#233;es et qui demeurent sans logement ont re&#231;u une 
notification leur stipulant de retirer l&#8217;ensemble de leurs biens stock&#233;s suite aux expulsions, faute 
de quoi, les autorit&#233;s proc&#232;deraient &#224; une vente aux ench&#232;res de ces biens. Etant donn&#233; que ces 
personnes sont actuellement sans logement suite &#224; l&#8217;expulsion, la rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale a formul&#233; 
la demande de ne pas proc&#233;der &#224; la vente ou &#224; la destruction de ces biens tant que le probl&#232;me de 
relogement de ces personnes n&#8217;a pas &#233;t&#233; r&#233;gl&#233;. De plus, les informations re&#231;ues par les autorit&#233;s 
concernant les biens des personnes expuls&#233;es du squat de la Tour restent vagues (&#171; Selon les 
informations communiqu&#233;es par le propri&#233;taire de l&#8217;immeuble, ces personnes ont eu l&#8217;occasion 
de r&#233;cup&#233;rer la plupart de leurs affaires &#187;). Des &#233;l&#233;ments pr&#233;cis et v&#233;rifiables ont &#233;t&#233; demand&#233;s 
par le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial &#224; ce sujet. Le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial a demand&#233; des explications quant 
aux mesures de relogement des personnes expuls&#233;es. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, les 
personnes &#233;vacu&#233;es du squat du Rhino auraient &#233;t&#233; inform&#233;es apr&#232;s leur d&#233;tention qu&#8217;aucune 
mesure de relogement n&#8217;avait &#233;t&#233; prise. Les sources non-gouvernementales ont indiqu&#233; que 
seules les personnes avec enfants ont &#233;t&#233; relog&#233;es par la Ville de Gen&#232;ve (17 personnes dont 9 
enfants - des chiffres plus pr&#233;cis que ce qui &#233;tait contenu dans la r&#233;ponse des autorit&#233;s). Ainsi, 
une majorit&#233; des personnes &#233;vacu&#233;es demeurent provisoirement chez des amis ou parents et sont 
actuellement sans logement. A ce jour, une seule des personnes &#233;vacu&#233;e aurait r&#233;ussi &#224; louer un 
nouveau logement. Une cinquantaine de r&#233;sidents aurait demand&#233; un relogement collectif &#224; la 
municipalit&#233; de Gen&#232;ve, qui malgr&#233; un accord de principe, a indiqu&#233; qu&#8217;il n&#8217;y avait actuellement 
pas d&#8217;immeuble disponible &#224; cet effet. Les informations des autorit&#233;s indiquent qu&#8217;au moment de 
l&#8217;intervention 22 personnes et une enfant en bas &#226;ge &#233;taient pr&#233;sents sur les lieux, mais 
n&#8217;indiquent pas combien de personnes au total logeaient dans cet immeuble. Les sources non-
gouvernementales indiquent que le nombre de personnes qui r&#233;sidaient dans ce b&#226;timent &#233;tait de 
75 dont 9 enfants, ainsi que 6 personnes qui s&#8217;&#233;taient retrouv&#233;es &#224; la rue suite &#224; l&#8217;&#233;vacuation du 
squat de la Tour. Sur ce sujet, le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial a demand&#233; des indications pr&#233;cises quant 
aux personnes affect&#233;es par les expulsions mentionn&#233;es dans ma lettre du 24 ao&#251;t et leur &#233;tat 
actuel de relogement. Les op&#233;rations polici&#232;res d&#8217;expulsion ont &#233;galement fait l&#8217;objet de 
l&#8217;attention du Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial. Les informations re&#231;ues all&#232;guent un recours excessif &#224; la 
force durant les diverses op&#233;rations polici&#232;res d&#8217;expulsion. Dans le cas de l&#8217;op&#233;ration 
d&#8217;&#233;vacuation du squat dit du Rhino, peu avant que les habitants du 12 Boulevard des Philosophes 
aient &#233;t&#233; emmen&#233;s, plusieurs personnes et t&#233;moins des &#233;v&#232;nements aux abords du premier 
immeuble &#233;vacu&#233; auraient &#233;t&#233; molest&#233;s par la police. Parmi elles, une conseill&#232;re administrative 
d&#8217;une commune genevoise qui a depuis lors &#233;t&#233; en contact avec la police et son commandant 
pour un suivi de ces faits. Les autorit&#233;s lui auraient affirm&#233; ouvrir une enqu&#234;te sur les faits. Les 
observateurs, ainsi que certains repr&#233;sentants de l&#8217;autorit&#233;,  indiqueraient que le moment de 
l&#8217;&#233;vacuation - par temps de forte pluie - aurait &#233;t&#233; &#233;galement choisi de mani&#232;re d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;e. A cet 
&#233;gard, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a exprim&#233; son souhait de recevoir des indications sur les raisons du 
maintien de l&#8217;op&#233;ration d&#8217;expulsion dans ces conditions. Le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial a en outre 
demand&#233; des informations compl&#233;mentaires sur la s&#233;curit&#233; d&#8217;occupation des personnes 
concern&#233;es par cette affaire. Dans sa r&#233;ponse &#224; une interpellation urgente (IUE 451-A), le 
Conseil d&#8217;Etat pr&#233;cise que la tol&#233;rance des autorit&#233;s &#224; l&#8217;&#233;gard d&#8217;occupation illicites de logements 
repose sur la &#171; n&#233;cessit&#233; de pr&#233;server la paix sociale en tenant compte du manque de logements 
r&#233;pondant aux besoins pr&#233;pond&#233;rants de la population, qui repr&#233;sente un int&#233;r&#234;t public sup&#233;rieur 
&#224; l&#8217;int&#233;r&#234;t priv&#233; du propri&#233;taire d&#8217;obtenir l&#8217;&#233;vacuation imm&#233;diate de son immeuble &#187;. Comme </p>

<p>mentionn&#233; dans la communication pr&#233;c&#233;dente, et comme reconnu &#224; plusieurs reprises par les 
autorit&#233;s dans leur r&#233;ponse, Gen&#232;ve semble subir actuellement une crise au moins aussi grave 
que dans les ann&#233;es 80, lorsque les autorit&#233;s ont &#171; d&#233;cid&#233; de tol&#233;rer une atteinte temporaire aux 
droits des propri&#233;taires de logements que ceux-ci refusaient de mettre sur le march&#233;, les laissant 
d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;ment vides dans un contexte de p&#233;nurie aigue&#187; (lettre du conseil d&#8217;Etat). Les 
informations re&#231;ues indiquent que le squat dit du &#171; Rhino &#187; &#233;tait list&#233; comme h&#233;bergement 
d&#8217;urgence dans une brochure officielle et que le centre d&#8217;action sociale et de sant&#233; logeait des 
personnes dans ce lieu. Cette reconnaissance officielle se serait traduite dans d&#8217;autres brochures 
officielles et &#224; d&#8217;autres occasions officielles. Les informations indiquent &#233;galement que les 
r&#233;sidents auraient fait des propositions de rachat de l&#8217;immeuble, ce qui aurait pu constituer une 
alternative &#224; une expulsion. De plus, il a &#233;t&#233; rapport&#233; que l&#8217;immeuble &#233;vacu&#233; va &#234;tre reconverti 
en logement &#224; loyer mod&#233;r&#233; pour une p&#233;riode limit&#233;e &#224; cinq ans. Il a &#233;t&#233; n&#233;anmoins pr&#233;cis&#233; que 
le propri&#233;taire n&#8217;a pas d&#8217;obligation de mettre ces logements &#224; disposition de familles &#224; revenus 
modestes. Ceux-ci pourraient les mettre &#224; disposition de leur famille ou ami et, une fois la 
p&#233;riode de cinq ans &#233;chue, les mettre sur le march&#233; libre de la location avec de tr&#232;s fortes 
augmentations de loyers. Dans ce contexte, le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial a requis des informations 
suppl&#233;mentaires quant aux points suivants : a) les raisons du changement de la tol&#233;rance des 
autorit&#233;s dans une situation de crise similaire aux ann&#233;es 80 ; b) quelles mesures ont &#233;t&#233; 
entreprises pour contrer la sp&#233;culation et le fait de laisser des logements vacants dans un contexte 
de p&#233;nurie; et c) si les logements &#233;vacu&#233;s ces derni&#232;res ann&#233;es ont &#233;t&#233; reconvertis en des 
logements abordables pour la population. Sur ce dernier point, je me r&#233;f&#232;re aux informations qui 
sont contenues dans ma lettre dat&#233;e du 24 ao&#251;t 2007 et qui me sont parvenues depuis lors 
concernant les b&#226;timents &#233;vacu&#233;s et qui demeurent vides apr&#232;s de nombreuses ann&#233;es malgr&#233; la 
crise du logement actuelle. Dans ce contexte, le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial a demand&#233; des informations 
suppl&#233;mentaires quant aux points suivants : a) les raisons du changement de la tol&#233;rance des 
autorit&#233;s dans une situation de crise similaire aux ann&#233;es 80 ; b) quelles mesures ont &#233;t&#233; 
entreprises pour contrer la sp&#233;culation et le fait de laisser des logements vacants dans un contexte

logements abordables pour la population. Sur ce dernier point, le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial s&#8217;est r&#233;f&#233;r&#233; 
aux informations qui sont contenues dans sa lettre dat&#233;e du 24 ao&#251;t 2007 et qui lui parvenues 
depuis lors concernant les b&#226;timents &#233;vacu&#233;es et qui demeurent vides apr&#232;s de nombreuses 
ann&#233;es malgr&#233; la crise du logement actuelle. Enfin, le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial a mentionn&#233; le statut 
l&#233;gal du droit au logement, et s&#8217;est r&#233;f&#233;r&#233; &#224; diff&#233;rents instruments &#224; cet &#233;gard. Selon les 
informations re&#231;ues, l&#8217;article 35 de la loi sur le tribunal f&#233;d&#233;ral indique que le selon le droit 
suisse, le recours peut &#234;tre form&#233; pour violation du droit international. N&#233;anmoins, il semble que 
les tribunaux se refusent &#224; prendre en compte le droit au logement tel qu&#8217;annonc&#233; &#224; l&#8217;article 10a 
de la Constitution Genevoise<b>2 </b>ainsi qu&#8217;&#224; tenir compte du droit international et des instruments 
                                                 
</p>
<p>2
<b>  </b>L&#8217;Article se lit comme suit :

</p>
<p>1. Le droit au logement est garanti.

<p>2. L'Etat et les communes encouragent par des mesures appropri&#233;es la r&#233;alisation de

<p>internationaux auxquels la Suisse est partie. A titre d&#8217;exemple, il est rapport&#233; que dans une 
d&#233;cision relative au squat Rhino, le tribunal administratif a clairement rejet&#233; l&#8217;applicabilit&#233; du 
droit au logement tel qu&#8217;&#233;nonc&#233; dans la Constitution genevoise et &#224; l&#8217;article 11.1 du Pacte 
international relatif aux droits &#233;conomiques, sociaux et culturels. Le tribunal aurait ainsi &#233;nonc&#233; 
que ces articles  seraient &#171; des normes pragmatiques &#187; qui ne conf&#232;rent aucun droit direct aux 
requ&#233;rants. Dans ce contexte, le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial a demand&#233; quel statut occupe le droit au 
logement dans la l&#233;gislation suisse et comment il peut &#234;tre invoqu&#233; par les individus devant les 
tribunaux pour faire valoir leurs droits humains. Le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial a demand&#233; des pr&#233;cisions 
concernant les diff&#233;rentes questions &#233;voqu&#233;es, et a ajout&#233; qu&#8217;il serait pr&#233;sent &#224; Gen&#232;ve &#224; la 
session de mars 2008 du Conseil des droits de l&#8217;homme, souhaitant profiter de cette occasion 
pour s&#8217;entretenir des diff&#233;rents &#233;l&#233;ments du dossier avec les autorit&#233;s genevoise comp&#233;tentes, en 
particulier le Procureur g&#233;n&#233;ral et le Conseil d&#8217;Etat.

<p><b>Communication re&#231;ue 
</b></p>
<p>83. Le 5 mars 2008, le Gouvernement Suisse a envoy&#233; une r&#233;ponse &#224; la communication dat&#233;e 
du 28 D&#233;cembre 2007, dans laquelle figure les informations suivantes, dont l&#8217;ordre suit celui des 
points soulev&#233;s par le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial dans sa lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation: 
</p>
<p>&#171; - Notification et avis d&#8217;expulsion : La proc&#233;dure judiciaire initi&#233;e par les occupants illicites de 
Rhino devant le Tribunal des baux et loyers n&#8217;avait pas d&#8217;incidence sur la proc&#233;dure 
d&#8217;&#233;vacuation. Au demeurant, dans sa d&#233;cision du 3 d&#233;cembre 2007, cette juridiction a consid&#233;r&#233; 
que l&#8217;action en justice des squatters tendant &#224; faire constater qu&#8217;ils &#233;taient au b&#233;n&#233;fice d&#8217;un bail 
rev&#234;tait un caract&#232;re purement dilatoire, raison pour laquelle elle les a non seulement d&#233;bout&#233;s, 
     
</p>
<p>3. A cette fin, dans les limites du droit f&#233;d&#233;ral, ils m&#232;nent une politique sociale du 
logement, notamment par :  
</p>
<p>a) la lutte contre la sp&#233;culation fonci&#232;re;  
</p>

<p>mais encore condamn&#233;s &#224; une amende pour abus de proc&#233;dure. Pour sa part, la Commission 
cantonale de recours en mati&#232;re de construction a d&#233;clar&#233; irrecevable le recours d&#233;pose par les 
squatters contre la d&#233;cision administrative, rev&#234;tue de la force ex&#233;cutoire, ordonnant la 
r&#233;alisation des travaux de r&#233;habilitation des immeubles en cause afin de rem&#233;dier &#224; l&#8217;&#233;tat de 
d&#233;gradation desdits immeubles et de permettre la mise sur le march&#233; locatif de logements 
r&#233;pondant aux besoins pr&#233;pond&#233;rants de la population au sens de la loi sur les d&#233;molitions, 
transformations et r&#233;novations de maisons d&#8217;habitation, du 25 janvier 1996 (LDTR). Enfin, les 
occupants illicites ont &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; interpell&#233;s sur ordre du Procureur g&#233;n&#233;ral, au motif que leur 
comportement &#233;tait constitutif de violation de domicile. Sur les 22 personnes interpell&#233;es lors de 
l&#8217;&#233;vacuation, seules 5 &#233;taient d&#233;clar&#233;es comme r&#233;sidentes du squat Rhino, les 17 autres &#233;tant des 
&#233;trangers de passage (9) ou des personnes ayant une autre adresse, &#224; Gen&#232;ve ou ailleurs (8). 
Apr&#232;s l&#8217;avis donn&#233; le 19 octobre 2005, la brigade des squats de la police cantonale a tenu 
inform&#233;e les occupants illicites de Rhino de l0&#233;volution de la situation ; les squatters &#233;taient au 
courant de l&#8217;imminence de leur &#233;vacuation, &#224; laquelle ils d&#233;claraient vouloir s&#8217;opposer en 
utilisant &#171; tous les moyens possibles &#187;, dans un communiqu&#233; publi&#233; le 5 juillet 2007. Par ailleurs, 
par avis du 29 juin 2007, il a &#233;t&#233; rappel&#233; aux occupants illicites que les b&#226;timents avaient fait 
l&#8217;objet d&#8217;une autorisation de construire en force No. DD 98&#8217;008-5, portant sur la r&#233;habilitation 
compl&#233;t&#233;e desdits b&#226;timents en vue de la mise sur le march&#233; de logements r&#233;pondant aux besoins 
pr&#233;pond&#233;rants de la population. Il a &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;cis&#233; que la r&#233;alisation des travaux autoris&#233;s 
&#233;tait indispensable pour assurer la p&#233;rennit&#233; des immeubles et que pour d&#8217;&#233;vidents motifs de 
s&#233;curit&#233;, cette r&#233;alisation impliquait que les b&#226;timents soient libres de tout occupant pendant 
toute la phase des travaux. L&#8217;&#233;vacuation ne requ&#233;rait pas la pr&#233;sence de repr&#233;sentants de 
l&#8217;autorit&#233; autres que les forces de police engag&#233;es. Ces derni&#232;res ont agi en toute transparence, 
puisqu&#8217;elles ont-elles-m&#234;mes inform&#233; l&#8217;ensemble des m&#233;dia de cette op&#233;ration d&#232;s son 
commencement. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Bilan des personnes expuls&#233;es : Pour &#233;viter une destruction par le propri&#233;taire de 
l&#8217;immeuble, l&#8217;Etat a pris &#224; sa charge, d&#232;s le 1er septembre 2007, le co&#251;t du stockage 
(quelque 600m2) et de la manutention des meubles des occupants de l&#8217;ancien squat 
Rhino entrepos&#233;s dans les locaux d&#8217;une entreprise priv&#233;e depuis l&#8217;&#233;vacuation dudit 
squat. A la fin f&#233;vrier 2008, l&#8217;Etat a d&#233;j&#224; pay&#233; pr&#232;s de Frs 60&#8217;000,- &#224; l&#8217;entreprise 
consid&#233;r&#233;e, les surfaces disponibles au garde-meuble de l&#8217;Etat ne permettant pas d&#8217;y 
stocker les meubles &#233;vacu&#233;s. Malgr&#233; un premier d&#233;lai fix&#233; aux anciens occupants du 
squat &#224; fin novembre et signifi&#233; &#224; leur conseil, seul un nombre insignifiant d&#8217;objets ont 
&#233;t&#233; repris par leurs propri&#233;taires. L&#8217;essentiel du volume occup&#233; dans les locaux de 
l&#8217;entreprise l&#8217;est par du gros mobilier (biblioth&#232;ques, cuisini&#232;res, frigos, lits, v&#233;los, 
etc&#8230;). La plupart des objets sont dans un &#233;tat d&#233;plorable et sont probablement 
invendables. Apr&#232;s une prolongation du d&#233;lai de retrait au 15 novembre 2007, le 
d&#233;partement cantonal des institutions a inform&#233; le conseil pr&#233;cit&#233;, par courrier du 11 
d&#233;cembre 2007, que des sommations allaient &#234;tre publi&#233;es dans la Feuille d&#8217;avis 
officielle (FAO) &#224; l&#8217;intention des occupants de l&#8217;ancien squat qui n&#8217;&#233;taient pas venus 
prendre possession de leurs objets mobiliers et qu&#8217;une demande d&#8217;autorisation de vente 
aux ench&#232;res suivrait. Les sommations d&#8217;usage ont &#233;t&#233; faites aux propri&#233;taires des 
meubles dans les &#233;ditions de la FAO des 7, 9, et 11 janvier 2008. Le d&#233;lai de retrait 
avait &#233;t&#233; fix&#233; au 25 janvier 2008. Par courrier du 28 janvier 2008, le d&#233;partement des 
institutions a demand&#233; au Tribunal de premi&#232;re instance l&#8217;autorisation de vente aux 
ench&#232;res du mat&#233;riel non repris, selon la proc&#233;dure habituelle apr&#232;s des &#233;vacuations </p>

<p>d&#8217;immeubles. Le Tribunal de premi&#232;re instance a autoris&#233; la vente aux ench&#232;res par 
ordonnance du 31 janvier 2008. S&#8217;agissant des biens des personnes &#233;vacu&#233;es du squat 
de la Tour, nous ne disposons pas d&#8217;autres informations que celles donn&#233;es dans notre 
pr&#233;c&#233;dent courrier. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Relogement des personnes expuls&#233;es : selon une liste &#233;tablie par Rhino en avril 2006, ce 
squat comptait 48 r&#233;sidents. Parmi ces derniers, seuls 18 &#233;taient annonc&#233;s comme tels &#224; 
l&#8217;Office cantonal de la population. La police a par ailleurs constat&#233; que durant l&#8217;ann&#233;e 
pr&#233;c&#233;dant l&#8217;&#233;vacuation, le nombre des occupants illicites de Rhino avait plut&#244;t eu 
tendance &#224; diminuer, ce que semble confirmer le faible nombre de personnes trouv&#233;es 
sur place le 23 juillet 2007. S&#8217;agissant du relogement des squatters &#233;vacu&#233;s, nous ne 
disposons pas d&#8217;autres informations que celles donn&#233;es dans notre pr&#233;c&#233;dent courrier.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Op&#233;ration polici&#232;re d&#8217;expulsion : en date du 10 octobre 2007, notre conseil a r&#233;pondu &#224; 
une interpellation parlementaire portant sur le comportement de la police lors des 
&#233;vacuations de l&#8217;&#233;t&#233; dernier (IUE 466-A). Nous vous transmettons en annexe une copie 
de cette r&#233;ponse, dont il r&#233;sulte que les policiers engag&#233;s dans ces op&#233;rations ont agi de 
mani&#232;re proportionn&#233;e et ont dans l&#8217;ensemble, remarquablement rempli leur mission. 
Lors du d&#233;clenchement de l&#8217;&#233;vacuation, le 23 juillet 2007 &#224; 14h00, le temps &#233;tait 
couvert mais sec. La police n&#8217;a donc en aucune mani&#232;re choisi d&#8217;effectuer sa mission 
par mauvais temps et le fait que les conditions se soient d&#233;grad&#233;es plus tard dans la 
journ&#233;e ne justifiait aucunement l&#8217;interruption de cette op&#233;ration.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; S&#233;curit&#233; d&#8217;occupation : Les principes, expos&#233;s dans notre pr&#233;c&#233;dente r&#233;ponse, a la base 
de la politique des autorit&#233;s cantonales en mati&#232;re d&#8217;&#233;vacuation d&#8217;immeubles occup&#233;s 
illicitement restent valables, quand bien m&#234;me on ne constate pas, malgr&#233; la p&#233;nurie, de 
comportement sp&#233;culatifs comparables &#224; ceux que Gen&#232;ve avait connus lors de la crise 
de la fin de ann&#233;es 80, les instituts de cr&#233;dit se montrant beaucoup plus circonspects 
dans l&#8217;octroi des pr&#234;ts hypoth&#233;caires. Le nombre d&#8217;immeubles occup&#233;s est d&#8217;ailleurs 
pass&#233; de 151 (dont 20 sous &#171; contrat de confiance &#187;) en 1999 &#224; 29 (dont 11 sous 
&#171; contrat de confiance &#187;) en 2008. Il va de soi cependant que ces principes ne trouvent 
pas application lorsque l&#8217;occupation illicite n&#8217;intervient qu&#8217;&#224; des fins politiques ou dans 
le seul but de troubler l&#8217;ordre public, comme cela a &#233;t&#233; le cas &#224; r&#233;it&#233;r&#233;es reprises dans le 
prolongement des &#233;vacuations op&#233;r&#233;es en &#233;t&#233; 2007. L&#8217;autorisation de construire en 
cours d&#8217;ex&#233;cution porte sur la r&#233;novation de 16 logements existants totalisant 106  
pi&#232;ces et l&#8217;am&#233;nagement dans les combles de 3 logements suppl&#233;mentaires. Les loyers 
apr&#232;s travaux ont effectivement &#233;t&#233; fix&#233;s par l&#8217;autorit&#233; comp&#233;tente pour une p&#233;riode de 
5 ans &#224; dater de la remise en location, &#224; un prix &#224; la pi&#232;ce par de CHF 3'225 s&#8217;agissant 
des logements existants et de CHF 6'000 pour les logements cr&#233;&#233;s dans les combles, et 
de conform&#233;ment aux dispositions de la LDTR. C&#8217;est par ailleurs le lieu de pr&#233;ciser que 
les conditions financi&#232;res de cette autorisation de construire ont &#233;t&#233; confirm&#233;es par les 
autorit&#233;s judiciaires cantonales. A l&#8217;issue de la p&#233;riode de contr&#244;le, le loyer de ces 
logements sera r&#233;gi exclusivement par le droit priv&#233; f&#233;d&#233;ral en mati&#232;re de bail. Enfin, la 
LDTR a pr&#233;cis&#233;ment pour but de lutter contre la p&#233;nurie et de garantir le maintien d&#8217;un 
habitat correspondant aux besoins pr&#233;pond&#233;rants de la population. Pour le surplus, il 
n&#8217;existe dans le canton de Gen&#232;ve aucun immeuble d&#8217;habitation vacant, sous r&#233;serve 
des b&#226;timents faisant l&#8217;objet de travaux.  </p>

</p>
<p>&#8226; Statut l&#233;gal du droit au logement : Il est exact que dans un arr&#234;t rendu en 2006 
(ATA/ 21/2006) le Tribunal administratif genevois a jug&#233; que les articles 10 A Cst. Gen. 
Et 11 du Pacte international relatif aux droits &#233;conomiques, sociaux et culturels 
rev&#234;taient le caract&#232;re de normes programmatiques, ne donnant aucun droit direct &#224; 
ceux qui s&#8217;en r&#233;clament. La l&#233;gislation cantonale est toutefois riche en dispositions 
diverses permettant le relogement, encourageant la construction de logements d&#8217;utilit&#233; 
publique, prot&#233;geant les locataires et pr&#233;servant l&#8217;habitat. &#187; 
</p>
<p>84. Dans le m&#234;me courrier, le gouvernement Suisse a donn&#233; des indications sp&#233;cifiques sur le 
statut du droit au logement en Suisse : &#171; - Au niveau international : La Suisse a adh&#233;r&#233; au Pacte 
International relatif aux droits &#233;conomiques, sociaux et culturels (ci-apr&#232;s le Pacte I) le 18 juin 
1992 et s&#8217;emploie, en sa qualit&#233; d&#8217;Etat partie, &#224; mettre en &#339;uvre les droits qui y sont &#233;nonc&#233;s. 
Lors de l&#8217;examen du rapport initial pr&#233;sent&#233; par la Suisse, le Comit&#233; des droits &#233;conomiques, 
sociaux et culturel a d&#8217;ailleurs constat&#233; qu&#8217;il n&#8217;y avait pas en suisse de difficult&#233; ou de facteurs 
essentiels faisant obstacle &#224; l&#8217;application effective du Pacte I (point 8). Le gouvernement suisse 
ainsi que le Tribunal f&#233;d&#233;ral admettent que les droits garantis par le Pacte I aux articles 6 &#224; 15 
sont en principe, de caract&#232;re programmatoire. Les dispositions qui les consacrent ne sont en 
cons&#233;quence pas directement applicables. Le Tribunal f&#233;d&#233;ral n&#8217;exclut toutefois pas que 
certaines dispositions du Pacte I puissent &#234;tre directement applicable. Tel pourrait notamment 
&#234;tre le cas de l&#8217;art. 8, al. 1, let. A concernant certains aspects de la libert&#233; de la libert&#233; syndicale.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Au niveau national : s&#8217;agissant de la Constitution f&#233;d&#233;rale (Cst.), elle ne pr&#233;voit pas, &#224; 
proprement parler, de droit au logement. Dans son &#233;nonc&#233; des buts sociaux, elle stipule 
toutefois que la Conf&#233;d&#233;ration et les cantons s&#8217;engagent, en compl&#233;ment de la 
responsabilit&#233; individuelle et de l&#8217;initiative priv&#233;e, &#224; ce que toute personne en qu&#234;te 
d&#8217;un logement puisse trouver, pour elle-m&#234;me et sa famille, un logement appropri&#233; &#224; 
des conditions supportables (art. 41, al. 1, let e.). L&#8217;art. 41, qui formule un but social, 
constitue donc une disposition constitutionnelle dont aucune pr&#233;tention directe &#224; des 
prestations de l&#8217;Etat ne peut &#234;tre r&#233;duite. La Constitution confie en outre des attributions 
&#224; la Conf&#233;d&#233;ration en mati&#232;re d&#8217;encouragement de la construction de logements et 
d&#8217;accession &#224; la propri&#233;t&#233; (art. 108) ainsi que de bail &#224; loyer (art. 109). Conform&#233;ment 
aux art. 41, 108, 109 Cst., la Conf&#233;d&#233;ration s&#8217;engage, dans le cadre de la politique du 
logement, &#224; ce que tous les groupes de population puissent trouver des logements 
appropri&#233;s &#224; des conditions supportables. L&#8217;Office f&#233;d&#233;ral du logement (OFL) est 
l&#8217;autorit&#233; responsable de l&#8217;application de la politique du logement de la Conf&#233;d&#233;ration. 
Il est charg&#233; de l&#8217;application des lois (&#233;nonc&#233;es ci-dessous) adopt&#233;es par le Parlement 
pour permettre &#224; la Conf&#233;d&#233;ration d&#8217;assumer les t&#226;ches en mati&#232;re de politique du 
logement mentionn&#233;es dans la constitution :

</p>
<p>85. Depuis 1975, la Conf&#233;d&#233;ration a encourag&#233; la construction et l&#8217;accession &#224; la propri&#233;t&#233; de 
logements dans le cadre de la loi f&#233;d&#233;rale encourageant la construction et l&#8217;accession &#224; la 
propri&#233;t&#233; de logements (LCAP). En d&#233;cembre 2001, les derni&#232;res demandes d&#8217;aide f&#233;d&#233;rale en 
vertu de la LCAP ont &#233;t&#233; approuv&#233;es. Les aides accord&#233;es dans le cadre de la LCAP se 
poursuivront encore pendant 25 &#224; 30 ans et la LCAP restera leur base l&#233;gale. Le 21 mars 2003, le 
Parlement a adopt&#233; la nouvelle loi f&#233;d&#233;rale encourageant le logement &#224; loyer ou &#224; prix mod&#233;r&#233;s 
(loi f&#233;d&#233;rale sur le logement ; LOG). Des aides directes et indirectes sont pr&#233;vues pour 
l&#8217;encouragement, mais les pr&#234;ts directs de la Conf&#233;d&#233;ration sont suspendus jusqu&#8217;&#224; fin 2008 en 
fonction des d&#233;cisions prises dans le cadre du programme d&#8217;all&#232;gement budg&#233;taire 2003. 
L&#8217;encouragement est donc temporairement limit&#233; aux aides indirectes. La conf&#233;d&#233;ration et les 
cantons, et parfois des communes et des tiers, versent des aides financi&#232;res sur la base de la loi 
f&#233;d&#233;rale du 20 mars 1970 concernant l&#8217;am&#233;lioration du logement dans les r&#233;gions de montagne 
(LALM). Les aides financi&#232;res accord&#233;es sur la base de la LALM ont &#233;t&#233; allou&#233;es jusqu&#8217;&#224; 
l&#8217;entr&#233;e en vigueur de la r&#233;forme de la p&#233;r&#233;quation financi&#232;re et de la r&#233;partition des t&#226;ches entre 
la Conf&#233;d&#233;ration et les cantons (RPT). Depuis d&#233;but 2008, ce domaine est du ressort exclusif des 
cantons. Aucune nouvelle subvention n&#8217;est donc vers&#233;e par la Conf&#233;d&#233;ration et seules les 
subventions en cours sont encore administr&#233;es pendant une p&#233;riode de 20 ans au maximum. La 
loi f&#233;d&#233;rale sur l&#8217;agriculture (LAgr) de 1998 donne &#224; la conf&#233;d&#233;ration la possibilit&#233; d&#8217;accorder 
des pr&#234;ts sans int&#233;r&#234;ts aux agriculteurs &#224; titre principal pour la construction ou la transformation 
de leurs maisons d&#8217;habitation. En moyenne, les pr&#234;ts sont rembours&#233;s dans un d&#233;lai de 16 and, 
durant les 10 derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, en moyenne CHF 38,7 millions ont &#233;t&#233; pr&#234;t&#233;s chaque ann&#233;e au 
titre de cette loi et ont permis la construction ou la transformation de 400 maisons d&#8217;habitation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Au niveau cantonal : La plupart des constitutions cantonales contiennent, &#224; l&#8217;image de la 
Constitution f&#233;d&#233;rale, un certain nombre de droits &#233;conomiques, sociaux et culturels, 
ainsi que des buts sociaux. Certaines pr&#233;voient les m&#234;mes garanties que la constitution 
f&#233;d&#233;rale. D&#8217;autres sont plus loin, en garantissant des droits suppl&#233;mentaires ou en 
&#233;tendant le champ d&#8217;application de droits figurant dans la Constitution f&#233;d&#233;rale. En ce 
qui concerne plus sp&#233;cifiquement le statut du droit au logement dans le canton de 
Gen&#232;ve, je me permets de vous renvoyer &#224; la r&#233;ponse des autorit&#233;s de la r&#233;publique et 
canton de Gen&#232;ve qui traite de cette question dans le dernier point de leur rapport. &#187;

<p>86. On 29 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government of 
Turkey regarding the Romani community of the Sulukule neighborhood which allegedly faced 
the threat of being forcibly evicted due to the Municipality&#8217;s urban rehabilitation project. The

response to his communication dated 31 July 2006, related to the situation of the Romani

project entered its last phase at the end of 2007. The protocol on the restoration of the Neslisah

Which are Eroded&#8221; No. 5366 which entered into force in 2005. Article 24 of the regulation 
introduced for the implementation of Law No. 5366 states that if mutual consent for the 
evacuation, demolition and nationalization of the buildings located within the renovation zone is 
not reached, real estate owned by an individual or legal entity can be nationalized by the decision 
of the authorized administration. Furthermore, the reports state that article 27 of the 
Nationalization Law No. 2942, provides that in the event of any delay in the renovation project 
due to the normal nationalization procedures, a speedy nationalization procedure may begin. 
Moreover, it is alleged that the Council of Ministers can issue a nationalization decision for 
&#8220;national defense purpose&#8221; and &#8220;in case of emergency&#8221;. Reportedly, on 13 December 2006, the 
Council of Ministers authorized the Fatih Municipality to proceed with the &#8220;immediate 
expropriation&#8221; of certain parts in Sulukule. This decision was allegedly taken even before the 
start of the regular nationalization procedures. Moreover, it is reported that neither the &#8220;national 
defense purpose&#8221; nor &#8220;emergency case&#8221; argument are applicable in this situation. Reportedly, a 
number of houses - among which several were officially registered as examples of cultural 
heritage - was already destroyed by the Municipality of Fatih since February 2007. For instance, 
while a prior notice for evacuation indicated the date of 31 March 2008, it is reported that on 
13 March 2008, seven houses belonging to Romani families were demolished by the 
Municipality of Fatih. Two of these houses were allegedly still inhabited by the families and as a 
consequence of their destruction, three Romani families comprising approximately 15 people 
and seven children were made homeless. Additionally, it is alleged that the concerned persons 
were not allowed to collect most of their belongings before municipal officials proceeded to 
destroy their houses. Reportedly, none of these families received any form of compensation or 
were appropriately relocated. In the first part of the Government of Turkey&#8217;s response to the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous communication, it was stated that the district of Fatih was located 
in an earthquake zone which was one of the reasons for the implementation of the renewal 
project. The Special Rapporteur subsequently received information which states that on 
18 December 2007, the Istanbul Chamber of Geology Engineers office delivered a report about 
the geological situation of Sulukule. Reportedly, the document states that the area of Sulukule is 
not particularly at a higher risk of earthquakes and that there is no need for specific prevention 
policies in this respect. Recent information also indicated that during the month of 
February 2008, Fatih Municipality sent notices to house owners in Sulukule, requesting them to 
evacuate the houses until the end of March 2008. It is alleged that the eviction notices did not 
make any reference to tenant&#8217;s rights and eventual ways to oppose the eviction. Additionally, it 
is reported that house owners were asked by the Municipality to evict the tenants from their 
houses otherwise they would lose their right to benefit from an apartment in the project. It is 
alleged that this situation has created tensions between owners and tenants in Sulukule. 
Moreover, some house owners have reportedly cut electricity and water to their tenant&#8217;s 
apartments in order to force them to move out. According to the latest reports, on 7 March 2008, 
the Municipality officials started placing &#8220;X&#8221; and &#8220;Y&#8221; signs meaning &#8220;to be demolished&#8221;, on 
houses which were still inhabited. Access to information, participation and consultation 
processes were also examined by the Special Rapporteur who requested further information. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 70 
 
</p>
<p>Reports received subsequently to the response from the Government of Turkey to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s previous communication indicate that the project has continued to be developed 
without consultation and agreement of the affected population. The social and economic needs of 
the people living in the Sulukule neighborhood were not taken into consideration during the 
consultative meetings held between June and July 2006. It is alleged that the renewal project 
does not consider the economic situation of the Roma communities and that, contrary to the 
authorities&#8217; statement, no meaningful consultations with the local communities were carried out. 
It is also alleged that, the communities have not received substantive information about the 
renewal plans and neither written nor verbal explanation was given to the inhabitants about the 
project. Furthermore, it is reported that the metropolitan Municipality, the Municipality of Fatih 
and the Housing Development Administration did not keep the promises they made to the 
tenants during the public meetings in July 2006. The Special Rapporteur also mentioned housing 
affordability. Reports indicated that the &#8220;housing project for right holders and tenants living in 
Neslisah and Hatice Sultan neighourhoods&#8221; was not adapted for the situation of the Romani 
community. Although the prices of the new houses and the payment conditions would be 
advantageous compared to the market situation, it seemed that they are still unaffordable for 
most of the original inhabitants, thus forcing them out of the area. According to recent 
information, 400 of the 620 houses in the project were sold to people who are not originally from 
Sulukule district. The remaining 220 homes would be under the threat of expropriation. It was 
alleged that the Municipality of Fatih puts pressure on people to sell their houses, and that those 
who do not do so, might be expropriated according to Nationalization Law No. 2942 and Law 
No. 5366. The Special Rapporteur received further information according to which the Housing 
Development Administration constructed public housing in Tasoluk for the tenants and owners 
of Sulukule in a location situated at 40 kilometers of Sulukule. According to the information 
received, in this project, tenants may become owners of their houses after a period of 15 years. A 
census was conducted in order to identify families who could benefit from this project, but 
reportedly, some 300 extremely poor families that are living without paying a rent and who 
receive the support from the neighborhood and the community, were left out. Thereby, it is 
alleged that those families would not have been counted by the Municipality as right holders for 
the newly constructed public housing. Additionally, it is reported that on 4 December 2007, Fatih 
Municipality organized a lottery in order to attribute some of the apartments which were built in 
Tasoluk. Some 200 tenants from Sulukule were reportedly attributed an apartment during this 
first lottery. It is further alleged that during the month of February 2008, those selected in the 
lottery were called to sign the contracts. Yet, the banks requested a stamp tax of 800 to 
1,300 YTL, and because of financially inability of the tenants to pay the amount, no contracts 
could be finalized. Other lotteries had been planned but have reportedly not taken place at the 
time of this communication. According to the allegations received, the Special Rapporteur 
warned that it is likely that the Roma people will suffer from deterioration of their living 
conditions, their financial resources, and their access to adequate housing. Moreover, by their 
relocation and separation into remote apartment blocks, their traditional way of life could be 
affected and the Romani cultural identity of the Sulukule neighborhood could disappear, if the 
project is fully implemented. This situation would reportedly result in a historical and cultural 
loss for the entire Romani community given the fact that the area of Sulukule is considered as 
one of the oldest Roma community in the world. The Special Rapporteur emphasized two 
principles of particular importance for the situation that is reported above. The first one is the 
principle of access to information of affected people which implies that individuals and 
communities have access to appropriate data, documents and intellectual resources that impact </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 71 
 
</p>
<p>upon their right to obtain adequate housing. The second crucial principle is the effective 
participation which means that, at all levels of the decision-making process in respect of the right 
to adequate housing, individuals and communities must be able to express and share their views, 
they must be consulted and be able to contribute substantively to such processes that affect 
housing, including, inter alia, location, spatial dimensions, links to community, social capital and 
livelihood, housing configuration and other practical features. The state must ensure that 
building and housing laws and policies to not preclude free expression, including cultural and 
religious diversity. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the 
Special Rapporteur requested further information on the &#8220;physical and social needs assessment 
analysis&#8221; as well as their conclusions; on the criteria used by the Council of Ministers and the 
basis of the decision taken on the 13 December 2007 which authorized the Fatih Municipality to 
proceed with the &#8220;immediate expropriation&#8221; of certain parts in Sulukule; on how international 
obligations, in particular on the right to adequate housing, have been considered throughout the 
legislation and decision process mentioned in this letter; on debates and conclusions of the 
consultative meetings held from June to July 2006 and also when and how the affected people 
were informed of the project, received the eviction notification and what was included in this 
notification; information about the alternative housing projects which, according to your letter, 
had to begin in October 2005 and whether the particular characteristics of the Roma 
communities were taken into account; regarding the case of the renewal project in Sulukule, 
information on how the specific economic, social and cultural situation of the Romani 
community is addressed by your Government; if the authorities have been informed of the 
reported dated 18 December 2007 of the Istanbul Chamber of Geology Engineers office; 
information on how did the census of the number of affected person by the project take place and 
if  the census has taken into account all the inhabitants of Sulukule, including the poor families 
mentioned above; concerning the lotteries for the attribution of the apartments in Tasoluk, how 
are they carried out and what is the scheduling for the next attributions, if the number of 
construction is inferior to the number of people relocated, what has been foreseen for these 
people so that they do not fall into homelessness, furthermore, if any priority in these attributions 
have been given to people with particular need (such as single women with children, people with 
health problems and /or disabilities); concerning the public housing in Tasoluk, what 
arrangements are foreseen for people who cannot afford to pay the tax stamp or other related 
costs requested by the banks for the conclusion of the contract; information on has been foreseen 
for people who cannot financially afford the new houses either in Sulukule or in Tasoluk; and 
what is done to preserve the Romani historical and cultural heritage, more specifically, if the 
aspect of cultural adequacy is part of the renewal project in Sulukule and in the public housing in 
Tasoluk. 
</p>
<p><b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>87. On the 23 June 2008, the Government of Turkey sent a letter to the Special Rapporteur, in 
response to the allegation letter dated 29 April 2008. The Government enclosed an Information 
Note containing the following elements: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;I.  General Framework on non-discrimination: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The main philosophy of Turkey&#8217;s human rights policy can be summarized as 
&#8220;Human rights for all with no discrimination.&#8221; </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 72 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Republic of Turkey adheres with great dedication to the legacy of tolerance. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The constitutional system of Turkey is based on the equality of all individuals 
without discrimination before the law. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Turkish nation is not a juxtaposition of communities or groups. It is composed of 
citizens, who are equal before the law irrespective of their origins in terms of 
language, race, colour, ethnicity, religion or any other such particularity, and 
whose fundamental rights and freedoms are enjoyed and exercised individually in 
accordance with the relevant law. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Every Turkish citizen is considered an indispensable part of the Turkish national 
identity and culture. Their origins are the source of richness in Turkish society and 
they can be enjoyed and preserved through the exercise of individual liberties. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The reforms conducted in transparency in Turkey are indeed testimony of our 
resolve to continue to improve standards of democracy and human rights for the 
benefit of all our citizens regardless of their origins. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Acts of discrimination are prohibited and penalized by law. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; As in any other democratic country governed by the rule of law, the independence 
of judiciary is guaranteed by the Constitution in Turkey. Decisions ruled by first 
instance courts are open to appeal before, at the national level, the Court of 
Appeals or the Council of State, and, at the international level, the European court 
of human rights, the compulsory jurisdiction of which was recognized by Turkey 
in 1990. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; No violation has been found by the European Court of Human rights (ECtHR) on 
the complaints lodged against Turkey on the grounds of discrimination concerning 
individuals&#8217; origins. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; All remedies are available against violations of fundamental rights and freedoms 
including acts of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In addition to the judicial ones, there are governmental/administrative and 
parliamentary remedies. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Administrative remedies are utilized through the Human Rights Presidency and 
Human Rights Boards established in all the 81 provinces and 850 sub-provinces 
throughout the country. The Human Rights Inquiry Commission of the Parliament 
acts as another remedy body at the parliamentary level. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; These bodies are tasked with investigating complaints and allegations of human 
rights abuses, and submitting their findings to relevant authorities for necessary 
action. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 73 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Turkey believes that a successful fight against all forms and manifestations of 
discrimination and intolerance requires combined efforts at national and 
international levels. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; With this understanding, Turkey is party to all relevant international instruments 
both at global (UN) and regional (Council of Europe and OSCE) for a, and duly 
maintains a close and constructive cooperation with the special mechanisms of 
these organizations tasked with the fight against intolerance and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>II.  The Renewal Project in the District of Fatih 
&#8226; Sulukule is a small part of Neslisah District. This area corresponds to only 20% of 
</p>
<p>the whole renewal project area, which is approximately 90.000 m2 in total. All the 
right holders in the project area are treated in a fair, transparent and equal manner. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On the 19 October 2005, the Municipality of Fatih declared Neslisah and Hatice 
Sultan Districts as &#8220;renewal area&#8221; pursuant to the &#8220;Law on the Protection by 
Renewal and Use through Survival of Historical and Cultural Immoveable Objects 
which are eroded&#8221; No. 5366. This decision was endorsed by the Metropolitan 
Municipality of Istanbul on 9 January 2006 (Decision No. 26) and was conveyed 
to the Council of Ministers for approval. The declaration of project renewal area 
subsequently came into effect following the approval by the Council of Ministers 
on 3 April 2006 (Decree No. 2006/10299 and the President, which was 
promulgated in the Official Gazette of 13 December 2006. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 13 July 2006 the &#8220;Protocol on the Project and Works for the 1st Group No. 2 
Renewal Areas of Fatih District in Istanbul&#8221; was signed between the Housing 
Development Administration, the Municipality of Fatih and the Metropolitan 
Municipality of Istanbul. The purpose of the Protocol is to clear the slump areas 
formed due to the prevalence of ruined, broken-down and squatter settlements 
with low urban standards as well as slums within the jurisdiction of the 
Municipality of Fatih with a view to establishing a urban area with modern 
standards, while preserving its historical formation. The Protocol also envisages a 
consensual settlement of possible conflicts which may arise with the right holders 
in the renewal area. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mutual consent in the renewal area is the main principle. In the event that an 
agreement cannot be reached and the regular expropriation process would delay 
the implementation of the project, authorization may be granted for a &#8220;speedy 
expropriation&#8221; according to the domestic legislation. This procedure is not limited 
to situations of &#8220;national defence&#8221; and &#8220;case of emergency&#8221; under the 
Expropriation Act No. 2942. Indeed, Article 27 of the Act No. 2942 allows for 
speedy expropriation in &#8220;extraordinary circumstances foreseen in special laws&#8221;. 
Law No. 5366 is a special law which is applicable in the case of the renewal 
project for Nelisah and Hatice Sultan Districts. Paragraph 4 of Article 24 of the 
Regulation on the implementation of the Law No. 5366 states that &#8220;in cases which 
the regular expropriation process will delay the implementation of the project (and 
an agreement cannot be reached with the right holder), speedy expropriation may </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 74 
 
</p>
<p>be authorized under Article 27 of the Act No. 2942.&#8221; In this regard, such an 
expropriation procedure was authorized by the Council of Ministers on the 
19 October 2006 (Decree No. 11296), which was promulgated in the Official 
Gazette dated 13 December 2006 following the approval of the President. 
However, this decision has not been enforced due to the suits of nullity initiated 
before the administrative courts. So far, it has been possible to reach a mutual 
agreement with 520 owners out of 620 and with all the tenants (340 persons in 
total) living in the renewal area. Whereas, verbal contracts have also been 
concluded with the rest of the owners due to the fact that settlements of 
inheritance and transfer claims are being awaited in order to proceed with the 
written contracts. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The right holders who sign contracts submit a petition for demolition (Annex 1) 
after they evacuate the property so that it is not occupied by others. Such 
properties are checked (in situ) whether it is inhabited or not. If the property is 
inhabited by people, then their status is determined in order to find out whether 
they are occupiers or tenants. If they are tenants, who have previously claimed 
accommodation in the apartments being built in Tasoluk, then they are 
opportunity to live in the property until their evacuation. If the tenant has not 
claimed accommodation as such, then he or she is allowed to stay in the property 
until the schools are closed (Annex 2).  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Unfortunately, illegal occupiers have managed to move into some of the 
evacuated houses. Legal proceedings have been initiated against such occupiers 
and in some instances the demolition work has been carried out under article 3 of 
the Law No. 5366 as a priority. The local people have lodged complaints against 
such illegal occupiers. No registered, listed or qualified property has been 
demolished in the area; On the contrary, one of the purposes of the project is to 
preserve the registered and qualified historical and cultural properties in the area. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The whole district of Fatih is under the earthquake risk of first degree. An 
earthquake map of Istanbul will be provided to the Special Rapporteur in due 
course. The region is particularly vulnerable since almost all the premises are old, 
ruined and shabby. Prior to the project, an assessment study was undertaken, as a 
result of which is was established that 439 buildings were heap, 75 reinforced 
concrete, 56 wooden and 4 other types of construction such as heap and wooden. 
410 buildings were in very bad shape, 3 in good shape, 155 medium, 5 ruined and 
1 torn down. Most of there constructions have completed their economic and 
durability like due to lack of proper care, carry a certain degree of risk. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A notice for evacuation was sent to the right holders in the region. However, the 
evacuation period was extended until the schools were closed and the tenants were 
transferred to new houses. No complaint has been received during this process. 
The relationship between the property owners and tenant is beyond the authority 
of the Municipality of Fatih. If a complaint is lodged with the Municipality 
concerning disputes arising from the owner-tenant relationship, the authorities can 
only offer good offices for the resolution of such disputes. All the owners and 
tenants are entitled to housing within the framework of the project. In this vein, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 75 
 
</p>
<p>conclusion of agreements with the right holders has entered into its last phase. 
Furthermore, the demolition work can only take place once the right holders 
submit their petitions for demolition to the municipal authorities.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; After the region was declared as &#8220;renewal area&#8221;, consultations with the right 
holders in the region were organized two times a week for a period of two months. 
During the process, the expectations, requests, suggestions and claims of the right 
holders were duly identified and the project was developed accordingly. 
Consultations with local people continued during the development phase of the 
project, thereby, allowing necessary adjustments and revisions to be made in the 
project. In June and July 2006, consultative meetings with the right holders were 
organized in the premises if the Municipality of Fatih. Furthermore, the 
Directorate of Research Project of the Municipality of Fatih continued to have 
regular briefings and exchanges with the right holders from September 2006 to 
September 2007. The owners are provided with new houses within the project 
area, whereas tenants are entitled to new apartment flats in other parts of Istanbul. 
Both the owners and tenants receive monthly financial aid until the project is 
completed. (The list of the beneficiaries can be provided to the Special 
Rapporteur, if needed.) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The project does not reflect the needs and expectations of only one specific group. 
It was developed on the basis of the general expectations and preferences of the 
local people. The project houses are two-storey buildings with open internal 
courtyards paved with stones. This style of construction is based on the preference 
of the Romani community. The prices of the houses were paid to the owners in 
advance. As for the remaining debt, in cases which the price of the new housed 
exceed that of their old properties, the right holders have been provided with 
flexible payment conditions. They are expected to begin their monthly payment 
(for a period of 180 month term), once they move to their new houses. On the 
other hand, if the owner is credited then he or she receives full payment in 
advance. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The prices of project houses were determined according to the price of the 
existing immoveable property plus the cost price of the construction. For instance, 
the price of a 100m2 house is 90,000 YTL (approximately 73,530 US Dollars). 
The price of the new project house, which the owner will be provided in return, 
would be 125,000 YTL (approximately 102,124 US Dollars). The remaining 
amount, which the owner is expected to begin paying once he or she moves to the 
new house, would be 35,000 YTL (approximately 28,594 US Dollars). Its 
monthly payment corresponds to 195 YTL (approximately 159 US Dollars). The 
rental income from the old house ranges from 250 to 300 YTL per month 
(204-245 US Dollars), while the project houses will produce a monthly income of 
1000 to 1500 YTL (approximately 817 to 1225 US Dollars). Therefore, the right 
holders expect the project to be completed as soon as possible. The right to 
ownership is safeguarded in the Constitution. There is no obstacle for right 
holders to transfer their properties and to purchase new ones. So far, transfer of 
ownership within the framework of the project has not been on a large scale as </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 76 
 
</p>
<p>suggested in the communication of the Special Rapporteur. Indeed, the recent data 
from the Directorate for Registry of Title Deeds shows that the transfer of 
ownership in the area is only %30 to date. Most of them were indeed hereditary 
transmissions. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Prior to the project, the Municipality of Fatih instructed the University of Istanbul 
to conduct a census in order to prepare a comprehensive assessment on the 
physical, social, cultural, demographic, economic and settlement conditions in the 
area. According to the findings of the census, the number of families living as 
tenants in the project area was established as 303. However, it was later found out 
that some of the tenants were not at home when the survey was conducted. In 
order not to exclude there people from the project, this process was extended until 
the end of 2007. The new deadline was repeatedly announced by the local 
authorities. Therefore, the number of tenants has risen to 340 according to the 
extended assessment. All of them had the opportunity to participate in the housing 
lotteries that were conducted in the presence of a notary public. The local families 
who had the status of tenants and occupiers when the project began in the renewal 
area, are entitled to housing attribution within the framework of the project. No 
family with such a status has been excluded from the project. It has been recently 
decided that those families who are able to prove that they were tenants when the 
project began are now recognized as having entitled to tenancy rights. The 
housing attribution contracts with the tenants are indeed free of charge. After the 
lotteries were organized, a total of 8 tenants applied to the bank instead of the 
Municipality of Fatih in order to sign contracts. They were requested to pay stamp 
tax by the banks for this transaction. The Municipality of Fatih immediately 
intervened after this situation was brought to its attention. Therefore, the 
Municipality once again announced to the local people that the contracts were to 
be signed with the municipal authorities and not with the banks. So far contracts 
have been concluded with almost all the tenants for the attribution of apartments 
in Tasoluk district. These apartment flats have been allocated to tenants without 
any prepayment. They are expected to begin their monthly payments (for a term 
of 180 months, corresponding to 15 years) once they move to their new flats. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; This project is designed to meet the expectations of the local people for better 
living standards and will contribute to their physical, socio-economic and cultural 
development. The project aims to preserve the historical street silhouette and is 
consistent with the local living traditions. The Romani community constitutes 
only a part of the population living as tenants in the renewal area. Most of the 
tenants come from different parts of the country to work in textile and service 
sectors with low income. However, the special situation of the Romani 
community has been given due attention at all stages of the project. The houses 
allocated to tenants are not in separate regions. They are in the same area and 
made up of 3 storey apartments with 6 flats each, constructed side by side with 
separately organized blocks. The total area is 7000,000 m2, 250,000 m2 of which 
is allocated to buildings. The remaining part is composed of green area and social, 
educational, cultural and recreational common parts. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
  page 77 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The project was developed on the basis of physical and social needs assessments. 
Some of these assessment reports will be provided to the Special Rapporteur in 
due course. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The decision of the council of Ministers for expropriation has never been 
implemented. As such, no expropriation work has been carried out to date. No 
family has been forced to evacuate their properties. So far, only the properties of 
those families who have submitted petition to the Municipality after their 
evacuation have been demolished. The project has been carried out pursuant to the 
decisions agreed upon during the consultative meetings held in June-July 2006. 
The public housing in Tasoluk district includes all tenants and occupant families 
in the renewal area. The attribution of the apartments to 340 families has been 
completed. The Municipality of Fatih has concluded an agreement with the 
Housing Development Administration for further the attribution of 100 houses in 
order to meet a possible accommodation deficit. The contracts signed between the 
right holders and the Municipality of Fatih are free of charge. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The project is not only designed as a renewal project but also includes social 
empowerment programmes. For instance, 45 local women are provided with 
opportunity to attend an occupational certificate programme on clothing and 
tailoring, with business guarantees. Another certificate programme on wooden 
works for 20 young locals will begin shortly. All participants are insured and 
receive daily wages during their courses. A third initiative is a vocational course 
organized in cooperation with &#8220;Istanbul Ready-Made Clothing Business Union&#8221;. 
Efforts are being made to ensure employment opportunities after the completion 
of this course. Furthermore, an application for an employment grant programme 
has been submitted to the European Union and Turkish Employment Organization 
(ISKUR).&#8221;

<p><b>United States of America 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>88. On 17 December 2007 the Special Rapporteur together with the Independent Expert on 
Minority Issues sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of the United States of America 
concerning information received regarding demolitions of public housing in New Orleans, 
Louisiana, which are scheduled to take place in Mid-December. Such demolitions would 
reportedly particularly affect African-Americans. According to the information received, 
approximately 5000 families who previous to Hurricane Katrina lived in public housing in 
New Orleans, were, as a result, internally displaced and were still waiting to be able to return to 
their homes in New Orleans. Reports indicated, however, that in their absence the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved the demolition of thousands 
of public housing units, allowing only approximately 1,500 families to return to New Orleans 
public housing. Specifically, on 14 June 2006, HUD announced that it would demolish more 
than 5,000 public housing units and replace them with mixed-income developments. HUD has 
moreover shortened the 100-day review period for demolition to one day. Demolition mainly 
concerns St. Bernard, C.J. Peete, B.W. Cooper, and Lafitte estates. These demolitions were 
allegedly scheduled to take place despite the fact that an independent survey to assess the </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1 
page 78 
 
</p>
<p>number of displaced residents of New Orleans who wish to return had not yet been completed. In 
addition, expert testimony reportedly contradicted housing officials in declaring that the housing 
units are structurally unsound. It has moreover been indicated that the demolition plans did not 
consider a one for one replacement of housing, and residents of the public housing concerned 
were not allowed to meaningfully participate in the decisions affecting their housing. 
Furthermore, the Gulf Coast Housing Recovery Act of 2007, which would provide all residents 
of the Gulf Coast the right to return and specifically identifies this right for previous public 
housing residents, was still pending before the Senate, and the above-mentioned demolitions 
were scheduled to take place before the Senate was able to vote on this legislation. Finally, in 
preparation for the demolition, reports described that contractors have begun clearing the 
properties concerned, discarding the personal property of the residents in the process, without 
their knowledge or consent. The position of those residents who are currently living in such 
housing was, at the time of this communication, unclear. These actions would reportedly 
contravene &#167; 1437p of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. &#167; 1437p) and the 
Administrative Procedure Act, which, among other things, prohibit approval of a public housing 
demolition application if the application was not developed in consultation with the residents 
who will be affected by the demolition and with each affected resident advisory board or resident 
council. These Acts further provide that, as a prerequisite to approval, the local housing authority 
must, inter alia, certify that the public housing development is: (1) obsolete and unsuitable for 
housing purposes and that no cost-effective plan can allow the buildings to be used for housing 
purposes; and (2) that each family will be notified of the demolition and offered comparable 
housing that meets housing quality standards and is allocated in an area that is generally not less 
desirable than the location of the displaced. Concern was expressed the demolition of over 5,000 
units of public housing, if implemented, would effectively deny the right to return, the right to 
housing restitution of IDPs, and the right to adequate housing of thousands of, particularly, 
African-American residents of New Orleans. Further concern was expressed from the point of 
view of non-discrimination, particularly since reports indicate that efforts to respect, protect and 
fulfil these rights for predominantly White residents of New Orleans have been undertaken. In 
addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs 
requested further information on whether tenants are informed about their legal rights and any 
steps taken to ensure their protection including legal aid for those with low-incomes; if all 
alternative solutions to resettlement of the persons affected by the scheduled demolitions are 
envisaged; in cases where relocation is unavoidable, whether it is ensured that the scheduled 
demolitions do not result in homelessness and adequate and fair compensation and rehabilitation 
is provided; and information on the measures taken to avoid any form of discrimination towards 
the African-American residents of New Orleans in relation to this matter.

</p>
<p>Government of Uzbekistan in relation to Ms Saida Kurbanova, director of the Human Rights 
Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU), a non-governmental organization in the Pakhtakor district of the 
Jizak region. She is also a farmer and a campaigner for farmers&#8217; rights. Since 24 February 2008, 
Ms Saida Kurbanova had reportedly been under threat of eviction from her home as a result of 
her organization of, and participation in, a series of peaceful protests in the past two months to 
protest against the lack of domestic heating and electricity in the Jizak region. Reports indicated 
that Saida Kurbanova has been under pressure from local authorities to leave the region. The 
head of the Pahtakor District Administration, has reportedly threatened her relatives, Kabul 
Sattarov and Murad Hujamuradov, that they will lose their farms if she refuses to leave the Jizak 
region. Saida Kurbanova reportedly was also subject to constant surveillance by unidentified 
persons in plain clothes and on 22 February 2008, she was attacked by a young man who stole 
her bag. In May 2007, Saida Kurbanova was subject to a smear campaign by regional media as a 
result of her work and was called a &#8220;traitor of the motherland&#8221; by Ergash Soliyev, the head of the 
Pahtakor District Administration, for internationally publicizing the plight of Uzbek farmers. 
This winter, farmers and citizens in Uzbekistan have suffered gas shortages amidst freezing 
temperatures. Concern was expressed that the harassment and intimidation faced by 
Ms. Saida Kurbanova may be directly related to her activities in defense of human rights, in 
particular the work carried out by the HRSU in defense of the rights of farmers in Uzbekistan. 
Further concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Saida Kurbanova, 
that of her family and all members of the HRSU. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the 
facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information if any complaint 
has been lodged; details, and where available the results, of any investigation and judicial or 
other inquiries carried out in relation to the harassment and intimidation of 
Ms. Saida Kurbanova; and information on the measures taken to ensure the safety of 
Ms. Saida Kurbanova. 
</p>
<p><b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>91. On 22 April 2008 the Government of Uzbekistan replied to the joint allegation letter dated 
13 March 2008, and gave the following information on the case of S. Kurbanova: &#8220;In the course 
of the investigation carried out by Uzbekistan&#8217;s competent authorities, it was established that 
neither Ms. Saida Kurbanova, born 31 December 1958 and residing at 7 Safarov Street, 
&#8220;Navbakhor&#8221; rural area, Pakhtakor municipal district of Dzhizak [Jizzax] province, nor members 
of her family, were threatened with expulsion from their homes. They did not appeal to the 
Office of the Procurator on that subject. 
</p><p>92. Nor did Ms. Kurbanova appeal to the local authorities concerning the lack of electric 
power and natural gas in Pakhtakor district during the winter of 2007-2008. However, the 
Dzhizak [Jizzax] municipal internal affairs office is carrying out a preliminary investigation into 
S. Kurbanova&#8217;s report that she was attacked on 22 February 2008 and robbed of 49,200 Uzbek 
sum and other items, and on the basis of the findings, a decision will be taken in accordance with 
the law. There has likewise been no corroboration of the information concerning threats by local 
administrative and law enforcement officials to Ms. Kurbanova&#8217;s relatives, Kabul Sattarov and 
Murad Khuzhamuradov, that they would lose their farms if Ms. Kurbanova refused to leave 
Dzhizak [Jizzax] province. In view of the foregoing, the information brought to the attention of 
the United Nations Special Rapporteurs concerning alleged violations of Ms. Kurbanova&#8217;s rights </p>

<p>by local authorities and law enforcement agencies in connection with her participation in

<p><b>Zimbabwe 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>93. On 22 April 2008 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on Torture sent a joint urgent 
appeal to the Government of Zimbabwe regarding reports of intimidation, violence and torture as 
a form of retribution or victimization in the aftermath of recent elections. Between 29 March and 
14 April 2008, 160 cases of injury resulting from organized violence and torture were treated by 
various doctors with many of the patients still remaining in hospital. One third of the patients 
were women. A fifth of the victims were members of the opposition Movement for Democratic 
Change (MDC) and another 20% were involved in the elections for the Zimbabwe Electoral 
Commission (ZEC). Nine patients sustained fractures (broken bones), reportedly typical of 
&#8220;defense injuries&#8221;, resulting from the victim raising his or her hands and arms to protect the face 
and upper body from assault. At least two politically motivated murders, 15 abductions of 
women, 288 cases of homes destroyed through politically motivated arson subjecting 175 
families and 14 persons to displacement, and 48 cases of assault took place during this period. 
The majority of persons displaced are said to be women and children. About 70 MDC members 
have been arrested in the days leading up to this communication. The above-described violence 
has been perpetrated by police officers, soldiers and members of the ruling Zanu PF party as part 
of a retributive and reprisal campaign mainly in rural areas, where people have voted for 
opposition candidates. In many instances victims were told that they were being victimized 
because they support the opposition; they were accused of &#8220;celebrating the MDC victory&#8221;, &#8220;of 
selling the country to the whites&#8221; and/or &#8220;of being responsible for the rigging of elections in 
favour of the MDC&#8221;. Reports also indicate that the authorities are targeting the independent local 
and foreign media, attempting to impede reporting on the current situation and the aftermath of 
the election, by resorting increasingly to police harassment and the arrest and detention of 
journalists; the deportation of one foreign journalist has been reported. In parallel, the 
State-controlled media is reportedly airing programmes and songs encouraging violence, such as 
&#8220;Mr. Government&#8221; by Man Soul Jah, which celebrates the Government&#8217;s land seizures and calls 
for the decimation of perceived political sell-outs (the song says: &#8220;We are living like squatters in 
the land of our heritage... give me my spear so that I can kill the many sell-outs in my 
forefathers&#8217; country.&#8221;) and a well known song encouraging people to take up arms and fight for 
their freedom aired by ZTV. Moreover, reports have appeared that there are plans to entrust the 
distribution of food aid to the military in order to control the population through the 
politicization of food distribution. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the 
allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further information if any complaint has been 
lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victims; details, and where available the results, of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this 
case; full details of any prosecutions which have been or will be undertaken and sanctions 
imposed on any of the alleged perpetrators; and whether compensation has been or will be 
provided to the alleged victims or their families. </p>

<p><b>Response received 
</b></p>
<p>94. On 11 June 2008, the Government of Zimbabwe responded to the communication dated 
22 April 2008, informing the Specials Rapporteurs that the President, Cabinet Ministers, Service 
Chiefs and various ruling party functionaries have all repeatedly before, during and after the 
29th March Harmonised Elections, publicly declared their disapproval for violence and warned 
all would be perpetrators of the full consequences of the law. The government gave the 
following information in response to the Special Rapporteurs allegation letter: 
</p>
<p>95. &#8220;On the eve of the election, Police Commissioner General Augustine Chihuri, flanked by 
his fellow Service Chiefs, issued his most stern warning against violence. A copy of this 
statement is at Annexure D. This policy has been and continues to be enforced without 
discrimination, fear or favour. All cases that have been reported to the police are the subject of 
investigations as part of the due processes of the law. In Zimbabwe, a report by an aggrieved 
party or reasonable suspicion of a crime having been committed or about to be committed is a 
critical step in launching this due process of the law. Once reported, the ZRP would then 
exercise its mandate to docket, investigate and bring suspects before the courts of law for 
prosecution and, ultimately, judgment. Where no report has been made to the police, as appears 
to be the case regarding the 31 politically motivated murders claimed by the MDC-T as having 
occurred since 29th March 2008, the Police would find it impossible to take the initial steps to 
launch the due process described above, bearing in mind that at Zimbabwean law, a person is 
presumed innocent until proven guilty. The eight murders officially attributed to the two sides 
fall far below the 31 claimed by MDC-T. It is impossible to verify the MDC-T&#8217;s claims, 
particularly because it appears to be complaining to the press before reporting them to the police. 
Even then, of the six murders allegedly committed by ZANU-PF supporters, subject to ongoing 
investigations, at least two do not seem to have been politically motivated. One of these was the 
case of Clemence Dube, who MDC-T&#8217;s Antony Chamisa claimed to have been murdered in 
Shurugwi by a ZANU-PF supporter on 27 April 2008. According to established facts, however, 
Dube died of immunosuppression and tuberculosis at Mpilo Hospital, in Bulawayo, on 
27 April 2008. Incidentally, on 11 April 2008, he had fought with a ZANU-PF supporter at a 
local township over money, but eye witnesses say the two later went their separate ways. In the 
other case, the alleged victim, a teacher in Muzarabani area, has turned out to be alive. He has 
actually denounced the MDC-T for using his name to justify &#8216;dubious statistics&#8217;. It seems, from 
these two cases alone, that the MDC-T is fabricating and exaggerating its tally of victims in 
order to give substance to its claims that there is a raging civil war in Zimbabwe. Some of the 
alleged crimes in the MDC-T&#8217;s tally, such as politically motivated rape, are completely alien and 
unheard of in Zimbabwe&#8217;s political culture. However, every complaint received will be 
investigated and pursued to its logical conclusion, with all perpetrators facing the full wrath of 
the law. It has never been Government&#8217;s policy to support or condone violence or impunity. It is 
unfortunate that, quite to the contrary of the objective reality on the ground, all the &#8216;evidence&#8217; 
cited by the Rapporteurs paints the MDC-T as the victim and implicates ZANU-PF as the 
principal perpetrator of violence. During the &#8216;mass action&#8217; called by the MDC-T on 
15th March 2008, marauding gangs of MDC-T DRCs burnt to ashes one conventional 77-seater 
bus belonging to the Nyamweda Bus Company which was full of cross-border traders en route 
from Botswana, stoned another bus belonging to the state-owned Zimbabwe United Passenger 
Company (ZUPCO) and two private motor vehicles, and also committed a wide range of other 
crimes ranging from disrupting traffic through makeshift road blockades to attempted murder. 
Police arrested 76 activists who have all confessed to be hired members of the DRCs. As a result </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/7/Add.1

</p>
<p>of the ongoing investigations pertaining to Electoral Fraud, close to 100 arrests have been made. 
Five of these have already been convicted for Contravening Section 87 of the Electoral Act 
Chapter 2: 13 and sentenced to fines ranging between ZW$12 billion and ZW$30 billion. The 
remaining cases are either at various stages of investigation or before the courts. This is not 
victimization of &#8216;human rights defenders&#8217; as the MDC-T claims. No one is above the law in 
Zimbabwe. Where a crime is suspected to have been committed, the perpetrator will be brought 
to justice regardless of his or her race, colour, religion or political affiliation. This principle 
demands that the law must be allowed to take its course. Much as some quarters may advocate 
the invocation of the &#8216;responsibility to protect&#8217; principle against Zimbabwe on the basis of the 
MDC-T&#8217;s litany of fabrications and exaggerations, it is equally important to understand that the 
Constitution of Zimbabwe demarcates the sovereign boundaries of responsibility within which 
the Government must protect its citizens. Regarding questions of compensation for alleged 
victims which are also raised in the communication, victims are receiving the usual basic 
assistance from the Civil Protection Department and the resident humanitarian agencies in the 
country. However, contrary to the over 5 000 &#8220;IDPs&#8221; that the MDC-T claims to have registered, 
the Government, with the support of non-partisan civil society, are attending to no more than 100 
households comprising 700 people. There are no new cases. Besides, it is still too early to start 
talking about long-term resettlement support at this stage when the problem is still being 
quantified, the victims screened and registered according to their needs.&#8221;
