of discrimination based on religion or belief adopted by the General Assembly and by the former 
Commission on Human Rights, 
</p>

</p>
<p>*  Non-member States of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,<b>1</b> 
article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights<b>2</b> and other relevant human rights 
provisions, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the recognition by the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights that 
all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, and its appeal to all 
Governments to take all appropriate measures in compliance with their international obligations 
and with due regard to their respective legal systems to counter intolerance and related violence 
based on religion or belief, including practices of discrimination against women and the 
desecration of religious sites, recognizing that every individual has the right to freedom of 
thought, conscience, expression and religion,<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the 2005 World Summit Outcome<b>4</b> in which the Heads of State and Government 
reaffirmed the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace<b>5</b> as well as the 
Global Agenda for Dialogue Among Civilizations and its Programme of Action<b>6</b> adopted by the 
General Assembly and the value of different initiatives on dialogue among cultures and 
civilizations, including the dialogue on interfaith cooperation and the Alliance of Civilizations, 
and committed themselves to taking action to promote a culture of peace and dialogue at the 
local, national, regional and international levels, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of promoting dialogue in order to enhance mutual 
understanding and knowledge among different social groups, cultures and civilizations in various 
areas, including culture, religion, education, information, science and technology, and in order to 
contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms,

<p> <i>Underlining</i> the importance of education in the promotion of tolerance, which involves the 
acceptance by the public of, and its respect for, diversity, including with regard to religious 
expressions, and underlining also the fact that education should contribute in a meaningful way 
to promoting tolerance and the elimination of discrimination based on religion or belief, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>the important work carried out by the Human Rights Committee with respect 
to the scope of the freedom of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p> <i>Seriously concerned</i> at all attacks upon religious places, sites and shrines in violation of 
international law, in particular human rights and humanitarian law, including any deliberate 
destruction of relics and monuments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Seriously concerned also</i> at the misuse of registration procedures and at the resort to 
discriminatory registration procedures as a means to limit the right to freedom of religion or 
belief of members of certain religious communities, at the limitations placed on religious 
publications and at the obstacles placed in the way of construction of places of worship 
inconsistent with the exercise of the right to freedom of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> of the need to address the rise in all parts of the world of religious extremism 
affecting the rights of individuals and groups based on religion or belief, the situations of 
violence and discrimination that affect many women as well as individuals from other vulnerable 
groups in the name of religion or belief or due to cultural and traditional practices, and the abuse 
of religion or belief for ends inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations and other 
relevant instruments of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that a formal or legal distinction at the national level between different kinds of 
religions or faith-based communities may, in some cases, constitute discrimination and may 
impinge on the enjoyment of the freedom of religion or belief,  
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that States, regional organizations, non-governmental organizations, religious 
bodies and the media have an important role to play in promoting tolerance, respect and freedom 
of religion or belief, </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of interreligious and intra-religious dialogue and the role of 
religious and other non-governmental organizations in promoting tolerance in matters relating to 
religion or belief, and welcoming different initiatives in this regard, including the Alliance of 
Civilizations, the programmes led by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization and the High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and 
Cooperation for Peace, held at Headquarters on 4 and 5 October 2007, 
</p>
<p> <i>Seriously concerned</i> at the slow progress in the implementation of the Declaration on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, 
</p>
<p> <i>Believing</i> that further intensified efforts are therefore required to promote and protect the 
right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief and to eliminate all forms of hatred, 
intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief, as also noted at the World Conference 
against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, 
</p>
<p> <i>Having conducted</i> an assessment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on freedom 
of religion or belief in the form of an interactive dialogue during its present session, in 
accordance with its resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the resolutions 5/1 &#8220;Institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights 
Council&#8221; and 5/2 &#8220;Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of the Human 
Rights Council&#8221; of 18 June 2007 and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge his/her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and their annexes, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Condemns</i> all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief 
as well as violations of the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 2.  <i>Recognizes with deep concern</i> the overall rise in instances of intolerance and 
violence directed against members of many religious and other communities in various parts of 
the world, including cases motivated by Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and Christianophobia; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses concern</i> over the persistence of institutionalized or social intolerance and 
discrimination practiced against many in the name of or due to their religion or belief; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 4.  <i>Recalls</i> that legal procedures pertaining to religious or belief-based groups and places 
of worship are not a prerequisite for the exercise of the right to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 5.  <i>Emphasizes</i> that such procedures as described in paragraph 4 above, at the national 
or local levels, as and when legally required, should be non-discriminatory in order to contribute 
to the effective protection of the right of all persons to practise their religion or belief either 
individually or in community with others and in public or private; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Condemns</i> any advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence, whether it involves the use of print, audio-visual and 
electronic media or any other means; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to 
make efforts to coordinate in the field of human rights the activities of relevant United Nations 
organs, bodies and mechanisms dealing with all forms of intolerance and discrimination based 
on religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 8.  <i>Emphasizes</i> that promoting tolerance and acceptance by the public of and its respect 
for diversity and combating all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion and 
belief are substantial elements in creating an environment conducive to the full enjoyment by all 
of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as enshrined in article 18 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Urges</i> States: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To ensure that their constitutional and legislative systems provide adequate and 
effective guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief to all without 
distinction, inter alia, by the provision of effective remedies in cases where the right to freedom

the right to change one&#8217;s religion or belief, is violated; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To design and implement policies whereby education systems promote principles of 
tolerance and respect for others and cultural diversity and the freedom of religion or belief; </p>

</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To review, whenever relevant, existing registration practices in order to ensure the 
right of all persons to manifest their religion or belief, alone or in community with others and in 
public or in private; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To ensure, in particular, the right of all persons to worship or assemble in connection 
with a religion or belief and to establish and maintain places for these purposes and the right of 
all persons to write, issue and disseminate relevant publications in these areas; 
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) To ensure that, in accordance with appropriate national legislation and in conformity 
with international human rights law, the freedom of all persons and members of groups to 
establish and maintain religious, charitable or humanitarian institutions is fully respected and 
protected; 
</p>
<p> (<i>i</i>) To ensure that, on account of religion or belief or the expression or manifestation of 
religion or belief, no one within their jurisdiction is deprived of the right to life, liberty or 
security of person, subjected to torture or arbitrary arrest or detention, or denied the rights to 
work, education or adequate housing, as well as the right to seek asylum, and to bring to justice 
all perpetrators of violations of these rights; </p>

 <p></p>

practices that violate the human rights of women and discriminate against women, including in 
the exercise of their right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> (<i>m</i>)  To promote and encourage, through education and other means, including regional 
or international cultural exchanges, understanding, tolerance and respect in all matters relating to 
freedom of religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Stresses</i> the need to strengthen dialogue, inter alia through the Global Agenda for 
Dialogue among Civilizations and the Alliance of Civilizations, including through the recently 
appointed High Representative of the Secretary-General for the Alliance of Civilizations and the

interact with various entities in the United Nations system and coordinate their contribution to 
dialogue; 
</p>
<p> 11.  <i>Invites</i> all actors to address in the context of that dialogue, inter alia, the following 
issues within the framework of international human rights: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>)  The rise of religious extremism affecting religions in all parts of the world;

within religions or beliefs, at all levels and with a broader participation including of women, to 
promote greater tolerance, respect and mutual understanding; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Also emphasizes</i> that no religion should be equated with terrorism, as this may have 
adverse consequences on the enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief of all 
members of the religious communities concerned; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Further emphasizes</i> that, as underlined by the Human Rights Committee, restrictions 
on the freedom to manifest religion or belief are permitted only if limitations are prescribed by 
law, are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and 
freedoms of others, and are applied in a manner that does not vitiate the right to freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Recommends</i> that the United Nations and other actors, including non-governmental 
organizations and bodies and groups based on religion or belief, in their efforts to promote 
freedom of religion or belief, ensure the widest possible dissemination of the text of the 
Declaration, in as many different languages as possible, and promote its implementation; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Concludes</i> that there is a need for the continued contribution of the Special 
Rapporteur to the protection, promotion and universal implementation of the right to freedom of 
religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Decides</i> therefore to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief for a further period of three years and, in this context, invites the Special 
Rapporteur: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>)  To promote the adoption of measures at the national, regional and international levels 
to ensure the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of religion or belief; </p>

 <p></p>

</p>

<p> (<i>d</i>)  To continue to apply a gender perspective, inter alia, through the identification of 
gender-specific abuses, in the reporting process, including in information collection and in 
recommendations; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to ensure that the Special Rapporteur receives the 
necessary resources to enable her/him to discharge her/his mandate fully; 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Urges</i> all Governments to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur and to respond 
favourably to her/his requests to visit their countries and to provide her/him with all necessary 
information so as to enable her/him to fulfil her/his mandate even more effectively;
