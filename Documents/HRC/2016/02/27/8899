<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The open-ended Working Group on the Right to Development convened its tenth session 
in Geneva from 22 to 26 June 2009, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 9/3. 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group was established by resolution 1998/72 of the then Commission on 
Human Rights and decision 1998/269 of the Economic and Social Council with a mandate: (a) to 
monitor and review progress made in the promotion and implementation of the right to 
development as elaborated in the Declaration on the Right to Development, at the national and 
international levels, providing recommendations thereon and further analysing obstacles to its 
full enjoyment, focusing each year on specific commitments in the Declaration; (b) to review 
reports and any other information submitted by States, United Nations agencies, other relevant 
international organizations and non-governmental organizations on the relationship between their 
activities and the right to development; and (c) to present for the consideration of the 
Commission on Human Rights a sessional report on its deliberations, including advice to the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) with regard to 
the implementation of the right to development, and suggesting possible programmes of 
technical assistance at the request of interested countries with the aim of promoting the 
implementation of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>3. The high-level task force on the implementation of the right to development was 
established by Commission on Human Rights resolution 2004/7 and Economic and Social 
Council decision 2004/249, at the recommendation and within the framework of the Working 
Group, in order to assist it in fulfilling its mandate. By Commission resolution 2005/4, the task 
force was requested to &#8220;examine Millennium Development Goal 8 on a global partnership for 
development and suggest criteria for its periodic evaluation with the aim of improving the 
effectiveness of global partnerships with regard to the realization of the right to development&#8221;. 
The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 9/3, decided that the criteria should be &#8220;extended to 
other components of Millennium Development Goal 8&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>4. Council resolution 9/3 and General Assembly resolution 63/178 endorsed the workplan for 
the implementation of the mandate of the high-level task force for the period 2008-2010 as 
outlined in paragraph 43 of the report of the Working Group on its ninth session (A/HRC/9/17). 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ORGANIZATION OF THE SESSION 
</b></p>
<p>5. The session was opened by the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
Kyung-wha Kang. 
</p>
<p>6. At its first meeting, on 22 June 2009, the Working Group re-elected by acclamation 
Arjun Sengupta (India) as Chairperson-Rapporteur<b>1</b> and adopted its agenda 
(A/HRC/WG.2/10/1/Rev.1) and programme of work (see annex I). 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Mr. Sengupta was first elected as Chairperson-Rapporteur on 10 September 2007 following the 
</p>
<p>resignation of Ibrahim Salama (Egypt), who had chaired the Working Group since 
February 2004. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. At the session, the Working Group considered the report on the fifth session of the 
high-level task force on the implementation of the right to development, held in Geneva 
from 1 to 9 April 2009 (A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/2). 
</p>
<p><b>III.  SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Opening statements 
</b></p>
<p>8. The representative of Cuba, speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, recalled 
that the fourteenth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Havana in September 2006, 
had called for the elevation of the right to development to the same level and on a par with all 
other human rights, as well as its full operationalization through the elaboration of a convention. 
The gap between developed and developing countries continued to grow while obstacles to its 
realization remained, such as debt burdens, failure to comply with official development 
assistance commitments, lack of democracy in decision-making in international trade, financial 
and monetary institutions, and unilateral coercive measures. Millennium Development Goal 8 
held the key to the achievement of all the other Millennium Development Goals. Taking note of 
the report of the task force, the representative said that in accordance with the task force&#8217;s work 
plan, the Working Group should not engage in negotiations on the revised criteria at the current 
session but rather focus on providing advice on further improvement of the criteria. 
</p>
<p>9. The representative of the Czech Republic, on behalf of the European Union (EU), 
reiterated the support of the European Union for the work of the task force and its commitment 
to the realization of the right to development and the attainment of the Millennium Development 
Goals. States had the primary responsibility for the realization of the right to development, and 
the criteria should focus on the national sphere, including good governance, social justice, equity 
and participation. The European Union supported a human rights-based approach to 
development, wherein the focus must be on the rights of individuals. The task force should 
develop benchmarks and indicators, but should not examine new partnerships. 
</p>
<p>10. The representative of the Netherlands took the floor to support the position taken by the 
European Union and noted its efforts to promote development through international cooperation 
and assistance. The representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
also supported the position of the EU and appreciated the task force&#8217;s transparency. Her 
Government was committed to the realization of the right to development but had yet to be 
convinced of the value of a legally binding convention. The representative outlined the 
Government&#8217;s active role in promoting the right to development through engagement at the 
national and international levels and gave examples of development programmes. She welcomed 
the focus of the task force on putting individuals at the centre of development, on vulnerable 
groups and promoting gender equality, on best practices developed by both donor and recipient 
countries and on evidence of the impact of human rights approaches to development.  
</p>
<p>11. The representative of the United States of America, expressing support for the work of the 
task force, emphasized that the right to development meant essentially that each individual had 
the right to develop his or her intellectual or other capabilities to the maximum extent possible 
through the exercise of the full range of human rights. The representative outlined the various </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>initiatives her Government had implemented through international cooperation and assistance in 
order to address the challenges of climate change and to contribute to greater food security, 
greater access to health care, and access to water and sanitation. The United States supported the 
approach of the task force, which recognized the indivisibility of human rights, equality, 
transparency, participation, democracy, rule of law and good governance and placed them at the 
centre of development. 
</p>
<p>12. The representative of Pakistan shared the concern that more than 22 years after the 
adoption of the Declaration on the Right to Development and 16 years after the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action, there had been little progress towards the realization of 
the right to development. The Working Group&#8217;s session was taking place against a backdrop of 
ongoing financial and economic crisis, which had exposed the vulnerabilities of developing 
countries in overcoming such challenges. The present crisis had once again proven the need for 
policy space for developing countries to exercise the right to development when such challenges 
occurred. Pakistan welcomed the efforts of the task force in developing the criteria with a view 
to finalizing it next year. 
</p>
<p>13. The representative of Brazil highlighted the heavy burden that the current financial and 
economic crisis was putting on developing countries, especially the poor. Trade distortions 
impacted negatively on the social and economic sectors in developing countries and the 
assistance provided by many developed countries did not match the vast needs of the developing 
countries; in any case, the developed countries had yet to live up to the commitment of devoting 
0.7 per cent of GDP to official development assistance. In that regard the criteria relating to the 
enabling environment should be couched in terms that reflected the need to break the cycle of 
dependency. 
</p>
<p>14. The observers for the Indian Council of South America, the Indigenous Peoples and 
Nations Coalition and the International Council for Human Rights drew the attention of the 
Working Group to the situation of indigenous peoples and expressed the hope that the interests 
of indigenous peoples would be considered in the work of the task force. They suggested that the 
task force should draw on specialized expertise from relevant non-governmental and 
international organizations and agencies such as Transparency International and the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development in the revision of the criteria and development of 
the sub-criteria.  
</p>
<p><b>B. Review of progress in the implementation of the right to development: 
consideration of the report of the high-level task force  
</b></p>
<p>15. Stephen Marks, Chairperson-Rapporteur of the high-level task force, presented the report 
on the fifth session of the task force (A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/2). The report contained a review of 
the implementation of the workplan of the task force for the period 2008-2010, including 
continued dialogue with the selected global partnerships reviewed at its previous sessions and 
assessment of additional global partnerships in the areas of access to essential medicines, debt 
relief and transfer of technology, as well as dialogue with the Common Market of the South 
(MERCOSUR). He also presented the interim draft version of the right-to-development criteria, 
as work in progress. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>16. The work of the task force had been greatly facilitated by the high quality of new expert 
members, although the task force could benefit from more assiduous participation by some of the 
institutional members. The Group of Twenty (G20) Summit had taken place in London at the 
time of the April 2009 session of the task force, just as the United Nations Conference on the 
World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development was taking place in 
New York during the present session of the Working Group. While growth, stability, openness of 
markets, trade flows, debt sustainability, private capital flows and aid were of major importance 
to the right to development, neither of these events appeared to attach the same importance to the 
core values of the right to development as the Working Group. Mr. Marks welcomed the 
participation of the High Commissioner in the World Conference and expressed the hope that the 
Conference would consider the impact of the economic downturn on human rights and the right 
to development. 
</p>
<p>17. As regards the first part of the report of the task force dealing with the assessment of 
partnerships, the Chairperson explained the methodology used in its assessment process, the 
lessons learned from partnerships reviewed and how that review served in the refinement of the 
criteria. The task force was currently dealing with 11 partnerships, 4 dealing with aid and trade 
with which it had had a dialogue over several years; 3 dealing with access to medicines and 
transfer of technology in the health field with which a dialogue had been established this year; 
and 4 concerned with transfer of technology relating to climate change and intellectual property, 
as well as debt relief and regional trade, with which it was planning to engage pursuant to the 
Working Group&#8217;s request at its last session. He was particularly impressed with the openness and 
receptiveness of the health-related partnerships during missions by the task force and consultants 
and the quality of the input from the institutions responsible for the Cotonou Agreement and debt 
relief during the last session of the task force. 
</p>
<p>18. He concluded by mentioning the activities the task force envisaged in the coming months 
with regard to the Development Agenda of the World Intellectual Property Organization, the 
Climate Change Conference and MERCOSUR, and underlined the importance of cooperation 
with those institutions so that the task force could extend its study and criteria to the components 
of Millennium Development Goal 8 that had not yet been covered, as requested by the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Global partnerships 
</b></p>
<p>19. During the general discussion on the report of the task force, the representative of Cuba (on 
behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement) welcomed the continued review of the existing global 
partnerships and the review of new partnerships, while pointing out that the focus of the review 
should shift from evaluating their compliance with the criteria towards learning lessons for the 
improvement of the criteria. The revised criteria contained in the report continued to focus on the 
national dimension of the right to development. Since the adoption of the Declaration on the 
Right to Development in 1986, adequate attention had not been given to its international 
dimension. Human rights mainstreaming was not the objective of the right to development; it 
was rather to enhance national capacity in terms of resources to ensure the enjoyment of all 
human rights. The right to development belonged to both individuals and peoples.</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>20. The representative of the Czech Republic (on behalf of the European Union) expressed 
reluctance to support assessments of new global partnerships. With regard to the revised criteria, 
the European Union attached importance to those relating to social justice and equality, 
non-discrimination, participation and good governance, among others. The EU agreed that expert 
input would be required for the criteria and sub-criteria to be methodologically rigorous. The 
global economic and financial crisis and climate change should be considered within the 
framework of the existing criteria. 
</p>
<p>21. Other delegations expressed the view that while the implementation of Millennium 
Development Goal 8 was essential to the right to development, a broader scope of that right 
should be borne in mind. A number of delegations expressed the view that given the limited time 
remaining in phase III of its workplan, the task force should focus on the partnerships previously 
selected for evaluation, noting that the mandate of the task force was to take stock of the 
experiences of selected partnerships in order to refine and finalize the criteria and sub-criteria, 
rather than contributing to improvement of the partnerships. 
</p>
<p>22. Several delegations questioned the need to continue a dialogue with previously assessed 
partnerships, raising the issue of its added value and inputs for the refinement of the criteria. 
Dialogue should be limited to the partnerships planned for phase III. In that context, several 
delegations disagreed with the proposed technical mission to the African Peer Review 
Mechanism and the assessment of the Caribbean Forum of African, Caribbean and Pacific 
States-European Community Economic Partnership Agreement (CARIFORUM EPA) and other 
economic partnership agreements under the Cotonou Agreement. 
</p>
<p>23. Clarifications were also sought on the recommendations made by the task force with 
regard to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Development Agenda and the 
Clean Development Mechanism. The task force was not expected to provide input to the WIPO 
Development Agenda or a related conference organized by WIPO, while a dialogue would be 
useful for the refinement of the criteria. A delegation explained that the objective of the WIPO 
Development Agenda was mainstreaming development into intellectual property issues; it was 
therefore not limited to transfer of technology. The representative of WIPO welcomed the 
attendance of the task force at the Conference on Intellectual Property and Public Policy Issues 
to be held on 13 and 14 July 2009. 
</p>
<p>24. The Chairperson of the task force characterized the pilot application of the criteria to the 
partnerships as a means of improving the criteria as requested in Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 2005/4, as well as of integrating the right to development into the thematic areas of 
Millennium Development Goal 8. In that context, reference was made to his recent dialogue with 
the secretariat of the World Health Organization Intergovernmental Working Group on Public 
Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property, which demonstrated the value of the criteria. With 
reference to General Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions calling for the effective 
implementation of the right to development through mainstreaming the right into policies and 
programmes of international development, trade and financial institutions, the Chairperson also 
highlighted the values of a dialogue with partnerships based upon the criteria in identifying entry 
points for successful operationalization of the right to development.</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>25. With respect to the Intergovernmental Working Group on Public Health, Innovation and 
Intellectual Property, a delegation emphasized the importance of the Global Strategy and Plan of 
Action, urging the task force to synthesize into the criteria the affordability and access 
dimensions of health care and medicines, as well as flexibilities envisaged in the Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement. A civil society representative underlined the 
importance of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples for the 
realization of their right to development, including for the protection of indigenous knowledge. 
</p>
<p>26. In relation to the recommendation of the task force relating to a dialogue with 
MERCOSUR, the representative of Paraguay, speaking on behalf of MERCOSUR and 
associated States, informed the Working Group that the issue had been discussed at the last 
meeting of high officials responsible for human rights and ministries of foreign affairs, and a 
response to the invitation would be communicated to the task force as soon as an official position 
had been received from the capitals. 
</p>
<p>27. With reference to the issue of debt relief, some delegations proposed that the task force 
should interact with the independent expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related 
international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, 
particularly economic, social and cultural rights, the independent expert on the question of 
human rights and extreme poverty and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises with a view to 
reviewing the impact of debt burdens and related issues on the right to development. 
</p>
<p>28. The Chairperson of the task force made a presentation on a informal chart he had prepared 
at the request of various delegations showing the linkages between each of the revised criteria, 
the relevant article of the Declaration, the previously endorsed criterion and the specific 
development partnerships which had been assessed from the perspective of the right to 
development and had contributed to the development or refinement of the criterion concerned. 
Also at the request of delegations, the Chairperson distributed informal lists of illustrative 
sub-criteria accompanying the revised criteria which had resulted from the work undertaken by a 
consultant to the task force, as well as from the expert meeting on methodological issues relating 
to the measurement of compliance with the right to development. It was noted that those lists 
were not considered by the task force as sufficiently developed to be shared with the 
Working Group but were distributed as a non-paper with the sole objective of providing some 
idea on the nature of the sub-criteria to be developed by the task force. Such lists were not 
discussed nor officially considered by delegations. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Right-to-development criteria 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Chairperson of the task force explained how the task force had approached the 
elaboration of criteria and operational sub-criteria or indicators for the implementation of the 
right to development. The methodology used in the formulation of criteria had evolved in light of 
the evaluation of partnerships the task force had examined. However, the primary sources of the 
interim draft list of criteria (as listed in annex IV to the task force report) were the Declaration on 
the Right to Development and the criteria as endorsed by the Working Group in 2006. The task 
force also considered as secondary sources the commissioned expert studies and 
recommendations of an expert meeting on methodological issues held in January 2009.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>30. The Chairperson further explained the basic approach to refining the criteria according to 
the principle that they should reflect distinct attributes that represented an exhaustive reading of 
the normative content of the right to development. Thus, the criteria were arranged around the 
components of comprehensive human-centred development, an enabling environment, and social 
justice and equity. The sub-criteria would provide indicators and benchmarks for measuring the 
extent to which relevant stakeholders had addressed the concerns of each criterion. While the 
task force had decided not to share draft sub-criteria until the criteria had been finalized and the 
formulation of quantitative and qualitative tools of measurement had been developed with the aid 
of professionals in the relevant fields, some examples were provided at the request of 
delegations. 
</p>
<p>31. The representatives of the Czech Republic (on behalf of the European Union), the 
United States, the Netherlands, Brazil, Cuba (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement), 
Bangladesh, Argentina, Paraguay, Ecuador, South Africa, the Philippines, Mexico, Germany, 
India, Canada, the United Kingdom, Pakistan and Senegal expressed their views on the 
refinement process undertaken by the task force. Some expressed concern that the criteria placed 
too much emphasis on a human rights-based approach to development at the national level and 
that not enough attention was given to international cooperation, market access for developing 
countries, debt relief and non-imposition of conditionalities. For those countries, implementing 
the right to development did not mean mainstreaming human rights in the development process, 
but mainstreaming development throughout the developing world in order to allow States to have 
the necessary resources to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights by all; that should be the 
approach to follow in the elaboration of the criteria. In their view, critical issues such as poverty, 
lack of human and financial resources and access to technology, hunger, poor health, low levels 
of education, inadequate housing and unemployment were essential to the right to development 
and should be reflected in more balanced criteria. For others, the rights of individuals to develop 
their potential were paramount to the realization of the right to development, which should not 
be addressed as a collective right of States. For those countries, the criteria dealing with good 
governance, non-discrimination, participation, transparency and the rule of law were vital. 
</p>
<p>32. Several delegates addressed the significance of the root causes of conflict, conditions for 
sustainable and durable peace, the fight against poverty, social exclusion, promotion of 
employment, income for all and social safety nets in the criteria. One delegation explained how it 
had restructured its external debt and obtained debt relief and suggested that the task force 
should draw on the work of relevant special procedures. For another delegate, not all types of 
debt of developing countries were unsustainable, and debt relief alone could not ensure the 
realization of the right to development. Another addressed issues of access to medicines and 
technology transfer, which should include a role for the private sector and private-public 
partnerships. There were other vehicles for development beyond mandatory technology transfer. 
</p>
<p>33. Among the other matters raised by delegates was the need to take into account different 
conditions prevailing in countries, the negative effects of the financial crisis on the ability of 
developing countries to realize this right, and the challenge of climate change to the right to 
development, all of which should be reflected in the criteria and sub-criteria. 
</p>
<p>34. Notwithstanding the differences in emphasis, there was general support for the approach of 
the task force to reflect both the national and international dimensions of the right to 
development in elaborating the criteria and to apply a holistic approach to human rights in the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>refinement of the criteria. There was also general support for the three components of the right to 
development reflected in the criteria, with particularly strong support for the attribute relating to 
social justice and equity. Some delegates attached more importance to the comprehensive 
approach to development component and others to the enabling environment element. 
</p>
<p>35. As regards coherence and pertinence of the criteria, several delegates expressed views and 
offered suggestions on specific criteria. Some concern was expressed about the very ambitious 
nature of some criteria and whether corresponding sub-criteria could be designed for those 
criteria. Some suggested that the criteria should be streamlined and duplication avoided, while 
others considered that one of the components should contain more criteria than the current 
preliminary draft. Numerous suggestions were made regarding specific criteria, which were 
noted and would be used by the task force in the next phase of its work. 
</p>
<p>36. As regards the sub-criteria, it was noted that the work of the task force needed to be 
balanced and carefully carried out. Some delegations were of the opinion that the Working 
Group might wish to extend the mandate of the task force beyond 2010 to allow it to finalize its 
work on sub-criteria; others considered that the extension of the mandate was not for discussion 
during the present session, and questioned attempts by some to undermine the independence of 
the task force in the formulation of its recommendations and prejudge the outcome of its work. 
</p><p>37. Wrapping up, the Chairperson of the task force stated that the views of delegates would be 
fully taken into account in the process of refinement of criteria and elaboration of corresponding 
sub-criteria. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>38. On the basis of the discussions in the Working Group, the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
prepared and circulated a draft text for the conclusions and recommendations of the Working 
Group at its tenth session. The draft text was subsequently discussed, negotiated and amended by 
delegations. At its final meeting, on 26 June 2009, the Working Group adopted, by consensus, its 
conclusions and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. After the adoption of the conclusions and recommendations, the representative of Cuba (on 
behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement) explained its position that: (a) the reference to the 
relevant provisions of Human Rights Council resolution 9/3 (para. 45) refers to those leading to 
the adoption of an international legal standard of a binding nature, which in the view of the 
Non-Aligned Movement, constitutes a convention; (b) &#8220;being mindful of the need to ensure 
efficient use of budgeted resources&#8221; (para. 46) does not imply any constraints or conditionalities 
on the work of the task force; (c) &#8220;procedures&#8221; (para. 46 (c)) relate to the special procedures of 
the Human Rights Council, in particular the independent expert on the question of human rights 
and extreme poverty and the independent expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related 
international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly 
economic, social and cultural rights; and (d) in relation to paragraph 46 (d), the Movement looks 
forward to the task force providing criteria related to hunger, poverty, unemployment and 
financial assistance to developing countries. The representative of the Czech Republic (on behalf </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of the European Union) explained its understanding of paragraph 44 as its expectation that the 
task force at its next session would provide suggestions on further work, including possible 
further prolongation of its mandate; and that the activities of the task force under 
paragraph 46 (e) should be undertaken within the framework of the existing criteria. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>40. <b>The Working Group expresses its appreciation to the high-level task force on the 
implementation of the right to development, as defined in the Declaration on the Right to 
Development, for the work it has carried out in accordance with its mandate. The Working 
Group takes note of the report of the high-level task force and of its observations regarding 
the development partnerships considered at its fifth session, as well as the interim draft 
version of the criteria, submitted as work in progress. 
</b></p>
<p>41. <b>The Working Group notes the contribution that the application of the criteria 
through dialogue with the institutions responsible for the identified partnerships has made 
to the improvement of the criteria and to promoting the implementation of the right to 
development. 
</b></p>
<p>42. <b>The Working Group agrees that, in accordance with its workplan endorsed in 
Human Rights Council resolution 9/3, in phase III (2009), the task force should focus on 
consolidating its findings and presenting a revised list of right-to-development criteria 
along with corresponding operational sub-criteria. The task force should continue its study 
of the ongoing development partnerships on the thematic issues of technology transfer and 
debt relief with a view to further refinement of the criteria. The task force should also 
ensure that due attention is given to other issues relevant to the right to development, 
including, inter alia, poverty and hunger, including in the context of climate change and the 
current global economic and financial crisis.</b> 
</p>
<p>43. <b>The Working Group agrees that the scope of the criteria should go beyond 
Millennium Development Goal 8 and aim at the implementation of the right to 
development, taking into account the evolving priorities of the international community.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>The Working Group recommends that the task force on the implementation of the 
right to development focus on consolidating its findings and presenting a revised list of 
right-to-development criteria along with corresponding operational sub-criteria and 
outline suggestions for further work, including aspects of international cooperation not 
covered until then, for the consideration of the Working Group at its eleventh session. 
</b></p>
<p>45.<b> The revised criteria and sub-criteria should address the essential features of the right 
to development, as defined in the Declaration on the Right to Development, in a 
comprehensive and coherent way, including priority concerns of the international 
community beyond those enumerated in Millennium Development Goal 8, and serve the 
purposes set out in all relevant provisions of Human Rights Council resolution 9/3. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>46.<b> In further refining the list of criteria and preparing the corresponding operational 
sub-criteria, the Working Group recommends that the task force, being mindful of the 
need to ensure efficient use of budgeted resources, undertake the following activities: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) It should draw on specialized expertise, including from academic and research 
institutions and relevant United Nations agencies and other relevant global organizations 
and the experience of countries in relation to the promotion of the realization of the right to 
development. It should also give due attention to the experience gained from the 
application of the provisional criteria to development partnerships and to the views 
expressed by Member States; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Regarding target 8.E on access to essential medicines and 8.F on technology 
transfer of the Millennium Development Goals, the task force should draw on its dialogue 
with the Intergovernmental Working Group on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual 
Property, the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the Special 
Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) In order to address the concerns of targets 8.B and 8.D on debt relief, the task 
force should devote time during its next session to an examination, from the perspective of 
the right to development, of the experience of the institutions responsible for the Heavily 
Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, and other 
institutions and procedures that address the issue of debt relief; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Taking into account the importance of the fight against poverty, hunger and 
unemployment and the continued need for financial assistance to developing countries, the 
task force should draw on the expertise and lessons learned from relevant international 
institutions, including the Bretton Woods institutions, from the manner in which ongoing 
development initiatives are working in that regard;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) In relation to target 8.F on technology transfer, the task force should:  
(i) Attend the Conference on Intellectual Property and Public Policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>organized by the World Intellectual Property Organization in Geneva in 
July 2009, and hold consultations to gather information on the 
Development Agenda of WIPO in relation to the realization of the right to 
development;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Continue to draw on the necessary expertise from examining the Clean 
Development Mechanism, including in connection with mitigation of and 
adaptation to climate change, from the perspective of the right to 
development and, subject to an invitation, attend the Climate Change 
Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009.  </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>47.<b> Finally, in view of their essential role and valuable contribution, the Working Group 
urges the institutional members of the task force representing international financial and 
development institutions, including the World Bank, the United Nations Development 
Programme, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Conference on Trade 
and Development, the World Trade Organization and the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization, as well as the World Health Organization and other 
relevant specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations, to participate 
actively in the work of the task force.

<p>48.<b> The Working Group appreciates the support rendered by OHCHR to the Working 
Group and the high-level task force and requests that it continue to provide all necessary 
assistance to these bodies in implementing the activities mentioned above. </b></p>
