<p> II. Organization of the session .....................................................................................  15&#8211;<footnote name="2">6. Pakistan, on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), stated that 
realizing the right to development was crucial to the realization of all other human rights, 
including in the industrialized world, and called for collective responsibility of all human 
beings. Realization of the right to development required political commitment and 
resources. Sustainable development demanded efforts at the national level, which should be 
supported at the international level through collective efforts. The goal of sustainable 
development must become a reality on the ground. The Working Group should proceed to 
the second reading, and extension of its meeting time should be considered. </footnote>3 5

<p> III. Summary of proceedings ........................................................................................  24&#8211;<footnote name="81">. EU, supported by the United States and Switzerland, explained that it was not 
prepared to begin a second reading before resolving some critical divergences, such as on 
measurability, the road map, additional meeting time and the participation of all non-
governmental organizations whether or not they were in consultative status with the 
Economic and Social Council, in order to ensure that the second reading would be 
productive. EU underscored that the participation of United Nations agencies and 
international organizations, with only 3 participating at the session of the 11 that had 
confirmed that they would participate, should also be addressed. EU, the United States and 
Switzerland were of the view that the issue of meeting time should be resolved at the 
Human Rights Council session in September 2014. On the participation of NGOs, the </footnote> 7

<p>  A. General statements..........................................................................................  24&#8211;<footnote name="4">7. The China NGO Network for International Exchanges stated that the criteria and 
subcriteria represented a historic milestone on the right to development. In the pursuit of 
sustainable development, it was necessary to look at the right to development, rights-based 
development and the human rights-based approach; and national and international 
obligations. States were not denied rights under the right to development, the biggest 
obstacle to which was the unequal world order. The right to development supported all 
countries to have equal opportunities for development. In the spirit of the Declaration on 
the Right to Development, that right promoted global justice. It supported the solution of 
problems of poverty, North-South inequality, inequality in financial systems and an unequal 
international and social order. The right to development encompassed all human rights, but 
was not limited to the sum total of all human rights in the two International Covenants;  
rather, it built on them and added further value to them. Human rights provided for 
protection at the national level, while the right to development needed to be implemented 
first at the international level. While States had the primary responsibility at the national 
level, the right to development required differentiated standards and responsibilities at the 
international level. It called for greater inclusiveness and participation in global 
governance, and required addressing not only outcomes, but also policies. The proposed 
indicators were mostly national rather than international, and more indicators were needed 
for the global level. The right to development required an institutional guarantee and was 
not about international charity. National and international obligations must be given more 
content, and a regional dimension should also be included. </footnote>8 7

</p>
<p>  C. Submissions of groups of States, States, regional groups  
and other stakeholders ....................................................................................  67&#8211;<footnote name="74">. One submission pointed out that the draft right to development criteria and 
operational subcriteria did not clearly clarify the core elements and principles of the right to 
development and the responsibilities which the international community, especially 
developed countries, should assume to implement that right. It suggested revising the draft 
criteria and subcriteria to strike a balance between &#8220;human rights-based development&#8221; and 
&#8220;the right to development&#8221;; between &#8220;development as a human right&#8221; and &#8220;human rights as 
development&#8221;; and between international responsibility and domestic responsibility. The 
submission contained several concrete proposals for revising the draft subcriteria, 
formulating new subcriteria, and revising and/or proposing indicators. While underlining 
that further studies and new international legal instruments were needed, such as a 
convention on the right to development, the suggestion was made that guidelines should be 
elaborated for implementing the Declaration on the Right to Development. It was necessary 
to distinguish between the right to development and human rights-based development and 
human rights. It was pointed out that the right to development emphasized fair and equal 
opportunities for development among subjects at different stages of development, with the </footnote> 15

including consideration, revision and refinement of the right  
to development criteria and operational subcriteria........................................  75&#8211;<footnote name="8">0. After concluding its consideration of the operational subcriteria, the Working Group 
considered agenda item 4 (d), &#8220;Other matters&#8221;. NAM acknowledged that although progress 
had been made in completing the first reading, much remained to be done to overcome 
challenges and to narrow down divergences in a constructive and non-distractive way, 
which required a number of measures to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the 
Working Group. Those measures included: extending the Working Group&#8217;s meeting time to 
two separate weeks annually; development by the Chair-Rapporteur of a road map; scaling 
up of the Chair-Rapporteur&#8217;s informal and formal contacts; enhancing the mainstreaming of 
the right to development in United Nations agencies and other international organizations, 
as mandated by pertinent resolutions of the Human Rights Council and the United Nations 
General Assembly; and limiting the participation of NGOs to those in consultative status 
with the Economic and Social Council. NAM argued that additional meeting time was 
needed to expedite the work of the Working Group. Nothing prevented the Working Group 
from making a recommendation to that effect to the Human Rights Council for 
endorsement at its twenty-seventh session. NAM further explained that it was not against 
indicators, but was of the view that they should not be copied from the task force report and 
pasted under subcriteria. India recognized that some useful contributions had been made 
during the first reading, but expressed its reservations on including new issues like the right 
to peace, self-determination, and business and human rights. It supported the proposals of 
NAM and added that two annual meetings of 10 days would be required. India also 
observed that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should not be renegotiated 
through the work on the right to development. Pakistan expressed regret that the realization 
of the right to development was lagging far behind and continued to face obstacles in 
moving forward. It expressed the need to commence the second reading and to find 
alternatives for consensus building.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The open-ended Working Group on the Right to Development was established 
pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/72, endorsed by the Economic 
and Social Council in its decision 1998/269, initially for a period of three years, to meet for 
a period of five working days each year, with a mandate to monitor and review progress 
made in the promotion and implementation of the right to development, as elaborated in the 
Declaration on the Right to Development, at the national and international levels, providing 
recommendations thereon and further analysing obstacles to its full enjoyment, focusing 
each year on specific commitments in the Declaration; to review reports and any other 
information submitted by States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on the relationship between 
their activities and the right to development; and to present for the consideration of the 
Commission on Human Rights a sessional report on its deliberations, including advice to 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) with 
regard to the implementation of the right to development, and suggesting possible 
programmes of technical assistance at the request of interested countries with the aim of 
promoting the implementation of the right to development. The Commission also decided 
that an independent expert should be appointed by its Chairman, initially for a period of 
three years, with a mandate to present to the Working Group at each of its sessions a study 
on the current state of progress in the implementation of the right to development, taking 
into account, inter alia, the deliberations and suggestions of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 2000/5, the Commission on Human Rights welcomed the consensus 
reached between all parties on the need for the Working Group to convene in two sessions, 
of five days each, before the fifty-seventh session of the Commission.  
</p>
<p>3. In view of the urgent need to make further progress towards the realization of the 
right to development as elaborated in the Declaration on the Right to Development, the 
Commission, in its resolution 2001/9, decided to extend the mandate of the Working Group 
for one year and the mandate of the independent expert for three years.  
</p>
<p>4. In resolution 2002/69, the Commission on Human Rights emphasized the 
international economic and financial issues that deserved particular attention by the 
Working Group, and decided to extend its mandate by one year to continue important 
deliberations and deepening dialogue on the operationalization of the right to development.  
</p>
<p>5. In resolution 2003/83, the Commission on Human Rights decided to renew the 
mandate of the Working Group for one year and to convene it, for a period of 10 working 
days, to consider the report of the independent expert on the right to development as well as 
the outcome of a two-day high-level seminar on effective strategies for mainstreaming the 
right to development in the policies and operational activities of the major international 
organizations/institutions, to be organized by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights within the 10 working days allocated to the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>6. In resolution 2004/7, the Commission decided to renew the mandate of the Working 
Group for one year, to meet for 10 working days. It also endorsed the recommendation of 
the Working Group at its fifth session to establish, for an initial period of one year, a high-
level task force on the implementation of the right to development, within the framework of 
the Working Group and in accordance with the terms of reference defined by it, to assist it 
in fulfilling its mandate as contained in paragraph 10 (a) of Commission resolution 
1998/72, and to allocate to the task force 5 of the 10 working days allocated to the Working 
Group. <b> </b></p>


<p>7. In resolution 2005/4, the Commission decided to renew the mandate of the Working 
Group for one year and to convene it for a period of 10 working days, 5 of them to be 
allocated to a second meeting of the high-level task force. It endorsed the recommendation 
of the Working Group at its sixth session to extend the mandate of the high-level task force 
for a further period of one year to examine Millennium Development Goal 8, on global 
partnership for development, and suggest criteria for its periodic evaluation, with the aim of 
improving the effectiveness of global partnerships with regard to the realization of the right 
to development.  
</p>
<p>8. In its resolution 1/4, the Human Rights Council endorsed the conclusions and 
recommendations of the Working Group at its seventh session, inter alia to renew the 
mandate of the high-level task force for a further period of one year to enable it to apply the 
criteria enumerated in its report, on a pilot basis, to selected partnerships, with a view to 
operationalizing and progressively developing those criteria. The Council also decided to 
renew the mandate of the Working Group for a period of one year, to meet for a period of 
five working days to consider the findings and recommendations of the task force and 
further initiatives in accordance with its mandate, and requested the high-level task force to 
meet for a period of five working days.  
</p>
<p>9. In resolution 4/4, the Human Rights Council endorsed the road map outlined in 
paragraphs 52 to 54 of the Working Group&#8217;s report on its eighth session, including a 
request to the high-level task force to consolidate its findings and present a revised list of 
right to development criteria along with corresponding operational subcriteria and outline 
suggestions for further work, including aspects of international cooperation not covered 
until then. The Council decided that the criteria, as endorsed by the Working Group, should 
be used, as appropriate, in the elaboration of a comprehensive and coherent set of standards 
for the implementation of the right to development, and that, upon completion of the above 
phases, the Working Group should take appropriate steps to ensure respect for and the 
practical application of those standards, which could take various forms, including 
guidelines on the implementation of the right to development, and evolve into a basis for 
consideration of an international legal standard of a binding nature, through a collaborative 
process of engagement. In the same resolution, the Council also decided to renew the 
Working Group&#8217;s mandate for a period of two years, to convene in annual sessions of five 
working days, and to renew the mandate of the high-level task force for a period of two 
years, to convene in annual sessions of seven working days. 
</p>
<p>10. In resolution 9/3 and in successive resolutions,1 most recently resolution 24/4, the 
Human Rights Council reiterated the tasks entrusted to the Working Group in resolution 
4/4, the purposes set out therein for which the criteria would serve once considered, revised 
and endorsed by the Working Group, and the steps to be taken by the Working Group upon 
completion. In resolution 9/3, the Council decided to renew the mandate of the Working 
Group until it had completed those tasks, and that it should convene annual sessions of five 
working days. The Council also decided to renew the mandate of the high-level task force 
until the eleventh session of the Working Group, in 2010, and that the task force would 
convene annual sessions of seven working days.  
</p>
<p>11. In resolution 12/23, the Human Rights Council tasked the Working Group to 
consider, revise and endorse the right to development criteria and corresponding 
operational subcriteria.  
</p>
<p>12. In resolution 21/32, the Human Rights Council welcomed the launching in the 
Working Group of the process of considering, revising and refining the draft right to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>development criteria and corresponding operational subcriteria, with the first reading of the 
draft criteria; acknowledged the need to further consider, revise and refine them; endorsed 
the recommendation of the Working Group that it pursue, at its fourteenth session, 
consideration of the draft operational subcriteria; decided to convene a two-day informal 
inter-sessional intergovernmental meeting of the Working Group with the participation of 
States, groups of States and relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes and 
institutions, as well as other multilateral institutions and forums, international organizations 
and relevant stakeholders, with a view to improve its effectiveness at its fourteenth session; 
and decided to consider the extension of the meeting time of the Working Group, as 
appropriate. 
</p>
<p>13. In resolution 24/4, the Human Rights Council endorsed the recommendation of the 
Working Group that it continue, at its fifteenth session, work on the consideration of the 
draft operational subcriteria with the first reading of the remaining operational subcriteria. 
The Council also decided to convene a two-day informal inter-sessional intergovernmental 
meeting of the Working Group with a view to improve its effectiveness at its fifteenth 
session, and reiterated its decision to consider the extension of the meeting time of the 
Working Group, as appropriate. 
</p>
<p>14. The Working Group accordingly held a two-day informal inter-sessional meeting on 
3 and 4 April 2014, and convened its fifteenth session in Geneva from 12 to 16 May 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the session 
</b>15. In her opening statement,<footnote name="2">The full text of the High Commissioner&#8217;s statement is available from 
 
 www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Development/Pages/15thSession.aspx. </footnote> the High Commissioner for Human Rights underscored 
the progress made in the recognition of the transformative potential of the right to 
development. It was now widely acknowledged that the right to development could 
contribute to a new paradigm for sustainable and equitable social justice built on the firm 
normative foundations of human rights. The High Commissioner recalled that it was 
mandatory to meet the needs of future generations, so that they could enjoy rights and 
economic opportunities in conditions of dignity and sustainability. She called upon the 
Working Group to guide the international community with a view to positioning the right to 
development in the post-2015 development agenda. The parameters of the right to 
development could inform the global debate on creating development that freed all human 
beings from fear and from want. Procedurally and substantially, the post-2015 development 
agenda must have the right to development at its core. The new development agenda&#8217;s 
goals, targets and indicators must explicitly align the development framework with human 
rights, including the right to development. Furthermore, the new development agenda must 
include a strong accountability framework that clearly identified the holders of rights and 
those responsible for fulfilling rights. It must also define mechanisms at all levels to ensure 
that relevant institutions were answerable for meeting their responsibilities, and were 
subject to enforceability where they did not deliver. Every human person and all peoples 
were entitled to a development process in which all human rights could be fully realized. 
That recognition was at the core of the human rights-based approach to development, and 
the responsibility for such development should be expanded to include actors in the private 
sector, notably large and transnational corporations.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>16. At its first meeting, on 12 May 2014, the Working Group re-elected by acclamation 
Tamara Kunanayakam (Sri Lanka) as Chair-Rapporteur. In her opening statement,<footnote name="3">8. The United States of America asserted that the right to development must be 
unifying rather than divisive and expressed its willingness to engage constructively in the 
Working Group. It expressed the need for a shared consensus on the definition and nature 
of the right to development and welcomed the participation of experts, civil society and </footnote> the 
Chair-Rapporteur reported on activities since the previous session of the Working Group, 
namely the informal consultations and the informal inter-sessional meeting. In addition, she 
reported on the results of her interactive dialogue at the twenty-fourth session of the Human 
Rights Council and at the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly<b>.</b> During its previous 
two sessions, the Working Group had completed the first reading of the criteria and the first 
part of the operational subcriteria, aided by the submission of detailed views and comments. 
It had also been assisted by the active participation of United Nations funds and 
programmes, NGOs and indigenous peoples&#8217; groups. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Chair-Rapporteur reminded the Working Group that the first reading of the draft 
operational subcriteria was part of a broader and longer-term process. She recalled Human 
Rights Council resolution 24/4, in which the Council had decided that, once considered, 
revised and endorsed by the Working Group, the criteria and corresponding operational 
subcriteria should be used, as appropriate, in the elaboration of a comprehensive and 
coherent set of standards for the implementation of the right to development, and that the 
Working Group should take appropriate steps to ensure the practical application of the 
standards, which could take various forms, including guidelines on the implementation of 
the right to development, and evolve into a basis for consideration of an international legal 
standard of a binding nature through a collaborative process of engagement. 
</p>
<p>18. Several proposals had emerged from the inter-sessional meetings on improving the 
effectiveness of the fifteenth session, and they remained on the table. She expressed the 
hope that, following past tradition, the Group&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations would be 
adopted by consensus. 
</p>
<p>19. The Chair-Rapporteur drew attention to the context in which the fifteenth session 
was being held. The International Year of Small Island Developing States was a reminder 
of the gravity of the current global crisis, its multidimensional and systemic character and 
the urgent need for collective action when those States were facing unprecedented 
challenges in achieving development, with climate change threatening their very existence,. 
Rising inequalities, within and between countries, unequally affecting those more closely 
integrated in the global market and less resilient to external influences, along with 
intensifying exploitation and social injustice, posed a threat to international peace and 
security, as well as to the ability of the planet to sustain life. There was increasing 
recognition that inequality was a key issue that had been neglected in the Millennium 
Development Goals.  
</p>
<p>20. The post-2015 process provided an opportunity for the Working Group to contribute 
actively to shaping the development agenda. With the mandate to promote a vision of 
development based on the principles of equality, non-discrimination, social justice, 
participation and solidarity at national and international levels, and international 
cooperation, and also to mainstream the right to development in the United Nations system, 
the Working Group was in a privileged position to contribute significantly to advancing the 
framework for an alternative vision of society, based on values and principles, and in 
harmony with the environment, so that life with dignity became a reality for all without 
discrimination, for present and future generations. 
</p>
<p>21. She expressed the hope that the fifteenth anniversary of the Working Group would 
provide inspiration to move forward with the sense of urgency that the current global 
</p>

<p>situation demanded, to confront and eliminate the obstacles standing in the way of 
development, to translate commitments into concrete action and to create the conditions for 
the enjoyment of the inalienable right to development for all peoples, everywhere.  
22. At its first meeting, the Working Group adopted the agenda (see annex I) and 
programme of work of its fifteenth session.  
</p>
<p>23. During the session, the Working Group finalized the first reading of the remaining 
draft right to development operational subcriteria proposed by the high-level task force on 
the implementation of the right to development. It also proposed draft operational 
subcriteria for new draft criteria that were proposed during the Group&#8217;s thirteenth session. 
For that purpose, the Working Group had before it two conference room papers 
(A/HRC/WG.2/15/CRP.<footnote name="3">7. Switzerland believed the right to development could bring human rights and 
development closer together and was yet another means to promote all human rights. 
Indeed, while the full implementation of human rights for all was the ultimate goal of 
development and human rights should thus be used to measure the outcomes of 
development, governance principles and the rule of law were also paramount for shaping 
the process of development at the national and international levels. In that context, 
Switzerland reaffirmed the universality, indivisibility, interrelatedness, interdependence and 
mutually reinforcing nature of all civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, 
including the right to development; those human rights should be realized for all, without 
any discrimination. Concerning the post-2015 development agenda, respect for and the 
promotion of all human rights, including the right to development, and how to make them 
accountable and to whom were the key issue. Switzerland did not subscribe to the view that 
the Working Group should discuss the post-2015 development agenda at the current stage, 
since it did not want to prejudge the discussions going on in New York on that issue. But it 
would not oppose the Working Group discussing it at a later stage. Finally, the Working 
Group should complete at the current session the first reading of the draft right to 
development criteria and very operational subcriteria, in the absence of a meaningful 
discussion on the issue of indicators that was fundamental to Switzerland.

<p><b> III. Summary of proceedings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General statements 
</b></p>
<p>24. On behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM),<b> </b>the Islamic Republic of Iran<b> 
</b>stated that the right to development must be given the high profile it deserved. It<b> </b>expressed<b> 
</b>serious<b> </b>concern that, despite longstanding efforts, progress had been slow and obstacles to 
realizing the right to development still persisted. The challenges were becoming more 
complex and it was now more than ever necessary to make the right to development a 
reality for all. The United Nations system organizations, including in the areas of finance 
and trade, must be involved and all relevant bodies should be engaged in mainstreaming the 
right to development into their objectives, policies and programmes. NAM stressed its 
unwavering commitment to the right to development, an individual and collective right 
involving individual, national and international responsibilities, and requiring a balance 
between national and international responsibilities. All human rights were interdependent 
and mutually reinforcing. The Working Group must continue the first reading of the criteria 
and subcriteria and proceed to the second reading. Once adopted, they would be 
comprehensive and coherent standards, providing a basis for international legal standards of 
a binding nature. They would enable implementation of the Declaration on the Right to 
Development. The ultimate goal of that process was the implementation of the right to 
development for all human beings.  
</p>
<p>25. The European Union (EU) expressed its strong commitment to sustainable 
development, the eradication of poverty and equitable globalization. It reiterated its support 
for the right to development, on the basis of the<b> </b>indivisibility and interdependence of all 
human rights and the multidimensional nature of development strategies. While national 
development efforts must be supported, States had primary responsibility for the realization 
of the right to development by their citizens. The ambitious programme of work of the 
Working Group was attainable and EU was willing to pursue a consensual approach to rise 
above polarization and focus on what united rather than what divided. 
</p>

<p>27. Speaking on behalf of the African Group and aligning itself with NAM, Ethiopia 
affirmed the great importance attached to the right to development, also enshrined in the 
African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. While States had the primary responsibility 
for realizing the right to development, there was an urgent need for a just and enabling 
international economic order and a responsive and accountable global financial 
architecture. States should have the necessary policy space to determine policies suited to 
their specific conditions. Ethiopia stressed that the right to development must be included in 
the post-2015 development agenda and the necessary framework for international 
cooperation, and reiterated the call for a legally binding instrument to ensure the full 
implementation of the right to development.  
</p>
<p>28. Aligning itself with NAM, Sri Lanka stated that the right to development was about 
mainstreaming and implementing development-oriented policies at all levels, to improve 
the capacity of States to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights. The right to 
development was the basis for sustainable development, in all its three dimensions. 
Asserting that the eradication of poverty was the most urgent human rights goal, Sri Lanka 
called for greater focus on the special needs of developing countries and advocated the 
integration of youth participation in the post-2015 agenda.  
</p>
<p>29. Aligning itself with NAM, Cuba stated that the right to development was an 
inalienable right of individuals and peoples, and its achievement required international 
cooperation and the creation of a conducive international environment. The adverse 
consequences of the neo-liberal agenda posed obstacles to developing countries and also 
affected developed countries. Much could be achieved with a genuine will on the part of 
developed countries. For the people of Cuba, the main obstacle to enjoying the right to 
development was the unjustified economic embargo by the United States of America for 
over 50 years. Cuba rejected all attempts to redefine the right to development and to limit 
its international scope, including with regard to trade and financial institutions. 
</p>
<p>30. Sri Lanka reiterated that it was imperative that the Declaration on the Right to 
Development should be the basis for further consideration, revision and refinement of the 
criteria and subcriteria in order to achieve real progress, and that effective international 
cooperation was essential to address the international obstacles and create an international 
climate conducive to the realization of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>31. China expressed its support for NAM and remarked that the right to development 
required a development-based and human-centred approach and the establishment of a new 
international economic order which removed obstacles to development faced by developing 
countries. The commitment to the Millennium Development Goals must be honoured and 
the post-2015 agenda must put development at its heart. Developed countries must adopt 
responsible macroeconomic policies, and international development cooperation must 
respect the development paths of all countries, the diversity of development patterns and 
different levels of development. An open, interconnected world economy, a cooperative 
and mutually beneficial global partnership, and transfer of technology must be promoted 
and supported.  
</p>
<p>32. South Africa aligned itself with the African Group and NAM. It consistently 
advocated for the right to development, which presented a holistic, cohesive and integrated 
framework for advancing development and for achieving the Millennium Development 
Goals and all three dimensions of sustainable development. The eradication of poverty and 
hunger, and combating inequality must be at the centre of the global agenda and partnership 
for development, which must acknowledge different levels of development and uphold 
common but differentiated responsibilities. South Africa reiterated the need for reform and 
democratization of global institutions, including the Security Council and the Bretton 
Woods Institutions, and the need to ensure the accountability of transnational corporations. 
It expressed dismay at the slow pace of progress in the Working Group.  </p>


<p>33. Venezuela aligned itself with NAM and reiterated the sentiments expressed by 
Cuba. It reaffirmed that the post-2015 development agenda must fully integrate the right to 
development, which was essential to human rights. Unilateral coercive measures against 
developing countries hampered economic development and set aside international 
solidarity. The international community must create an enabling environment for the full 
enjoyment of all human rights. The prevailing economic system promoted climate change, 
including through the activities of transnational corporations. Lack of transfer of 
technology also compromised development. 
</p>
<p>34. Aligning itself with NAM and OIC, Malaysia asserted that the Working Group was 
a pillar for upholding the right to development. Differences in viewpoints were natural 
because of divergent approaches to development, differences in the economic, social and 
cultural particularities of countries and diversity in perspectives. Participation by all was 
important for a holistic process. While responsibilities lay primarily with States, 
international cooperation was essential for realizing the right to development. It was 
important to complete the task at hand in a spirit of constructive engagement, and that the 
meeting duration be increased to two weeks. 
</p>
<p>35. Indonesia, aligning itself with NAM and OIC, pledged its full commitment to the 
right to development, which encompassed all human rights. While States had the primary 
responsibility for realizing the right to development, international cooperation for the 
creation of an enabling environment was crucial. The right to development must be 
mainstreamed in all development processes throughout the United Nations system.  
</p>
<p>36. Morocco<b> </b>aligned itself with NAM, the African Group and OIC, and highlighted the 
importance of the Declaration on the Right to Development. The right to development 
could not be disassociated from other rights. It was a right of human beings, as well as of 
nations, and called for greater political commitment, through development cooperation and 
assistance. It was a priority in overcoming vulnerabilities and required the sharing of 
national and international responsibilities. Morocco shared concerns about the slow pace of 
progress on the mandate of the Working Group and called on Member States to be led by 
wisdom and to adopt a humanistic and consensual approach.  
</p>

<p>private actors. With regard to the process going forward, an empirical approach was a 
critical need and, in that context, some sort of measurable elements were necessary. That 
approach was not intended to rank and criticize States, but rather, as described by the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, to be a potential bridge between human rights and 
development. While the United States recognized that some delegations believed the high-
level task force was not mandated to produce indicators, operational subcriteria had been 
proposed by it and were referred to in Human Rights Council resolutions. The task force&#8217;s 
operational subcriteria included indicators. The United States was prepared to seek 
consensus through the incorporation of measurability into the subcriteria. With regard to 
substance, the focus needed to be on universal human rights, which individuals enjoyed and 
might demand from their own governments, including civil and political, as well as 
economic, social and cultural rights. International financial institutions had no human rights 
obligations and States had no human rights. Instead, States had human rights obligations 
towards their citizens. The United States emphasized the importance of focusing on factors 
that included non-discrimination by States, democracy, good governance and social 
protection policies, including such related aspects as labour organization, women&#8217;s rights, 
the prevention of violence against women and girls, and ways to protect, include and 
empower members of minority and vulnerable groups. Much development came from 
private sources and that fact warranted the Working Group&#8217;s consideration. 
</p>
<p>39. Speaking on behalf of OHCHR, the Chief of the Development and Economic and 
Social Issues Branch presented the work of the Office on the post-2015 development 
agenda. The Office was actively engaged in the Open Working Group on Sustainable 
Development Goals, and the Declaration on the Right to Development was central to 
OHCHR advocacy. The Working Group on the Right to Development was particularly 
relevant to the making of the new agenda and goals. The Millennium Development Goals 
left several gaps, including lack of accountability. The OHCHR approach was to integrate 
all human rights through research, advocacy and engagement with States, civil society and 
others. The High Commissioner was engaged in the process and, in an open letter to all 
Member States, had called for a new, universal and balanced development agenda, which 
upheld all human rights. She had emphasized the need to focus on equality, the right to 
development and the accountability of all actors. The Office gave technical support, 
including in a briefing paper dedicated to human rights and the right to development. 
OHCHR had stated that the current model of development was imbalanced and 
unsustainable and the global crises had exacerbated inequalities, both within and between 
countries. The focus on average statistics and aggregates was the main failing of the 
Millennium Development Goals. The new agenda must enable the measuring of outcomes 
and efforts, and disaggregation, and all targets and indicators must be aligned with human 
rights standards.  
</p>
<p>40. OHCHR had called for a new development agenda, which promoted and protected 
freedom from fear and want for all people without discrimination. Its central objective must 
be the eradication of extreme poverty. Inequalities should be a central concern, and the 
related but different notions of non-discrimination, equity and equality must be integrated 
and reflected across all the goals. Inequality must be disaggregated and dedicated targets 
and goals must be adopted for target groups. Attention should be paid to marginalized 
groups and those bearing unequal environmental burdens, such as small island developing 
States. The Declaration on the Right to Development placed people at the centre of 
development, called for an enabling environment and addressed both national and 
international constraints on development. Enhanced international cooperation and human 
rights-based policy coherence were needed to ensure that global rules and policies were 
consistent with human rights law. The new agenda must contain explicit provisions to 
remove obstacles to development, for instance in trade, investment and intellectual property 
systems, which undermined human rights. Meaningful reforms at the international level and </p>


<p>the democratization of institutions of global governance were essential. States must have 
the policy space to protect the human rights of their people and must be held accountable. 
Strong accountability mechanisms must be put in place and private actors must be held to 
account, including through due diligence, human rights impact assessments and the Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. The new goals must be universally applicable 
while taking into account different national realities. The right to development provided 
substance to article 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which called for a 
social and international order in which all human rights could be realized.  
</p>
<p>41. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) stated that climate change must be 
addressed and that the right to information and access to information were critical in 
relation to the environment and climate, and were also in line with the right to development. 
Some countries had acknowledged the importance of climate change in their constitutions. 
Scientific predictions and information must be factored into policies, and the sharing of 
information and access to data were essential. WMO facilitated free and unrestricted 
exchange of data for environmental protection. It was supporting an initiative for the 
recovery and collection of historical data from past colonial institutions for vulnerable 
countries. That was important for the assessment of long-term trends. WMO contributed to 
the fulfilment of human rights by supporting peoples&#8217; safety and security from weather, 
water and natural hazards. 
</p>
<p>42. The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund perceived a close linkage between the right to 
development<b> </b>and children&#8217;s rights and welcomed the focus on sustainable, human-centred, 
rights-based development and equity. Children were the basis for future generations. Their 
vulnerabilities were interdependent; addressing those vulnerabilities comprehensively was 
important for improving their lives. The reduction of inequalities, the protection of 
children&#8217;s rights, the strengthening of social services and the protection of women and 
children must be reflected in the efforts of the Working Group. There must be tangible 
results for the most excluded in society. That required data disaggregated by age, and data 
on all grounds of discrimination, including sex, age, race, ethnicity and income, relevant to 
countries and their contexts. The Working Group&#8217;s discussions must contribute to the post-
2015 process, as the right to development pointed in the same direction as the sustainable 
development goals of eradicating poverty, enhancing the sharing of resources and fostering 
intergenerational equity. 
</p>
<p>43. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) promoted and ensured access to 
the benefits of scientific progress, which was one of the attributes of the right to 
development. International and communications technology and broadband could enhance 
the quality of life, improve access to information and empower people to participate in local 
and national development and to exercise their rights. Referring to article 19 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ITU asserted that the digital divide must be 
bridged through improved awareness, access and inclusion of the most vulnerable. The 
digital revolution was also providing tools for poverty reduction, and information and 
communications technology could narrow the pervasive divides within countries, for 
instance between urban, rural and other populations, and between developed and 
developing countries. 
</p>
<p>44. Speaking on behalf of the Catholic-inspired Working Group for the Right to 
Development and International Solidarity, the Association Comunit&#224; Papa Giovanni XXIII 
appealed to Member States to overcome the political impasse in the Working Group and 
move from rhetoric to action. That group of non-governmental organizations had submitted 
three written contributions on the revision of criteria and operational subcriteria. It 
proposed the compilation of a report reflecting all comments on the first reading before 
proceeding to the second reading. Between the first and second readings, the group 
proposed a two-year phase of implementation to ensure the effectiveness of the criteria and </p>


<p>subcriteria. It suggested that experts be selected at the national level and tasked with 
making proposals on indicators. The Working Group must listen to the people whose lives 
depended on the implementation of the right to development. The collection of good 
practices and the involvement of national organizations could support its work. 
</p>
<p>45. The International Youth and Student Movement for the United Nations recalled that, 
in 1986, the overwhelming majority of Member States had supported the Declaration on the 
Right to Development. That right was necessary for the enjoyment of all other human rights 
and must eventually be embodied in a legally binding framework. The Movement 
expressed difficulty in understanding how some States continued to object to the substance 
of the right to development or a legally binding framework. It called on all to strongly 
commit themselves to the right to development. That was required by morality, as well as 
by law, as that right was part of customary international law. The Movement perceived a 
challenge in the discussion of measurability by States that had not all unambiguously 
agreed on the right to development. Every major human rights instrument had been created 
by first agreeing on a legal obligation and defining the core principles, and only then 
considering mechanisms to measure whether or not a right was being respected. Only if all 
parties agreed on the legal obligation could that measurement be discussed. It urged States 
to cooperate on the right to development and called on the Working Group to consider how 
it could contribute to the Open Working Group in defining the post-2015 development 
agenda and sustainable development goals. 
</p>
<p>46. Friedrich Ebert Stiftung asserted that the right to development belonged to 
individuals and peoples, and its<b> </b>implementation was crucial to the post-2015 development 
agenda. Implementation must take place at all levels, from local to global. Friedrich Ebert 
Stiftung suggested that, on completion of the first reading of the criteria and subcriteria, the 
Working Group should request the Human Rights Council to mandate its Advisory 
Committee to support work on measurement and monitoring, building on the work done in 
the Sub-Commission which had not received any follow-up. Expert advice could serve to 
unlock political debate and the work of the high-level task force could provide useful 
guidance. It was necessary to look at the options for the way forward and for the monitoring 
and measurability, as well as the legal standing, of the right to development.  
</p>

<p>48. The full text of general statements made available to the secretariat is posted on the 
OHCHR website (www.ohchr.org). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Inter-sessional meeting and informal consultations by the Chair 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Chair-Rapporteur reported4 on the informal inter-sessional meeting of the 
Working Group, which was held on 3 and 4 April 2014 in accordance with Human Rights 
Council resolution 24/4. She also reported on the informal consultations she had held with 
coordinators of regional and political groups, United Nations system organizations and 
intergovernmental bodies, as well as non-governmental organizations, in preparation for the 
informal inter-sessional meeting of the Working Group and its fifteenth session. 
</p>
<p>50. The main issue discussed was how to most effectively utilize the time should the 
Working Group complete the first reading of the criteria and operational subcriteria before 
the end of its fifteenth  session. Groups of States representing developing countries had 
proposed that, in line with its mandate to consider, revise and refine the draft right to 
development criteria and corresponding operational subcriteria, the Group should proceed 
with the second reading. Others stated that the measurability element must first be clarified.  
</p>
<p>51. Some concerns raised related to the overall orientation of the Working Group and 
whether the review exercise was expedient for elaborating a legally binding instrument, and 
in that context a broader discussion had been proposed on how best to achieve the ultimate 
goal. There had also been a suggestion that the Working Group should consider adopting a 
position on the right to development for incorporation in the post-2015 development 
agenda. 
</p>
<p>52. During consultations with NGOs, the importance of addressing the problem of 
unilateral coercive measures was underlined. Ways needed to be found to integrate youth 
concerns more concretely into the draft right to development criteria, and modalities 
established to enable indigenous peoples to participate in the work of the Working Group 
on an equal basis. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>53. With respect to the inter-sessional meeting, the Chair-Rapporteur reported that, at 
the outset of the meeting, she had underlined the need for the Group to bear in mind its 
larger mandate when carrying out the specific task entrusted to it for the fifteenth session. 
In its resolution 4/4 and in subsequent resolutions, the Human Rights Council had decided 
that, once considered, revised and endorsed, the criteria and subcriteria should be used, as 
appropriate, in the elaboration of a comprehensive and coherent set of right to development 
standards for the implementation of the right to development, and that the Working Group 
should take appropriate steps for ensuring respect for and the application of those standards, 
which could take various forms, including guidelines on the implementation of the right to 
development, and evolve into a basis for consideration of an international legal standard of 
a binding nature through a collaborative process of engagement. 
</p>
<p>54. The Working Group&#8217;s original mandate in Commission on Human Rights resolution 
1998/72 was to monitor progress on the implementation of the right to development, as 
elaborated in the Declaration on the Right to Development, at the national and international 
levels, provide recommendations and further analyse obstacles to its enjoyment. 
55. Several proposals had been made with a view to improving the effectiveness of work 
at the fifteenth session, but no agreement had been reached. Many developing country

 The Chair-Rapporteur&#8217;s oral report on the informal inter-sessional meeting of the Working Group is 
</p>
<p>available from www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Development/Pages/15thSession.aspx. </p>


<p>representatives had expressed concern that none of the NAM proposals had been accepted, 
and the Secretariat had been called upon to clarify the voting procedure. NAM had 
expressed the view that while consensus must be the aim, voting might become necessary 
if, despite all efforts, consensus could not be reached. 
</p>
<p>56. The Chair proceeded to summarize the various proposals made and the discussions 
on the proposals.  
</p>
<p>57. NAM had proposed that, after completion of the first reading and in line with the 
mandate to consider, revise and refine the draft right to development criteria and 
corresponding operational subcriteria with a view to their endorsement, the Group 
recommend to the Human Rights Council that it proceed to the second reading at its 
sixteenth session and, in that regard, flagged the need for more time to be allocated to the 
Working Group. 
</p>
<p>58. In that respect, EU, the United States and Switzerland had stated that the issue of 
measurability must be clarified before proceeding to the second reading and that it was too 
early to discuss the conclusions and recommendations of the Group&#8217;s fifteenth session.  
</p>
<p>59. NAM, Algeria, Cuba and Pakistan had asserted that the Working Group had no 
mandate to discuss indicators, that the high-level task force had gone beyond its mandate by 
proposing indicators and that in no case could a matter outside the mandate of the Working 
Group be used as a condition for the fulfilment of the mandate given to it by the Human 
Rights Council. Pakistan and Indonesia had suggested that the issue of measurability be 
considered simultaneously with the second reading. NGOs expressed the view that the 
question of measurability would arise only in the implementation phase and that, given the 
subjective character of the right to development, indicators must be determined by the 
people themselves at the local and national levels and be based on their specific needs and 
requirements. A collective of NGOs suggested proceeding with the second reading with a 
parallel debate on indicators, using input from a pilot project that would seek to apply the 
proposed criteria and subcriteria, and from an expert group set up for the purpose.  
</p>
<p>60. NAM, Egypt and Sri Lanka had proposed an exchange of ideas on integration of the 
right to development in the post-2015 development agenda. South Africa had underlined 
the importance of supporting a right to development approach as opposed to the human 
rights-based approach to development, which focused on civil and political rights 
</p>
<p>61. EU, Switzerland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the 
United States were of the view that the ongoing discussions on the post-2015 agenda should 
not be prejudged or the process duplicated, and that all human rights, not just the right to 
development, were crucial to the post-2015 development agenda. Algeria, Cuba, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and Tunisia, as well as the Association of World Citizens, had argued that 
many Human Rights Council resolutions already contained explicit language on the process 
and that the Working Group&#8217;s contributions, being more specific, would only complement 
the more general discussions and would be welcomed.  
</p>
<p>62. NAM had proposed that, while bearing in mind that completion of the first reading 
was the priority, a letter should be sent to relevant United Nations organizations and 
specialized agencies requesting them, when making their contributions, to relate their 
activities also to the post-2015 development agenda.  
</p>
<p>63. EU, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States had argued that United 
Nations organizations and specialized agencies should be free to decide on the content of 
their contributions. If a specific request was to be made to them, then it should also include 
a request to express their views on indicators. </p>


<p>64. Switzerland had proposed as a compromise that, in the letter, United Nations 
agencies should be invited to feel free to respond to questions that might be posed, 
including on integrating the right to development in the post-2015 development agenda.  
</p>
<p>65. Indonesia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka had been of the view that political will was 
lacking to join together internationally to implement the Declaration on the Right to 
Development and that, therefore, it was important to adopt a systemic approach that would 
permit discussion on the international system, on the need for an enabling environment and 
on identification of obstacles at the international level. 
</p>
<p>66. The Indian Council of South America had proposed establishing a process whereby 
indigenous peoples could participate in the work of the Working Group on an equal basis, 
taking into account their special status as peoples entitled to the exercise of the right to self-
determination. One NGO had proposed that a privileged place be accorded to the 
participation of young people in the work of the Working Group, given their importance in 
society and their special responsibility for the future of humanity. NGOs had called for the 
compilation of all the comments made during the review process on criteria and operational 
subcriteria. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Submissions of groups of States, States, regional groups  
and other stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 24/4, endorsed the recommendations 
adopted by the Working Group on the Right to Development at its fourteenth session, in 
which, inter alia, the Working Group requested OHCHR to make available on its website 
and to the Working Group at its fifteenth session, in the format of two conference room 
papers, all further submissions by Governments, groups of Governments and regional 
groups, as well as inputs by other stakeholders. The Chair-Rapporteur provided a summary 
of the submissions as follows.  
</p>
<p>68. In response to its letter dated 5 July 2013, the Secretariat received 4 submissions 
from groups of States (2 from NAM and 2 from EU), 33 from Member States, 10 from 
United Nations organizations, 4 from national human rights institutions (2 from the 
National Human Rights Commission of India and 1 each from the Independent Human 
Rights Commission of Afghanistan and the Advisory Council on Human Rights of 
Morocco), 1 from a United Nations treaty body (the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights), 4 joint submissions from NGOs (3 from Catholic-inspired NGOs and 1 
from an indigenous peoples&#8217; organization) and 12 individual submissions from civil society 
organizations and academics.<b> </b>Those submissions are in addition to comments made during 
the past three sessions. All the submissions have been posted in their original versions on 
the OHCHR website and have also been compiled in documents A/HRC/WG.2/15/CRP.3 
and 4. 
</p>
<p>69. The content and focus of the contributions varied, ranging from general statements 
to specific proposals. One submission expressed concern that the draft right to development 
criteria and operational subcriteria sought to redefine the right to development and were 
conceived of, with their focus on the national dimension, as a tool to monitor the actions of 
States. However, the main objective of the exercise should be the creation of the necessary 
basis for the elaboration of a legally binding instrument. The focus of the criteria must be 
on achieving the conditions for economic development and strengthening the ability of 
States to promote and protect all human rights. Underdevelopment was not an intrinsic 
property of one or several countries, but the result of colonization and looting. International 
responsibility and collective action should therefore focus on creating the conditions 
necessary for the full realization of the right to development.  </p>


<p>70. Another submission recommended specific indicators and reformulation of a 
subcriterion to reflect the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on development, 
and further indicators for measuring the elimination of sexual exploitation and human 
trafficking. One submission provided an overview of steps taken at the national level to 
ensure the realization of the right to development, steps taken in international cooperation 
and steps taken at the regional level, such as the drafting of a regional human development 
report focusing on the right to development.  
</p>
<p>71. A joint submission from civil society organizations emphasized the urgent need to 
fully implement the right to development to overcome structural obstacles at the 
international and national levels. The post-2015 development agenda should be aligned 
with the human rights-based approach and focus on the right to development. While 
indicators were necessary to monitor the implementation of the right to development, they 
should be determined after agreement had been reached on the criteria and subcriteria. 
Experts might be more competent and neutral in identifying indicators, while States should 
indicate specific national subparameters for responding to the needs of a specific 
population/country. The criteria and operational subcriteria should reflect all the articles of 
the Declaration on the Right to Development, including its preamble, as the principal 
source. The criteria and subcriteria must address structural imbalances and remove 
obstacles to the realization of an enabling international and national environment for 
implementing the right to development.  
</p>
<p>72. One contribution cautioned against further expanding the list of criteria and 
subcriteria. On attribute 2, &#8220;Participatory human rights processes,&#8221; it suggested that the 
relevance of constitution-building processes in the consolidation of the rule of law, and the 
role of electoral participation in the strengthening of democracy should be emphasized, and 
the participation of women, youth and ethnic minorities in those processes, especially in the 
context of post-conflict reconstruction and peacebuilding, should be advocated. On attribute 
3, &#8220;Social justice in development,&#8221; it encouraged, all possible mutual feedback with the 
post-2015 development agenda, including on structural change and social covenants for 
equality. It called for specific attention to sustainable development and the equitable use of 
natural resources. 
</p>
<p>73. Another contribution emphasized the need for non-discrimination in development 
and the fair sharing of the benefits and burdens of development. It advocated a mixed 
economy as the most suited to create favourable conditions for development, and 
highlighted social safety nets, green technology, health-care systems and education as 
important elements for achieving development. Another submission shared information on 
experiences in promoting women&#8217;s leadership and participation.  
</p>

<p>aim of eliminating the gap between developed and developing countries, especially least 
developed countries. The need to focus also on good governance at the international level 
was underlined. Another submission provided information on the key role of women and 
made concrete proposals for fostering and promoting their role for development.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Review of progress in the implementation of the right to development, 
including consideration, revision and refinement of the right 
to development criteria and operational subcriteria 
</b></p>
<p>75. At its 2nd to 6th meetings, from 12 to 14 May, the Working Group considered and 
revised the draft operational right to development subcriteria listed in the annex to 
addendum 2 to the report of the high-level task force (A/HRC/15/WG.2/ TF/2/Add.2) under 
attributes 2 &#8220;Participatory human rights processes&#8221; and 3 &#8220;Social justice in development&#8221;, 
as well as proposals for additional subcriteria.  
</p>
<p>76. Throughout the consideration of the operational subcriteria, a few speakers 
introduced or sought to introduce the element of measurability, ranging from indicators to 
monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of human rights. Raising concerns, 
reservations and objections, the overwhelming majority of developing country Member 
States maintained that indicators, whether so named or under the guise of measurability, 
were clearly outside the mandate of the Working Group and had also been outside the scope 
of the mandate of the high-level task force on the implementation of the right to 
development. They contended that indicators did not make a positive contribution to the 
Working Group&#8217;s objective of elaborating a comprehensive and coherent set of standards 
for the implementation of the right to development, in accordance with the resolutions of 
the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>77. A broad range of perspectives emerged in the consideration of individual subcriteria, 
and new subcriteria were also proposed. In the discussion of international conventions, 
some speakers<b> </b>emphasized the implementation of all instruments relating to human rights, 
the environment and labour, focusing on the disadvantaged and marginalized. Others raised 
questions about the source of the notions of disadvantaged and marginalized in previous 
intergovernmental agreements. On national legal protection of human rights, some speakers 
advocated the inclusion of constitutional and legislative guarantees, and proposed that the 
particular role of national human rights institutions set up in accordance with the Paris 
Principles should be highlighted, while others preferred measures to improve the global 
partnership and achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the 
Millennium Development Goals. For a few Member States, the right to development 
remains an ambiguous concept. For the majority, it is a human right that must be reflected 
in all discussions on human rights.  
</p>
<p>78. Some speakers favoured the human rights-based approach to development for 
national development strategies, while others opposed it on the basis that it did not take 
account of different levels of development. Some suggested that the right to development 
approach should replace the human rights-based approach. One NGO suggested revising 
the draft criteria and subcriteria to strike a balance between &#8220;human rights-based 
development&#8221; and &#8220;the right to development&#8221;; between &#8220;development as a human right&#8221; 
and &#8220;human rights as development&#8221;; and between international responsibility and domestic 
responsibility.  
</p>
<p>79. The numerous, miscellaneous and detailed proposals on existing and new subcriteria 
included suggestions on human rights education, consultation with civil society, access to 
data and information, especially on climate and the environment, information management 
systems for responding to natural disasters, good governance, the rule of law and combating </p>


<p>corruption, decent work, access to good-quality employment, decent housing, preventing 
violence against women and girls, combating child, early and forced marriage, the 
elimination of sexual exploitation and human trafficking, the rights of migrant workers, the 
positive role of migrants in the globalization process, the elimination of all forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, colonialism and colonization, the 
right to self-determination of peoples which remain under colonial occupation, foreign 
domination and occupation, common but differentiated responsibilities, global good 
governance, international cooperation (North-South, South-South and triangular), the 
reform of international institutions, avoidance of unilateral coercive measures; 
strengthening national equitable land redistribution and rural development policies for 
historically disadvantaged peoples, including those affected by apartheid and colonialism, 
sovereignty over all natural wealth and resources, global financial architecture, the removal 
of inequities in global decision-making in international institutions, the removal of 
asymmetries in international trade, the elimination of tax havens, the elimination of debt, 
the root causes of climate change, development of a new model of international cooperation 
based on solidarity, the right to international solidarity, the right to peace and a legally 
binding framework for the right to development. 
</p>

<p>Chair-Rapporteur called on the Secretariat to explain the applicable rules. It was 
consequently clarified that unless otherwise laid down in the resolutions establishing 
subsidiary bodies of the Human Rights Council, such as the Social Forum, participation in 
them was limited to NGOs in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. 
However, the Working Group could consider and agree to expanding the participation of 
NGOs to include those not in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council, in 
which case it should make a recommendation to that effect for endorsement by the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>82. <b>At the final meeting of its fifteenth session, on 16 May 2014, the Working 
Group on the Right to Development adopted, by consensus, its conclusions and
