<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
15/8, and constitutes the third annual report submitted to the Council since the current 
Special Rapporteur, Raquel Rolnik, assumed her functions on 1 April 2008. It focuses on 
the question of women and their right to adequate housing. For women across the world, 
the right to adequate housing is as yet unrealized. The status of women&#8216;s right to adequate 
housing is central not only to understanding the female face of poverty worldwide, but also 
to understanding the dynamics of gender inequality itself, both within and outside the 
home.   
</p>
<p>2. The recognition and realization of every woman&#8216;s right to adequate housing is 
necessary to ensuring that every woman is able to live a life with dignity. For millions of 
women, it is the home which is the centre of daily life, and, in many cultures, it is women 
who spend the most time at home. For women in particular, the status of their right to 
adequate housing is intimately connected to their security, health, livelihood and overall 
well-being.   
</p>
<p>3. However, adequate housing for women goes far beyond addressing basic material 
needs. Because of the close connection that exists between the right to adequate housing 
and the right to equality, adequate housing for women goes to the heart of social inequality 
and discrimination. When a woman is unable to access adequate housing and land mainly 
because she is a woman, she is not only affected in terms of her immediate material needs, 
she is also relegated to a subordinate and dependent position within society because of her 
gender. Ensuring that women have access to and control over, vital resources such as 
housing and land is essential to challenging and changing gender power structures and 
patterns of gender inequality which continue to oppress, exclude and relegate women to the 
margins. 
</p>
<p>4. Finally, while it is true that women and the home are still in many places closely 
connected for social and cultural reasons, to insist that a woman&#8216;s right to adequate housing 
is upheld should not reinforce the old (and discriminatory) adage that &#8213;a woman&#8216;s place is 
in the home&#8214;. Rather, securing women&#8216;s right to adequate housing ultimately ensures 
greater autonomy for women in all areas of their lives, and not less. Advocating on behalf 
of women&#8216;s right to adequate housing is not about confining women to certain gender roles. 
</p>
<p>Instead, it is about acknowledging that gender as a social construct fundamentally impacts 
the ways in which women and men experience their housing situations, and that in order for 
women to enjoy adequate housing on the basis of equality their needs must be understood 
and made visible within the framework of the right to adequate housing.   
</p>
<p><b> II. Women and the right to adequate housing: past and present 
</b></p>
<p>5. The focus on women and the right to adequate housing is not a new topic for the 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur. Indeed, significant work on women&#8216;s right to adequate 
housing was done under the mandate of the Special Rapporteur between 2002 and 2006. 
The 2006 report on women and the right to adequate housing of the then Special 
Rapporteur offered the main findings stemming from an important body of thematic 
research, country missions, regional civil society consultations and information received 
from Governments and other actors on the status and implementation of this right.1   
</p>
<p>  
 1 E/CN.4/2006/118.   </p>


<p>6. During that period, regional civil society consultations were held with support from 
the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, United Nations agencies, and non-
governmental organizations.2 Those regional consultations highlighted key issues related to 
women&#8216;s right to adequate housing, most of which remain relevant today, including 
</p>
<p>women&#8216;s right to adequate housing and access to land in the context of HIV/AIDS; 
violence against women and its relationship to housing; the impact of forced evictions on 
women; gender discrimination in law, custom and practice related to housing (including 
discriminatory practices with respect to property and inheritance); as well as intersectional 
discrimination.3  
</p>
<p>7. Those consultations brought to light the specific difficulties that women, in every 
region, have to face in accessing housing and land. And, to make matters worse, far from 
being a place of safety and security, the home is too often permeated by violence. Women, 
those consultations highlighted, were likely to experience physical and sexual assault 
within the context of forced evictions. They also face insecurity and abuse within their own 
communities, including domestic violence. While the home should be a place of security, 
dignity, peace, and equality, for millions of women around the world the right to adequate 
housing has gone unfulfilled and unrealized.   
</p>
<p><b> A. Results of the 2011 consultation of the Special Rapporteur on women 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>8. In 2011, the current Special Rapporteur decided once again to address the question 
of women and the right to adequate housing, in order to gauge what progress has been made 
in the advancement of this right for women globally since these first consultations were 
held. 
</p>
<p>9. A worldwide online consultation on women and the right to adequate housing was 
launched,4 supplemented by direct outreach to women&#8216;s rights organizations and advocates 
across regions.5 The e-consultation served as a new opportunity to identify and make visible 
the multiple issues which women are currently facing in relation to housing.  
</p>
<p>10. The e-consultation harnessed the participation of approximately 300 organizations, 
networks, social movements, grassroots groups, advocates, academics, affected women, 
experts and others from across the world. While many of the issues documented by the 
earlier reports of the mandate remain relevant today, it is also clear that new challenges 
have emerged which threaten to turn back the clock for women and their right to adequate 
housing. At the same time, it is also clear that some notable advances, mainly in the field of 
new national legislation on women and housing, have occurred in different regions. 
</p>
<p>

 5 The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the following for their assistance in this work: Mariana 
</p>
<p>Pires, Rodrigo Faria, and Joyce Reis (Brazil team); Mayra G&#243;mez (project coordinator), Shivani 
Chaudhry (focal point for Asia), Mobola Fajemirokun (focal point for Africa), Leilani Farha with 
assistance from Narmeen Hashim (focal point for North America), Vanesa Vali&#241;o and Mariko Patti 
(focal points for Western Europe), Anelise Melendez Lundgren and Ana Falu with assistance from 
Kristen McNeill (focal points for Latin America), Salwa Duaibis (focal point for the Middle East and 
North Africa) and Tatjana Peric (focal point for Eastern Europe and Central Asia). The Special 
Rapporteur also wishes to thank all those who participated in the global e-consultation for their 
important contributions. </p>


<p>11. The e-consultation highlighted a host of issues which continue to impact the ability 
of women to enjoy their right to adequate housing or which otherwise have a 
disproportionate gender impact. In all regions, patriarchy and gender discrimination; 
poverty; and the impact of globalization, neo-liberal economic policies and privatization 
surfaced as overarching issues of concern which set the stage for violations of women&#8216;s 
right to adequate housing. More specifically, the impact of natural and human-induced 
disasters, conflict and internal displacement, war and occupation, lack of affordable and 
low-cost housing, forced evictions, homelessness, domestic violence, lack of women&#8216;s 
participation in law and policy-making, lack of access to remedies, inadequate and 
discriminatory laws, and the application of discriminatory customary law, all emerged as 
relevant barriers to women&#8216;s right to adequate housing across regions.  
</p>
<p>12. Concerns also emerged which were more regionally specific. In Africa, 
urbanization, climate change, low levels of financial literacy amongst women, and the 
rising number of female headed households all emerged as key issues affecting the status of 
women&#8216;s right to adequate housing in the African continent today. In Asia, as well as in 
Africa, the consultation revealed how women are negatively affected by the impact of the 
agrarian crisis, as well as by &#8213;land grabbing&#8214;,6 further limiting women&#8216;s already precarious 
access to, and control over, land and other natural resources. The e-consultation in Eastern 
and Central Europe highlighted the importance of recognizing intersectional discrimination 
as it affects certain groups of women, in particular vis-&#224;-vis the segregation of Roma 
communities. In the Middle East and North Africa, lack of law enforcement; conflict and 
occupation; and discrimination against minorities all negatively impact women&#8216;s right to 
</p>
<p>adequate housing. In Western Europe and North America, key issues highlighted included 
inadequate supply of public housing and lack of government assistance for housing; lack of 
affordable housing; domestic violence; and discrimination against women on public 
assistance, women with disabilities, and women belonging to racial/ethnic minorities, 
including Indigenous women. And in Latin America, where the e-consultation highlighted 
many of the issues already mentioned &#8211; including discrimination in matters related to 
housing against indigenous and Afro-descendant women, lack of access to justice, and 
domestic violence &#8211; participants also highlighted the need for better statistical information 
related to women and housing, as well as the urgent need to close the implementation gap 
between policy and practice. 
</p>
<p>13. In addition the global financial crisis emerged as a key cross-cutting theme during 
the e-consultation. Within this context, cuts to public housing programmes are having a 
devastating impact for women in many countries across the world. For example, in 2011, 
the United States cut US$2.8 billion from its federal housing programmes.7 These cuts to 
public housing programmes have hit women, and in particular ethnic minority women, 
women single heads of households, and women with disabilities, the hardest.8  
</p>
<p>14. The foreclosure crisis also has specific gender implications. Again, in the United 
States alone, researchers estimate that there were 2.5 million foreclosures from 2007 to 
</p>
<p>  
 6 Land grabbing can be defined as the action of &#8213;taking possession of and/or controlling a scale of land 
</p>
<p>for commercial/industrial agricultural production which is disproportionate in size in comparison to 
the average land holding in the region&#8214;, FIAN, <i>Land Grabbing in Kenya and Mozambique</i> (April 
2010), p. 8, available at: 
http://www.fian.at/assets/StudieLandgrabbinginKeniaMozambiqueFIAN2010.pdf 
</p>
<p> 7 See Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011. 
 8 See, inter alia, A/HRC/13/20/Add.4, para. 64.  </p>


<p>2009.9 Due to gender-based discrimination in mortgage lending, women in the United 
States &#8211; and ethnic minority women, in particular &#8211; were 32 per cent more likely than men 
to be targets of sub-prime and predatory lenders, despite having on average higher credit 
scores.10   
</p>
<p>15. Similar concerns were also echoed across other regions. For example, in Spain, 
where foreclosures have soared during the last three years, women participating in the e-
consultation reported that poor women and their families have been especially impacted, 
and that they continue to &#8213;experience the devastating effects of the economic crisis at close 
quarters.&#8214; As in other countries, those hit the hardest by cuts to social programmes have 
been those women already marginalized. The consequences of foreclosure for women are 
similar to what has been documented in terms of the impact of forced evictions, namely 
increased social isolation, increased exposure to domestic violence, and deepened poverty.   
</p>
<p>16. This negative impact has also certainly been felt by women living in other countries 
and regions. In Africa, for example, the consultation highlighted that since the onset of the 
global financial crisis, reductions in foreign aid, as well as foreign direct investments and 
remittances, have directly resulted in significant cutbacks in national-level housing 
programmes. In addition, the recent growth in land grabbing and the sale of formerly 
communal lands to foreign investors has made women&#8216;s access to land even more difficult, 
</p>
<p>and also jeopardizes directly their rights to adequate housing, water and sanitation, food and 
health.   
</p>
<p>17. Urgent progress must be made if women are to see improvements in their actual 
housing situations. However, what we have seen is far from what is required. In fact, within 
the context of the global financial crisis there has been a worrying move away from human 
rights standards, such as those requiring allocation of the maximum of available resources 
towards the realization of the right to adequate housing, or prioritizing marginalized women 
in all matters related to housing law, policy and programming. Rather, the trend has been 
towards increased privatization and further deregulation of the housing market, a move 
which leaves millions of women at the periphery, unable to access adequate housing. This 
situation not only perpetuates women&#8216;s poverty, it also reinforces women&#8216;s second-class 
status and gender inequality itself.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Recent </b>advancements for women&#8217;s right to adequate housing at 
<b>international and national levels 
</b></p>
<p>18. While the financial crisis looms heavy, it is important to recognize that some 
significant legal, policy and judicial progress has been achieved in recent years which 
increasingly recognizes and protects women&#8216;s right to adequate housing. This section 
highlights some of the recent successes in the fight for women&#8216;s equal right to adequate 
</p>
<p>housing, including on issues related to inheritance, divorce, land and property at 
international, regional and national levels. While not meant to be a comprehensive account 
of all of the advancements that have been made, each of the laws, policies, frameworks, 
decisions and/or judicial decisions highlighted below has had positive attributes from the 
standpoint of women&#8216;s right to adequate housing, as well as their right to equality.

Prime Mortgages&#8212;A Need for Fair Lending Practices&#8214; Fact Sheet, (New York, 12 September 2011). </p>


<p>19. At the international level, the newly created UN-Women, the United Nations Entity 
for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, has incorporated a specific goal on 
increasing women&#8216;s access to economic empowerment and opportunities. This focus seeks, 
</p>
<p>inter alia<i>,</i> to promote the adoption and implementation of laws and policies that expand 
women&#8216;s economic assets and security, including laws and policies to guarantee equal 
access to land and property.11 In addition, the recently created Working Group on the issue 
of discrimination against women in law and practice has been tasked by the Human Rights 
Council with promoting and exchanging views on best practices related to the elimination 
of laws that discriminate against women or are discriminatory to women in terms of 
implementation or impact. Doing so will contribute to ending gender discrimination in all 
parts of the world, as well as to ending systemic violations of women&#8216;s right to adequate 
housing.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>20. In addition, the most recent concluding observations adopted by the Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on Israel for the first time made explicit 
reference to women&#8216;s &#8213;right to adequate housing.&#8214;12 In those concluding observations, the 
Committee also for the first time made explicit reference to the practice of &#8213;forced 
</p>
<p>evictions&#8214;, urging Israel to &#8213;revoke its policies allowing for and refrain from the practice of 
forced eviction and house demolitions, which negatively impact on the physical and 
psychological well-being as well as the development and advancement of Palestinian and 
Israeli Arab women.&#8214;13 These recommendations help to conceptually link the contents of 
general comments 4 (1991) on the right to adequate housing and 7 (1997) on forced 
evictions of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to the non-
discrimination and equality protections guaranteed under the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>21. One area in which new policies adopted in recent years have increasingly protected 
women&#8216;s right to adequate housing is within the context of domestic violence.14 In Europe, 
for example, the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe issued a 
recommendation on the implementation of the right to housing in 2009, advocating the 
adoption and implementation of national housing strategies by all Council of Europe 
member States.15 Section 4.3.6. of the recommendation deals explicitly with women and 
women victims of violence, calling upon States &#8213;to protect women victims of violence 
</p>
<p>through specific legal and policy initiatives including the provision of specialized 
emergency shelters and other alternative housing.&#8214;16 Section 5 also urges States to adopt 
national housing strategies that &#8213;apply a gender perspective, identify disadvantaged and 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups and include positive measures for ensuring their effective enjoyment of 
the right to housing,&#8214;17 and also to &#8213;adopt anti-violence provisions in housing legislation

 14 The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on violence against women noted in her 2000 report 
</p>
<p>(E/CN.4/2000/68/Add.5) that &#8213;Housing policy is directly related to issues of violence against women 
&#8230;. Lack of shelter facilities forces up to 30 per cent of women who have fled domestic violence to 
</p>
<p>return to their homes and thus to violence.&#8214; See also: United Nations Division for the Advancement 
of Women, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, <i>Handbook for Legislation on Violence 
Against Women</i> (New York, 2010).

<p>and policies and ensure that domestic violence laws include provisions to protect women&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>right to housing, including the right to privacy and security.&#8214;18 
</p>
<p>22. The recognition that women&#8216;s housing security is vital to their ability to leave a 
violent relationship is spreading, and efforts have been made at national level, resulting in 
the promulgation of new domestic laws. For instance, in Serbia, according to article 198(2) 
of the Family Law adopted in 2005, courts can issue an order for the removal of the 
perpetrator from family housing, and they can also order that victims of domestic violence 
be allowed to stay in family housing, in both cases regardless of the ownership of housing.19 
In Brazil, what has become popularly known as the &#8213;Maria da Penha Law&#8214; (2006) allows 
for the removal of the abuser from the home.20 Additionally, the Indian Protection of 
Women from Domestic Violence Act (2005) explicitly recognizes the right of women 
victims of domestic violence to reside in a shared household, and provides that &#8213;every 
woman in a domestic relationship shall have the right to reside in the shared household, 
whether or not she has any right, title or beneficial interest in the same.&#8214;21 In addition, the 
Act guarantees that a person suffering domestic violence &#8213;shall not be evicted or excluded 
from the shared household or any part of it by the respondent [i.e. the abuser] save in 
accordance with the procedure established by law.&#8214;22   
</p>
<p>23. Women&#8216;s right to adequate housing is often denied or ignored within the broader 
context of family and marriage law. Equality in matters of inheritance is often denied for 
women and girls on the basis of custom and tradition, whether within the context of the 
death of a spouse, parent or other relative. This has important ramifications, as inheritance 
is a primary means by which wealth and resources are transferred within societies, as well 
as within families. To be excluded from the process of inheritance reinforces women&#8216;s lack 
</p>
<p>of autonomy and equality, and jeopardizes in a very direct way their right to adequate 
housing.   
</p>
<p>24. As awareness has grown, many countries have taken steps to amend their laws to 
ensure that women and girls are able to inherit housing, land and property on an equal basis 
with men and boys. In Sierra Leone, for example, equality in matters of inheritance is now 
provided for by a 2007 law,23 while the Registration of Customary Marriages and Divorce 
Act of 2007 (amended in 2009) recognizes the right of women to acquire and dispose of 
property in their own right, and to enter into contracts.24  
</p>
<p>25. In applying the law, the courts also have a critical role to play. In Kenya, recent 
judicial decisions referencing the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>  
 18  Ibid., section 5.6. 
 19 Article 198(2) of the Family Law of the Republic of Serbia, 2005. Similar legal improvements have 
</p>
<p>been noted in other countries of the region. In the Czech Republic, Act No. 135/2006 Coll. on 
Protection against Domestic Violence empowers the police intervening in domestic violence cases to 
ask the perpetrator to leave the household for ten days. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the 2005 Laws on 
the Protection from Domestic Violence, adopted respectively in its Republika Srpska and the 
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entities, both offer protection measures including removing the 
perpetrator from housing for a period of one to six months.   
</p>
<p> 20 Federal Law 11340, also known as the Lei Maria da Penha (Maria da Penha Law), of 7 August 2006.  
See Section 2, Article 22 on urgent protective measures. 
</p>
<p> 21 The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, No 43 of 2005, 13 September 2005. See 
Section 17 of the Act, on the right to reside in a shared household. 
</p>
<p> 22 Ibid. 
 23 The Devolution of Estates Act, 2007 [No. 21. 2007]. 
 24 The Registration of Customary Marriage and Divorce Act, 2009 [No. 1 of 2009]. In India, the Hindu 
</p>
<p>Succession (Amendment) Act of 2005 removed provisions in the 1956 Hindu Succession Act which 
discriminated on the basis of gender. </p>


<p>Discrimination against Women have put to rest the persistent conflict between customary 
legal systems which deny women inheritance of family property on the one hand, and the 
guarantee of gender equality under the Kenyan Constitution on the other. In the <i>Ntutu</i> case 
(2008), for example, the Kenyan High Court heard arguments by the sons of the deceased 
that &#8213;Masai customary law of succession &#8230; does not recognize the rights of the daughters 
to inherit the estate of their fathers.&#8214;25 Here, the Court applied international human rights 
law, international covenants and treaties which have been ratified by Kenya, and noted the 
previous decision of <i>Rono vs. Rono</i>.26 The Court found &#8213;the customary law which shall 
abrogate the right of daughters to inherit the estate of a father cannot be applicable as it 
shall be repugnant to justice and morality,&#8214; and upheld the right of the daughters to inherit 
</p>
<p>equally from the assets of the estate.27 
</p>
<p>26. Women&#8216;s right to equality in matters of inheritance is also relevant within the 
context of Sharia law, the application of which particularly affects women in the Middle 
East and North Africa. While Sharia law generally supports women&#8216;s rights to acquire, 
</p>
<p>hold, use, administer and dispose of property, women and girls receive a lesser share than 
their male counterparts when it comes to matters of inheritance (generally half of what a 
male in the same position would be entitled to receive). Customary practices and traditional 
structures can also contribute to further aggravating the situation. A prime example is that 
women are often forced, due to social pressures, to renounce their already reduced share of 
the inheritance in favour of male members of the family. In order to discourage this 
practice, in the occupied Palestinian territory, the Deputy Supreme Judge of Palestine of the 
Head of the Upper Council of Sharia Jurisdictions issued a notice in 2011 in which he 
instructed relevant authorities to apply certain conditions before legalizing a woman&#8216;s 
renunciation of her inheritance share, including that at least four months pass after a 
person&#8216;s death before a renunciation of inheritance can be registered.28 The notice also 
instructs the relevant authorities to verify the real value of the inheritance share, relying on 
an official report by three experts authorized by the municipality or local council. This new 
protocol is aimed at helping women to retain their inheritance shares and protecting women 
from losses as a result of reduced valuations of those shares. 
</p>
<p>27. In many countries, women are denied not only rights related to inheritance, but also 
their equal rights over marital property, effectively denying them any legal claim to housing 
whatsoever. The idea that rights over housing, land, property and inheritance fall 
exclusively within the male domain must be challenged. When looking at what works best

<p>Succession Cause 1263 of 2000, decided 19 November 2008. 
 26 In that case, sons of the deceased father claimed &#8213;according to Keiyo traditions, girls have no right to 
</p>
<p>inheritance of their father&#8216;s estate.&#8214; The Court of Appeal, however, awarded equal shares of

<p> 27 In Uganda, the Constitutional Court in the case of <i>Law Advocacy for Women in Uganda v Attorney 
General </i>(2007), struck down sections of the national Succession Act as unconstitutional because of 
preference given to male heirs over female heirs, as well as other provisions which discriminated on 
the basis of sex. See<i>:</i> <i>Law Advocacy for Women in Uganda v Attorney General</i>, Uganda 
Constitutional Court, Constitutional Petitions Nos. 13/05/ &amp; 05/06 [2007] UGCC 1, decided 5 April 
2007. Most recently in Swaziland, in the case of <i>Aphane v Registrar of Deeds &amp; Others </i>(2010), the 
High Court ruled that married women have a right to register property in their own name, rather than 
solely in their husband&#8216;s name. See<i>: Aphane v Registrar of Deeds &amp; Others, </i>High Court of 
Swaziland, Civil Case No. 383/2009, decided on 23 February 2010. </p>

<p>for women, researchers have found that a full or modified community of property regimes 
which recognize joint rights with equal powers between spouses best protects women&#8216;s 
right to adequate housing and to equality.29 The Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women in its recent concluding observations on Sri Lanka 
underscored this point when it noted &#8213;that discriminatory practices prevent women from 
acquiring ownership of land since only the &#8215;head of household&#8216; is authorized to sign official 
documentation such as land ownership certificates and receive pieces of land from 
Government.&#8214;30 In that case, the Committee urged the Government to abolish the concept of 
&#8213;head of household&#8214; in administrative practice and recognize joint or co-ownership of land, 
and to amend its national legislation to ensure joint or co-ownership.  
</p>
<p>28 Women&#8216;s access to and control over land is also a critical issue which connects in 
very real ways to women&#8216;s right to adequate housing.31 At national levels, advancements in 
this area are also taking place. In Tajikistan, a joint effort of UNIFEM (now UN-Women) 
with the Government of Tajikistan, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other 
partners resulted in the establishment of the Coordination Council dealing with women&#8216;s 
ownership issues, whose key task was to mainstream gender in Tajik land reform.32 In 
2004, seven changes were made to the clauses of the national Land Code which previously 
discriminated against women.33 Changes in the Land Code made it mandatory that all 
family members &#8211; women included &#8211; are now listed on land use certificates when families 
receive pieces of land from former collective farms.34 Over the course of a few years, those 
changes coupled with media campaigns, the provision of free legal advice, and the 
collection of sex-disaggregated data, resulted in raising women&#8216;s land ownership from 2 to 
14 per cent.35  </p>
<p>29. In Africa, a region where the issue of women&#8216;s access to and control over land 
emerged as a key theme within the consultation, the recent &#8213;Framework and Guidelines for 
Land Policy in Africa&#8214; also represents a positive new development from the standpoint of 
women&#8216;s equal right to access and control land, with specific sections on strengthening the 
land rights of women.36  </p>

<p><b> III. Gender-sensitive housing law, policy and programming: the 
right to adequate housing from a gender-equality perspective 
</b></p>
<p>30. Each of these advancements in law and policy represents an important achievement 
which ought to be celebrated. Yet, women throughout the world continue to face 
entrenched de jure and de facto barriers to the realization and enjoyment of this right. When 
it comes to women&#8216;s right to adequate housing, much more needs to be done to ensure the 
</p>
<p>effective domestication of human rights standards and the harmonization of national 
legislative frameworks with those international standards. In addition, the conceptual 
tensions which exist between &#8213;progressive realization&#8214; on the one hand (which is applicable 
to the achievement of substantive rights contained within the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights versus the immediate obligation of States to ensure 
that women enjoy their rights to non-discrimination and equality on the other (as 
guaranteed under both the Covenant and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, as well as other relevant treaties) must be addressed.   
</p>
<p>31. It is clear that the legal and policy barriers to women&#8216;s enjoyment of their right to 
adequate housing must be removed, and replaced by laws, policies and programming which 
take a focused and proactive approach. Legislative and policy measures must be put in 
place at national and regional levels explicitly prioritizing women&#8216;s right to adequate 
housing. In order to assist States and other relevant actors in the development of gender-
sensitive housing law, policy, and programming, the Special Rapporteur takes this 
opportunity to provide some guidance on a gender perspective on the elements of the right 
to adequate housing, through a gendered lens. 
</p>
<p><b>  Security of tenure 
</b></p>
<p>32. Security of tenure, as a cornerstone element of the right to adequate housing, 
provides legal protection against forced eviction, as well as harassment and other threats. 
For women, security of tenure is too often tenuous and secondary because it is assumed to 
be achieved through their relationship with a male &#8211; be it their husband, father, brother, or 
son. This situation falls far short of the standard, and gaps in protection are easily exposed. 
For many women, once that relationship with a male family member is severed through 
death or divorce, they are immediately vulnerable to being forced out of their homes. As we 
know, this is the case for widows who are routinely &#8213;disinherited&#8214; after the death of their 
husbands, as well as for women victims of domestic violence where a woman&#8216;s housing 
situation depends on her relationship to her abuser.   
</p>
<p>33. In addition, mass forced evictions which take place at the hands of State authorities 
or third party actors also impact women disproportionately.37 In 2000, the then Special 
Rapporteur on Violence against Women wrote: 
</p>
<p>Violence occurring in relation to forced eviction starts before the eviction process. 
Psychological stress on learning about the eviction can destabilize the family 
atmosphere and cause emotional trauma. (&#8230;) During the eviction, verbal abuse and 
beatings, rape and even killing are common. The destruction of the home and the 
</p>
<p>  
 37 In its resolution 2004/28 on forced evictions, the former United Nations Commission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights recalled that while certain groups were more vulnerable to forced eviction because of social 
exclusion and discrimination, the fact remains that &#8213;women in all groups are disproportionately 
</p>
<p>affected, given the extent of statutory and other forms of discrimination which often apply in relation 
to the property rights of women, including home ownership and rights of access to property of 
accommodation, and given the particular vulnerability of women to acts of gender-based violence and 
sexual abuse when they are rendered homeless.&#8214; See also: E/CN.4/2004/48 and A/HRC/4/18. </p>


<p>destruction of property are further traumatic experiences. (&#8230;) Coping with injuries, 
the death of family members, inadequate housing or even homelessness, poverty, 
lack of community support when relocated away from the home town are all 
possible burdens that have to be taken on by women after eviction.38 
</p>
<p>34.  In order to ensure women&#8216;s right to security of tenure, it is critical for States to 
refrain from the practice of forced evictions, and to protect women against forced evictions 
at the hands of private actors and third parties. In particular, the independent right of 
women to security of tenure should be explicitly recognized in housing law, policy and 
programmes, irrespective of their family or relationship status, thereby protecting women 
from forced evictions, including at the hands of community and even family members.   
</p>
<p>35 Where evictions are lawful under international human rights law, at no time shall 
acts of violence and harassment against women be tolerated. As the basic principles and 
guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement underscore, States must 
ensure &#8213;that women are not subject to gender-based violence and discrimination in the 
course of evictions.&#8214;39   
</p>
<p>36. Furthermore, in order to uphold women&#8216;s right to security of tenure within the 
context of domestic violence, women who are victims of domestic violence must also be 
able to enjoy security of tenure, such that they are allowed to reside in their own homes &#8211; 
regardless of title or formal ownership &#8211; whereas perpetrators may be removed.   
</p>
<p>37. Housing law, policy and programmes should also ensure that women have the legal 
literacy and legal resources needed to effectively claim and enforce their rights within the 
context of eviction. Women must &#8213;have the right to relevant information, full consultation 
</p>
<p>and participation throughout the entire [evictions] process, and to propose alternatives that 
authorities should duly consider&#8214;40 and in the event of eviction &#8213;[w]omen and men must be 
co-beneficiaries of all compensation packages. Single women and widows should be 
entitled to their own compensation.&#8214;41  
</p>
<p><b>  Availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure 
</b></p>
<p>38. Adequate housing requires availability of services, materials, facilities and 
infrastructure, including<b> </b>access to water and sanitation; heating, cooling, and lighting; 
energy; washing facilities; food storage and refuse disposal; as well as emergency services. 
Taking into account women&#8216;s perspectives on these issues is vital given the fact that 
</p>
<p>women tend to spend more time at home, and are often disproportionately burdened with 
household chores which depend directly on the availability of such services, materials, 
facilities and infrastructure. There are interesting precedents for this type of gender-
sensitive planning, as in the housing project Frauen-Werk-Stadt developed by the City of 
Vienna. This housing project received international acclaim for being a &#8213;housing project for 
</p>
<p>and by women&#8214; and was designated a best practice for urban settlements by UN-Habitat 
and UNESCO.42

designs by four women architects in co-operation with one woman landscape planner.  </p>


<p>39. The issue of water demonstrates clearly the relevance of taking a gender-sensitive 
approach. It is now well-documented that it is women, more than men, who spend precious 
hours of each day on water collection for themselves and their families when water is not 
provided at home. Cumulatively, women in South Africa alone must walk the equivalent of 
a trip to the moon and back 16 times each day just to supply their households with water. 
However, when States adopt a gender-sensitive approach to water delivery and 
management, the situation for women can change dramatically, and for the better.43 </p>
<p>40. We also see the gender impact of lack of sanitation facilities for women, who are 
disproportionately exposed to face sexual assault on their way to use facilities. UN-Water 
has highlighted that: 
</p>
<p>&#8213;A focus on gender differences is of particular importance with regard to sanitation 
initiatives, and gender-balanced approaches should be encouraged in plans and 
structures for implementation, [T]he design and the location of latrines close to 
home may reduce violence against women, which may occur when women have to 
relieve themselves in the open after nightfall&#8214;.44   
</p>
<p>41. Indeed, in its recent concluding observations on Kenya, the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women expressed concern over &#8213;the situation of 
women and girls living in urban slums and informal settlements and who are under threat of 
sexual violence and lack access to adequate to sanitation facilities, which exacerbate their 
risks of being victims of sexual violence and impact negatively on their health.&#8214;45  
</p>
<p>42. Water points and sanitation facilities must be made available and accessible to 
women, ensuring women&#8216;s rights to water and sanitation, as well as to health. In order to 
</p>
<p>ensure that women&#8216;s needs are adequately reflected in housing law, policy, and 
programming, a human rights-based approach requires that women be able to participate in 
all stages of policy and programme development, so that they are able to give input into the 
kinds of resources most needed by them within their specific social and cultural context. 
For example, the recent Inter-Agency Standing Committee guidelines on addressing gender 
issues in the aftermath of Haiti&#8216;s earthquake of January 2010 highlighted that &#8213;it is essential 
</p>
<p>that water and sanitation actors consult women and girls on the location of sanitation 
facilities to ensure that the route is safe; that latrines be well lit, lockable from the inside, 
and offer privacy.&#8214;46 
</p>
<p><b>  Location 
</b></p>
<p>43.  In order for housing to be adequate it<b> </b>must be situated so as to allow access to 
employment options, health-care services, schools, childcare centres and other social 
facilities. However, if these resources are effectively unavailable to women due to gender-
based discrimination or lack of gender sensitivity, they are of no practical benefit to women 
and women remain just as excluded as if those resources were not present. Therefore, 
housing law, policy and programming must assure that women and girls are also able to

<p>benefit on an equal basis from these community resources, such that they are adequate, 
available and fully accessible to women and girls.  
</p>
<p>44. In this respect, researchers have found that &#8213;site planning and location, service 
arrangements, and the design of community facilities can be critical in easing the burden of 
women's double day. For example, site layouts can be planned to cluster several houses 
around a communal area. In [El Salvador], this layout has given rise to informal, collective 
arrangements for child care which would have been difficult to develop otherwise.&#8214;47 On 
access to employment and livelihoods, researchers have also highlighted that housing 
location is particularly important for women&#8216;s employment: as they earn less, the cost and 
time of long commutes discourages formal employment, and access to markets is vital for 
typical informal occupations.48 
</p>
<p><b>  Affordability 
</b></p>
<p>45. In order for housing to be adequate, it must be affordable. The definition of what is 
affordable, however, is not gender-neutral and cannot be thought of as being the same for 
women and men. Throughout the world, the reality is that women on average earn less than 
men, accumulate less pension/superannuation support over a lifetime, and have less access 
to financial resources in general. In a world where housing is often accessed through 
markets and capital, what may be affordable for the average man may not be affordable for 
the average woman. In Europe, for example, Eurostat found a persisting gender pay gap of 
17.5 per cent on average in 27 European Union Member States.49   
</p>
<p>46. As such, when seeking to define affordability, it is important to take into account the 
gender disparity in income and access to financial resources, and to prioritize the allocation 
of social or public housing to those who are unable to meet the cost of housing, often 
women. Within the context of increased privatization of social services, it is also vital that 
the cost of housing itself be defined to include costs associated with realizing the right to 
adequate housing, including vis-&#224;-vis rights to water and sanitation, energy supply, etc. 
Within the framework of housing law, policy and programming, women&#8216;s access to the 
</p>
<p>financial resources needed to obtain adequate housing &#8211; including loans, credits, and/or 
vouchers, etc. &#8211; ought to be reflected.   
</p>
<p><b>  Habitability 
</b></p>
<p>47. For women, habitability of housing has been linked to protection against violence 
within the home. Therefore, the notion of habitability for women must itself be interpreted 
in a gender-sensitive way, ensuring that housing is safe for women. The notion of 
habitability must also be sensitive to women&#8216;s disproportionate caregiving roles. These 
roles must be considered in the design of housing law, policy and programming. For 
example, in many parts of the world, it is women who cook and prepare meals. When 
cooking over open fires or traditional stoves fuelled by wood, animal dung or charcoal, it 
has been shown that women breathe in a mix of toxic pollutants and are particularly 
vulnerable to developing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).50 For women, 
this indoor smoke is responsible for half a million deaths each year, and millions more have

<p>their health suffer due to impaired breathing and respiratory disease.51 In the case of COPD, 
for example, one study in Xuanwei, China, where rates of lung cancer and COPD are 
strongly associated with household use of coal fires, researchers showed that simple 
measures, such as installing a chimney, dramatically reduced the incidence of COPD 
among women.52 
</p>
<p>48. While the design of housing can be gender-sensitive, most often it is not. Scholars 
interested in feminist architecture have argued that:   
</p>
<p>&#8213;Despite this relationship of women to the home, they have little control over the 
nature of their housing. Architects and planners are usually men and, in the case of 
local authority housing estates, not of the class of those who actually spend most of 
their time in the flats and houses they design. It is women who bear the brunt of 
high-rise flats, estates with no open play spaces, inadequate laundry facilities, noise, 
vandalism and bad access to shops and transport. Cramped kitchens, damp, thin 
walls, broken lifts, dark and dangerous stairways and the numerous other 
consequences of low cost building, make taking care of the home and rearing young 
children doubly difficult and time-consuming.&#8214;53 
</p>
<p>49. On the positive side, the design of housing itself can certainly encourage greater 
equality vis-&#224;-vis enjoyment and use of domestic space.54 An example of new ways of 
thinking about domestic space from a gender perspective can be seen through the 
development of housing projects which seek to promote non-hierarchical and more flexible 
uses of the home. For example, creating personal workspaces inside the home can support 
women who are more likely to engage in home-based income-generating activities. Another 
interesting development which can be found in certain policies relates to the design of 
kitchens, a traditionally female space which is often cramped and separated. The design of 
housing from a gender-sensitive perspective can better promote family integration, as well 
as a more equitable sharing of household responsibilities between women and men through 
openness and shared use of spaces.   
</p>
<p><b>  Accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>50. In order to ensure that housing is accessible to all groups of women, it is similarly 
important for housing law, policy and programmes to reflect the needs of women who may 
be especially disadvantaged and who encounter intersectional discrimination, including 
widows, elderly women, lesbians, homeless women, migrant women, women with 
disabilities, women who may be single mothers or single heads of households, women 
living with or otherwise affected by chronic illnesses such as HIV/AIDS and mental health 
disorders, women belonging to racial/ethnic/linguistic minorities, domestic workers, sex 
workers, illiterate women and women who have been displaced.  
</p>
<p>51. Women who face intersectional discrimination are more vulnerable to losing their 
homes, and have more difficulty accessing adequate housing in the first place. In the case of 
women affected by HIV/AIDS, for example, advocates have shown how &#8213;One of the 
</p>
<p>greatest obstacles HIV/AIDS infected women confront is their inability to secure property. 
Women&#8216;s inability to possess and manage property may result in their impoverishment,

<p>particularly in cultures which have a propensity to humiliate or shun HIV/AIDS infected 
women and girls. In many cases, subsequent to the HIV/AIDS related deaths of male 
partners or disclosure of their HIV/AIDS status, women are divested of their marital 
property, inheritance rights, livelihoods, and at times even their children, by relatives who 
forcibly evict them from their homes.&#8214;55 Yet, access to housing and land can also serve as a 
pivotal means by which to improve the lives of women affected by HIV/AIDS. There is 
growing evidence to suggest that where women&#8216;s right to adequate housing is upheld, 
</p>
<p>women are far better able to mitigate the negative impacts of AIDS, and that enjoyment of 
this right may even help to prevent further spread of HIV/AIDS by promoting women&#8216;s 
economic security and empowerment.56 This example shows how the needs of women who 
are especially marginalized and disadvantaged must be prioritized.  
</p>
<p><b>  Cultural adequacy </b></p>
<p>52. Culturally adequate housing allows for the expression of cultural diversity, yet too 
often women are excluded from being able to shape that cultural identity and to participate 
in traditional cultural decision-making structures. In order to ensure that women&#8216;s voices 
and visions are reflected, women must be able to effectively participate in defining what 
adequate housing means to them within their particular context, and to ensure that housing 
addresses not only their practical, material needs, but also their needs vis-&#224;-vis autonomy, 
equality and dignity. In order to achieve this, women must be seen as partners in the 
creation and interpretation of cultural norms related to housing and land. The Kenya Legal 
and Ethical Issues Network on HIV and AIDS (KELIN) has spearheaded innovative efforts 
specifically designed to utilize cultural structures to protect women&#8216;s rights, including to 
adequate housing.57  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Overcoming gaps in implementation  
</b></p>
<p>53. Legislation and gender-sensitive housing law, policy and programming are only the 
first step. Even where good laws and policies are in place, an important challenge remains 
in translating them fully into practice. Unfortunately, in terms of implementation, progress 
has remained slow. Indeed, during the consultation process for this report, it became clear 
that even in places where good laws exist, discriminatory social and customary norms 
continue to hinder the enjoyment of women&#8216;s right to adequate housing.   
</p>
<p>54. The existing gaps are complex and difficult to overcome as they are deeply rooted in 
culture, discriminatory social attitudes and practices, as well as weak or gender-blind 
systems which delay progress in the realization of the right, and fail to effectively make 
visible the existing barriers. Those challenges require more than ordinary efforts to enforce 
laws and put policies into practice; additional actions directed to provoke those changes in 
cultural patterns are required, and this can be obtained particularly through the combination 
of awareness-raising and public education, as well as through legal enforcement and legal 
aid, and provision of appropriate resources through the adoption of specific budgetary 
measures.  <b>

<p> 57 The Kenya Legal and Ethical Issues Network on HIV and AIDS (KELIN), &#8213;Guide on Working With 
Cultural Structures to Resolve Disputes&#8214;, (December 2010). </p>


<p><b> A. Awareness-raising and public education 
</b></p>
<p>55. Awareness-raising and public human rights education are critical to the 
advancement of women&#8216;s de facto enjoyment of the right to adequate housing, and must 
take place at multiple levels. Participants in the e-consultation from different countries and 
regions emphasized this point repeatedly, noting how &#8213;there is clearly a need for rights 
education at all levels of society so that access to adequate housing is understood and 
accepted as a basic human right&#8214; and how &#8213;we need information campaigns, not only 
</p>
<p>among women but also among those in power too. &#8230; training policymakers, police 
</p>
<p>officers, judiciary on women&#8216;s land and housing rights is also something gravely 
lacking &#8230;&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>56. With these gaps in mind, awareness-raising programmes and campaigns aimed at the 
general public ought to be launched, so as to challenge discriminatory attitudes which may 
be widely shared. Such programmes and campaigns should actively promote women&#8216;s 
equality in all matters related to housing and land and combat these discriminatory attitudes 
within the broader society, which should be addressed through media campaigns, public 
education and outreach, and discussion of these issues within public forums. 
</p>
<p>57.  Awareness should also be raised about women&#8216;s right to adequate housing amongst 
key audiences, including traditional, religious and customary leaders; law-makers; lawyers, 
legal advocates, and members of the judiciary; law enforcement authorities; housing 
authorities and administrative personnel; gender ministries; and those engaged in the 
development and/or implementation of land policy and/or land reform. Each of these 
groups should be made fully aware of the norms protecting women&#8216;s right to adequate 
housing at the domestic level, as well as those norms in international law. 
</p>
<p>58. Women must also be made aware of their right to adequate housing, both as it is 
recognized under domestic legislation as well as under the international human rights 
framework. This right should be actively promoted so as to ensure that women know what 
it entails in all aspects. However, it is also important to go beyond &#8213;rights awareness&#8214; so 
that women are actually able to know and understand what services are available locally to 
assist them in claiming their rights and holding actors accountable for violations of these 
rights. With the foundation of rights awareness, women must have a seat at the table of 
decision-making, so that they are able to effectively and meaningfully able to participate in 
all aspects related to the formulation, design and implementation of housing law, policy and 
programming. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Ensuring adequate legal enforcement and legal aid 
</b></p>
<p>59. In order to ensure proper enforcement and implementation, it is also important for 
the legal system to be accessible to women and itself gender-sensitive, and that it is 
specifically enabled to protect women&#8216;s right to adequate housing. In this regard, it is vital 
for women to have access to affordable or free legal aid which can assist them in seeking 
justice and enforcing their right to a remedy. Women must also be able, should they so 
choose, to file legal complaints against the State as well as private and third-party actors for 
gender-discrimination in housing and other violations of women&#8216;s right to adequate 
housing, and to have those complaints decided by a fair and impartial tribunal. 
</p>
<p>60. Adequate legal enforcement also requires that all human rights violations, such as 
forced evictions, disinheritance, violence against women carried out within the context of 
eviction be vigorously investigated, prosecuted and punished. Police units operating at the 
local level should be adequately supported to assist women with issues stemming from 
violations or potential violations of their right to adequate housing, such as property </p>


<p>grabbing and domestic violence, including the removal of perpetrators from the home and 
the recovery of stolen property. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Providing appropriate budgetary supports  
</b></p>
<p>61. The implementation of housing law, policy and programming often requires that 
adequate budgetary support be put in place in order to ensure effectiveness. In order to 
ensure that there are adequate financial and human resources allocated, processes of 
participatory budgeting which are inclusive of women&#8216;s voices should be used. Women 
</p>
<p>should be active participants in open and transparent budgeting processes related to all 
aspects of housing law, policy and programmes as well as land use plans. Gender-sensitive, 
detailed budget analysis of current housing programmes and land use plans should also be 
employed, so as to ensure better accountability of States in promoting and realizing gender 
equality, and in meeting their international human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> In order to continue to advance the recognition, protection and enjoyment of 
</b>women&#8217;s right to adequate housing, as well as women&#8217;s rights to non<b>-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>and equality, States should adopt reinforcing strategies. These strategies should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>targeted both at the articulation of domestic law, policy and programming which 
</b></p>
<p>uphold women&#8217;s right to adequate housing, as well as at effective implementation. In 
</p>
<p><b>order to better protect and realiz</b>e women&#8217;s right to adequate housing, the Special 
</p>
<p><b>Rapporteur offers the following recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> The Special Rapporteur reiterates that States should design, adopt and 
implement gender-sensitive and human rights-based law, policy and programming</b> 
<b>which: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) R</b>eflects international human rights standards related to women&#8217;s right 
</p>
<p><b>to adequate housing, and a gender-sensitive understanding of the elements of the right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to adequate housing;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) E</b>nsures accountability for actors who violate women&#8217;s rig<b>ht to adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>housing;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) F</b>acilitates women&#8217;s empowerment, by creating awareness of women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>rights;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Prioritizes the needs of particularly vulnerable and/or marginalized 
</b></p>
<p><b>women, including widows, elderly women, lesbians, homeless women, migrant women, 
</b></p>
<p><b>women with disabilities, women who may be single mothers or single heads of 
</b></p>
<p><b>household, women living with or otherwise affected by HIV/AIDS, women belonging 
</b></p>
<p><b>to minorities, domestic workers, sex workers, illiterate women and women who have 
</b></p>
<p><b>been displaced;</b>  
</p>
<p><b> (e) Ensures that women are able to meaningfully participate in design, 
</b></p>
<p><b>planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluation of housing law, policy, 
</b></p>
<p><b>programming and budgets; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Ensures that implementation of relevant law, policies and programmes is 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequately supported in terms of both financial and human resources;   
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Directs the maximum of available resources towards the realization of 
</b></p>
<p>women&#8217;s right to adequate housing, and;<b> </b></p>


<p><b> (h) Provides for the collection of gender-sensitive and gender-disaggregated 
</b></p>
<p>data which can serve as a tool for evaluation and measurement of women&#8217;s actual 
</p>
<p><b>enjoyment of their right to adequate housing. 
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> States should also amend or repeal domestic legislation related to family and 
marriage which discriminates against women, so as to ensure that women and men 
</b></p>
<p><b>have equal powers in all matters related to housing and land. Seemingly gender-
</b></p>
<p><b>neutral concepts or standards which discriminate against women in practice </b>&#8211;<b> such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>the application of the </b>&#8220;<b>head of the household</b>&#8221;<b> concept </b>&#8211;<b> should similarly be rescinded.   
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> States should eliminate discrimination against women and girls in all matters 
related to inheritance, so they benefit from inheritance on an equal footing with men 
</b></p>
<p><b>and boys. States should ensure that the application of customary law and practice 
</b></p>
<p><b>does not interfere with the basic right of women and girls to gender equality, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in matters related to housing and land, such inheritance.   
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> States must refrain from the practice of forced evictions, and protect women 
against forced evictions at the hands of private actors and third parties. Violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>against women carried out within the context of eviction must be vigorously prevented 
</b></p>
<p><b>and sanctioned.   
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> States should also ensure that police units operating at the local level are 
adequately supported to assist women victims of property grabbing and domestic 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence, including the removal of perpetrators from the home and the recovery of 
</b></p>
<p><b>stolen property. States should also ensure that emergency shelters are available and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessible to women, and that women who are victims of domestic violence are 
</b></p>
<p><b>specifically able to benefit from transitional housing programmes and social housing 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes. 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> Housing law, policy and programming should explicitly recognize the 
independent right of women to security of tenure, irrespective of their family or 
</b></p>
<p><b>relationship status.   
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> Housing law, policy and programming should also recognize joint or co-
ownership of housing and land, and ensure that women have the legal literacy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal resources needed to effectively claim and enforce their rights. 
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> States should ensure that housing includes water points and sanitation facilities 
available for and accessible to women, ensuring women their rights to water and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sanitation, as well as to health. States should also ensure that housing is adequately 
</b></p>
<p><b>located in order to provide women with access to employment options, health-care 
</b></p>
<p><b>services, schools, childcare centres and other social facilities, such that they are non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory, adequate, available and fully accessible to women and girls.   
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> Definitions of affordable housing should take into account any gender disparity 
in income and access to financial resources, and prioritize the allocation of social or 
</b></p>
<p><b>public housing to those who cannot afford the cost of housing. States should ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>within the framework of housing law, policy and programming that women are able 
</b></p>
<p><b>to access other financial resources needed to obtain adequate housing, including loans, 
</b></p>
<p><b>credits, and/or vouchers, etc. 
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> </b>States should actively promote women&#8217;s equality in all matters related to 
<b>housing and land and combat discriminatory attitudes within the broader society 
</b></p>
<p><b>through media campaigns, public education and outreach, and discussion of these 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues within public forums. 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> </b>States should raise awareness about women&#8217;s right to adequate housing 
<b>amongst targeted audiences, including traditional, religious and customary leaders; </b></p>


<p><b>law-makers; lawyers, legal advocates, and members of the judiciary; law enforcement 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities; housing authorities and administrative personnel; gender ministries; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>those engaged in the development and/or implementation of land policy and/or land 
</b></p>
<p><b>reform. 
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> </b>States should actively promote women&#8217;s right to adequate housing so as to 
<b>ensure that women know what this right entails, as well as what services are available 
</b></p>
<p><b>locally to assist them in claiming this right. States should also ensure that women have 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to affordable or no-cost legal aid, which can assist them to seek justice when 
</b></p>
<p><b>their right to adequate housing is violated. 
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the Committees on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide continued normative advice </b>on women&#8217;s right to adeq<b>uate housing, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>on issues related to inheritance, land and property, and to pay special attention to 
</b></p>
<p>conceptual tensions between the immediate obligations of States to ensure women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>right to equality and the </b>&#8220;<b>progressive realization</b>&#8221;<b> obligation of Economic, Social and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cultural Rights. The Special Rapporteur also encourages the Committee on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Elimination of Discrimination against Women to adopt a general recommendation on 
</b></p>
<p>women&#8217;s right to adequate housing, including issues related to inheritance, <b>land and 
</b></p>
<p><b>property.    
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the recently established UN-Women to 
incorporate, in all its areas of work, support for initiatives aimed at protecting 
</b></p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights to adequate housing. In particular, the Special Rapporteur en<b>courages 
</b></p>
<p><b>UN-Women: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To provide technical cooperation and support to Member States in order 
</b></p>
<p><b>to ensure that women are able to exercise and enjoy their right to adequate housing; 
</b></p>
<p><b>and   
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To strengthen its partnership with civil society so as to contribute to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective implementation and monitoring of human rights norms on women and 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate housing.  
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the Working Group on the issue of 
discrimination against women in law and practice to document best practices with 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect to women and the right to adequate housing, within the scope of its mandate to 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote and exchange views on best practices related to the elimination of laws that 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminate against women or are discriminatory to women in terms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation or impact. The Special Rapporteur also encourages the Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group to make recommendations for the improvement of housing legislation and its 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation, within the scope of its mandate to contribute to the realization of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Millennium Development Goals, in particular Goal 3 on the promotion of gender 
</b></p>
<p><b>equality and the empowerment of women.
