<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In its resolution 19/6, the Human Rights Council extended, for a period of three 
years, the mandate of the current mandate holder as a special rapporteur in the field of 
cultural rights. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to submit her third thematic report to the 
Council under this new title. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur focuses on the right to enjoy the 
benefits of scientific progress and its applications. The Special Rapporteur stresses the 
strong link of this right with the right to participate in cultural life, as well as other human 
rights. She considers that its normative content includes (a) access by everyone without 
discrimination to the benefits of science and its applications, including scientific 
knowledge; (b) opportunities for all to contribute to the scientific enterprise and freedom 
indispensable for scientific research; (c) participation of individuals and communities in 
decision-making and the related right to information; and (d) an enabling environment 
fostering the conservation, development and diffusion of science and technology. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur makes a number of recommendations, most of which could 
be implemented in a timely manner. She also recommends that further work be conducted 
to enhance the conceptual clarity of the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and 
its applications. A robust discussion is needed, including on her proposal to adopt a public 
good approach to knowledge innovation and diffusion.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The right of everyone to share in scientific advancement and its benefits is enshrined 
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and, in slightly different terms, as the right to 
benefit from scientific progress and its applications in the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It is also recognized in other international and 
regional human rights instruments. The scope, normative content and obligations of the 
State under this right, referred herein as &#8220;the right to science&#8221;, remain underdeveloped 
while scientific innovations are changing human existence in ways that were inconceivable 
a few decades ago.  
</p>
<p>2. The right to science is usually regarded as a means to advance the realization of 
other human rights and to address &#8220;the needs common to all humanity&#8221;1 or in terms of the 
&#8220;potentially adverse consequences for the integrity, dignity and human rights of the 
</p>
<p>individual&#8221;.2 Although the potential human rights implications of scientific advances must 
be considered, they do not suffice to define the scope of the right. It is essential to consider 
what the right to science means as a human right. 
</p>
<p>3. The right to science tends to be considered in isolation from the right to participate 
freely in the cultural life of the community, to which it is usually juxtaposed with relevant 
instruments. The Special Rapporteur views these rights as inherently interlinked, since both 
relate to the pursuit of knowledge and understanding and to human creativity in a 
constantly changing world.  
</p>
<p>4. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur hopes to catalyse a robust discussion 
among States, scientific researchers and practitioners, civil society groups and the private 
sector to further elucidate the right to science.  
</p>
<p>5. In order to collect the views of States and other stakeholders, the Special Rapporteur 
disseminated a questionnaire on the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its 
applications. Responses were received from 21 States and 13 other stakeholders (see annex 
I). On 5 and 6 December 2011, the Special Rapporteur convened an experts&#8217; meeting on the 
issue (see annex II). She also convened a public consultation in Geneva on 7 December 
</p><p>2011. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to all those who contributed. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The right to benefit from scientific progress and its 
applications: legal and conceptual framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International and regional standards  
</b></p>
<p>6. Various international and regional provisions demonstrate a wide consensus with 
regard to the need to ensure the right to science for all persons. Numerous other texts on a 
wide range of related issues, such as health, the environment, development, and information 
and communication technologies are referred to below, where relevant. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Declaration on Social Progress and Development, General Assembly resolution 2542 (XXIV), 
</p>
<p>preamble. 
 2 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (A/CONF.157/23).See also Proclamation of Teheran, 
</p>
<p>Final Act of the International Conference on Human Rights, para. 18. </p>


<p><b> 1. International law 
</b></p>
<p>7. The right to share in scientific advancement and its benefits is recognized in article 
27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and, in slightly different terms, in article 
15 (1)(b) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Although 
both texts link it with the right to take part in cultural life and to the protection of the moral 
and material interests resulting from scientific, literary or artistic production, the right to 
science is usually considered in isolation. The juxtaposition with the right to culture has 
often been viewed as coincidental. The Special Rapporteur believes that, to the contrary, 
the rights to science and culture should be read together and in conjunction with, in 
particular, the right of all peoples to self-determination and the right of everyone to take 
part in the conduct of public affairs (see also paragraph 21 below).3  
</p>
<p>8. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights further 
stipulates the obligations of States Parties to promote the conservation, the development 
and the diffusion of science and culture (art. 15 (2)), to respect the freedom indispensable 
for scientific research and creative activity (art. 15 (3)) and to recognize the benefits to be 
derived from the encouragement and development of international contacts and cooperation 
in the scientific and cultural fields (art. 15 (4)). The Special Rapporteur considers the calls 
for international cooperation in the area of science and transfers of technologies, as made in 
numerous United Nations and other documents, as particularly important for realizing the 
right to science for all. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Regional law 
</b></p>
<p>9. According to the Charter of the Organization of American States, States &#8220;shall 
extend among themselves the benefits of science and technology by encouraging the 
exchange and utilization of scientific and technological knowledge&#8221; (art. 38). The American 
Declaration on the Rights and Duties of Man upholds the right of every person &#8220;to 
</p>
<p>participate in the benefits that result from intellectual property, especially scientific 
discoveries&#8221; and &#8220;to the protection of his moral and material interests as regards his 
inventions or any literary, scientific or artistic works of which he is the author&#8221; (art. XIII), 
while article 14 of the Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights 
in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights includes the right to science in 
language similar to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
The right has yet to be addressed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and 
the Inter-American Court on Human Rights, although the Commission recently stressed the 
urgent need for the right to be defined so that it may be applied in practice.4 
</p>
<p>10. Article 42 of the Arab Charter on Human Rights recognizes the right of everyone &#8220;to 
take part in cultural life and to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its application&#8221;, 
together with the obligations of States to &#8220;respect the freedom of scientific research and 
creative activity&#8221;, to &#8220;ensure the protection of moral and material interests resulting from 
scientific, literary and artistic production&#8221; and to enhance cooperation &#8220;at all levels, with 
</p>
<p>the full participation of intellectuals and inventors and their organizations, in order to 
develop and implement recreational, cultural, artistic and scientific programmes.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>11. Article II (2) of the Charter of the African Union identifies scientific and technical 
cooperation as essential for meeting its goals. Articles 4 (1)(h) and 12 (2)(b) of the Protocol 
on the Rights of Women in Africa of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights 
specifically prohibits medical experimentation on women without their informed consent, 
</p>
<p>  
 3  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 25. 
 4  See www.oas.org/es/cidh/audiencias/TopicsList.aspx?Lang=en&amp;Topic=27. </p>


<p>and requires States to take specific measures to promote education and training for women, 
particularly in the fields of science and technology. 
</p>
<p>12. Article 13 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights requires that scientific 
research be &#8220;free of constraint&#8221;. The Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine of the 
Council of Europe contains, in the preamble thereto, important provisions, including &#8220;the 
need for international cooperation so that all humanity may enjoy the benefits of biology 
and medicine&#8221;; it also declares that the &#8220;interests and welfare of the human being shall 
prevail over the sole interest of society or science&#8221; (art. 2). Importantly, the need for 
appropriate public consultation and debate is underlined (art. 28). The Convention also 
provides clear guidelines regarding the conditions under which research involving human 
persons may be conducted.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Domestic implementation  
</b></p>
<p>13. According to information provided to the Special Rapporteur through, inter alia, the 
responses to her questionnaire, the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its 
applications is recognized explicitly in the constitutions of at least four countries (Armenia, 
Ecuador, Paraguay, Republic of Moldova). Numerous other constitutions protect specific 
aspects of this right, such as the right to have access to science (Brazil, Colombia, 
Dominican Republic, Estonia, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Yemen); promotion of scientific 
research and infrastructure development (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Croatia, 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, Ecuador, Guatemala, Iran (Islamic Republic of), 
Korea, Kuwait, Madagascar, Malta, Mexico, Switzerland, the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, Uzbekistan); promotion of scientific research specifically for social benefit 
(Brazil, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador); protection of scientific freedom 
(Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Czech 
Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, Egypt, Georgia, Hungary, Japan, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Madagascar, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, the 
Republic of Moldova, Spain, Switzerland, Tajikistan, the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, Turkey, Ukraine, Uzbekistan); support for science education (Brazil, 
Colombia, Zambia); promotion of the dissemination and/or use of science and technology 
(Argentina, Colombia, Czech Republic, Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, 
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Georgia, Honduras); encouraging international cooperation 
in science and technology (Bosnia and Herzegovina); promotion of innovation and free 
public research (Switzerland); and support for private initiatives aimed at scientific progress 
(Costa Rica). 
</p>
<p>14. Key challenges confronting States include the lack of human capacity, in particular 
scientists; inadequate science education and trained teachers; insufficient equipment and 
infrastructure; a paucity of public or private funding; and absence of targeted national plans 
or programmes (see submissions by Costa Rica, Georgia, Guatemala, Mauritius, Peru, 
Serbia, Uruguay and Viet Nam). Additionally, some States mentioned a low level of 
intellectual property protection (Costa Rica, Mauritius), brain drain (Mauritius), lack of 
national scientific journals (Guatemala) and ineffective models of transfers of technology 
(Uruguay, Viet Nam). The need for more effective involvement of sectors of society that 
would benefit from research and development was also stressed (Uruguay). Furthermore, 
the diverse and dispersed character of a population may present challenges for realizing this 
right, particularly for marginalized groups with a diminished ability to safeguard their 
interests in the context of specific research projects (Canada, Viet Nam). 
</p>
<p>15. States have taken steps to address the above-mentioned challenges, especially in the 
area of scientific education and international cooperation. These steps include promoting 
scientific cooperation and connecting scientists internationally, offering scholarships and </p>


<p>student exchanges, sharing information, exchanging equipment, ensuring technology 
transfers and entering into technical cooperation agreements (Canada, Costa Rica, 
Germany, Greece, Japan, Peru, Serbia, Spain, Uruguay). Measures have been taken to 
promote access to the Internet, open access to scientific knowledge, the dissemination of 
scientific knowledge among the public and public participation in science-related matters. 
Specific programmes address disparities in access to scientific advances by, inter alia, 
women and persons with disabilities,5 and in rural communities (Peru). Some States 
facilitate the participation of women in scientific enterprise (Germany, Greece, Japan, 
Serbia, Spain, Viet Nam).  
</p>
<p><b> C. Relationship with other human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The rights to science and culture: a strong link 
</b></p>
<p>16. The rights to science and culture are interlinked. Importantly, the Human Rights 
Council, in its resolution 10/23, established the mandate on cultural rights. In resolution 
19/6, the Council renewed the mandate, deeming it necessary to reaffirm &#8220;he right of 
everyone to take part in cultural life and to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its 
applications. 
</p>
<p>17. The two rights have interesting similarities. Both relate to the pursuit of knowledge 
and understanding and to human creativity in a constantly changing world. The preparatory 
work on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights reflected the intention of the drafters to include a 
provision promoting universal access to science and culture.6 In addition, it has been 
suggested that, at the signing of the Universal Declaration, &#8220;the United Nations had come to 
envision the sharing of scientific and cultural knowledge as something that could unite an 
international community &#8211; a common task that would contribute to cross-cultural 
understanding and yield a more secure world&#8221;7 and that these international norms require a 
public good approach to knowledge innovation and diffusion&#8221;.8 This idea is reflected in the 
Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO), mandated to protect &#8220;the world&#8217;s inheritance of books, works of art and 
monuments of history and science&#8221; and to encourage international &#8220;cooperation in all 
branches of intellectual activity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>18. A prerequisite for implementing both rights is ensuring the necessary conditions for 
everyone to continuously engage in critical thinking about themselves and the world they 
inhabit, and to have the opportunity and wherewithal to interrogate, investigate and 
contribute new knowledge with ideas, expressions and innovative applications, regardless 
of frontiers. More precisely, the right to participate in cultural life entails ensuring 
conditions that allow people to reconsider, create and contribute to cultural meanings and 
manifestations in a continuously developing manner.9 The right to enjoy the benefits of 
science and its applications entails the same possibilities in the field of science, understood 
as knowledge that is testable and refutable, including revisiting and refuting existing 
theorems and understandings. Finally, both cultural and science-related rights encompass

<p>the right to benefit from the creativity of others while protecting the moral and material 
interests emanating from &#8220;any scientific, literary or artistic production&#8221;.10 
</p>
<p>19. The bond between the right to science and the right to participate in cultural life is 
reflected in the discussions led by UNESCO on 16 and 17 July 2009, in Venice, Italy, 
involving academics and United Nations partners, including the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the 
World Trade Organization (WTO), that culminated in the Venice Statement on the Right to 
Enjoy the Benefits of Scientific Progress and its Applications. At the event, participants 
stressed that access to the benefits of scientific progress not only allowed improving one&#8217;s 
socio-economic situation, but also gave the opportunity to take a meaningful part in the life 
of communities, whether they are local, national or international.11 One example is new 
information communication technologies, which not only influence culture but are 
becoming an intrinsic part of culture as everyday practice. The rights to science and to 
culture should both be understood as including a right to have access to and use information 
and communication and other technologies in self-determined and empowering ways.  
</p>
<p>20. The link between the right to science and the right to culture can be further 
understood with regard to people&#8217;s ability to &#8220;aspire&#8221;. A growing body of literature 
suggests that the ability to aspire &#8211; namely, to conceive of a better future that is not only 
desirable but attainable &#8211; is an important cultural capability that needs to be supported and 
developed, especially among the marginalized and vulnerable.12 Aspirations embody 
people&#8217;s conceptions of elements deemed essential for a life with dignity. Never a mere 
individual exercise, aspirations are informed by, and in turn inform, communities of shared 
cultural values and draw upon cultural heritage, including accessible accumulated scientific 
knowledge. New scientific knowledge and innovations increase available options, thereby 
strengthening people&#8217;s capacity to envisage a better future for which access to specific 
technologies may sometimes be pivotal.13 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Linkages with other rights 
</b></p>
<p>21. Given the enormous impact that scientific advances and technologies have on the 
daily lives of individuals and peoples, the right to science must be read in conjunction with 
freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and 
ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers,14 the right of everyone to take part in the conduct 
of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives,15 and the right of all 
peoples to self-determination.16 The right to development as the &#8220;constant improvement of 
the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active,

<p>free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits 
resulting therefrom&#8221;17 must also be taken into consideration.  
</p>
<p>22. Indeed, one key aspect of the right to science relates to the opportunities given to 
individuals and peoples to make informed decisions after considering both the possible 
improvements offered by scientific advances and their potential side effects or dangerous 
usages. One important aspect of the discussion is determining what is to be regarded as 
&#8220;benefits&#8221; or &#8220;scientific progress&#8221;. This consideration must be guided by instruments such 
as Limburg principle 11, stressing that popular participation at all stages is &#8220;indispensable 
to achieving progress in realizing economic, social and cultural rights&#8221;;18 Principle 10 of the 
Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, which reiterates the importance of 
access to information and participation in decision-making processes; and the Convention 
on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in 
Environmental Matters. 
</p>
<p>23. The right to science is sometimes considered a prerequisite for the realization of a 
number of other human rights. The full use of technical and scientific knowledge is 
explicitly mentioned in article 11(2) (a) of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights with respect to the right to food.19 The link with other human rights, such as the 
rights to health, water, housing and education, as well as the right to development and the 
emerging right to a clean and healthy environment, is also obvious.20 Some national case 
law on access to health care can help to develop conceptual understanding of the right to 
science. In 2001, for example, the Supreme Court of Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) 
found that the failure of the Venezuelan Institute for Social Security to ensure a regular and 
consistent supply of the drugs needed by HIV-positive persons covered by it constituted, 
inter alia, a violation of the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress.21  
</p>
<p><b> III. Scope, normative content and obligations of States  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Scope 
</b></p>
<p>24. Science must be understood as knowledge that is testable and refutable, in all fields 
of inquiry, including social sciences, and encompassing all research. The terms &#8220;benefits&#8221; 
of science and &#8220;scientific progress&#8221; convey the idea of a positive impact on the well-being 
of people and the realization of their human rights. The &#8220;benefits&#8221; of science encompass not 
only scientific results and outcomes but also the scientific process, its methodologies and 
tools.

<p><b> B. Normative content and related obligations of States  
</b></p>
<p>25. The normative content of the right to benefit from scientific progress and its 
applications includes (a) access to the benefits of science by everyone, without 
discrimination; (b) opportunities for all to contribute to the scientific enterprise and 
freedom indispensable for scientific research; (c) participation of individuals and 
communities in decision-making; and (d) an enabling environment fostering the 
conservation, development and diffusion of science and technology.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Access by all without discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>26. The right to science connotes, first of all, a right of access: scientific knowledge, 
information and advances must be made accessible to all, as stated in article 2 of the 
International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, without discrimination of 
any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or 
social origin, property, birth or other status. Access must be to science as a whole, not only 
to specific scientific outcomes or applications. 
</p>
<p>27. The right to have access to scientific knowledge is pivotal for the realization of the 
right to science. At the juncture of the right to education and the right to information, it 
implies a right to science education, understood as a right to be introduced to and informed 
about main scientific discoveries and their applications, regardless of frontiers. It also 
entails education instilling a spirit of scientific inquiry.22 Popularizing science outside 
schooling is also important. Interesting measures such as &#8220;science week&#8221;, the introduction 
of &#8220;science caf&#233;s&#8221; and the opening of science museums with specific educational 
approaches contribute to this objective.23  
</p>
<p>28. Access to scientific information for researchers is essential. Some States have taken 
steps to promote such access. In Spain and the United States of America, for example, 
researchers principally supported through public funds must make public a digital version 
of their research no later than 12 months after publication.24 Germany referred to the Berlin 
Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities, which may be 
signed by various stakeholders. The Special Rapporteur also notes with great interest the 
development of open-access journals and repositories, and the importance of mandatory 
open-access policies implemented by some universities and research institutions, which 
&#8220;incorporates local research into interoperable network of global knowledge, increases 
</p>
<p>impact of local research, providing new contacts and research partnerships for authors, and 
removes professional isolation&#8221;.25 
</p>
<p>29. Another aspect is the right to have access to scientific applications and technologies. 
One core principle is that innovations essential for a life with dignity should be accessible 
to everyone, in particular marginalized populations. The potential implications of scientific 
advances likely to have a significant impact on human rights, such as electricity, 
information and communication technologies, nanotechnology and synthetic biology, need 
attention.26

<p>30. States should ensure that the benefits of science are physically available and 
economically affordable on a non-discrimination basis.  
</p>
<p>31. The non-discrimination obligation demands eliminating both de jure and de facto 
barriers. In particular, positive steps must be taken for marginalized populations, such as 
people living in poverty and persons with disabilities, as well as the elderly,27 women and 
children,28 to ensure non-discriminatory access to scientific information, processes and 
products. Specific measures encompass eliciting the priority needs of such populations 
through a consultative process and facilitating targeted research by both public and private 
sector institutions. 
</p>
<p>32. As indicated in their responses to the questionnaire, some States have taken steps in 
this respect. For example, Uruguay encourages research with a high social impact and has 
established participatory mechanisms for identifying needs. Mauritius has established 
research groups to address priority issues, including with regard to food, water and building 
research capacity.29 Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur was informed that Burkina Faso 
has addressed issues concerning food security, suitable rice varieties and the environment, 
science and technology solutions to poverty, and water management, particularly in the 
context of raising cattle.30 Specific research is also being conducted in the area of 
Aboriginal health, rare diseases including those affecting unique ethnic groups, diseases 
associated with the elderly and the disabled.31  
</p>
<p>33. Incentives and purposive funding are being used to promote appropriate research; 
this includes &#8220;innovation prizes&#8221; in developed and developing countries to address societal 
needs, especially in the areas of health, food and the environment. Preceded by a 
consultative process, prizes expand opportunities for smaller innovators that would 
otherwise have no access to funding, and can bring together government, the private sector 
and philanthropic interests.32  
</p>
<p>34. Affordability is crucial and may require delinking research and development costs 
from product prices, as proposed by the World Health Organization in its global strategy 
and plan of action on public health, innovation and intellectual property.33 The proposed 
innovative models enhance broad and affordable access, especially when they exclude 
time-limited legal monopolies that have the ultimate effect of increasing product prices. 
These could be applied to other areas as well. Intellectual property protection and product 
prices can also be delinked through innovation inducement prizes that reserve a percentage 
of prize monies for individuals and institutions ready to share knowledge, materials and 
technologies for product development. When combined with open-source dividend reward 
programmes, this encourages collaboration rather than competition.34

<p>35. Other initiatives include the International Drug Purchase Facility (UNITAID), which 
extends access to most impoverished groups by means of funds generated through taxing 
airfare purchases to negotiate lower prices for essential medicines, accelerate the 
distribution of medicines and create incentives for developing new treatments. It has 
catalysed the development of nine new paediatric HIV medications, leveraged price 
reductions of up to 60 per cent for several key treatments, and greatly enhanced access to 
treatment for children.35 
</p>
<p>36. Access to the Internet and information communication technologies is an 
increasingly important area of action.36 The Committee on Economic Social and Cultural 
Rights stressed that Governments must respect and protect freedom of information and 
expression, including on the Internet to ensure the implementation of article 15 of the 
Covenant.37 With the Internet emerging as a critical platform for scientific and cultural 
flows and exchanges, freedom of access to it and maintaining its open architecture are 
important for upholding the right of people to science and culture.  
</p>
<p>37. Significant gaps in computer use and access to the Internet for reasons of income, 
education, gender and geographic location persist.38 In response, interesting initiatives have 
been adopted. For example, Estonia has ensured a rate of access to the Internet of 90 per 
cent, including a broadly accessible online network of resources and services available to 
researchers, students and teachers.39 India has promoted access for poor communities.40 
Other programmes include providing computers to children and students (Greece, Portugal, 
Uruguay), computer training for women, refugees and other forced migrants (Azerbaijan), 
extending telecommunication networks to reach remote ethnic minorities (Viet Nam) and 
adopting a list of universal services, including public fixed telephone networks enabling 
quality Internet access (Serbia).41 Another noteworthy example, the Global Digital 
Solidarity Fund, launched by Senegal and supported by several States, aims at ensuring 
&#8220;affordable and fair access to the information technologies and their contents for 
</p>
<p>everybody, especially marginalized groups&#8221; and promoting &#8220;such access as a basic right in 
both the public and private domains&#8221;.42 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur notes the initiatives of WIPO to increase the availability of 
scientific and technical information in developing countries, such as the Access to Research 
for Development and Innovation programme, and to support open access to scientific 
knowledge. In its response, WIPO suggests that &#8220;new models of communication and open 
access to educational resources and scientific literature, particularly via digital means, 
should be developed based on national and regional experiences.&#8221; A priority in the WIPO 
Development Agenda &#8220;is to promote the role of IP rights in enhancing wider and more 
user-friendly distribution of content as a tool to promote innovation and scientific 
advancement as well as for reducing the &#8220;Digital Divide&#8217;&#8221;.43

<p><b> 2. Freedom indispensable for scientific research and opportunities for all to contribute 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the scientific enterprise 
</b></p>
<p>39. Freedom of scientific research means ensuring that the scientific enterprise remains 
free of political and other interference, while guaranteeing the highest standards of ethical 
safeguards by scientific professions.  
</p>
<p>40. Read in conjunction with the right to the freedoms of association, expression and 
information, scientific freedom encompasses the right to freely communicate research 
results to others, and to publish and publicize them without censorship and regardless of 
frontiers. The right of scientists to form and join professional associations as well as to 
collaborate with others in their own country and internationally, including the freedom to 
leave and re-enter their own country, must also be respected and protected. In addition, 
scientific freedom involves respecting the autonomy of higher education institutions and the 
freedom of faculty and students to, inter alia, express opinions about the institution or 
system in which they work, and to fulfil their functions without discrimination or fear of 
repression by the State or any other actor. 44 
</p>
<p>41. The Venice Statement emphasizes that freedom of inquiry is vital for advancing 
knowledge on a specific subject, procuring data and testing hypotheses for some practical 
purpose, as well as for promoting further scientific and cultural activity. In the preamble to 
its recommendation on the status of scientific researchers, UNESCO called for measures 
enabling scientists to work in a spirit of intellectual freedom to pursue, expound and defend 
the scientific truth as they see it, and to help define the aims and objectives of the 
programmes they are engaged in and the methods adopted. It stressed the right of scientific 
researchers to &#8220;express themselves freely on the human, social or ecological value of 
</p>
<p>certain projects and, in the last resort, withdraw from those projects if their conscience so 
dictates&#8221;; it also recommended strong whistle-blower protections.  
</p>
<p>42. Freedom of scientific research includes the right of everyone to participate in the 
scientific enterprise, without discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, language, 
religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. 
Barriers to scientific research and opportunities for entering the science professions of 
certain sectors of society must be overcome. The Special Rapporteur also notes efforts to 
enhance popular participation in science, such as DIYbio, an online hub for sharing ideas 
and cost-effective methodologies and associated non-profit laboratories such as Genspace, 
and the Open Science Project, dedicated to writing and releasing free and open-source 
scientific software.45 Evidence indicates that providing access to scientific know-how and 
facilitating experimentation by concerned populations can result in more cost-effective 
context-appropriate technological innovations.46  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Participation of individuals and communities in decision-making  
</b></p>
<p>43. Reasons of the importance of the participation of individuals, communities and 
peoples in science-related decision-making include, in particular (a) the obligation to 
protect all persons, including marginalized populations, such as indigenous peoples, against 
the negative consequences of scientific testing or applications on, in particular, their food 
security, health or environment; and (b) the need to ensure that scientific research is 
conducted on key issues, including for the most vulnerable. Major decisions regarding

<p>19) and Appadurai (see footnote 12). </p>


<p>funding and research priorities, science policies, emerging areas of research, and new 
technological applications should entail a participatory process.  
</p>
<p>44. Some States have initiated public consultations on scientific advances. The Societal 
Dialogue on Nanotechnologies in the Netherlands, for example, catalysed the formulation 
of a public agenda, &#8220;Responsibly forward with nanotechnologies&#8221;, that was submitted to 
the Government for its consideration.47 In India, wide-ranging public consultations led the 
Government to impose a moratorium on Bt brinjal.48 A number of countries use consensus 
conferences, citizens&#8217; dialogues or other consultative mechanisms49 to elicit the views of 
the public.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. An enabling environment for the conservation, development and diffusion of science 
</b></p>
<p>45. Under article 15, paragraph 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, States undertake to take the steps necessary for the conservation, 
development and diffusion of science. These three interconnected aspects are essential. 
</p>
<p>46. Conservation requires the identification and safeguarding of scientific knowledge, 
products and tools, including literature, databases, specimens and equipment.  
</p>
<p>47. Development demands an explicit commitment to the development of science and 
technology for human benefit by, for example, developing national plans of action. Usually, 
this implies the adoption of programmes to support and strengthen publicly funded 
research, to develop partnerships with private enterprises and other actors, such as farmers 
in the context of food security, and to promote freedom of scientific research.  
</p>
<p>48.  &#8220;Diffusion&#8221; encompasses the dissemination of scientific knowledge and 
applications both within the scientific community and in society at large, including through 
publishing research findings. As noted by UNESCO in the preamble to its recommendation 
on the status of scientific researchers, open communication of the results, hypotheses and 
opinions of research lie at the heart of the scientific process, and also provide the strongest 
guarantee of accuracy and objectivity of scientific results. The diffusion of science is a 
precondition for public participation in decision-making and essential for fostering further 
research, development and applications.50  
</p>
<p><b> C. The issue of limitations 
</b></p>
<p>49. The right to benefit from scientific progress and its applications, including scientific 
freedom, may be subjected to limitations, in accordance with relevant international 
standards. The Special Rapporteur recalls that such limitations must pursue a legitimate 
aim, be compatible with the nature of this right and be strictly necessary for the promotion 
of general welfare in a democratic society, in accordance with article 4 of the Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Any limitations must be proportionate: the least 
restrictive measures must be taken when several types of limitations may be imposed. 
Furthermore, existing international human rights standards on limitations that can or cannot 
be legitimately imposed on rights intrinsically linked to the right to science, such as the

<p>rights to freedom of opinion and expression, to information and to association,51 must be 
taken into consideration. 
</p>
<p>50. More specifically, the Declaration on the Use of Scientific and Technological 
Progress stresses the importance of ensuring that the results of scientific and technological 
developments are used for the purpose of human rights and freedoms in accordance with 
the Charter of the United Nations. Noting that scientific and technological developments 
can give rise to social problems, as well as threaten the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of the individual, States are called upon to protect all strata of the population both 
socially and materially, from possible harmful effects of the misuse of scientific and 
technological developments&#8221;.52 In this regard, the Special Rapporteur stresses the 
importance of the precautionary principle: &#8220;in the absence of scientific consensus, caution 
and the avoidance of steps are required in case an action or policy might cause severe or 
irreversible harm to the public or the environment,&#8221; and of the obligations of states to 
&#8220;monitor the potential harmful effects of science and technology, to effectively react to the 
</p>
<p>findings and inform the public in a transparent way&#8221;.53  
</p>
<p>51. Conducting research in a socially responsible manner in accordance with ethical 
standards is emphasized in article 14 of the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome 
and Human Rights. Rights and freedoms that may be most threatened by the conduct of 
scientific research, especially those involving exposure or contact and social science 
research eliciting personal data, are the rights to physical and intellectual integrity, liberty 
and security, to privacy, and to seek, receive and impart information.54 The prohibition to 
submit a person to medical and scientific experimentation without his or her free consent 
must be specifically underlined.55 States responses to the questionnaire describe various 
measures adopted to address these concerns.56 
</p>
<p>52. Marginalized populations with limited financial or political power and scientific 
awareness run a greater risk of violations as human research subjects.57 In its general 
comment No. 20, the Human Rights Committee elucidated that special measures are needed 
to protect persons incapable of giving their consent and vulnerable populations, such as 
prison inmates. The Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine also 
contains important provisions on the issue of consent.58 Safeguarding the rights of research 
subjects must include benefit-sharing and providing remedies in the event of abuse. The 
UNESCO Universal Declaration on Human Rights and Bioethics and the development of 
National Bioethics Committees are examples of legal and institutional frameworks for the 
protection of research subjects.  
</p>
<p>53. One way to ensure the respect of ethical standards in scientific research is through 
codes of ethical standards developed and maintained by discipline-specific professional 
organizations. Currently, however, these codes are rarely based explicitly on human rights 
standards; for example, the codes of only 11 of the 261 organizations affiliated with the 
world&#8217;s largest multidisciplinary scientific membership organization, the American 
</p>
<p>Association for the Advancement of Science, refer to human rights. Several focus on

<p>scientists&#8217; rights; only a few provide standards for respecting human rights in the conduct 
of work. Developing codes of conduct explicitly informed by human rights thus seems 
essential.  
</p>
<p>54. Many States have taken measures to oversee research methods and the conduct of 
science in the public sector. The research practices of private institutions receive less 
scrutiny, however. This area requires greater attention, particularly when companies 
undertake research that would be illegal in one country but which, owing to a lack of legal 
protections, are possible in another. As stressed by the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, States have an obligation to take steps to prevent human rights 
contraventions abroad by corporations which have their main office under their jurisdiction, 
without infringing the sovereignty or diminishing the obligations of the host States. 59 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur also received information that assessments made pursuant to 
certain agreed international standards &#8220;are insufficient to determine the hazard(s) of certain 
</p>
<p>chemicals&#8221;, and &#8220;have been criticized by civil society as an inadequate reflection of 
scientific progress in detecting the hazards of chemicals&#8221;. It has been further argued that the 
reluctance of regulators to use general peer-reviewed and published scientific evidence of 
chemicals hazard(s) may &#8220;impede the application of the benefits of scientific progress by 
effectively limiting access to relevant information in decision-making processes&#8221;.60 This 
requires further attention. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Areas for further consideration 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The right to science and intellectual property rights 
</b></p>
<p>56. Concern has been widely expressed about the conflict between the right to science 
and intellectual property rights, in particular since the adoption of the WTO Agreement on 
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).61 Bilateral and/or regional 
trade and investment agreements containing &#8220;TRIPS plus&#8221; provisions or restricting TRIPS 
flexibilities can also pose problems.62 The potential of intellectual property regimes to 
obstruct new technological solutions to critical human problems such as food, water, health, 
chemical safety, energy and climate change requires attention.63

<p>if necessary, be limited to uphold other rights.64 The intellectual property regime is a 
temporary monopoly that &#8220;should be managed in accordance with a common responsibility 
</p>
<p>to prevent the unacceptable prioritization of profit for some over benefit for all&#8221;.65 
</p>
<p>58. In its response to the questionnaire, WIPO stated that, &#8220;in order for the international 
patent system to continue to serve its fundamental purpose of encouraging innovation and 
promoting dissemination and transfer of technology, the right balance should be struck 
between the rights of technology holders and the rights of technology users for the benefit 
of society as a whole.&#8221; A number of exceptions and flexibilities in treaties, such as the Paris 
Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the International Convention for 
the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, may be used to ensure compatibility with, in 
particular, the right to science. A wide range of policy space given to States, 
&#8220;asymmetries&#8221;, allow &#8220;different standards of IP protection provided the principles and 
substantive provisions are fulfilled&#8221;. The TRIPS Agreement reduced this policy space 
although it, too, incorporates some &#8220;flexibilities&#8221;.66  
</p>
<p>59. These flexibilities are important tools to ensure respect for human rights; they need 
to be explored further and applied more consistently. The Special Rapporteur recalls, 
however, that &#8220;a number of developing countries, while attempting to implement TRIPS 
flexibilities to address public health concerns, have experienced pressures from developed 
countries and multinational pharmaceutical corporations&#8221;.67 Similar concerns have been 
expressed in other fields.68 She also notes that, in accordance with intellectual property 
treaties, States must establish &#8220;minimum standards of protection&#8221;, and that surpassing these 
may not always be compatible with human rights standards. Furthermore, it is pertinent to 
assess whether existing minimum standards accord with human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>60. The relationship between intellectual property regimes and human rights has been 
most comprehensively addressed in the context of health,69 although it is now receiving 
more attention in the contexts of the right to food and of climate change. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur notes that new incentives have been proposed to ensure 
innovation and access to medicines at affordable costs, in particular for those living in 
extreme poverty. Importantly, the WTO Doha Declaration<b> </b>on the TRIPS Agreement and 
public health explicitly recognizes that the TRIPS Agreement &#8220;can and should be 
interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO Members&#8217; right to protect 
</p>
<p>public health&#8221;, and reaffirmed the right to use the flexibilities included in the Agreement for 
this purpose. Generic competition has emerged as a most effective strategy, for example 
allowing a reduction of up to 99 per cent in the cost of drugs.70 Interesting case law is also 
developing on this issue. In 2008, for example, in India, the High Court of Delhi dismissed 
a case brought by a multinational pharmaceutical company claiming that the generic 
manufacturing of a lung cancer drug infringed on its patent rights. The ruling was based, in 
part, on the court finding that upholding the multinational&#8217;s patent rights would violate the 
right to life of those without access to its drugs.  
</p>
<p>62. Incentives can be provided through &#8220;patent pools&#8221; that enable several patent holders 
to license their patents to third parties. This increases access by reducing the time in which 
drugs become available, lowers drug costs by promoting collaboration rather than

<p>competition, and facilitates new drug combinations for simpler treatment. The UNITAID 
Medicines Patent Pool, for example, encourages new generic formulations by facilitating 
patent-sharing and streamlining the production of new medicines in currently 
underresearched areas. A new royalty-free license for patents on the HIV/AIDS 
antiretroviral drug Darunavir introduced by the United States National Institutes of Health 
led to Gilead Science licensing its patents on several drugs to the Patent Pool.  
</p>
<p>63. In the field of agricultural biotechnology, initiatives include the multi-country Public 
Intellectual Property Resource for Agriculture, in which more than 40 public institutions 
seek to lower barriers created by intellectual property regimes and to facilitate technology 
transfer. Research is also encouraged by such open-source experiments as the Biological 
Open Source (BiOS) License, which offers researchers free access to key technologies 
provided that they share any improvements made to these tools under the BiOS open source 
license regime.71  
</p>
<p>64. A separate, often raised concern relates to the threat posed by &#8220;bioprospecting&#8221; for 
traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples and other local communities. In response, 
many States are developing databases for the documentation and conservation of traditional 
knowledge. Interesting models for protecting traditional knowledge from misappropriation 
include the India Traditional Knowledge Digital Library 
(www.tkdl.res.in/tkdl/langdefault/common/), which provides national patent offices with 
access to 223,000 indigenous medicinal formulations. As a result, at least two patents have 
been withdrawn and more than 75 applications withdrawn, rejected or amended. Some 
States, such as, Brazil, Guatemala, Peru and Portugal, have taken measures to give legal 
protection to the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities to their accumulated 
scientific knowledge. Further discussion is needed, however, on the modalities and 
conditions under which others should benefit from such accumulated knowledge, and how 
to allow further development and dissemination of such knowledge while safeguarding the 
moral and material interests of the individual or collective creators. Agrobiodiversity, 
maintained and transmitted as a common public good by local farmers, also needs to be 
addressed.72 WIPO is currently conducting &#8220;text-based negotiations&#8221; with a view to 
reaching an agreement on an international legal instrument(s) which &#8220;will ensure the 
effective protection of genetic resources, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural 
expressions&#8221;.73 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur points out that legal scholars have increasingly questioned 
the economic effectiveness of intellectual property regimes in promoting scientific and 
cultural innovation. Scholars have found no evidence to support the assumption that 
scientific creativity is only galvanized by legal protection or that the short-term costs of 
limiting dissemination are lower than the long-term gain of additional incentives. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, the Special Rapporteur proposes the adoption of a public good approach to 
knowledge innovation and diffusion, and suggests reconsidering the current maximalist 
intellectual property approach to explore the virtues of a minimalist approach to IP 
protection.74 Recalibrating intellectual property norms that may present a barrier to the right

<p>to science and establishing greater coherence among them seem to be necessary steps. The 
Special Rapporteur stresses the need to guard against promoting the privatization of 
knowledge to an extent that deprives individuals of opportunities to take part in cultural life 
and to enjoy the fruits of scientific progress, which would also impoverish society as whole.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Equitable sharing of benefits and transfer of technologies 
</b></p>
<p>66. The need to promote everyone&#8217;s access to science and its applications raises the 
issue of the sharing of benefits and the transfer of scientific knowledge and technologies.  
</p>
<p>67. Two declarations made by UNESCO that address the issue in the field of biomedical 
research, its conduct, outcomes and applications are a useful starting point. The Universal 
Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights states that &#8220;benefits resulting from any 
scientific research and its applications should be shared with society as a whole and within 
the international community, in particular with developing countries&#8221;. In article 15, it 
recognizes multiple forms of benefit-sharing, including &#8220;special and sustainable assistance 
to, and acknowledgement of, the persons and groups that have taken part in the research; 
access to quality health care; provision of new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities or 
products stemming from research; support for health services; access to scientific and 
technological knowledge; and capacity-building facilities for research purposes&#8221;. The 
International Declaration on Human Genetic Data, in its article 19, addresses benefit-
sharing in almost identical terms. Important provisions may also be found in part IV of the 
International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.75 Numerous 
United Nations documents, including some relating to the environment, biological diversity 
and climate change, emphasize the need to strengthen international cooperation in the area 
of science, develop the scientific and technological capacity of developing countries, ensure 
the international dissemination of scientific knowledge and research, particularly among 
industrialized and developing countries, and call for transfers of technologies, practices and 
procedures.76 A number of regional texts (see paragraphs 9 &#8211; 12  above), should also be 
recalled.  
</p>
<p>68. The implied obligation for developing countries is the prioritization of the 
development, importation and dissemination of simple and inexpensive technologies that 
can improve the life of marginalized populations, rather than innovations that 
disproportionately favour educated and economically affluent individuals and regions.77 
The corresponding obligation for industrialized States is to comply with their international 
legal obligations through the provision of direct aid, financial and material, as well as the 
development of international collaborative models of research and development for the 
benefit of developing countries and their populations.

<p>69. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the WIPO programmes on capacity-building 
and technical assistance in the area of technology transfer.78 
</p>
<p><b> C. Third-party actors and their obligations 
</b></p>
<p>70. The diminishing role played by the State in research and development and the 
concomitant extensive increase in the involvement of the private sector are reducing the 
ability of Governments to identify priority research areas, conduct research and disseminate 
resultant products.  
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur believes that, in the area of science, States should not rely 
entirely on the private sector; they should make all efforts possible to ensure publicly 
funded research, enter into partnerships with the private sector, and ensure that private 
companies respect human rights. This includes setting out clearly &#8220;the expectation that all 
business enterprises domiciled in their territory and/or jurisdiction respect human rights 
throughout their operations&#8221;, including abroad.
</p>
<p> 79 
</p>
<p>72. Initiatives to influence the actions of private companies for better realization of the 
right to science include &#8220;socially responsible&#8221; or &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; licensing, which ensures 
that the licensing of intellectual assets, often developed by Government-funded research at 
universities, is negotiated and transacted in a manner conducive to providing broad 
affordable access to disadvantaged sections of society, particularly in developing countries. 
It also makes proprietary research tools widely available for the advancement of knowledge 
and has been applied to innovations in, for example, medicine, agriculture and diagnostic 
tools. Strategies include issuing non-exclusive licenses, allowing licensors to license a 
product for humanitarian and commercial purposes simultaneously; licensing to a public-
private partnership to develop a product that may, for example, benefit a neglected market; 
and conditional licensing, which requires social responsibility on the part of the licensee, 
for example, to sell a product at a reduced price to poor markets. Such licensing does not 
affect business transactions in developed countries where significant profits can still be 
achieved while ensuring access for least developed countries.  
</p>
<p>73. Examples from the United States of America include the Food and Drug 
Administration Act, which rewarded the development of a new tropical disease medication 
by issuing a transferable voucher that entitles the bearer to a priority review for any other 
drug it submits for market approval in the United States, and Yale University, which 
renegotiated its license agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb to allow generic production in 
South Africa at a price reduced by thirty-fold .80 
</p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) States ensure that innovations essential for a life with dignity reach
