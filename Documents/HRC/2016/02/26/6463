<p><b>7/&#8230; The role of good governance in the promotion  
and protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard 
of achievement of all peoples and all nations applying to every individual and every 
organ of society, and also the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,<b>1</b> which 
affirmed that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. 
<b>1
</b>  A/CONF.157/23. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the resolution of the Commission on Human Rights 2005/68 of 20 April 2005 
and all previous relevant resolutions on the role of the good governance in the promotion of 
human rights, as well as the United Nations Millennium Declaration, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the importance of a conducive environment, at both the national and the 
international levels, for the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms and of the 
mutually reinforcing relationship between good governance and human rights,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that transparent, responsible, accountable and participatory government, 
responsive to the needs and aspirations of the people, including women and members of 
vulnerable and marginalized groups, is the foundation on which good governance rests and that 
such a foundation is an indispensable condition for the full realization of human rights, including 
the right to development,  
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that democracies have embedded institutional advantages incontestably 
favourable to sustainable development, and that when based on the respect for human rights, 
they provide political incentives to Governments to respond to the needs and demands of the 
people, allow for more informed and extensive policy dialogue, are more adaptable, and create 
necessary checks and balances on Government power, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the leading role played by the United Nations in developing and promoting 
democracy and human rights, and recognizing the role of other processes, including the 
International Conference of New or Restored Democracies and the Community of Democracies, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also</i> the importance of international and regional cooperation, when required 
by the States in need, in order to facilitate the implementation of good governance and 
anti-corruption practices at all levels,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that good governance at the national and international levels is essential for 
sustained economic growth, sustainable development and the eradication of poverty and hunger, 
as reflected in the 2005 World Summit Outcome,  
</p>
<p><i> Noting with satisfaction</i> the outcomes of the respective conferences of the Community 
of Democracies, held in Warsaw in 2000, in Seoul in 2002, in Santiago in 2005 and in Bamako 
in 2007, at which the States committed themselves to build on shared principles and goals to </p>

 <p></p>
<p>promote democracy in all regions of the world, to support the integrity of democratic processes 
in societies on the democratic path and to coordinate policies to enhance the effectiveness of 
democratic governance, 
</p>
<p><i> Realizing</i> that the fight against corruption at all levels plays an important role in the 
promotion and protection of human rights and in the process of creating an environment 
conducive to their full enjoyment,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the increasing awareness in the international community of the detrimental 
impact of widespread corruption on human rights, through both the weakening of institutions and 
the erosion of public trust in government, as well as through the impairment of the ability of 
Governments to fulfil their human rights obligations, particularly the economic and social rights 
of the most vulnerable and marginalized, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that effective anti-corruption measures and the protection of human 
rights are mutually reinforcing and that the promotion and protection of human rights is essential 
to the fulfilment of all aspects of an anti-corruption strategy, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with attention</i> the outcome of the first and second sessions of the Conference of the 
States parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption, held in Dead Sea, Jordan, 
in 2006, and in Bali, Indonesia, in 2008, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the note by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
transmitting the report on the United Nations Conference on anti-corruption, good governance 
and human rights, held in Warsaw, on 8 and 9 November 2006, by the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, and noting the main themes discussed during the 
seminar: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The impact of corruption on human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Human rights and good governance in the fight against corruption; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The role of civil society, the private sector and the media; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Fighting corruption while safeguarding human rights; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 2. <i>Invites</i> States to consider ratifying or acceding to the United Nations Convention 
against Corruption and to promote transparency, accountability, prevention and enforcement as 
key principles of anti-corruption efforts; 
</p>
<p> 3.  <i>Welcomes</i> the publication of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights entitled &#8220;Good Governance Practices for the Protection of Human Rights&#8221;,<b>2</b> 
pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/68, and requests the Office of the 
High Commissioner to prepare a publication on anti-corruption, good governance and human 
rights, drawing on the results of the Warsaw conference; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of the question of the role of good governance, 
including the issue of the fight against corruption in the promotion and protection of human 
rights, at a future session.
