ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On August 4, 2016, the Company entered into the Second Omnibus Amendment ("Amendment")
of its existing agreements with Pacific Leaf Ventures, LP ("Pacific Leaf").  The Amendment
eliminates Pacific Leaf's option to purchase up to a 20% membership interest in GB Sciences
Nevada LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("GBS") and reduces Pacific Leaf's
existing royalty rate to 16.4% of the gross sales revenue of GBS.  It also caps maximum
aggregate royalty payments to be made to Pacific Leaf at $2,420,000 with respect to any
calendar year. In consideration of the amended terms, Pacific Leaf will receive 1,000,000 shares
of the Company's common stock and a five-year warrant to purchase 1,500,000 shares of the
Company's common stock at $0.36 per share.
On August 9, 2016, the Company finalized a settlement agreement in final disposition of the
lawsuit filed by the Company on April 2, 2014, in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York.  The suit is more particularly described in Part I, Item 3 of the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on July 14, 2016.  The Company's obligation under the agreement is to issue
1,400,000 shares of restricted common stock to certain non-affiliates of the Company.
ITEM 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of
Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On August 5, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors accepted the resignation of John Poss as
Chief Financial Officer of the Company and appointed Ksenia Griswold as the Company's Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Poss will continue to serve as the President, Chief
Executive Officer, and Chief Operating Officer of the Company. Ms. Griswold has been serving as
the controller of the Company since November, 2015.  For the five years prior to that time
beginning in October, 2010, she worked in the Las Vegas, Nevada office of Ernst & Young, LLP. 
At the time of her departure from Ernst & Young, she was audit manager.  It is expected that an
amendment to Ms. Griswold's employment agreement and compensation will be negotiated
during the upcoming fiscal quarter.
