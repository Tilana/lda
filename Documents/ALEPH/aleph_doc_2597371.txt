Almaden Minerals Ltd.
Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
Unaudited - Expressed in Canadian dollars
1.    Nature of Operations
Almaden Minerals Ltd. (the “Company” or “Almaden”) was formed by amalgamation under the laws of the Province of
British Columbia, Canada on February 1, 2002.  The Company is an exploration stage public company that is engaged
directly in the exploration and development of exploration and evaluation properties in Canada and Mexico.  The
address of the Company’s registered office is Suite 1710 –1177 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6E
2L3.
The Company is in the business of exploring and developing mineral projects and its principal asset is the Ixtaca
precious metals project located on its Tuligtic claim in Mexico.  The Company has not yet determined whether this
project has economically recoverable mineral reserves.  The recoverability of amounts shown for mineral properties is
dependent upon the establishment of a sufficient quantity of economically recoverable reserves, the ability of the
Company to obtain the necessary financing or participation of joint venture partners to complete development of the
properties and upon future profitable production or proceeds from the disposition of exploration and evaluation assets.
2.     Basis of Presentation
(a) Statement of Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements, including comparatives, have been prepared in accordance
and compliance with International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 34, Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and interpretations of the International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”).
(b) Basis of preparation
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
This interim financial report does not include all of the information required of a full annual financial report and is
intended to provide users with an update in relation to events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of
the changes in financial position and performance of the Company since the end of the last annual reporting period.  It is
therefore recommended that this financial report be read in conjunction with the annual audited financial statements of
the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015. However, this interim financial report provides selected significant
disclosures that are required in the annual audited consolidated financial statements under IFRS.
Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of
application as the annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, with the
exception of the following new accounting standards and amendments which the Company adopted and are effective for
the Company's interim and annual consolidated financial statements commencing January 1, 2016:
IFRS 7: Amended to require additional disclosures on transition from IAS 39 and IFRS 9.

Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
Unaudited - Expressed in Canadian dollars
2.    Basis of Presentation (Continued)
(b) Basis of preparation (continued)
The following new accounting standards and amendments are effective for future periods and have not been adopted by
the Company:
Revenue recognition
IFRS 15 - In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("IFRS 15") which
supersedes IAS 11 – Construction Contracts; IAS 18 – Revenue; IFRIC 13 – Customer Loyalty Programmes; IFRIC 15 –
Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate; IFRIC 18 – Transfers of Assets from Customers; and SIC 31 – Revenue
– Barter Transactions involving Advertising Services. IFRS 15 establishes a single five-step model framework for
determining the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a
customer. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017, with early adoption
permitted. The Company is currently considering the impact, if any, of the standard on its future consolidated financial
statements.
Financial instruments
IFRS 9 - In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments ("IFRS 9") to replace IAS 39 –
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 provides a revised model for recognition and
measurement of financial instruments and a single, forward-looking 'expected loss' impairment model. IFRS 9 also
includes a substantially reformed approach to hedge accounting. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning
on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently considering the impact, if any, of the
final standard on its future consolidated financial statements.
Leases
IFRS 16 - In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 – Leases ("IFRS 16") which replaces IAS 17 – Leases and its
associated interpretative guidance. IFRS 16 applies a control model to the identification of leases, distinguishing
between a lease and a service contract on the basis of whether the customer controls the asset being leased. For those
assets determined to meet the definition of a lease, IFRS 16 introduces significant changes to the accounting by lessees,
introducing a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to current finance lease accounting, with limited
exceptions for short-term leases or leases of low value assets. Lessor accounting remains similar to current accounting
practice. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early application
permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the final standard is expected
to have on its consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently considering the impact, if any, of the standard
on its future consolidated financial statements.

3.    Significant accounting policies
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all note disclosures required by IFRS for
annual financial statements, and therefore should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2015.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for fair presentation of
the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been included.  Operating results for the
three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for
the year ending December 31, 2016.
4.    Accounts receivable and prepaid expenses
 
    Accounts receivable and prepaid expenses consist of the following:
Accounts receivable $270,268  $ 235,983
Prepaid expenses    180,611    147,481
 $450,879  $ 383,464
June 30,   December 31, 
 
 2016
2015
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred value added taxes of $70,181 (December 31, 2015 -
$159,689) included in exploration and evaluation assets as the value added tax relates to certain projects and will be
recovered when the assets are sold (Note 7).
5.    Deposit on Mill Equipment
On October 19, 2015, the Company entered into a Mill Purchase Option Agreement to acquire the Rock Creek mill. 
Pursuant to the agreement, Almaden has the exclusive right and option to purchase the mill for a total of US$6,500,000,
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances (the “Option”).
On November 25, 2015, the Company issued 407,997 common shares at a fair value of $0.67 per share, for a total fair
value of $273,358.
In order to exercise the Option, Almaden must make option payments according to the following schedule:
 
On execution of agreement:

13.    Financial instruments
The fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and trade and other payables
approximate their carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
The Company’s financial instruments are exposed to certain financial risks, including currency risk, credit risk, liquidity
risk, interest rate risk and commodity and equity price risk.
 
(a)Currency risk
 
The Company’s property interests in Mexico make it subject to foreign currency fluctuations and inflationary pressures
which may adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  The Company is
affected by changes in exchange rates between the Canadian Dollar, the US dollar and Mexican peso.  The Company
does not invest in foreign currency contracts to mitigate the risks.
As at June 30, 2016, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through the following assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the applicable subsidiary:
All amounts in Canadian dollars
Cash and cash equivalents
Accounts receivable and prepaid expenses   -
US dollar  Mexican peso 
 
 $549,868  $ 180,687

13.    Financial instruments (Continued)
 
(a)Currency risk (continued)
 
A 10% change in the US dollar exchange rate relative to the Canadian dollar would change the Company’s net loss by
$40,000.
A 10% change in the Mexican peso relative to the Canadian dollar would change the Company’s net loss by $32,000.
 
(b)Credit risk
 
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held in large Canadian financial institutions.  These investments mature
at various dates during the twelve months following the statement of financial position date.  The Company’s excise tax
included in accounts receivables and prepaid expenses consists primarily of sales tax due from the federal government
of Canada. The Company is exposed to credit risks through its accounts receivable.
To mitigate exposure to credit risk on cash and cash equivalents, the Company has established policies to limit the
concentration of credit risk with any given banking institution where the funds are held, to ensure counterparties
demonstrate minimum acceptable credit risk worthiness and ensure liquidity of available funds.
As at June 30, 2016, the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of its cash and cash
equivalents and accounts receivable.
 
(c)Liquidity risk
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.  The Company
manages liquidity risk through the management of its capital structure.
Trade and other payables are due within twelve months of the statement of financial position date.
 
(d)Interest rate risk
 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market interest rates. The Company is exposed to varying interest rates on cash and cash equivalents. The
Company has no interest bearing debt.
A 1% change in the interest rate would change the Company’s net income by $60,000.
 
(e)Commodity and equity price risk
 
The ability of the Company to explore its exploration and evaluation assets and the future profitability of the Company
are directly related to the market price of gold and other precious metals.  The Company monitors gold prices to
determine the appropriate course of action to be taken by the Company.  Equity price risk is defined as the potential
adverse impact on the Company’s performance due to movements in individual equity prices or general movements in
the level of the stock market.

capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to pursue the exploration of its
exploration and evaluation assets and to maintain a flexible capital structure which optimizes the costs of capital at an
acceptable risk.
The Company manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and
the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.  To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may attempt to
issue new shares and, acquire or dispose of assets.
In order to maximize ongoing exploration efforts, the Company does not pay out dividends.  The Company’s investment
policy is to invest its short-term excess cash in highly liquid short-term interest-bearing investments with short term
maturities, selected with regards to the expected timing of expenditures from continuing operations.
The Company expects its current capital resources will be sufficient to carry its exploration plans and operations for the
foreseeable future.
