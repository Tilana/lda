<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The independent expert, in his first report, explored his mandate pursuant to 
resolution 2005/55 of the Commission on Human Rights. In the second report (A/HRC/4/8), he 
identified key areas of focus in international solidarity, namely, international cooperation; global 
responses to natural disasters, agricultural pests and diseases, and third generation rights. 
Practical examples were provided of specific considerations and priority areas that should be 
taken note of in dealing with these concerns.  
</p>
<p>2. International solidarity by its nature covers a broad range of areas of cooperation and 
assistance. This does pose a challenge in identifying specific areas of focus in the independent 
expert&#8217;s work. In accordance with his mandate, in the present report, the independent expert 
considers it important to establish the legal framework of international cooperation in human 
rights conventions and treaties and how the obligation of international cooperation has evolved 
in human rights instruments. This will be the first in a series of reports to deepen study on the 
key areas of focus in the mandate, with a view to developing a framework to analyse 
international solidarity, establishing the main elements and elaborating on the content of the right 
of peoples and individuals to international solidarity. 
</p>
<p>3. In its resolution 6/3, the Human Rights Council urged the international community to 
consider urgently concrete measures to promote and consolidate international assistance to 
developing countries in their endeavours for development and for the promotion of conditions 
that make possible the full realization of all human rights. 
</p>
<p>4. In his second report, the independent expert defined international solidarity as the union of 
interests or purpose among the countries of the world and social cohesion between them, based 
upon the dependence of States and other international actors on each other, in order to preserve 
the order and very survival of international society, and in order to achieve collective goals 
which require international cooperation and joint action. In this definition, the key words include 
&#8220;union of interests or purpose&#8221;, interdependence and international cooperation, and joint action. 
The independent expert maintained that the definition should not be restricted to the action of 
States and has emphasized that the term &#8220;global solidarity&#8221; is broader as it does encompass the 
relationship of solidarity between States and other actors, such as international organizations, 
and civil society. 
</p>
<p>5. In the present report, the independent expert will also highlight the preliminary steps that 
will be taken towards preparing a draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to 
international solidarity. Human Rights Council resolution 6/3 also took into account the urgent 
need to further develop guidelines, standards, norms and principles with a view to promoting and 
protecting the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity. Human Rights Council 
resolution 7/5 reiterated that the Independent Expert seek views and contributions from 
Governments, United Nations agencies, other relevant international organizations and 
non-governmental organizations in the discharge of his mandate.<b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 
</b></p>
<p>6. International solidarity and international cooperation are based on the foundation of shared 
responsibility. In the broadest sense, solidarity is a communion of responsibilities and interest 
between individuals, groups and States, connected by the ideal of fraternity and the notion of 
cooperation. The relationship between international solidarity and international cooperation is an 
integral one, with international cooperation as a core vehicle by which collective goals and the 
union of interests are achieved. 
</p>
<p>7. The purpose of the study of international assistance and cooperation in this report is to 
emphasize that such cooperation must be oriented, as a matter of priority, toward the realization 
of all human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights, and internationally agreed 
goals such as the Millennium Development Goals, and must respond swiftly and effectively to 
grave situations such as natural disasters. 
</p>
<p><b>International cooperation and collective obligations in international human rights 
instruments 
</b></p>
<p>8. The essence of international cooperation can be found in the purposes contained in the 
United Nations Charter. Article 1.1 states &#8220;To achieve international co-operation in solving 
international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, and in 
promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all 
without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.&#8221; An entire chapter of the Charter 
(Chap. IX) is devoted to international economic and social cooperation. Articles 55 and 56 
establish international legal obligations in relation to international cooperation and assistance. 
</p>
<p>9. International cooperation and assistance is also firmly established within international 
human rights instruments. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in article 28, states that 
&#8220;everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth 
in this Declaration can be fully realized&#8221;. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights contains explicit references to international assistance and cooperation for the 
realization of the rights guaranteed therein: article 2 draws attention to the obligation of all States 
parties to take steps &#8220;individually and through international assistance and cooperation, 
especially economic and technical&#8221;, towards the full realization of the rights recognized in the 
Covenant. Article 11.2 emphasizes as well the obligation to take steps, individually and through 
international cooperation, to ensure the right to be free from hunger. The importance of 
collective obligations was reaffirmed by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
in its general comment No. 3 on the nature and scope of international legal obligations. Similar 
obligations have been laid out for other rights as well.<b>1</b>

(E/C.12/1999/10, para. 56), CESCR general comment No. 14, article 12, The right to the highest 
attainable standard of health (E/C.12/2000/4, para. 45), CESCR general comment No. 15, 
The right to water (E/C.12/2002/11, para. 38), CESCR general comment No. 17, The right of 
everyone to benefit from the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any 
 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>10. In its general comments and concluding observations, the Committee has emphasized the 
need for international cooperation. As an illustration, general comment No. 14 on the human 
right to adequate health emphasizes individual and joint obligations of Government relating to 
the control of disease, and the physical and economic accessibility and affordability of essential 
medicines. It also stipulates that the United Nations specialized agencies, the World Bank, 
regional development banks, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) should cooperate effectively with States parties in this respect. 
</p>
<p>11. Collective obligations are also central to the interpreting of the nature and scope of 
international legal obligations under article 4 of Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), 
which deals with international cooperation. The general comments of the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child affirm that parties take upon themselves obligations not only to implement it 
within their jurisdiction, but also to contribute, through international cooperation, to global 
implementation. The Committee further emphasized that &#8220;international cooperation&#8221; entails 
international development and financial cooperation, including international cooperation to 
support States in fulfilling their obligations under the Convention, and to ensure that 
international organizations including the World Bank, IMF and the WTO give primary 
consideration to the full implementation of the Convention.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>12. International cooperation is also a core theme in the Declaration on the Right to 
Development adopted in 1986. Articles 3 and 4 stipulate that States have a duty to cooperate 
with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development and 
recognize the obligation of States to take steps, individually and collectively, to formulate 
international development policies with a view to facilitating the full realization of the right to 
development. The former independent expert on the right to development, in his reports, has 
pointed out the primary responsibilities of States to ensure the right to development, but also 
stated that it cannot be achieved without other members of the international community, 
including other States and international organizations, what he refers to as &#8220;contingent 
obligations&#8221;. He included in these &#8220;contingent obligations&#8221;, eliminating &#8220;obstacles&#8221; and 
cooperating in trade, debt, finance, technology transfer, and development assistance. 
He augmented this reasoning by suggesting the idea of &#8220;development compacts&#8221;, where 
cooperation may be required to achieve the complete realization of a human right. The 
Millennium Development Goals could be viewed as a form of a development compact, where 
Governments and international organizations have coalesced behind the realization of these goals 
by 2015. Millennium Development Goal 8 makes explicit mention of a &#8220;global partnership for 
development&#8221;, covering targets regarding aid, debt, trade and transfer of technologies. The seven 
Millennium Development Goals and their targets can only be achieved pursuing international 
cooperation implicit in the concept of a &#8220;global partnership for development&#8221;.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>13. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child have required all States parties to report on all obstacles to the achievement of 
rights, and the identification of specific obstacles that can impede their full achievement has been 
an important element of the Committees&#8217; analytical and fact-finding framework. In its 
consideration of reports of States parties, the Committees have highlighted the importance of 
specific obstacles - including resource constraints, significant foreign debt, economic transition, 
and structural adjustment that can restrict progress in achieving the full realization of economic, 
social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>14. Recent international human rights conventions such as the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities include a stand-alone article on international cooperation which shows 
the evolution of the obligation in human rights instruments and underscores its importance. 
References to international cooperation can be found in articles 2 and of the Disability 
Convention, the latter provision emphasizing inclusion of and accessibility to persons with 
disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b>International cooperation:  potential application of the &#8220;tripartite typology&#8221; of respect, 
protect and fulfil 
</b></p>
<p>15. In the present report, the independent expert would like to explore the potential application 
of the &#8220;tripartite typology&#8221; of respect, protect and fulfil to the area of international cooperation. 
Given the broad mandate of international solidarity, it is also crucial to identify and differentiate 
the responsibilities that can be assigned to States, international organizations and non-State 
actors in reference to international assistance and cooperation; however this will not be studied 
in depth in this report. 
</p>
<p>16. In response to the classification of civil and political rights as merely entailing negative 
obligations and economic, social and cultural rights as entailing positive obligations, typologies 
of rights were elaborated that countered this binary proposition. The Draft Articles on State 
Responsibility elaborated by the International Law Commission (ILC) clearly establish that 
international obligations can be breached by both acts of <i>omission </i>and acts of <i>commission</i>.<b>3</b> 
There is by now a significant body of authoritative standards that clearly establish that all 
human rights - civil, political, economic, social, and cultural - can give rise to both negative and 
positive obligations. The three essential aspects of international obligation in relation to all 
human rights are the obligations to respect, protect and fulfil. 
</p>
<p>17. The obligation to respect concerns a lack of interference with the enjoyment of all human 
rights, including the freedom from forced evictions and the right to satisfy basic needs. The 
obligation to protect implies that States are under a positive obligation to ensure the protection of 
individuals from violations by third parties. The obligation to fulfil means that States are under a 
positive obligation to take measures effectively to secure the full realization of human rights.
</p>
<p>

</i></p>
<p><i>International Law Commission on the Work of its Fifty-third Session</i>, A/56/10. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>This can be achieved by taking legislative, budgetary, administrative and other measures to 
promote the achievement of human rights, including facilitating opportunities for the 
achievement of human rights and by direct provision when rights are denied. 
</p>
<p>18. This typology of rights has had a major influence on the evolution of thinking on 
economic, social and cultural rights. It has been adopted in a number of general comments, 
including by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its general comments 
No. 12 on the human right to adequate food, No. 14 on the human right to the highest attainable 
standard of health and No. 15 on the human right to water.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>19. The typology of respect, protect and fulfil is a useful framework to interpret provisions 
on international assistance and cooperation. As an illustration, while asserting that the primary 
obligation to realize the right to food rests with national Governments, the former Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food noted that Governments also have &#8220;extranational obligations&#8221; 
to respect, protect and facilitate the right to food. The duty to respect extends to actions that have 
a negative impact on the right to food for people in other countries.<b>5</b> There is also a duty for 
States to abstain from any policy that impinges on the protection of at least the core content of 
the economic, social and cultural rights of the affected peoples of another State. This can be 
seen in general comment No. 8 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
on the relationship between economic sanctions and respect for economic, social and  
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>20. The responsibilities of States can be viewed as extending to responsibility for the 
organizations of which they are members, including their participation in international and 
regional organizations.<b>6</b> These responsibilities can include the obligation to respect and protect. 
States must abstain from participating in decisions of international financial institutions that may 
obstruct or hinder the realization of economic, social and cultural rights. In concrete terms, the 
duty to protect requires developed States to avoid involvement in any international assistance

<p>and cooperation programme which may have a negative effect on the enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural rights.<b>7</b> On the obligation to fulfil, the precise content at the international level 
is yet to be worked out but could include facilitating, providing and promoting rights.<b>8</b> </p>
<p><b>Nature and scope of the obligation of international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>21. The nature of the responsibilities that arise out of international cooperation will also be 
preliminarily explored in this report, namely, the range of actions that fall broadly within the 
category of international cooperation in human rights instruments. The obligations related to 
international assistance and cooperation are complementary to the primary responsibility of 
States to meet their national human rights obligations. International cooperation rests on the 
premise that developing countries may not possess the necessary resources for the full realization 
of rights set forth in human rights covenants and conventions. There is a shared responsibility for 
development met by States&#8217; national obligations and the obligations of international cooperation, 
facilitating global implementation. 
</p>
<p>22. International cooperation is most often conflated with international development 
assistance, as mainly reflected in the volume of development assistance. The divergent 
interpretations of international cooperation range from judicial, administrative and technical 
cooperation, to cooperation for development. While international cooperation includes 
development cooperation, it is a much broader term. The issue of international cooperation 
featured prominently in the discussions and negotiations on the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. It was emphasized by delegates from developed and developing States 
that international cooperation was not a synonym for development assistance and the transfer of 
resources from North to South. Many substantive dimensions of international cooperation were 
evoked, ranging from the transfer of resources and technical assistance and cooperation, to 
policy advice, and the international sharing and exchange of experience, expertise and good 
practice to assist in effective implementation, networking and workshops, development of 
technologies. These various elements of international cooperation can be found in article 32 of 
the Convention. 
</p>
<p>23. Even in the context of development cooperation, in broader human rights terms, 
international cooperation should also ideally cover the obligation to respect and to protect, 
namely the obligation respectively to abstain from interference with economic, social and 
cultural rights in other countries, and to prevent third parties under a State&#8217;s control  from 
interfering with these rights.<b>9</b> It should however be noted that various committees under human

 <p> 
</p>
<p>rights instruments, such as the Committee on Economic, Social and Economic Rights and the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child, have also made specific recommendations on 
development cooperation, urging Governments to meet internationally agreed targets, including 
the United Nations target for international development assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross 
domestic product (GDP). 
</p>
<p>24. In terms of international solidarity and the areas of focus in the independent expert&#8217;s 
mandate, more attention will be given to international cooperation to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals and respond to natural disasters. There is an emphasis within that context on 
the mobilization of resources and the need to ensure that countries which are authentically 
committed to achieving the Goals and have done all within their power to do so will be provided 
with the additional resources necessary to enable them to meet the Millennium Development 
Goals.<b>10</b> At some point, the reiteration of commitments to achieve the Millennium Development 
Goals in documents such as the Millennium Declaration, the Johannesburg World Summit on 
Sustainable Development and the Monterrey Consensus, will start to provide a strong argument 
that such obligation has crystallized into customary law.<b>11</b> In response to natural disasters, the 
obligation of international cooperation is cemented in human rights law. The Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stated that States and international organizations have a 
joint and individual responsibility to cooperate in providing disaster relief and humanitarian 
assistance in times of emergency.<b>12</b> In disaster relief and emergency assistance, priority is to be 
given to Covenant rights.<b>13</b> The independent expert will in future work concentrate on the global 
response to natural disasters, specifically international cooperation in the light of natural 
disasters and the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>II. PRELIMINARY STEPS TOWARDS DEVELOPMENT 
AND PREPARATION OF A DRAFT DECLARATION 
ON THE RIGHT OF PEOPLES AND INDIVIDUALS TO 
INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY 
</b></p>
<p>25. The independent expert has been mandated with the task of preparing a draft declaration 
on the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity. Human Rights Council 
resolution 6/3 also took into account the urgent need to further develop guidelines, standards, 
norms and principles with a view to promoting and protecting the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>26. The process towards a draft declaration or even the further development of guidelines, 
standards, norms and principles require elaboration of a rigorous conceptual framework for 
human rights and international solidarity, on the basis of extensive deliberations and inputs. 
As requested in relevant Human Rights Council resolutions, the independent expert intends to 
seek views and contributions from Governments, United Nations agencies, other relevant 
international organizations and non-governmental organizations in the discharge of his mandate 
through a draft questionnaire to solicit their input on the content, scope and nature of obligations 
for the promotion and protection of the rights of peoples and individuals to international 
solidarity (see Annex). The received input will be analysed with the purpose of planning 
incremental steps towards the further development of guidelines and standards and a draft 
declaration. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUDING REMARKS 
</b></p>
<p>27. International solidarity by its nature covers a broad range of areas of cooperation and 
assistance. This does pose a challenge in identifying specific areas of focus in the independent 
expert&#8217;s work. In accordance with his broad mandate, in this report, the independent expert 
considered it important to establish the legal framework of international cooperation in human 
rights conventions and treaties and how the obligation of international cooperation has evolved 
in human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>28. International solidarity and international cooperation are based on the foundation of shared 
responsibility. In the broadest sense, solidarity is a communion of responsibilities and interest 
between individuals, groups and States, connected to the ideal of fraternity and the notions of 
cooperation. The relationship between international solidarity and international cooperation is an 
integral one, with international cooperation as a core vehicle by which collective goals and the 
union of interests are achieved. 
</p>
<p>29. International cooperation is well established in international law, in human rights 
instruments, including covenants and conventions and is also a core theme in the Declaration on 
the Right to Development adopted in 1986. Millennium Development Goal 8 makes explicit 
mention of a &#8220;global partnership for development&#8221;, covering targets on aid, debt, trade and 
transfer of technologies. The seven other Millennium Development Goals and their targets can 
only be achieved through the pursuance of international cooperation implicit in the concept of a 
&#8220;global partnership for development&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>30. The typology of respect, protect and fulfil delineate essential aspects of international 
obligations in relation to all human rights and is a useful framework to interpret provisions on 
international assistance and cooperation. 
</p>
<p>31. The obligations related to international assistance and cooperation are complementary to 
the primary responsibility of States to meet their national human rights obligations. There is a 
shared responsibility for development met by States&#8217; national obligations and the obligations of 
international cooperation, facilitating global implementation. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>32. International cooperation, while conflated with international development assistance is a 
broader term and can range from transfer of resources to technical assistance and cooperation, to 
policy advice, international sharing and exchange of experience, expertise and good practice to 
assist in effective implementation, networking and workshops, development of technologies, as 
elaborated in article 32 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>33. To conclude, international assistance and cooperation must be oriented, as a matter of 
priority, to the realization of all human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights, 
internationally agreed goals such as the Millennium Development Goals and must respond 
swiftly and effectively to grave situations such as natural disasters, which will be further 
explored in the future. </p>

<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>DRAFT QUESTIONNAIRE TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO 
STATES, INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND 
      NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>Purpose:  To identify the basic parameters of the principle of international solidarity and 
human rights 
</p>
<p>1. According to the independent expert, the principle of international solidarity is defined as 
the union of interests or purposes among countries, and social cohesion between them, 
based upon the dependence of States and other international actors on each other, in order 
to preserve the order and very survival of international society, and in order to achieve 
collective goals, which require international cooperation and joint action. Recalling that the 
principle of international solidarity is essential in responding to current global challenges, 
what is your position regarding international solidarity as a principle in human rights law? 
</p>
<p>2. According to General Assembly resolution 55/2, solidarity is recognized as a fundamental 
value to be essential to international relations. With regard to the principles of international 
solidarity and the right to development, and human rights-based approaches, what is your 
opinion on international solidarity as one of the approaches to eradicate poverty? 
</p>
<p>3. The independent expert endorses three major areas of focus, namely, international 
cooperation; global responses to natural disaster, agricultural pests and diseases; and third 
generation rights. In your opinion, are those main areas sufficiently representative of 
today&#8217;s challenges/issues? 
</p>
<p>4. Global responses to natural disaster require further elaboration in international law. 
International solidarity is closely interconnected with humanitarian assistance, including 
global responses to natural disaster. Having said that, how do you perceive global 
responses to natural disaster within international solidarity and a human rights-based 
approach? 
</p>
<p>5. Recalling the establishment of third generation rights, and recalling solidarity rights as 
third generation rights, comprising inter alia, the right to economic and social 
development, the right to participate in and the benefit from the &#8220;common heritage of 
mankind&#8221;, the right to peace, the right to a healthy and sustainable environment, the right 
to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and the right to communication: 
</p>
<p> (a) Do you observe third generation rights in particular solidarity rights as an 
established, emerging, or lex lata human rights law? 
</p>
<p> (b) In your opinion, is there any particular right that should be established under 
solidarity rights other than those rights above mentioned? 
</p>
<p>6. The Millennium Development Goals could be considered as collective goals. How can 
international cooperation be strengthened in order to achieve them? </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. The right of development is one of the third generation rights which has been enshrined in 
several international instruments. The Declaration on the Right to Development recognized 
in 1986 the right to development as an inalienable human right. How do you perceive the 
right to development by means of international cooperation as the right of developing 
countries to reduce the gap existing between them and the developed countries?  
</p>
<p>8. Regarding question number 7, do you acknowledge the very existence of people&#8217;s right to 
development? 
</p>
<p>9. International solidarity itself is not a new notion, having been introduced by developing 
countries in the course of the 1970s. Correspondingly, international solidarity has been 
echoed in several international instruments (i.e. resolution 55/2). Having said that, what is 
your opinion on whether there are duties to realize international solidarity? 
</p>
<p>Recalling that the independent expert on human rights and international solidarity is in charge of 
preparing a draft declaration on the right of peoples to international solidarity, in case you have 
any suggestions, comments or advice, please do feel encouraged to do so in addition to responses 
to the questions above.
