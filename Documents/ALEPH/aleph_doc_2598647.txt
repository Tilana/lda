</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman">Revolving Credit Facility </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-
bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On August 10, 2016, 
Murphy Oil
Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) entered into a new credit agreement for a 
$1.2&nbsp;billion revolving credit facility (the &#147;New Revolving Credit 
Facility&#148;). The New Revolving Credit Facility will be a senior unsecured 
guaranteed
facility and will expire in August 2019. The Company presently has no borrowings
under the New Revolving Credit Facility. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-
bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Borrowings under the 
New
Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest at 4.50% above LIBOR and 
thereafter are subject to stepdowns based on consolidated leverage ratios set 
forth in the credit agreement for the New Revolving Credit Facility. In 
addition, facility
fees of 0.50% are charged on the full commitments under the New Revolving Credit
Facility. Beginning in the quarter ending March 31, 2017, if the Company&#146;s 
total leverage ratio exceeds 3.25 times the Company&#146;s trailing twelve month
consolidated adjusted EBITDAX (as defined in the credit agreement for the New 
Revolving Credit Facility), the New Revolving Credit Facility will be required 
to become secured, subject to limitations set forth in the documents governing 
the
Company&#146;s existing notes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-
bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The New Revolving 
Credit Facility also contains certain financial and other covenants, including a
maximum consolidated
debt ratio of 3.75x, and a minimum ratio of Adjusted EBITDAX to interest expense
of 2.50x. Furthermore, as a condition to availability, the Company is required 
to execute at least a $400 million capital markets offering. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman">In addition, on August 10, 2016 the Company entered into an amendment
of its existing revolving credit facility dated as of June&nbsp;14, 2011 among 
the
Company and the other borrowers and lenders party thereto (the &#147;Existing 
Credit Facility&#148;) to reduce the commitments of the existing lenders that 
have committed to the New Revolving Credit Facility and allow for the incurrence
of the New
Revolving Credit Facility. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt;
font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Lenders under the Existing Credit 
Facility that did not become lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility 
will remain
lenders under the Existing Credit Facility, with aggregate commitments of $630 
million, until its currently scheduled maturity in June 2017. </P> <P 
STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New
Roman">The
foregoing is qualified by reference to the full text of the New Revolving Credit
Facility agreement as well as the amendment to the Existing Credit Facility, 
which are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and each of 
which are
incorporated herein by reference. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-

23.1 hereto is the

font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On August 12, 2016, the Company 
announced that
it has priced an offering of $550 million 6.875% senior notes (the 
&#147;Notes&#148;) that will be due 2024, an increase from the previously
