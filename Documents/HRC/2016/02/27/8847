<p>1019. In a letter dated 29 December 2009, the Government of India responded to the 
communication sent on 29 July 2009 as follows. The Government has examined the 
communication and found the allegations to be inaccurate. No Government of India official 
contacted the subject in Geneva on 8 June 2009. As regards the allegation of a visit by an 
official of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to her house in Punjab, the allegation 
has been investigated by the local office of the CBI that has found it to be untrue. 
Subsequent to the allegation, the CBI has contacted the subject and provided her with 
contact details to help her in case any person approaches the subject at the behest of the 
CBI in future. <b>

<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1060 bis. In a letter dated 5 November 2009, the Government of Indonesia responded 
to the communication sent on 4 September 2009 as follows. On 21 August 2009, in 
Abepura, Jayapura District, the District Police conducted a criminal investigation based on 
</p>
<p> United Nations A/HRC/13/22/Add.1/Corr.1

<p>a report which cited Mr. Andreas Wakerwa as being in possession of weapons without a 
permit according to the terms of Article 2 paragraph (1) of Emergency Law No. 12 of 1951. 
In the course of the investigation, the police did confiscate several items of evidence which 
included a machete, two Badik blades, a bayonet, a weapon made from a cassowary bone 
awl, and a slingshot. But the bicycle pump mentioned in the letter of the Special Rapporteur 
as allegedly capable of being turned into a bomb was not confiscated, nor was Mr. 
Wakerwa arrested on that day. 
</p>
<p>1060 ter. Based on the detention warrant letter Ref. Pol. 
SP.HAN/158/VIII/2009/Reskrim, Mr. Wakerwa&#8217;s arrest and detention took place on the 
following day, 22 August 2009. However, in the absence of any conclusive evidence to the 
effect that weapons found at his premises were meant for offensive use, on 1 September 
2009, Mr. Wakerwa was released on the following conditions: 1., he would not attempt to 
leave the area; 2., he would not repeat his actions (i.e. being found in possession of 
weapons without a permit); and 3., he would not eliminate the evidence. In addition, he was 
to report regularly to the investigators. However, to date Mr. Wakerwa has failed to fulfil 
this last condition, namely to report to the investigators.  
</p>
<p>1060 quarter. As regards the handling of the investigation into possible criminal acts or acts 
of subversion being committed, or being contemplated, by Mr. Wakerwa following the 
discovery of his offence with regard to possession of weapons without a permit, it was 
carried out strictly in accordance with procedure. Furthermore, Mr. Wakerwa&#8217;s rights 
during the investigation and throughout his detention were fully respected. The Permanent 
Mission of Indonesia believes that, on the basis of the above clarifications, any doubts as to 
the fact that Mr. Wakerwa&#8217;s detention was connected to his job as a human rights defender 
have been conclusively dispelled.

<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1232 bis. In a letter dated 24 January 2010, the Government of Israel responded to the 
communication sent on 13 November 2009 as follows. In confronting the threat of 
terrorism and protecting its civilians from suicide bombers and other attacks, Israel, like 
other countries facing such threats, has found that the use of administrative detention is, on 
occasion, a necessary and effective measure. 
</p>
<p>1232 ter. Where sufficient and admissible evidence exists against an individual, the 
authorities are required to bring that individual to justice, rather than adopt such measures 
as administrative detention. Thus, this measure may be used as an exception only when the 
evidence in question is clear, concrete and trustworthy, but for reasons of confidentiality 
and protection of intelligence sources, cannot be presented as evidence in ordinary trial 
proceedings. Issuance of administrative detention orders against detainees who pose a 
danger to public security, in cases such as those outlined above, is recognized by 
international law and is in full conformity with Article 78 of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
of 1949. 
</p>
<p>1232 quater. As an additional safeguard, the measure is only used in cases where there is 
corroborating evidence that an individual is engaged in illegal acts that endanger security 
and the lives of civilians, and each administrative detention order is subject to judicial 
review. Administrative detention orders are limited to six months and any extension 
requires a re-evaluation of the relevant intelligence material, as well as further judicial 
review. Furthermore, local legislation governing the process grants all relevant individuals 
the right to appeal the order to the Military Court of Appeals for judicial review. Petitioners </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/22/Add.1/Corr.1 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>may be represented by counsel of their choice at every stage of these proceedings. All 
individuals have the additional right to petition the Israeli High Court of Justice for a repeal 
of the order. The judicial organs reviewing each and every order carefully examine whether 
the criteria outlined in case law and legislation are fully met. 
</p>
<p>1232 quinquies. Mr. Othman was detained in administrative detention in September 2009. 
The last order in his regard was issued on 22 December 2009, and was due to remain in 
force until 22 January 2010. In the judicial review of the order and after examination of the 
confidential material against Mr. Othman, the Court stated, inter alia, that the information at 
the basis of Mr. Othman&#8217;s detention was the suspicion that he was in contact with a foreign 
agent of a terrorist organization, a suspicion that Mr. Othman himself confirmed. The Court 
also stated that relevant considerations of protecting security and the public stood at the 
basis of the decision to extend his administrative detention. At no point was Mr. Othman&#8217;s 
political activity or personal views regarded as a basis for his detention. 
</p>
<p>1232 sexies. After weighing the respondent&#8217;s right for freedom versus the public interest, 
the Court affirmed the order but shortened it until 12 January 2010 in order to give the 
security forces additional time for investigation procedures. Mr. Othman was subsequently 
released from detention on 12 January 2010. Mr. Othman was represented by a lawyer in all 
the legal proceedings and court hearings in his regard.

<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2312 bis. In a letter dated 22 December 2009, the Government of Turkey responded to 
the communication sent on 27 August 2009. The Government forwarded the judgement 
dated 9 June 2009 of the Fifth Criminal Court of Diyarbakir concerning the sentencing of 
Mr. Cemal Bektas, who was condemned to 10 months of imprisonment for having carried 
out propaganda on behalf of a terrorist organization. The prosecution alleged that Mr. 
Cemal Bektas, President of the Association of Mutual Aid and Solidarity with the Relatives 
of the Disappeared, participated in a meeting on 8 June 2009 entitled &#8220;The Disappeared and 
the Reality in Turkey&#8221;, where he committed the offence of propagating for a terrorist 
organization. The prosecution requested that Mr. Bektas be sanctioned according to the 
provisions of Article 7/2 of the Law on Countering Terrorism and Article 53 of the Penal 
Code.  
</p>
<p>2312 ter. The Court found that the statement of Mr. Cemal Bektas amounted to 
propaganda on behalf of a terrorist organization, the PKK, the aim of which is to split a part 
of the territory of the Republic of Turkey in order to establish a Kurdish State based on 
Marxist-Leninist principles. The PKK is an armed terrorist group which has attempted, 
since its creation, to assert its authority in the region and throughout the country by 
blocking roads, extorting money and killing vulnerable persons in the villages it attacks. In 
its judgement, which is not yet final, the Court condemned Mr. Cemal Bektas to one year of 
imprisonment based on Article 7/2 of the Law on Countering Terrorism, which was 
amended by Article 6 of Law No. 5532. The Court also decided to reduce the sentence of 
Mr. Bektas by one sixth in accordance with Article 62 of the Penal Code, taking into 
account his tacit acceptance, his good behaviour and his conduct during the trial, and 
sentenced the defendant to 10 months in prison.
