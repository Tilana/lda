</p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Natural disasters, 1  i.e. the consequences of events triggered by natural hazards that 
overwhelm local response capacity and seriously affect the social and economic development of 
a region, are traditionally seen as situations creating challenges and problems mainly of a 
humanitarian nature. Less attention has been devoted to human rights protection which also 
needs to be provided in this particular context.  
</p>
<p>2. The tsunamis, hurricanes and earthquakes which hit parts of Asia and the Americas in 
2004/05 have highlighted the need to be attentive to the multiple human rights challenges that 
persons affected by such disasters may face. All too often their human rights are not sufficiently 
taken into account. The problems that are often encountered by persons affected by the 
consequences of natural disasters include: unequal access to assistance; discrimination in aid 
provision; enforced relocation; sexual and gender-based violence; loss of documentation; 
recruitment of children into fighting forces; unsafe or involuntary return or resettlement; and 
issues of property restitution. The affected populations are most often forced to leave their homes 
or places of residence because of the destruction of houses and shelter by volcanic eruptions, 
tsunamis, floods, drought, landslides, earthquakes and tornados. Thus, a high number of persons 
also become internally displaced as a result of such disasters or the fear of future damages.  
</p>
<p>3. Experience has shown that, while patterns of discrimination and disregard for economic, 
social and cultural rights may already emerge during the emergency phase of a disaster, the 
longer the displacement situation lasts, the greater the risk of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>4. Normally, situations affecting the human rights of persons affected by natural disasters 
are not consciously planned and implemented, but result from inappropriate policies or simple 
neglect. The vulnerability of the people affected often is the result of inadequate planning and 
disaster preparedness. As stated by the Secretary-General, &#8220;The risks and potential for disasters 
associated with natural hazards are largely shaped by the prevailing levels of vulnerability and 
the effectiveness of measures taken to prevent, mitigate and prepare for disasters&#8221;2. Once the 
people have been affected by a disaster, however, they often encounter further challenges to the 
full realization of their rights. These challenges could be avoided if the relevant human rights 
guarantees were taken into account, at the very outset, by national as well as international actors.  
</p>
<p>5. Human rights are the legal underpinning of all humanitarian work pertaining to natural 
disasters. There is no other legal framework to guide such activities, especially in areas where 
there is no armed conflict. If humanitarian assistance is not based on a human rights framework, 
it risks having too narrow a focus and cannot integrate all the basic needs of the victims into a 
holistic planning process. There is also the risk that factors important for recovery and 
reconstruction later on will be overlooked. Furthermore, neglecting the human rights of those 
affected by natural disasters effectively means no account will be taken of the fact that such 
</p>
<p>                                                 
1 The term &#8220;natural&#8221; disaster is used for ease. It is important to understand, however, that the magnitude of the 
consequences of sudden natural hazards is a direct result of the way individuals and societies relate to threats 
originating from natural hazards. The magnitude of the consequences is, thus, determined by human action, or the 
lack thereof.  
2 Report of the Secretary General to the General Assembly &#8220;On international cooperation on humanitarian assistance 
in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development&#8221;, A/60/227 </p>

people do not live in a legal vacuum. They live in countries with laws, rules and institutions that 
should protect their rights.  
</p>
<p>6. States are directly responsible for respecting, protecting and fulfilling the human rights of 
their citizens and other persons on their territory or under their jurisdiction. Whereas national 
humanitarian organizations are bound by their national laws, international humanitarian 
organizations, while not directly bound by international human rights treaties, accept that human 
rights underpin all of their actions. Therefore, they should do their utmost to ensure that these 
rights are protected &#8211; even beyond the strict wording of their mandates and in the interest of the 
people directly affected. All humanitarian organizations are under the obligation not to promote, 
actively participate in, or in any other manner contribute to, or endorse policies or activities, 
which do or can lead to human rights violations by States. The challenge often is how to apply 
these rules in an operational context, not least given the many humanitarian and human rights 
dilemmas potentially faced in situations of humanitarian disasters. 
</p>
<p>7. There are guidelines on humanitarian action in emergencies, including situations of 
natural disaster. There are also standards on protecting human rights in situations of armed 
conflict, internal displacement and refugee situations. Guidance is lacking, however, on how to 
protect the human rights of individuals affected by natural disasters.  
</p>
<p>8. These Operational Guidelines are addressed to intergovernmental and non-governmental 
humanitarian actors when they are called upon to become active just before or in the aftermath of 
a natural disaster. The Operational Guidelines do not list the rights of persons as enshrined in 
international law. Rather, they focus on what humanitarian actors should do in order to 
implement a rights-based approach to humanitarian action in the context of natural disasters.3 
They call on humanitarian actors to look beyond their core mandate and to have a holistic vision 
of the needs of the people they have been asked to serve. While these Guidelines have been 
drafted with the consequences of natural disasters in mind, most of them are also relevant in 
preparation for or after other kinds of disasters4 have struck.  
</p>
<p>9. These Operational Guidelines are informed by and draw on relevant international human 
rights law, existing standards and policies pertaining to humanitarian action, and human rights 
guidelines on humanitarian standards in situations of natural disaster. They cover relevant civil 
and political as well as economic, social and cultural rights. While natural disasters may occur in 
situations of armed conflict, international humanitarian law per se does not regulate the effects of 
such disasters. However, it may complement human rights law in such situations.  
</p>
<p>10. These Operational Guidelines are inspired by the understanding of human rights 
protection during disaster relief5. 
</p>
<p>11. Those affected by natural disasters, including those displaced by such events, remain, as 
residents and most often citizens of the country in which they are living, entitled to the protection 
of all guarantees of international human rights subscribed to by the State concerned. They are 
                                                 
3 Currently there are processes trying to address additional State responsibilities in the context of natural disaster 
relief, which run parallel to the immediate need of the humanitarian agencies for guidance. 
4 Such as disasters that have set on slowly, e.g. drought, or so-called &#8220;man-made&#8221; disasters.  
5 See Report of the Representative of the Secretary-General on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons, 
E/CN.4/2006/71, paragraphs 4 &#8211; 8. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/38/Add.1 
page 4 
 
also entitled to, if applicable, the protection of the guarantees of international humanitarian law 
or customary international law. People do not lose, as a consequence of their being displaced or 
otherwise affected by the disaster, the rights of the population at large. At the same time, they 
have specific needs, distinct from those of the non-affected population, which call for specific 
assistance and protection measures.  
</p>
<p>12. The primary duty and responsibility to provide such protection and assistance lies with 
the national authorities of the affected countries. Those affected by natural disasters have the 
right to request and receive such protection and assistance from their governments. The main 
duty bearers, thus, are the governments and administrations of the countries concerned.  
</p>
<p>13. Protection is not limited to securing the survival and physical security of those affected 
by natural disasters. It encompasses all relevant guarantees &#8211; civil and political as well as 
economic, social and cultural rights &#8211; attributed to them by international human rights and, 
where applicable, international humanitarian law. For practical reasons, these rights can be 
divided into four groups, namely: (a) rights related to physical security and integrity (e.g.: 
protection of the right to life and the right to be free of assault, rape, arbitrary detention, 
kidnapping, and threats to these rights); (b) rights related to basic necessities of life (e.g.: the 
rights to food, drinking water, shelter, adequate clothing, adequate health services, and 
sanitation); (c) rights related to other economic, social and cultural protection needs (e.g.: the 
rights to be provided with or have access to education, to receive restitution or compensation for 
lost property, and to work); and (d) rights related to other civil and political protection needs 
(e.g.: the rights to religious freedom and freedom of speech, personal documentation, political 
participation, access to courts, and freedom from discrimination). The first two groups of rights 
may be the most relevant during the emergency, life-saving phase. Only the full respect of all 
four groups of rights, however, can ensure adequate protection of the human rights of those 
affected by natural disasters, including of those who are displaced. 
</p>
<p>14. In all cases States have an obligation to respect, protect and to fulfil the human rights of 
their citizens and of any other persons in their territory or under their jurisdiction. States are 
therefore under the obligation: (a) to prevent violations of these rights from occurring or from re-
occurring; (b) to stop them while they are happening by making sure that its organs and 
authorities respect the rights concerned and protect victims against violations by third parties; 
and (c) to ensure reparation and full rehabilitation if a violation has happened. 
</p>
<p>15. Where the capacity and/or willingness of the authorities to fulfil their responsibilities 
is/are insufficient, the international community needs to support and supplement the efforts of 
the government and local authorities. The scope and complexity of many natural disasters call 
for the active involvement of organizations and groups, both within and outside the United 
Nations system, which possess special expertise and resources, including from among the 
displaced and host communities, as well as from civil society.  
</p>
<p>16. These Operational Guidelines constantly re-emphasize the need to ensure non-
discriminatory humanitarian assistance, as well as the need to consult with the affected people. 
This is not only a matter of fundamental human rights. It is also in the interest of good 
humanitarian practise and accountability and can avoid creating sources of future conflicts.  
</p>
<p>17. Finally, in order to ensure that the protection of the human rights of those affected by 
natural disasters, including those who are internally displaced, is effectively implemented, it is </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/38/Add.1 
 page 5 
 
essential to establish effective monitoring mechanisms, benchmarks and indicators. Disaster 
prevention, relief and recovery should be assessed as to whether they are being carried out in 
accordance with international human rights and humanitarian standards as outlined in these 
Operational Guidelines.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES ON HUMAN RIGHTS  
</b></p>
<p>AND NATURAL DISASTERS 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>General Principles 
</b></p>
<p>I. Persons affected by natural disasters should enjoy the same rights and freedoms under 
human rights law as others in their country and not be discriminated against. Targeted measures 
to address assistance and protection needs of specific categories of affected populations do not 
constitute discrimination if, and to the extent that, they are based on differing needs.  
</p>
<p>II. States have the primary duty and responsibility to provide assistance to persons affected 
by natural disasters and to protect their human rights. 
</p>
<p>III. Organizations providing protection and assistance to persons affected by natural disasters 
accept that human rights underpin all humanitarian action. In situations of natural disaster they 
should therefore respect the human rights of persons affected by disasters at all times and 
advocate for their promotion and protection to the fullest extent. Humanitarian organizations 
shall not promote, actively participate in, or in any other manner contribute to, or endorse 
policies or activities, which do or can lead to human rights violations by States. They shall strive 
to enable the affected people to exercise their own rights.  
</p>
<p>IV. Organizations providing protection and assistance in situations of natural disasters shall 
be guided by these Operational Guidelines in all of their activities, in particular when monitoring 
and assessing the situation and needs of affected persons, when programming and implementing 
their own activities as well as when entering into a dialogue with governmental authorities on the 
State&#8217;s duties and responsibilities under international human rights and, where applicable, 
international humanitarian and refugee law. In doing so, they shall remain accountable to all of 
their relevant stakeholders, in particular to the persons affected by the natural disaster. 
</p>
<p>V. All communities affected by the natural disaster should be entitled to easy accessible 
information concerning: (a) the nature and level of disaster they are facing; (b) the possible risk 
mitigation measures that can be taken; (c) early warning information; and (d) information on 
ongoing humanitarian assistance, recovery efforts and their respective entitlements. They should 
be meaningfully consulted and given the opportunity to take charge of their own affairs to the 
maximum extent possible and to participate in the planning and implementation of the various 
stages of the disaster response.  
</p>
<p>VI. These Operational Guidelines seek to improve the practical implementation of 
international instruments protecting human rights. They shall not be interpreted as restricting, 
modifying or impairing the provisions of international human rights or, where applicable, </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/38/Add.1 
 page 7 
 
international humanitarian and refugee law. They should be applied together with other relevant 
Codes of Conduct, Guidelines and Manuals.6  
</p>
<p>VII. Organizations providing protection and assistance in situations of natural disasters shall 
endeavour to have adequate mechanisms established to ensure that the Operational Guidelines 
are applied and that the human rights of the affected are protected.  
</p>
<p><b>Operational Guidelines 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.         Protection of Life, Security of the Person, Physical Integrity and dignity 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.1  Evacuations, relocations and other life-saving measures 
</b></p>
<p>A.1.1.  If an imminent natural disaster creates a serious risk for the life, physical integrity or 
health of affected individuals and communities, all appropriate measures necessary to protect 
those in danger, in particular vulnerable groups, should be taken to the maximum extent possible 
(e.g. emergency shelter arrangements). 
</p>
<p>A.1.2.  If such measures would be insufficient, endangered persons should be allowed, and 
assisted to leave the danger zone. To the extent that they cannot do so on their own, endangered 
persons should be evacuated from the danger zone by using all available means.  
</p>
<p>A.1.3.  These evacuations should be carried out in a manner that fully respects the rights to life, 
dignity, liberty and security of those affected. Measures should be taken to safeguard homes and 
common assets left behind. Evacuated persons should be registered and their evacuation 
monitored. 
</p>
<p>A.1.4.  When the natural disaster has occurred, persons affected by it should be allowed to move 
to other parts of the country and to settle there. This right may not be subject to any restrictions 
except those which are provided by law, and are necessary to protect national security, the safety 
and security of affected populations, public order (<i>ordre public</i>), public health or the rights and 
freedoms of others.  
</p>
<p>A.1.5.  Persons -- including evacuees -- who have been ordered or forced to flee or to leave their 
homes or places of habitual residence as a result of a natural disaster or its effects, or have left in 
order to avoid them, and have not crossed an internationally recognized State border should be 
treated as belonging to the category of internally displaced persons covered by the 1998 Guiding 
Principles on Internal Displacement. 
</p>
<p>A.1.6.  After the emergency phase, persons displaced by the natural disaster should be granted 
the opportunity to choose freely whether they want to return to their homes and places of origin, 
to remain in the area to which they have been displaced, or to resettle in another part of the 
country. Their right of choice may not be subjected to any restrictions except those which are 
provided by law, and are necessary to protect national security, the safety and security of 
affected populations, public order <i>(ordre public</i>), safety, public health or morals or the rights and 
freedoms of others. In particular, the return of persons displaced by the disaster to their homes 
                                                 
6 See the detailed references to codes of conduct, guidelines and manuals that are relevant in the context of natural 
disasters in the accompanying Manual. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/38/Add.1 
page 8 
 
and places of origin should only be prohibited if these homes or places of origin are in zones 
where there are real dangers to the life or physical integrity and health of the affected persons. 
Restrictions should only last as long as such dangers exist and only be implemented if other, less 
intrusive, measures of protection are not available or possible. 
</p>
<p>A.1.7.  Persons affected by the natural disaster should not, under any circumstances, be forced to 
return to or resettle in any place where their life, safety, liberty and/or health would be at further 
risk. 
</p>
<p>A.1.8.  Unless it is necessary for the protection of affected persons against very serious and 
imminent threats to their lives, their physical integrity or health, evacuations against their will, or 
prohibitions against their return, should not be supported by organizations providing protection 
and assistance to persons affected by natural disasters, even if they have been ordered by the 
competent authorities. Such organizations should not become involved in involuntary 
evacuations in any manner.  
</p>
<p><b>A.2 Protection against the negative impacts of natural hazards 
</b></p>
<p>A.2.1.  Persons affected by natural disasters, displaced or not, should be protected against the 
dangers of potential secondary hazards and other disaster risks.  
</p>
<p><b>A.3 Protection against violence, including gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p>A.3.1.  During and after the emergency phase, law enforcement personnel and local authorities 
should be encouraged to take effective measures to ensure the security of populations affected by 
the natural disaster. 
</p>
<p>A.3.2.  Mechanisms which are appropriate to address instances of violence and other violations 
of human rights, as well as of relevant guarantees under international humanitarian law, should 
be established without delay. In particular, the deployment of law enforcement personnel to areas 
at risk of or with a break down of law and order -- including sexual and gender-based violence, 
robberies, or looting -- should be requested. 
</p>
<p>A.3.3.  Appropriate measures should be taken as early and as quickly as possible to protect 
affected populations, in particular women and boy and girl children, against trafficking, forced 
labour and contemporary forms of slavery such as sale into marriage, forced prostitution, and 
sexual exploitation.   
</p>
<p>A.3.4.  Should the natural disaster have occurred in a country with an armed conflict, 
appropriate measures should be taken as soon as possible to ensure that children affected by the 
natural disaster are protected against being recruited or associated with armed forces or groups. 
</p>
<p><b>A.4 Camp security 
</b></p>
<p>A.4.1.  Persons displaced by the disaster should, to the maximum extent possible, be provided 
with the means to recover as quickly as possible and become self-sustainable (even in places of 
temporary displacement) or with fast rehabilitation assistance for return. Camps are a last resort 
and should only be established where, and until, the possibility of self-sustainability or fast 
rehabilitation assistance do not exist.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/38/Add.1 
 page 9 
 
A.4.2.  The location and lay-out of camps and settlements for persons displaced by the disaster 
should be situated in areas with a low natural hazard risk. They should be designed so as to 
maximize the security and protection of displaced persons, including women and others whose 
physical security is most at risk (e.g. children, older persons, persons with disabilities, single-
headed households and members of religious and ethnic minority groups or indigenous peoples).  
</p>
<p>A.4.3.  Security should be provided in camps, in particular by monitoring, through law 
enforcement personnel and camp committees drawn from among the displaced communities. 
Appropriate mechanisms to address instances of violence and other violations of the human 
rights of camp residents should be established. 
</p>
<p>A.4.4.  Persons affected by the disaster should be allowed to move freely in and out of camps. 
Such movement should not be restricted or prohibited unless it is necessary for the protection of 
the security or health of camp residents, or that of the population in the vicinity. If there are 
restrictions, they should not remain in force any longer than absolutely necessary. 
</p>
<p>A.4.5.  In order to maintain the civilian character of camps at all times, appropriate measures 
should be taken to avoid the presence of uncontrolled armed elements in camps and settlements. 
Where such elements are present, they should be separated from the civilian population in the 
camp. The presence of armed State police or security forces should be limited to the extent 
strictly necessary to provide security. 
</p>
<p>A.4.6.  Once the immediate emergency phase is over, camps set up by armed forces or groups 
should be managed by civilian authorities or organizations. The role of police and security forces 
should be limited to providing security.<b> </b>   
</p>
<p><b>A.5 Protection against anti-personnel landmines and other explosive devices 
</b></p>
<p>A.5.1.  Access for specialised organizations should be facilitated as soon as possible, so that 
they can take appropriate measures -- including information and awareness campaigns and 
fencing off and marking relevant areas -- to protect persons affected by natural disasters, 
displaced or not, against the dangers of anti-personnel landmines and other explosive ordnance 
that may have been dislodged, concealed or obscured in the course of the natural disaster. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Protection of Rights Related to Basic Necessities of Life 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.1  Access to goods and services, and humanitarian action 
</b></p>
<p>B.1.1.  Measures should be taken to ensure that persons affected by natural disasters, in 
particular those displaced, have unimpeded and non-discriminatory access to goods and services 
necessary to address their basic needs. 
</p>
<p>B.1.2. Humanitarian action should be based on assessed need and provided to all persons 
affected by the natural disaster without adverse distinction of any kind other than that of 
differing needs.  
</p>
<p>B.1.3. Safe and non-discriminatory access to available humanitarian assistance should be 
secured for all persons in need. In particular, measures should be taken to grant priority access to </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/38/Add.1 
page 10 
 
such vulnerable groups as minorities, single-headed households, elderly, people with disabilities, 
and unaccompanied and separated children.  
</p>
<p>B.1.4.  In particular, when the authorities concerned are unable or unwilling to provide the 
required humanitarian assistance, international humanitarian organizations and other appropriate 
actors should offer their services in support of persons affected by natural disasters and in need 
of humanitarian assistance. 
</p>
<p>B.1.5.  Humanitarian action should be carried out in accordance with the principles of humanity, 
impartiality and, in countries with armed conflict, neutrality. Humanitarian assistance should not 
be diverted. 
</p>
<p>B.1.6.  International organizations and agencies and other actors providing humanitarian 
assistance, should ensure coordination of their actions among themselves and with national and 
local authorities. The responsibilities for certain areas of activities assigned to specific agencies 
and organizations should be taken into account. 
</p>
<p><b>B.2 Provision of adequate food, water and sanitation, shelter, clothing and essential 
health services 
</b></p>
<p>B.2.1.  During and after the emergency phase of the disaster, adequate food, water and 
sanitation, shelter, clothing, and essential health services should be provided to persons affected 
by natural disasters who are in need of these goods and services. Provision of goods and services 
should be without any discrimination of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, 
political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, age, disability or other status. 
  
Adequacy of these goods and services means that they are (i) available, (ii) accessible, (iii) 
acceptable, and (iv) adaptable:  
</p>
<p>    <i>(i)</i> <i>Availability</i> means that these goods and services are made available to the affected 
population in sufficient quantity and quality;  
</p>
<p>    <i>(ii)</i> <i>Accessibility</i> requires that these goods and services (a) are granted without discrimination 
to all in need, (b) are within safe reach and can be physically accessed by everyone, including 
vulnerable and marginalized groups, and (c) are known to the beneficiaries;  
</p>
<p>    (<i>iii)</i> <i>Acceptability</i> refers to the need to provide goods and services that are culturally 
appropriate and sensitive to gender and age;  
</p>
<p>    <i>(iv)</i> <i>Adaptability</i> requires that these goods and services be provided in ways flexible enough to 
adapt to the change of needs in the different phases of emergency relief, reconstruction and, in 
the case of displaced persons, return.  
During the immediate emergency phase, food, water and sanitation, shelter, clothing, and health 
services are considered adequate if they ensure survival to all in need of them. 
</p>
<p>B.2.2.  If food, water and sanitation, shelter, clothing, and health services are not available in 
sufficient quantities, they should be provided first to those most in need. The definition of need 
should be based and assessed on non-discriminatory and objective criteria. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/38/Add.1 
 page 11 
 
B.2.3.  If the host population, which has not been directly affected by the natural disaster, 
suffers from similar shortages of water and sanitation, shelter, clothing, and essential health 
services as those affected by the natural disaster, relief should also be provided to it on an 
equitable basis. 
</p>
<p>B.2.4.  The right to shelter should be understood as the right to live somewhere in security, 
peace and dignity. These criteria should be used as benchmarks in planning and implementing 
shelter programmes, taking into account the different circumstances during and after the 
emergency phase. 
</p>
<p>B.2.5.  Those affected by the natural disaster should be given access to psycho-social assistance 
and social services, when necessary. Special attention should be given to the health needs of 
women, including provision of appropriate clothing and hygienic supplies, access to female 
health care providers and such services as reproductive health care.  
</p>
<p>B.2.6.  Special attention should be given to the provision of psycho-social care for victims of 
sexual and other abuses.  
</p>
<p>B.2.7.  Special attention should be given to the prevention of contagious and infectious diseases, 
including HIV/AIDS, among the affected population, particularly among those displaced by the 
disaster.  
</p>
<p><b>C. Protection of Other Economic, Social and Cultural Rights  
</b></p>
<p><b>C.1  Education 
</b></p>
<p>C.1.1.  The return of children, whether displaced or not, to schooling should be facilitated as 
early and as quickly as possible after the disaster. Education should respect their cultural identity, 
language and tradition. 
</p>
<p>C.1.2.  Education should be compulsory and free at the primary level. Measures should be taken 
to ensure that education is not disrupted at higher levels when students, as a consequence of the 
disaster, can no longer afford such education. 
</p>
<p>C.1.3.  Special efforts should be made to ensure the full and equal participation of women and 
girls, affected by the natural disaster, in educational programmes. 
</p>
<p><b>C.2  Property and possession 
</b></p>
<p>C.2.1.  Competent authorities should be requested to protect, to the maximum extent possible, 
against looting, destruction, and arbitrary or illegal appropriation, occupation or use of property 
and possessions left behind by persons or communities displaced by the natural disaster. 
</p>
<p>C.2.2.  Unused private property and possessions may be temporarily, but no longer than 
absolutely necessary, allocated to those displaced by the natural disaster. Competent authorities 
should be requested to ensure that owners of affected property are adequately compensated for 
such use. Due process guarantees and access to fair and impartial legal procedures should be 
assured for all parties. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/38/Add.1

and possessions should be facilitated as soon as possible.  
</p>
<p>C.2.4.  Owners, whose land deeds or property documents have been lost or damaged during the 
natural disaster or whose land boundaries have been destroyed, should be provided with 
accessible procedures to re-claim ownership of their original land and property without undue 
delay. 
</p>
<p>C.2.5.  Legal procedures should be put in place to consider competing claims to land and 
property with due process guarantees and without delay. Access to an independent court or

deeds in their own name. 
</p>

land title and ownership based on prolonged possession, in the absence of formal land titles, 
especially for indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>C.2.8.  Appropriate measures should be taken to protect persons or communities affected by 
natural disasters -- in particular the poor, women, members of minority groups or indigenous 
peoples, or those displaced -- against undue or illegal attempts by landlords, speculators, local 
authorities and other actors to deprive them of their property and possessions.  
</p>
<p>C.2.9 Prohibitions on remaining in or returning to certain areas and/or rebuilding should not be 
supported unless they are based on law and, in the individual case, necessary for reasons of 
safety, health, disaster prevention, or the implementation of reconstruction and development 
schemes. In all cases of prohibitions on remaining, returning and rebuilding measures should be 
taken to provide owners with due process guarantees, including the right to be heard and the 
right of access to an independent court or tribunal, as well as just compensation.  
</p>
<p>C.2.10.  Should evictions become unavoidable in the course of measures mentioned above in 
A.1.3 and C.2.3, the following guarantees should be put in place: (a) an opportunity for genuine 
consultation with those affected; (b) adequate and reasonable notice prior to the scheduled date 
of eviction; (c) the timely provision of information on the eviction and future use of the land; (d) 
the presence of government officials during an eviction; (e) the proper identification of all 
persons carrying out the eviction; (f) the prohibition of evictions during bad weather or at night; 
(g) provision of legal remedies; and (h) provision of legal aid, where needed, to seek redress 
from the courts. 
</p>
<p>C.2.11.  Evictions -- in particular those ordered in the context of evacuations and of secondary 
occupants of property and possessions left behind by persons displaced by the natural disaster -- 
should not render individuals homeless or vulnerable to the violation of other human rights. 
Appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that adequate alternative housing, resettlement 
and/or access to productive land is made available to those unable to provide for themselves. </p>

<b>C.3 Housing 
</b></p>
<p>C.3.1.  As soon as possible, appropriate measures should be taken, without discrimination of any 
kind, to allow for the speedy transition from temporary or intermediate shelter to temporary or 
permanent housing, fulfilling the requirements of adequacy in international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>C.3.2.  The criteria for adequacy are: accessibility, affordability, habitability, security of tenure, 
cultural adequacy, suitability of location, and access to essential services such as health and 
education (see B.2.1). Respect for safety standards aimed at reducing damage in cases of future 
disasters is also a criterion for adequacy. 
</p>
<p>C.3.3.  To ensure sustainable long-term planning of resettlement and reconstruction in the 
aftermath of a natural disaster, all affected groups and persons, including women, indigenous 
peoples and persons with disabilities, should be consulted and participate in the planning and 
implementation of housing programmes. To the maximum extent possible, and provided that 
necessary safety standards are met, owners of destroyed houses should be allowed to decide on 
their own how to rebuild them.  
</p>
<p><b>C.4 Livelihood and work 
</b></p>
<p>C.4.1.  Projects to restore economic activities, opportunities and livelihoods that are disrupted 
by the natural disaster should start as soon and as completely as possible. To the maximum 
extent possible, such measures should already be taken during the emergency phase. 
</p>
<p>C.4.2.  Where individuals are unable to return to previous sources of livelihood due to the 
natural disaster, appropriate measures -- including provision of re-training opportunities or 
micro-credits -- should be taken. Opportunities created by such measures should be available 
without any discrimination of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or 
other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, age, disability or other status. 
</p>
<p>C.4.3.  Access to livelihoods and employment opportunities should be ensured when planning 
temporary camps and relocation sites, as well as permanent re-housing for individuals displaced 
by the natural disaster. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Protection of Other Civil and Political Rights  
</b></p>
<p><b>D.1  Documentation 
</b></p>
<p>D.1.1.  Organizations providing humanitarian assistance to persons affected by natural disasters 
should grant access to life-saving goods and services even in the absence of relevant documents 
or should issue such documents without delay even during the emergency phase of the 
humanitarian action. Personal data collected, and records established in this context, shall be 
protected against misuse of any kind.  
</p>
<p>D.1.2.  Appropriate measures should be taken as early as possible, including during the 
emergency phase, to restore personal documentation that has been lost or destroyed in a natural 
disaster, to persons affected by the natural disaster (e.g. birth, marriage and death certificates, 
insurance certificates, passports, personal identification and travel documents, education and 
health certificates).  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/38/Add.1 
page 14 
 
D.1.3.  Women and men should be treated equally when documents of any kind are issued. 
Women should be issued documentation in their own names. 
</p>
<p>D.1.4.  Unaccompanied and orphaned children should be issued documentation in their own 
names.  
</p>
<p>D.1.5.  Loss of personal documentation should not be used: (a) to justify the denial of essential 
food and relief services; (b) to prevent individuals from travelling to safe areas or from returning 
to their homes; or (c) to impede their access to employment opportunities. 
</p>
<p>D.1.6.  Loss of documents proving land tenure and ownership should not be used to impede 
property rights (see C.2). 
</p>
<p><b>D.2  Freedom of movement and right to return 
</b></p>
<p>D.2.1.  In accordance with their right to freedom of movement, persons displaced by natural 
disaster should be provided with the information necessary to exercise their right to decide freely 
where they want to live -- whether they want to return to their homes, to integrate where they are 
staying during their displacement or to resettle in another part of the country. 
</p>
<p>D.2.2.   Appropriate measures should be taken as soon as possible to establish conditions 
conducive to sustainable return in safety and dignity. Conditions are considered sustainable if: 
</p>
<p><i>(i)</i>  people feel safe and secure, free from harassment and intimidation, as well as 
from unmitigated risks of further calamitous effects produced by natural hazards; 
</p>
<p><i>(ii)</i>  people have been able to repossess their properties or homes, and these have been 
adequately reconstructed or rehabilitated;  
</p>
<p><i>(iii)</i>  people can return to their lives as normally as possible, with access to services, 
schools, livelihoods, employment, markets, etc. without discrimination.  
</p>
<p>D.2.3.  Appropriate measures should be taken to provide the means to enable persons displaced 
by the disaster to return to their homes or places of habitual residence, or to remain or to resettle 
voluntarily in another part of the country. 
</p>
<p><b>D.3  Family life and missing or dead relatives 
</b></p>
<p>D.3.1.  Members of displaced families who wish to remain together should be allowed and 
assisted to do so during the emergency phase and in the context of return or resettlement. 
</p>
<p>D.3.2.  Appropriate measures should be taken as early and as quickly as possible to re-establish 
contacts between members of families that have been separated in the course of the disaster, and 
to reunite them without delay, particularly when children are involved.  
</p>
<p>D.3.3.  Separated and unaccompanied children should be assisted in accordance with the best 
interests of the child. In particular, the placing of children in institutions should be avoided 
whenever possible.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/38/Add.1 
 page 15 
 
D.3.4. Appropriate measures should be taken to establish the fate and whereabouts of missing 
relatives and to inform the next of kin on the progress of the investigation and results obtained. 
</p>
<p>D.3.5.  Appropriate measures should be taken to collect and identify the mortal remains of those 
deceased, to prevent their despoliation or mutilation, and to facilitate the return of the remains to 
the next of kin. If remains cannot be returned -- for example, when the next of kin cannot be 
identified or contacted -- they must be disposed of respectfully and in a manner which will help 
their future recovery and identification.  
</p>
<p>D.3.6.  Cremation of unidentified bodies should be avoided. Instead, they should be stored or 
buried temporarily, pending future identification and return to families. 
</p>
<p>D.3.7.  All burials should be conducted in a manner that respects the dignity and privacy of the 
dead and of their living family members. Measures should allow for the possibility of recovery 
of the human remains for future identification and reburial if required. Local religious and 
cultural practices and beliefs should be taken into account. 
</p>
<p>D.3.8.  Measures should be taken to protect funerary sites and monuments from desecration or 
disturbance. 
</p>
<p>D.3.9.  Family members should be fully informed about the location of grave sites, and have full 
access to them. They should be given the opportunity to erect memorials and conduct religious 
ceremonies as needed.  
</p>
<p>D.3.10. Family members should have the opportunity to recover the remains of their dead for 
further forensic investigations and to dispose of them according to their own religious and 
cultural beliefs and practices. 
</p>
<p><b>D. 4 Expression, assembly and association, and religion 
</b></p>
<p>D.4.1.  Mechanisms should be established to enable communities to give feedback and raise 
complaints or grievances on the disaster relief, recovery and reconstruction response. Efforts 
should be made to ensure that women and persons with special needs &#8211; e.g. children, older 
persons, persons with disabilities, single-headed households, and members of religious and 
ethnic minority groups or indigenous peoples  -- are specially consulted and can participate in all 
aspects of the disaster response. Persons affected by the natural disaster should be protected 
against adverse reaction for exchanging information or expressing their opinions and concerns 
regarding the disaster relief, recovery and reconstruction efforts. Opportunity should be provided 
for affected persons to conduct peaceful assemblies or to form associations for this purpose.  
</p>
<p>D.4.2. Religious traditions should be respected, as appropriate, when planning and 
implementing humanitarian assistance, in particular in the context of food assistance, health care 
services, and living and sanitary arrangements. 
</p>
<p>D.4.3.  Opportunity should be provided for the exercise of religious faith in a manner that 
respects the rights and beliefs of others and does not incite discrimination, hostility or violence.  </p>

<b>D.5  Electoral Rights 
</b></p>
<p>D.5.1.  Measures should be taken to ensure that persons affected by the natural disaster can 
exercise their right to vote in elections and to be elected, in particular if they have been 
displaced. Such measures may include voter registration and arrangements for absentee voting.
