<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report is the first one presented to the Human Rights Council by the new 
mandate holder, Raquel Rolnik, who took up her position on 1 May 2008. In view of the current 
crisis in the housing and financial sector, the Special Rapporteur decided to devote this thematic 
report to the consequences of certain economic, financial and housing policies and approaches 
that have seriously impacted the right to adequate housing in the past decades and have 
contributed to the present crisis. 
</p>
<p> The first chapter of the present report discusses the housing/mortgage and financial crisis. 
The second chapter relates these crises to prevalent economic, financial and housing policy 
approaches and their impact on the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p> Within the context of the globalization of the housing and real estate finance markets and 
economic adjustment policies, cities have become unaffordable for inhabitants of lower-income - 
and increasingly middle-income - groups. In the majority of countries, the market has become 
the regulating institution, setting benchmarks for the price, location and availability of housing 
and land, as well as rental housing prices, while the role of the State in the management of public 
housing has generally decreased. This has contributed to strengthening the perception of housing 
as a mere commodity and a financial asset, neglecting other dimensions of the right to adequate 
housing and negatively impacting on the enjoyment of human rights for all. 
 The Special Rapporteur believes that these crises provide an opportunity to reflect on the 
current housing system and the adoption of a human rights-based approach, to introduce changes 
to make the system sustainable and allow the provision of adequate housing for all. She calls on 
the Council to consider the different issues tackled in the present report and gives a number of 
preliminary recommendations: the multiple dimensions of housing should be recognized; it 
should not be considered as a mere commodity or financial asset. The report argues that markets 
alone cannot provide adequate housing for all, and in some circumstances public intervention is 
needed. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur advocates the adoption of human rights-based public housing 
policies which support access to adequate housing by different means, including through 
alternatives to private mortgage and ownership-based housing systems, and through the 
development of new financial mechanisms and tenure arrangements. The Special Rapporteur 
also calls for an increase in public funding for housing and the construction of public housing, 
in order to address the impacts of the crisis in human settlements and the enjoyment of human 
rights. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council in accordance with its 
resolution 6/27 on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of 
living. 
</p>
<p>2. The new Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, Raquel Rolnik, took up her mandate on 1 May 2008. During the 
months of May and June, the Special Rapporteur held extensive consultations and in July 2008, 
she submitted a preliminary report to the General Assembly (A/63/275), outlining the approach 
she intends to take to the mandate. From 3 to 6 November, she took part in the World Urban 
Forum in Nanjing, contributing as a key speaker in several panels including a plenary session on 
&#8220;equity in cities&#8221;, a dialogue on the promotion of social equity and inclusiveness, and various 
roundtables including on women and housing and on indigenous peoples&#8217; housing. The Special 
Rapporteur has started following up on the country missions undertaken by her predecessor; she 
is reporting to the Council on the implementation of the recommendations he formulated for 
Mexico, Peru, Romania and Afghanistan.<b>1</b> She is also reporting on communications sent to and 
received from Governments<b>2</b> and submitting the report of her predecessor on his visit to Canada 
in October 2007.<b>3</b> The Special Rapporteur has contacted a number of States in regard to possible 
country visits. She looks forward to positive responses and collaboration from these States. 
</p>
<p>3. The recent housing and mortgage crisis and the subsequent financial crisis have been at the 
forefront of the media and international attention. Yet, little has been said about their global 
impact on the right to adequate housing. In October 2008, the Special Rapporteur shared her 
concerns with the General Assembly. Encouraged by a number of delegations, she decided to 
devote her first report to the Human Rights Council to this issue. 
</p>
<p>4. The first section of the present report discusses the housing/mortgage and financial crisis. 
The second part relates these crises to the prevalent economic, financial and housing policies and 
approaches and their impact on the right to adequate housing. The report concludes with a 
number of preliminary recommendations to address the current situation including consideration 
of the issue by the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  THE CURRENT HOUSING, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS 
</b></p>
<p>5. In order to understand the crisis and its impact on the right to adequate housing and to 
make useful recommendations, the Special Rapporteur believes it important to analyse economic 
and financial decisions and approaches that have led to the current situation. 
</p>
<p>6. It is generally accepted that the global credit crunch generated by the subprime mortgage 
crisis has been one of the main causes of the current worldwide financial and economic crisis.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Subprime&#8221; mortgage is a term used to refer to loans &#8220;given to borrowers whose incomes or 
credit ratings or the equity in whose property does not justify a conventional mortgage at the 
prevailing interest rate on prevailing terms. Instead, subprime mortgages carry a higher interest 
rate and are seen as having a greater risk of foreclosure for non-payment&#8221;.<b>4</b> In this context, 
adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) are also offered, i.e. loans with an interest rate which can 
significantly change over the life of the mortgage. Subprime mortgages were sold by lenders 
(mainly through portfolio or collateralized debt obligations) to investors globally. Over the last 
decade, such operations generated a global business estimated at $1.3 trillion as of March 2007.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>7. Subprime mortgages were initially promoted in some developed countries as a way to 
expand home ownership to high risk, often low-income families.<b>6</b> This was done in a context of 
abundant liquidity which induced a rapid expansion of credit in many developed and emerging 
countries.<b>7</b> Market-based housing finance has become an increasingly important activity of the 
financial sector and has contributed to a widespread bubble in real estate prices.<b>8</b> Liberalization 
in mortgage markets was promoted through a range of policies and normative developments. The 
European Union (EU), for instance, witnessed decisions to abolish interest rate ceilings, to relax 
credit controls, and to end the restrictions on entry into mortgage markets.<b>9</b> In the United States 
of America, the repeal in November 1999 of the Glass-Steagall Act allowed commercial banks to 
collaborate with full-service brokerage firms and participate in investment banking.

</b>  A recent World Bank study notes, however, that over half of subprime loans have been for 
</p>
<p>refinancing existing mortgages rather than purchasing a house and that not all subprime lending 
has been for low-income households, with many loans made to higher income earners with poor 
credit records, W.B. Gwinner and A. Sanders, <i>The Sub Prime Crisis: Implications for Emerging 
Markets</i>, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 4726, September 2008.

</b>  &#8220;While it has for many years played an important role in countries such as Denmark, the 
</p>
<p>United States of America (which has more than $6 trillion in mortgage assets outstanding), and 
the United Kingdom, access to finance is now expanding elsewhere. In Western European 
countries, housing finance is increasing at more than 8 per cent per year, more than double the 
rate of growth of GDP for the past decade&#8221;,  R.M. Buckley and J. Kalarickal, eds., <i>Thirty Years 
of World Bank Shelter Lending: What Have We Learned?</i>, World Bank, 2006.<i>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>8. In the United States, subprime lending began surging in the mid-1990s. These loans 
comprised 8.6 per cent of all mortgages in 2001, soaring to 20.1 per cent by 2006. Since 2004, 
more than 90 per cent of the subprime mortgages have offered adjustable interest rates that 
increase sharply after an initial low-interest period.<b>10</b> In recent years, most subprime loans were 
made by non-depository institutions, commonly referred to as mortgage originators. These 
companies borrowed millions of dollars to originate and fund mortgages. Originators only briefly 
owned the loans (typically for 60 to 90 days) before they were bundled with other loans and sold 
to secondary market investors in a process called securitization, allowing the originators to repay 
their creditors.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>9. The expansion of the subprime mortgage business was accompanied by inadequate 
appreciation of the risks by investors, the lack of due diligence by regulators and supervisors, the 
build-up of excessive leverage by financial institutions, and housing speculation and 
overbuilding during the boom period.<b>12 </b>Consumers were inadequately protected and often 
victims of abusive practices. Many subprime originators were no longer concerned with the 
terms of the loan or whether the borrower would be ultimately able to afford the loan. Instead, 
the originators&#8217; incentive was to close the loan as quickly as possible, in order to be paid their 
origination fees, and then sell the loan to the secondary market. The problem became even worse 
for thinly capitalized mortgage brokers, who originated 63.3 per cent of subprime loan volume 
in 2006, and did not have enough of a stake in the outcome of the loans. 
</p>
<p>10. In the United States, some large, national subprime lenders had core competency in 
marketing and sales, not responsible lending.<b>13</b> In other countries, like Spain, although the 
mechanisms and credit system were very different, other forms of subprime lending were 
practised: financing 100 per cent of the price of a house, initial interest-free mortgages for young 
people, etc.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>11. The value of real estate is partly tied to the availability of credit, so its extreme 
appreciation has been fuelled in part by these so-called &#8220;affordability&#8221; mortgages. Rather than be 
guided by responsible underwriting and deny certain applications, lenders and investors used 
artificial loan features to &#8220;qualify&#8221; borrowers. The end result was extreme risk layering in which

 <p> 
</p>
<p>multiple risky features were present in the same loan. No matter how far the price of housing 
exceeded the actual income of borrowers, so long as a borrower could be qualified for a 
mortgage, housing appreciation increased. Thus, loose and irresponsible lending, while not the 
sole cause, contributed to and enabled irrational housing price appreciation.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>12. It has been observed that beneath the subprime mortgage business and its consequences, 
lies an economic system &#8220;built on the drive for the steady accumulation of profit and the 
necessity of constant growth to provide that profit. &#8230; The development of the subprime housing 
market is one result: a whole new stratum of homebuyers is created, the market for homes is 
increased dramatically, and as long as prices continue to rise &#8230; [the fact] that the increase is 
based on &#8230; buying by those that cannot afford to buy is suppressed&#8221;.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>13. The system worked as long as the housing market grew and borrowers made their monthly 
mortgage payments. Between 2006 and 2007 the housing market stopped growing in a number 
of countries, credits were revaluated and in 2007 an important number of borrowers started 
defaulting on their mortgages. In the United States serious delinquencies (90 days or more 
delinquent or in foreclosure) for all subprime loans rose from 5.68 per cent in the third quarter 
of 2005 to 14.44 per cent at the end of 2007. In the same period, serious delinquencies for 
subprime ARMs quadrupled, from 5.15 per cent to 20.43 per cent.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>14. Between the summer and the fall of 2007, the collapse in the subprime market began to 
impact on banks in the United States and Europe which had made related investments. 
Governments intervened in different ways, mainly with central bank money injections, 
supporting specific banks and companies and in some cases even nationalizing some institutions 
(starting with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in January 2008). 
In December 2007, the United States President proposed initiatives to support also the victims 
of the crisis, i.e. the homeowners facing foreclosure, estimated at 1.7 million people by the end 
of 2007. Starting from January 2008, stock markets began to bear important losses globally and 
the impact of the crisis on the &#8220;real economy&#8221; was predicted by the World Bank. During the 
course of the year, while the prices of houses and the number of approved mortgages continued 
to decrease, and a growing number of banks to collapse, initiatives to address the crisis 
multiplied, including national rescue packages for the banking systems and central bank rate 
cuts. By the autumn of 2008, in many Western countries as well as in the United States, a 
growing number of people had lost their jobs. 
</p><p>15. Faced with potential catastrophe, even the fiercest critics of State &#8220;meddling&#8221; in the 
economy condoned massive public intervention to save private entities and markets. 
Some countries intervened by purchasing distressed assets, especially mortgage-backed

</p>
<p>securities, and making capital injections into banks. This so-called &#8220;bail-out&#8221;<b>18</b> is considered by 
some observers as an opportunity to rethink a system in which individuals and private entities are 
seen to &#8220;take hostage&#8221; the population and the authorities, given the significant consequences of 
their activities. The financial sector is recognized to be in need of thorough reform and 
restructuring; massive public expenditure for the rescue of the financial sector requires all actors 
to be held accountable and ensuring that their activities do not negatively impact human rights. 
</p>
<p>16. The draft outcome document of the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for 
Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus states that &#8220;the current 
financial crisis, as well as the continued weaknesses in the international financial system, further 
underline the need to strengthen the international financial architecture&#8221;.<b>19</b> Unfortunately, the 
document fails to recognize the need for a human rights-based approach to this process. The 
current crisis represents a threat to the implementation of housing rights - as well as other human 
rights - if bank losses are covered by public funds at the expense of State programmes and 
development aid for housing and other social areas. It can thus further deepen the current crisis 
in housing and living conditions. 
</p>
<p>17. Another important additional element that has to be taken into account in the context of the 
present report is the impact on States, housing policies and related issues of the acceleration of 
global interdependence, interaction and integration. While the financial crisis was initially seen 
as a crisis of developed countries, it is increasingly spreading to affect also developing ones. For 
many countries already hard-hit by food and energy price increases, the financial crisis and its 
impact on the global economy is triggering additional problems. The crisis is expected to affect 
developing countries differently, depending on their links with the international financial system. 
For instance, in sub-Saharan Africa, the impact of the crisis should be more limited than in other 
regions of the world because of its de-linkage from Western financial institutions.<b>20</b> Despite 
these differences, four trends would have a negative impact on most developing countries: the 
decline in exports from developing to developed countries (because of the recession in the latter), 
possible decline in international development aid, decreasing income remittances from migrants, 
and a decline in foreign direct investment. In addition, in case of a global recession, the impact 
of the crisis will affect all countries. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur believes that the crisis, and its origins in the housing market, 
reflects fundamental flaws in current economic and housing policies, revealing the inability of 
market mechanisms to provide adequate and affordable housing for all. The underlying causes of 
the mortgage crisis and the resulting global financial crisis must be examined to assess their 
impact on the right to adequate housing.

</p>
<p><b>II. PREVALENT ECONOMIC AND HOUSING POLICIES AND 
APPROACHES AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE RIGHT TO 
ADEQUATE HOUSING 
</b></p>
<p>19. Whether freely decided by Governments or imposed in some cases by international 
financial institutions and other actors as loan conditions, the withdrawal of States from the 
housing sector, as well as the commodification and increased use of housing as an investment 
asset, within a globalized financial market, has deeply impacted the enjoyment of the right to 
adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>20. Observers have noted the impact on adequate housing and housing systems, including laws 
and policies, of globalization and economic models prevailing in recent decades. As one noted, 
&#8220;[t]he growth and power of globalized corporations involved in housing; the globalization of 
property rights, housing finance markets, and the promotion of owner-occupation; globalized 
real estate investment in housing; the reordering of cities and slums; new roles for the State in 
relation to housing; and the effect of globalized migrants and refugees all present new and 
undetermined challenges.&#8221;<b>21</b> The belief that markets could regulate the production of housing as 
the most rational means of resource allocation as well as the growing role of investment in 
housing under a globally integrated financial system has led public policies towards increasing 
State withdrawal from the social sphere. 
</p>
<p>21. In the same way as other social fields, housing is affected by the ongoing struggle between 
those who believe in collective responsibility, including - but not limited to - the role of 
government in promoting general welfare and those who believe that general welfare is best 
achieved by all pursuing their own self-interest via the market, with government doing as little as 
possible.<b>22</b> The first view can be seen as predominant in the first part of the twentieth century, 
with the second view gaining in prominence in recent decades. Some claim that &#8220;nowhere has 
this shift been greater than with regard to housing and housing policy&#8221;.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>22. For decades, the world has witnessed &#8220;the requirements of attracting international capital 
take precedence over the fulfilment of other social objectives&#8221;.<b>24</b> Neoliberal priorities such as 
fiscal constraint, free trade, reduced welfare spending and lower taxation, were soon endorsed by

<p>governments across the world. Accordingly, by the end of the 1990s, there was a worldwide shift 
&#8220;away from an emphasis on State economic management and service provision, to an ethos of 
&#8216;privatism&#8217; in the provisioning and regulation of social and economic life&#8221;.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  The redefinition of the State&#8217;s role 
</b></p>
<p>23. When the acute misery of the urban poor began to be revealed by social reformers in 
Europe and the United States in the late nineteenth century, governments started to become 
active in the provision of housing assistance to individuals and households and to directly supply 
housing.<b>26</b> This sort of intervention required large bureaucratic institutions and large public 
funds. In the United States, for example, as a result of the Great Depression, many homeowners 
couldn&#8217;t afford to make their monthly mortgage payments and this provoked foreclosure on a 
massive scale and the collapse of the entire housing industry. In response, the Roosevelt 
administration established programmes and institutions that &#8220;paved the way for the nation&#8217;s 
remarkable increase in homeownership from the 1940s to the 1960s and established a new stable 
system for housing finance that stood solid for more than 40 years&#8221;.<b>27</b> The New Deal approach to 
housing included the building of cheap public housing for the poor and the creation of a Housing 
Authority which subsidized low rents for low-income families and granted long-term loans to 
local agencies that assumed part of the cost for slum clearance and public housing construction 
and maintenance.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>24. At the end of the Second World War, an appalling number of families and communities 
were homeless in Europe. The reconstruction of the cities and the construction of social housing 
saw rapid growth which continued in a sustained manner for at least two decades. By the end of 
the 1970s the demand for housing was relatively stable in the region and the costs of major 
public housing programmes continued to increase. With the slowdown of the economy in the 
late 1960s, the cost of the welfare state was increasingly viewed as an excessive drain on public 
finances. Critics began to argue that such policies were no longer fiscally or socially sustainable 
or necessary.<b>29</b>

</p>
<p>25. However, during the same period, some developing countries, particularly in 
Latin America, experienced a strong demand for housing due to the urban impact of industrial 
development which attracted migrant flows from rural areas to cities. The lack of urban and 
housing policies, as well as the lack of land policies to enable this new urban population, mostly 
poor, to access urbanized land, meant that the majority of this new urban population was mostly 
housed in self-built informal settlements characterized by precarious housing and a severe lack 
of basic services and infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>26. An important shift was appearing, as one set of economic theories supported the transfer 
from State control to the private sector of economic activities and called for unrestricted free 
markets and free trade. Over the years this view became the predominant economic doctrine, 
shaping the policies of States, international financial institutions and development agencies. The 
effects of the hegemony of these new economic approaches on different States have also been 
influenced by their own legal, political and institutional context.<b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>27. In general, the role of governments concerning housing has been seen to shift in these 
countries from that of a provider to that of a facilitator.<b>31</b> Thus, there has been a significant 
reduction in the construction of adequate housing for the poor - and most vulnerable groups - 
along with decreasing national budgets and available public funds. States have instead privileged 
their role in the promotion and creation of an enabling environment to attract international 
capital and foreign investment for real estate operations. This new role is far from being a 
passive one; it is an active role which implies creating conditions, institutions and regulations 
aimed at supporting financial activities.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>28. Persuaded that they should diminish their intervention, governments started adapting their 
budgets and decreasing the funding for public housing and subsidies. It is argued that the current 
housing difficulties in France can partly be explained by an insufficient construction level 
throughout the last decade. While, home ownership has grown steadily in France since 1954, 
between 1989 and 1995 this increase slowed down due to the reduction of Government 
subsidies.<b>33</b> Similarly, in Poland, a variety of central Government subsidies to housing have been 
cut over the past decades, as much as ten times over the period 1995-2004.<b>34</b>

<p>29. In most developing countries, especially those which had passed through intense processes 
of urbanization in the 1960s and 1970s (like Brazil and other Latin American countries) the 
rolling back of the State interrupted fragile attempts to establish welfare systems. The result was, 
in most cases, an increase in poverty and informal arrangements, worsening the living standards 
of the poor.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p>30. It should, however, be noted that while provision of public housing was cut throughout 
Europe, in addition to the changes in governance of housing systems and the delivery of housing 
policies, States continued to facilitate home ownership for lower income households.<b>36</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Structural adjustments 
</b>31. The same policy preferences for reduced State intervention initially adopted by developed 
countries were gradually spread through the work of international organizations, donors, and 
other actors influencing the policies of developing countries. Thus, whether as a matter of 
imitation or imposition through conditionalities of aid or loans, particularly in the context of 
structural adjustment programmes, critics argue that models of development that were put in 
place in many developing countries caused governments to lessen their efforts concerning 
economic, social and cultural rights, including housing.<b>37</b> In Ghana for instance the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank sponsored structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) 
were seen to have pushed real estate prices beyond affordable levels for a significant proportion 
of the population.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>32. The 1980s, when the IMF and World Bank were mobilized to help the restructuring of  the 
economies of many developing countries in order to reduce their debt, were the years when 
slums grew explosively, attracting not only poor rural migrants, but also millions of city-dwellers 
displaced or impoverished by the impact of these adjustments.<b>39</b>

<p>33. In Latin America, public housing construction was hit by severe cuts in State spending. 
For instance, between 1990 and 2000, the housing deficit in the region increased from 38 to 
52 millions of housing units, partly explained by the decrease of public expenditure in social 
housing in a number of countries in the region. For instance, in Brazil, public housing and 
sanitation expenditure represented 4.4 per cent of the total public expenditure in 1990, whereas it 
decreased to 0.8 per cent in 2001. Similarly, in Paraguay, public investment in housing and 
sanitation decreased from 5.6 to 1 per cent of total public expenditure in the same period, 
while in the Dominican Republic expenditure was reduced by 75 per cent, decreasing from 13.6 
to 3.4 per cent of total public expenditure.<b>40 
</b></p>
<p>34. There is a clear link between the rise in housing prices - and resulting affordability 
problems - and the demand for public and affordable housing. Through his country visits, the 
previous Special Rapporteur observed the reduction of public housing stocks and its impact on 
the most vulnerable sections of the population. The constant reduction of public housing has 
resulted in long waiting lists, keeping a large number of people in inadequate housing conditions 
or impacting their expenditures in other areas, such as food, clothing and health. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Homeownership as the sole objective and the impact on other housing options 
</b>35. The transfer of responsibility for provision of housing to the market has been accompanied 
by the view that homeownership was the best option for all. Thus, this form of tenure was put at 
the centre of all housing policies by most countries. While this aim has provided good results for 
a part of the population, it has also had negative side effects. 
</p>
<p>36. Public housing was seen as an integral part of the culture of welfare dependency as well as 
representing the worst problems of modern urban design.<b>41</b> Public housing is nowadays 
essentially understood as housing for the poor and the so-called marginal groups. This perception 
has implications for policy programming and government housing options, as well as for social 
attitudes towards public housing. 
</p>
<p>37. In some countries, selling publicly owned houses to the tenants has been seen as a way to 
increase homeownership while diminishing State expenditure, especially in terms of 
maintenance. The privatization of public housing has taken various forms, including the sale of 
public<b> </b>rented housing through right-to-buy policies to sitting tenants (as in the United Kingdom), 
property transfers to not-for-profit actors (as in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) and in 
some cases to profit-maximizing actors (as in Germany).<b>42</b> 
</p>
<p>38. Larger-scale privatization of public housing has also taken place in countries in transition 
from planned to market economies. According to the World Bank, in transition countries, a 
considerable amount of residential property - perhaps as much as $1 trillion worth - changed 
</p>
<p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>from public to private hands.<b>43</b> The impact of housing privatization on the population has varied 
from country to country<b>44</b> but concerns have been raised that this very rapid privatization has 
been implemented without taking sufficiently into account the impact it could have on the most 
vulnerable.<b>45</b> In the same countries, more restrictive public housing financing, housing 
privatization and liberalization of construction and utility prices has resulted in a decrease of 
housing affordability and of new construction.<b>46</b> 
</p>
<p>39. The increasing commercialization of housing associations and housing companies has also 
been noted in countries in transition. Their consequent adoption of financial risk avoidance 
strategies has the effect of drawing social housing away from a focus on the most deprived and at 
risk households; the vetting of tenants for reliability and the use of eviction orders are 
symptomatic of this process.<b>47</b> 
</p>
<p>40. Accompanied by financial system deregulation, housing finance has also become 
increasingly important in developing countries where in many cases the outstanding mortgage 
debt is in excess of 10 per cent of GDP (but less than 20 per cent, which is still low compared 
with 100 per cent in Denmark or 75 per cent in the United States).<b>48</b> As late as 2006, the World 
Bank was still quite optimistic concerning this development of housing finance in developing 
countries. It believed that &#8220;for housing finance in developing countries, further deregulation and 
expansion seem almost inevitable. The genie is out of the bottle, and if prudently managed, can 
be expected to confer enormous benefits.&#8221;<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p>41. This optimism has now been reviewed, taking into consideration that emerging financial 
markets have been damaged by losses from opaque off balance sheet entities and that smaller

</p>
<p>economies have suffered in the international credit crunch also because of their reliance on 
foreign capital to fund growth in domestic financial markets.<b>50</b> The World Bank is now 
suggesting that, in developing countries, housing policies for low and moderate income groups 
should not be excessively weighted towards owner-occupied solutions and that &#8220;Households 
with low and uncertain incomes may be better off renting than owning housing that meets 
standards for health and safety. If subsidies are provided, they should be available for either 
ownership (for example with down payment assistance) or rental (for instance with rental 
vouchers), and in either case for new or used units. There should be balanced protections in law 
for mortgage lenders and borrowers, and for rental landlords and tenants. Tax treatment should 
not unduly favour owning or renting.&#8221;<b>51</b> 
</p>
<p>42. In parallel to the reductions in public housing, tenant protection legislation was revised in 
some developed and developing countries. For instance in Canada, tenant protection and rent 
regulation law were terminated in 1998 in Ontario, which may have led to an increase in 
evictions. <b>52</b> In Spain, the liberalization of rental contracts initiated in 1985 by the Boyer Act, and 
continued in 1994 by the Urban Rental Law (<i>Ley de Arrendamientos Urbanos</i>), aimed at 
facilitating the renting of homes by owners. However, it seems that this measure has not been 
fully productive or acted as an incentive to the rental market, while it has possibly negatively 
affected security of tenure.<b>53</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D. Commodification of housing 
</b></p>
<p>43. The reduction in the management of public housing by the State and the shift of housing 
provision solely to the private market has facilitated a perception of housing as a mere good that 
can be bought and sold like many others - an object of consumption. Considered as a commodity 
and a financial asset, other dimensions of the right to adequate housing have been completely 
neglected, with significant consequences for the enjoyment of human rights for all. Scholars 
have pointed out that globalization has accentuated the commodification of housing.<b>54</b> 
</p>
<p>44. Escalation of housing and rental prices are the normal response of the market to 
imbalances between supply and demand. In theory, the market should adjust through an increase 
in supply and a subsequent decrease in prices. Unfortunately, there is a wide gap between theory 
and the reality.

</p>
<p>45. When credit is available and the financial capital seeking investment opportunities 
increases, competition for urban land grows and the value of land appreciates, so that only higher 
income households can afford to buy. 
</p>
<p>46. The rise in housing prices is usually due to a variety of factors; speculation in land and 
housing, urban renewal, city beautification, and the creation of so-called world class cities 
directly impacts housing affordability in cities. The result is to create specific areas of the city for 
use by the wealthy, with all the services and comfort that could be desired. On the other side, 
those that cannot afford to live in these areas are pushed into slums or inadequate housing, living 
in areas with poor or no basic services and too distant from their sources of livelihood. 
Vulnerable groups, in particular women, are the most affected by the lack of solutions and are 
frequently those who suffer most from the centrifuge effect that expels them to the outskirts of 
cities, and into suburbs or slums without basic infrastructure and services. This migration from 
the inner cities is in great measure the result of the lack of affordability of housing, services and 
other goods, as well as of the lack of adequate policies. 
</p>
<p>47. Thus the increased role of financial markets in the production of housing and infrastructure 
has produced in metropolitan areas as different as those of Madrid, Mexico City or Santiago a 
new form of discrimination based on economic status or social class.<b>55</b> In Chile, the Government 
acknowledges that its social housing policies were not really a housing policy but were instead 
policies to finance construction of cheap housing. It had been thought that the new housing stock 
would be part of the effort to improve access to housing, as policies were designed and justified 
in order to reduce the housing deficit and to improve the quality of life of poor families by 
helping them move from precarious settlements to new housing. However, studies undertaken 
since the mid-1990s reveal the opposite result: the new social housing was not part of the 
solution, but rather created a new problem: urban ghettos.<b>56</b> 
</p>
<p>48. As a highly profitable sector, housing and land have also been the object of speculation in 
every part of the world.<b>57</b> Speculation contributes to the rise in prices and affordability. 
</p>
<p>49. The current crisis worsens affordability problems for housing and land across the world. It 
is also a blunt reminder that affordability concerns do not only affect the poor but also 
low-income groups and increasingly also middle-income groups. The discrepancy in the rise in 
incomes and housing and rental prices is crucial in this context, leading households to constantly 
fear losing their homes through defaulting on payments of their rents or mortgages.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>50. Evidently, in the context of the mismatch between need and availability, and of lack of 
affordability, many are not able to compete for adequate housing because of their economic 
status. Moreover, the integration of the housing finance markets with general circuits of finance 
means that individual owners are competing with multinational corporations for capital and 
credit. Whether access to adequate housing is possible cannot be based on such income-based 
competition which, in human rights terms, becomes unacceptable discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>E. Financing homeownership 
</b></p>
<p>51. Governments encouraged the accession of low-income households to homeownership with 
the double idea of enhancing the financial assets of these households and reducing their reliance 
on government aid. While this option could work to provide better security of tenure for many 
households, it also encompassed an important side effect: credits were attributed by the private 
sector to households that - in normal circumstances - would not be eligible for loans. That means 
that not only the risk for private companies increased but also low-income households were 
made even more vulnerable to economic and financial changes. 
</p>
<p>52. As long as housing prices continued to rise, the expectation that the increase in price would 
be even greater than the discrepancy between housing costs and incomes left everyone happy. 
One of the impacts of globalization on housing relates to the house price bubble which prompted 
The Economist to launch its global house price indices in 2002, covering 20 countries. Some 
observers calculate that the total value of residential property in developed economies increased 
by an estimated $20 trillion (to over $60 trillion) between 2000 and 2003. Calculations by The 
Economist suggested that house prices hit record levels in relation to incomes in Australia, 
France, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, the United Kingdom and the 
United States.<b>58</b> 
</p>
<p>53. As expected, rises in prices could not indefinitely continue. The &#8220;biggest bubble in history&#8221; 
was foreseen, but little or nothing was done by Governments to prevent the crisis from 
occurring.<b>59</b> As soon as prices stopped increasing, the problems began to mount, resulting in the 
foreclosure and financial crisis that we are witnessing.<b>60</b> 
</p>
<p>54. While States favoured the acquisition of homes through mortgages, other forms of access 
to homeownership were developed at grass-roots level. For instance, lending to low-income 
households for shelter improvements, to allow them to buy or build their new homes, can be 
provided through community development banks, credit unions, microfinance schemes and other

</p>
<p>ethical lending. Such programmes can provide a critical contribution to improved shelter and 
livelihood strategies.<b>61</b> This approach is far from the perception of housing as a mere means of 
appreciation of value for globalized investors and brokers. 
</p>
<p><b>F. Titling for land and housing 
</b></p>
<p>55. Another dimension of the emphasis on financial markets of housing policies has been the 
spread of irregular land titling programmes. According to Hernando De Soto, who actively 
promoted these programmes, one of the principal reasons for underdevelopment is the absence of 
a property registration system to facilitate mortgage lending, consequently prohibiting the 
development of personal capital and equity growth in land and housing.<b>62</b> 
</p>
<p>56. Under the above assumptions, massive land titling programmes were considered as the 
preferred option to assist slum dwellers. Under this assumption, Western legal systems and 
property law approaches were exported to other parts of the world. This has contributed to the 
impact of globalization, further legitimizing practices resulting in the patenting, control, 
appropriation, and commodification of physical and human resources worldwide. During the 
1980s and 1990s, some countries - supported by international financial institutions - thus 
promoted programmes aimed at giving title to slum and informal settlement dwellers to enable 
them to enter the market. In this context, mortgages were widely promoted by credit 
institutions.<b>63</b> 
</p>
<p>57. Some argue that in order to develop and implement fair housing markets, legal instruments 
and State involvement are required in order to ensure a property rights regime, housing finance 
regime, residential infrastructure regime, regulatory regime, and housing subsidies regime. A 
functional and effective property rights regime must involve a set of transparent, predictable, 
non-discriminatory and stable rules that preserve the rights of individuals to use, invest, 
maintain, rent, mortgage and sell their land and housing without hindrance and with full 
protection against arbitrary action by the authorities.<b>64</b> Others have viewed the process of

<p>creation of property rights in land and housing merely as a new re-colonization leading to the 
repossession of land and property through formal legal means, with companies and banks from 
developed countries gaining control over the territories of developing countries.<b>65</b> 
</p>
<p>58. In his 2003 mission to Peru, the former Special Rapporteur observed the functioning of 
titling programmes. In his mission report he concluded that the practice of granting titles by the 
Commission for the Formalization of Informal Properties (COFOPRI), inspired by the work of 
Hernando de Soto and supported by the World Bank, was flawed when viewed in the context of 
Peru&#8217;s obligations to the human rights instruments. He called for a review of the policy and of 
the functioning of institutions such as COFOPRI to ensure compliance with human rights 
obligations. He also noted that the policy provided titles to families without ensuring access to 
water, sanitation and electricity and security of home and person, or ensuring equal rights for 
women. He argued that this could only lead to a false sense of security and that it only 
approached the right to housing as a narrow and individualistic property right.<b>66</b> 
</p>
<p>59. Several evaluation studies of massive titling programmes, especially in Latin America, 
have shown that titling without urbanization and socio-economic integration enables markets to 
work but does not ameliorate the lives of slum dwellers.<b>67</b> The main issue in regard to financial 
services is<b> </b> that &#8220;the design of such services needs to take into account the difficult choices faced 
by low-income households in generating savings, as they struggle to balance potential income 
gains (microenterprise borrowing), expenditure savings, investments in capacities and 
relationships (education, marriage) and investments in assets (including housing)&#8221;. Rather than 
discouraging credits targeting low-income sectors, more &#8220;flexibility to support this complexity&#8221; 
should be provided by financial services; moreover, they should be based on the specific needs 
of the people concerned.<b>68</b>

<p>participation in decision-making processes related to housing; or lack of protection against 
discriminatory practices of private actors. Lending practices may discriminate against particular 
groups such as nomads, minorities, migrants and women. 
</p>
<p>61. Members of minority groups trying to purchase homes may face discrimination, for 
instance from mortgage lending institutions. They may be denied equal access to capital (as they 
may be less likely to obtain mortgage financing) or receive less favourable conditions for a 
mortgage when one is obtained. 
</p>
<p>62. A number of studies in the United States have shown differences in loan denial related to 
race. As for discrimination in loan conditions, as discussed in the description of subprime 
mortgages above, lenders have often targeted low-income and minority communities, people 
who would otherwise be considered too risky for a conventional loan. Because of their weaker 
credit profile, they were charged higher interest rates. According to Federal Reserve data, 
about 46 per cent of Hispanics and 55 per cent of African Americans who obtained mortgages 
in 2005 got higher-cost loans compared with about 17 per cent of whites and Asians. A typical 
subprime borrower was slated to pay $5,222 more during the first four years of a $166,000 
mortgage compared to a similar borrower with a normal mortgage. Over 30 years, this borrower 
would pay $35,874 more in interest payments.<b>69</b> 
</p>
<p>63. While such data could be at least partly explained by ethnic income disparities, other 
sources confirm that African Americans were five times more likely to receive a subprime loan 
than whites, even when they qualified for a loan at lower, prime rates.<b>70</b> The proportion of 
subprime home loans by race was 52.44 per cent for African American families, 40.66 per cent 
for Hispanic families and 22.20 per cent for white non-Hispanic families.<b>71</b> Obviously, such 
differences place these groups in a far more vulnerable position in the event of a crisis such as 
the current one. 
</p>
<p>64. In Spain, where according to information submitted by the Consejo General del Poder 
Judicial (General Council of the Judiciary) it is estimated that the percentage of foreclosures will 
rise during 2009 by up to 194 per cent relative to 2007,<b>72</b> with migrants from Latin America

<p>particularly affected by the crisis. It has been estimated that 180,000 families originally from 
Latin America, are in risk of default because they cannot afford their interest payments on home 
loans.<b>73</b>  
</p>
<p>65. In this context, the practice of so-called predatory lending has also disproportionally 
impacted some categories of the population.<b>74</b> Predatory loans are characterized by excessively 
high interest rates or fees, and abusive or unnecessary provisions that do not benefit the 
borrower, including balloon payments or single premium credit life insurance, large prepayment 
penalties, and underwriting that ignores a borrower&#8217;s repayment ability.<b>75</b> 
</p>
<p>66. Predatory lending practices have been described as including features such as unreasonable 
and unjustifiable loan terms and outright fraudulent behaviour that maximizes the destructive 
financial impact on consumers of inappropriate marketing strategies and loan provisions. 
Importantly, it has also been seen to include targeted marketing to households on the basis of 
their race, ethnicity, age or gender or other personal characteristics unrelated to 
creditworthiness.<b>76</b> Thus, predatory lending includes lending that is inherently discriminatory and 
must be prohibited. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Security of tenure, evictions and homelessness 
</b></p>
<p>67. Security of tenure, for both owners and lenders, has been deeply affected by the crisis. In a 
number of cases, foreclosure concerned second residences, but in the majority of cases, 
foreclosure has meant the loss of the unique home of a household, often resulting in 
homelessness or inadequate living conditions. The rise of &#8220;tent cities&#8221; and encampments has 
been reported in some cases, apparently as a direct result of foreclosures.<b>77</b> 
</p>
<p>68. Foreclosures have also concerned housing units that were rented. In some cases, tenants 
were not aware that their landlord was subject to a foreclosure procedure and were evicted from 
their homes with little or no prior notice. 
</p>
<p>69. It is important to understand the impact of foreclosure - or eviction - on a household. It 
pushes people into more difficult situations and inadequate living conditions and impacts their 
ability to cope with further hardship, particularly where it results in homelessness. It is much

<p>more difficult to maintain employment while having difficulty in accessing water and sanitation 
and basic services. A lot of effort is required to cope with weather changes and administrative 
demands, relocating belongings, and maintaining an address where one can be reached. In some 
cases, not having a permanent address leads to exclusion from certain types of aid, or results in 
denial of civil and political rights, including the right to vote. 
</p>
<p>70. Following foreclosure, many families have no savings left, which makes them unable to 
afford a rental security deposit. Even if they can afford the security deposit, they are considered 
as less able to meet debt obligations or mortgage payment, and thus they are not eligible for a 
new rental contract.<b>78</b> 
</p>
<p>71. The impact of eviction and homelessness on women and children can be particularly 
devastating, as is the reality of living in constant fear of being evicted. Homelessness has a 
particularly negative impact on both groups. The discrimination faced by women can lead to a 
potentially higher impact on them from eviction and homelessness. The former Special 
Rapporteur conducted several studies on women and adequate housing and he concluded that 
women bear the brunt of evictions as they often lead people to live in distant places and in 
inadequate conditions, without security of tenure, basic services, access to schools, health 
services and employment. When families are moved to places with no source of livelihood, men 
tend to migrate and leave women to fend for the family. As another result of forced evictions 
women are frequently left in more difficult situations than before in caring for their families.<b>79</b> 
</p>
<p>72. In evictions, possessions are often destroyed, family stability jeopardized, and livelihoods 
and schooling threatened. Affected children describe the violence, panic and confusion of the 
evictions and the painful experience of sleeping and managing their lives out in the open. They 
also face the challenge of re-establishing a stable life and dealing with frequent breakdowns in 
family relations as a consequence of the stress and economic challenges that are the result of 
homelessness. 
</p>
<p>73. In addition to the physical and psychological trauma of eviction and homelessness, 
households, especially women and children, lose the support systems they were used to and their 
relations with a community. The breaking of these social ties and the loss of stability lead to 
many other problems.

<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Rapporteur fears, in view of the preceding information and analysis, that 
the financial crisis will continue to cause many internal and international economic and 
financial problems, including additional bankruptcies and impact on the housing sectors 
affected by the financial investment industries.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur believes that the current crisis represents also an 
opportunity for reflection and to consider how to improve housing systems, policies and 
programmes so as to ensure adequate housing for all. She hopes that the Human Rights 
Council will consider the issues raised in the present report. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Further consideration of the distinction between property rights and the right to 
adequate housing, which encompass common and separate features, may prove useful in 
helping the Council consider how enjoyment of the right to adequate housing could be 
further improved. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The challenges posed by the crisis - and the range of issues raised in this report - will 
require further analysis and the Special Rapporteur will continue to monitor the situation. 
However, she would like to offer some preliminary recommendations for the consideration 
of the Human Rights Council.</b> 
</p>
<p>78. <b>All actors involved in the housing sector should fully recognize the multiple 
dimensions of housing, which is much more than a mere financial asset and has great 
implications for the individual, the community and society as a whole. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The right to adequate housing should be fully integrated into all policies, projects and 
activities concerning housing, in particular those designed by public authorities. All public 
and private actors involved in housing need to acknowledge the right to adequate housing 
and take it into account in their work. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>States must ensure coherence in decision-making - both nationally and 
internationally, and at all levels and for all relevant public agencies and actors. State 
activities should aim to improve the enjoyment of human rights and adequate housing. For 
instance, decisions taken by the Human Rights Council on adequate housing should be 
acknowledged, coordinated with and supported by those adopted at UN-Habitat or by 
international financial institutions. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>State action should reflect acknowledgement that the value of housing is not only 
linked to the personal investment of a household but also depends on a large number of 
external factors, including public investments in infrastructure, the basic services 
connected to it, and the environment, community, and security housing is associated with, 
ensuring society has both a role to play and a legitimate stake in the value of housing, 
which requires appropriate regulation.</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>82. <b>The global economic crisis, and even recession in many countries, may result in a 
reduction in income for some sectors of the population, thus making affordable housing 
even more necessary. Therefore States should take promptly all measures needed to 
increase the availability of adequate housing options. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>States should support access to adequate housing by measures such as promoting 
alternatives to private mortgage and ownership-based housing systems, and develop new 
financial mechanisms that can ensure the improvement of the living and housing conditions 
for the majority of the world&#8217;s population, which has not been well served by existing 
mechanisms. They should not reduce State expenditure on housing. On the contrary, public 
funding for housing and construction of public housing will need to increase in order to 
address the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>In some countries, homeownership has been traditionally seen as the safest form of 
tenure and rental tenure has been less secure, with a greater potential for eviction. Recent 
events clearly show that homeownership is a secure form of tenure only under certain 
circumstances, in particular when there are adequate, sustainable and stable financial 
means to achieve it. Rental tenure could be made more secure with appropriate legislation 
to protect tenants against abusive evictions, as well as to expand access to affordable, 
controlled and subsidized rent mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>States must ensure that financial institutions and regulation take account of the 
vulnerabilities and limited repayment capacities of low-income households. Financial 
services for low-income groups must be developed in consultation with these groups, as 
they are best able to assess their repayment capacity and ensure the development of 
systems that effectively meet their needs.</b> 
</p>
<p>86. <b>States must acknowledge that markets alone are unable to achieve adequate housing 
for all. Effective regulation and close monitoring by the State of private sector activities, 
including financial and building companies, is required. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>In some situations, States should consider intervening in the market, for instance 
through equitable land-use policies, public financing and housing provision, appropriate 
rent regulation and reinforcement of legal security of tenure. Enshrining in relevant 
legislation the right to adequate housing will help in ensuring an appropriate role for the 
State in the housing sector. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>States should take mitigating measures to lessen the impact of foreclosures and the 
crisis, for instance in cases of tenant eviction due to foreclosure or because of unpaid rents 
due to the economic crisis. In particular, States should make every effort to prevent 
homelessness which pushes households into inadequate housing and has a detrimental 
impact on the enjoyment of other human rights by individuals, families and communities, 
including their access to education, work and an adequate standard of living. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>States should ensure appropriate regulation of international financial activities in 
order to avoid future financial crises and their subsequent effect on human rights and 
adequate housing. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>90. <b>States should adopt internal and international measures to control speculation in 
housing and mortgages. They should, in particular, protect the housing rights of the 
population by putting in place monitoring mechanisms aimed at regulating the activities of 
private companies - prohibiting predatory lending, mobbing, discriminatory credit 
practices, etc. - that result in the denial of the right to adequate housing. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Economic hardship risks causing a wave of disinvestment in housing, yet it is crucial 
both for social and economic reasons, that massive investment in housing take place 
instead. States must react as promptly and efficiently as they did to intervene in the 
international financial system to address the housing crisis worldwide, so as to implement 
their obligation to protect the right to adequate housing for all.</b>
