<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its ninth session from 1 to 12 November 
</p><p>2010.  The review of Mongolia was held at the 3rd meeting, on 2 November 2010. The 
delegation of Mongolia was headed by the State Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade, Damdin Tsogtbaatar. At its 5th meeting, held on 4 November 2010, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Mongolia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Mongolia: Gabon, Kyrgyzstan and 
Switzerland. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Mongolia:

</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the interactive dialogue, 43 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are found in section II of the present report.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>6. At the 3rd meeting, the delegation of Mongolia, headed by the State Secretary of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Damdin Tsogtbaatar, began its presentation of the 
national report by stating that the Government considered the universal periodic review as a 
unique opportunity to share Mongolia&#8217;s experience in the human rights area with States and 
to learn from international best practices. Although over the past two decades Mongolia had 
made great strides in introducing and genuinely institutionalizing human rights, the 
Government recognized the need for further improvements. The delegation expressed the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to participating actively in the review process and devoting its 
efforts to implementing proposals and recommendations of the Council. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation stated that human rights and freedoms had been set out in the 1992 
Constitution, and Mongolia had attached significant importance to protecting the rights and 
freedoms of its citizens and establishing a political and legal environment for the effective 
enjoyment of those rights and freedoms. Mongolia was party to the core human rights 
instruments; it had placed priority on empowering its national human rights institutions; 
Parliament had adopted the National Action Programme on Human Rights in 2003; and the </p>


<p>Committee on the National Action Programme had been established to coordinate the day-
to-day implementation of the Programme. 
</p>
<p>8. The national report had been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and had been 
prepared by a working group established by a decree of the Prime Minister. The Working 
Group had held numerous consultations with the National Human Rights Commission, 
relevant experts and non-governmental organizations. In addition, a tripartite consultative 
process comprising the Government, the United Nations Development Programme and civil 
society organizations had taken place in February 2010. 
</p>
<p>9. Mongolia, while providing specific protection of civil and political rights, was also 
committed to promoting and protecting economic, social and cultural rights. The 
Government&#8217;s actions were also focused on the rights of persons with disabilities and of 
citizens with monthly incomes lower than the national average. In addition, protecting the 
rights of national minorities was a priority of Government action, as it implemented non-
discriminatory policies and legislation concerning the rights of national minorities. 
</p>
<p>10. The Law on the National Human Rights Commission had been adopted on 7 
December 2000 by Parliament, and the independent Commission had begun its activities in 
February 2001. 
</p>
<p>11. While Mongolia had maintained capital punishment de jure, the President had 
declared a moratorium on the use of the death penalty in January 2010 and had indicated 
that the moratorium should constitute the first step towards its abolition. Accession to the 
Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was 
being considered in Parliament. 
</p>
<p>12. The Government had focused on protecting women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights by 
putting in place necessary national programmes. In 2010, the Government had signed the 
Agreement on Cooperation to Combat Trafficking in Persons with the Macao Special 
Administrative Region, anticipating that the agreement would lead to more efficient 
bilateral cooperation aimed at facilitating better prevention of human trafficking, as well as 
stronger protection and the smoother return and reintegration of trafficking victims. 
</p>
<p>13. Owing to global warming and climate change, the following factors had deteriorated 
living conditions: the glaciers were receding, surface water was drying up, vegetation was 
decreasing, water was becoming more mineralized, soil erosion was increasing, and 
desertification was spreading. In 2010, a new National Programme to Combat 
Desertification and a water programme had been approved. Natural disasters such as <i>dzud</i> 
disasters, blizzards and storms had also affected the right of herding households to a healthy 
and safe environment. In that context, in 2009 the Parliament had adopted the State Policy 
on Herders to improve herders&#8217; living conditions and promote their right to a healthy and 
safe environment. 
</p>
<p>14. Health-care services were provided to all citizens, without any discrimination. The 
Government had approved the Action Plan for 2008&#8211;2012, which set the objectives for 
improvements in health care, and a private insurance system had been introduced.  
</p>
<p>15. Mongolia&#8217;s Millennium Development Goals, which had been approved by 
Parliament in 2005, included fundamental gender equality objectives, such as eliminating 
gender disparity at all levels of education, increasing by up to 50 per cent the number of 
women in wage employment in non-agricultural sectors, and expanding by up to 30 percent 
the number of women in the national Parliament no later than 2015. The participation of 
women in the decision-making process was still insufficient. Although the number of 
female candidates was steadily increasing, their number in Parliament was actually 
dropping. Mongolia&#8217;s view was that the percentage of women candidates should be </p>


<p>increased. Parliament was scheduled to consider a draft law on gender equality initiated by 
the Government. 
</p>
<p>16. The Government had been working to implement the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto, and its Action Plan 2008-2012 
included such objectives as providing persons with disabilities with standard facilities, as 
well as opportunities for a comfortable lifestyle. The Ministry of Labour and Social 
Welfare had sought to expand its cooperation with non-governmental organizations through 
the publication and distribution of Braille books for blind persons, and by raising public 
awareness about the need to ensure the participation of persons with disabilities in social 
life. 
</p>
<p>17. While noting many challenges, including poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, 
and air pollution in the capital city, the delegation stated that the Government had the 
necessary political will and would continue to overcome them with the support of its people 
and the solidarity of other countries. The Government had been trying to strike a balance 
between economic growth and human rights, and to utilize more equitably and more 
effectively the increasing wealth derived from mining. 
</p>
<p>18. While noting the fact that periodic reports had been regularly submitted to the treaty 
bodies and follow-up information forwarded to Special Rapporteurs, the delegation 
acknowledged the need to further improve the quality of such reports. 
</p>
<p>19. The delegation expressed the Government&#8217;s belief that the goals of the universal 
periodic review could be achieved only through the active participation of and constructive 
dialogue among all States and non-governmental organizations; it also expressed its 
readiness to work with all partners to promote and protect human rights in Mongolia. 
</p>
<p>20. In response to the advance question on the abolition of the death penalty, the 
delegation reported that the Government supported the ratification of the Second Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The relevant standing 
committee of Parliament had been discussing whether Parliament should finally ratify it. If 
Parliament responded positively, draft amendments to all legislation regulating the death 
penalty, including the Law on the State Secret, would be formulated. 
</p>
<p>21. Responding to an advance question, the delegation referred to the 2008 amendment 
to the Criminal Code that had altered the definition of the term &#8220;torture&#8221; in line with the 
Convention against Torture. Moreover, as a result of the amendment, any official involved 
in an investigation would be prosecuted and punished under the Code if he or she tortured, 
or took cruel, inhuman or degrading measures against, a suspect in order to obtain 
information or a confession. A working group had been studying the possibility of the 
ratification by Mongolia of the Optional Protocol to the Convention. 
</p>
<p>22. The delegation stated that there no data had been recorded regarding the allegation 
of discrimination based on sexual orientation against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
persons. There had been regular supervision by the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office on this issue, and an 
Open-Door Day was held each month in order to receive individuals&#8217; complaints and 
requests. Support was provided for the participation of advocates in the process of 
interrogating suspects and prosecuted persons. The Government planned to conduct a 
survey on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons and to record their needs and 
requests, which would make it possible to identify areas for possible legal amendments. In 
addition, an association of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons had been 
registered. 
</p>
<p>23. Regarding the question concerning the period of pre-trial detention, the delegation 
reported that the 2007 amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code had decreased the </p>


<p>period of pre-trial detention, which was based on the severity of the crime and ranged from 
one month to a maximum of 24 months. 
</p>
<p>24. The delegation explained that, under the Labour Law, an employer should not ask 
questions pertaining to the private life, marital status, sexual orientation or pregnancy of an 
employee unless such questions were related to the work or duties to be performed. There 
were no cases or data regarding the firing or discharge of lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender persons from their work, and the relevant laws prohibited discrimination based 
on sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>25. The Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor had implemented a project to support and 
reintegrate street children into society through music and culture.  A cash benefit system, 
aimed at meeting the basic needs of families and children who had the lowest household 
income, was provided for in a social welfare law that had been submitted to Parliament for 
discussion. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>26. A number of delegations thanked Mongolia for its cooperation with the universal 
periodic review mechanism and commended the delegation for the constructive dialogue 
initiated with civil society during the preparation of its national report, as well as the 
comprehensive presentation of the national report during the working group.  
</p>
<p>27. Algeria welcomed the establishment of various human rights protection 
mechanisms, including the National Action Programme of the Human Rights Committee. 
Algeria noted Mongolia&#8217;s adherence to most international human rights instruments and the 
moratorium on the death penalty. It noted the difficulties faced by the country in improving 
public health and education. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Morocco stated that it had observed Mongolia&#8217;s positive developments and the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to build a democratic country. It welcomed Mongolia&#8217;s actions 
regarding the protection of the rights of minorities and the creation of legal aid centres. 
Morocco also welcomed the efforts to ensure the protection of disabled persons, the 
adoption of the law on the protection of child rights, and the Programme on Gender 
Equality. Morocco took note of Mongolia&#8217;s efforts in the areas of health, education, 
employment and the reform of the electoral system. Morocco reiterated its appeal to the 
international community to support Mongolia&#8217;s democratic process. 
</p>
<p>29. The Russian Federation noted with appreciation the progress made by Mongolia in 
acceding to international human rights treaties and in providing basic free education and 
free medical care, as well as the existence of the National Action Plan for Human Rights 
and the national human rights institution. It also noted the moratorium on the death penalty 
and the country&#8217;s acknowledgement of problems and challenges in its national report and 
presentation. The Russian Federation made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>30. Indonesia was encouraged to learn that, in recent years, Mongolia had established 
both a national human rights commission and a National Action Plan for Human Rights. It 
also highlighted efforts and progress made on gender equality and the enhancement of 
women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights. However, poverty remained a key obstacle to the country&#8217;s 
ability to fulfil the basic human rights of its population. Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. France welcomed the moratorium on the death penalty and noted the current debate 
regarding adherence to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. While noting with satisfaction that Mongolia was party to most 
international human rights instruments, France inquired why Mongolia had not yet ratified </p>


<p>the Convention against enforced disappearance. France referred to alleged cases of torture 
by the police forces. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Poland expressed appreciation for the progress made in the establishment of a 
human rights infrastructure and various measures taken to address the problem of human 
trafficking. However, it referred to concerns expressed by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child at the increasing incidence of the trafficking and exploitation of women and girls and 
the low rate of the prosecution of perpetrators. Poland asked about steps taken to address 
the root cause of this. Poland made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>33. Australia praised Mongolia for its progress towards a robust democracy and 
commended the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission, which had been 
accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status.  It encouraged the country to continue to raise awareness of the 
Commission&#8217;s work and to increase its access to disadvantaged and remote communities. 
Australia welcomed the 2010 moratorium on the death penalty and urged Mongolia to 
legislate abolition. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Mexico acknowledged progress made in the field of human rights and noted actions 
undertaken to promote universal access to health care and public education and to guarantee 
food security. Mexico welcomed the moratorium on the death penalty. Mexico made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Canada thanked Mongolia for its demonstrated commitment to the principles of 
democracy and free expression and welcomed its moratorium on application of the death 
penalty but noted that the penalty has not been eliminated from the law.  It noted the recent 
reports alleging continued incidents of human trafficking, violence against subjects of 
police arrest and detention, and the erosion of public services through corruption. With the 
prospect of impressive economic growth ahead, Canada expressed the hope that Mongolia 
will allocate adequate expenditures towards ensuring continued progress in its efforts to 
advance human rights and the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>36. Germany commended Mongolia for having established the National Human Rights 
Commission. Germany welcomed the moratorium on the death penalty and took note of the 
ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights. Germany inquired on the follow-up made on the recommendation by the 
Special Rapporteur on Torture regarding the possibility of making a declaration in 
accordance with article 22 of the Convention against Torture. Germany made 
recommendations.

human rights obligations despite many constraints. It noted the measures taken to promote 
the right to a healthy and safe environment, health care, education and food security. 
Malaysia commended Mongolia for its cooperation with international human rights 
monitoring mechanisms. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Hungary noted with satisfaction that the Government had drafted a law on gender 
equality that included a definition of direct and indirect discrimination. It welcomed the 
ratification of a wide range of human rights treaties, but deemed it necessary to further 
strengthen the protection of human rights at the national level. Hungary expressed concerns 
about article 44 (1) of the Criminal Code, which might lead to impunity for law 
enforcement officials. Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Cuba noted that Mongolia had included in its Constitution the right to a safe and 
healthy environment and had adopted more than 30 legislative instruments on the issue.

recommendation. 
</p>
<p>41. Slovakia commended Mongolia for being party to the main international human 
rights instruments and for its standing invitation to special procedures. Slovakia welcomed 
the moratorium on the death penalty. It echoed the concerns expressed by the human rights 
monitoring mechanisms at the persistence of strong stereotypes regarding the role and 
responsibilities of women. Slovakia welcomed the ratification of the Convention on the

unemployment levels and an increasing number of homeless persons and working children 
remained the key challenges faced by the Government. Brazil referred to the universal 
periodic review documentation referring to the existence of discriminatory practices against 
women and concerns over the use of the corporal punishment of children. Brazil made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Sweden welcomed the moratorium on executions and the plans to abolish the death 
penalty de jure and to sign and ratify the Second Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It expressed concern over the attacks against 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals and documented discrimination against 
them. Sweden asked about actions taken to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights by 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. Sweden made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>44. Norway noted that Mongolia was party to most international human rights 
instruments and expressed appreciation for its standing invitation to special procedures 
mandate holders. Norway noted the moratorium on the death penalty. Norway also noted 
the recent rise in nationalism, which had resulted in cases involving discriminatory criminal 
acts, and referred to incidents of discrimination against minorities, including lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender persons. Norway referred to the current discussion on possible 
accession to the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Optional Protocol thereto. Norway 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Azerbaijan noted positively the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in April 2010. It also 
noted the increasing level of cooperation with special procedures, including the Special 
Rapporteur on Torture, with positive results such as the inclusion of the notion of torture in 
the Criminal Code. Azerbaijan noted that Mongolia was suffering from climate-change-
related effects. It welcomed measures taken for the advancement of women&#8217;s rights, but 
noted that human trafficking was on the rise. Azerbaijan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. The United Kingdom welcomed the recent submission of reports by Mongolia to 
treaty bodies. It expressed concern about the absence of a definition of torture that met 
international standards. It expressed its hope that Mongolia would consider the 
recommendations on the improvement of governance and transparency. It asked what </p>


<p>legislative measures would be taken to abolish the death penalty and prevent discrimination 
based on sexual orientation. The United Kingdom made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. The delegation stated that the issue of accession of the Second Optional Protocol to 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights had been debated in the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Policy and National Security of Parliament. The delegation expected 
positive results. 
</p>
<p>48. Regarding to the issue of timely reporting to the United Nations treaty bodies, the 
delegation stressed the Government&#8217;s strong commitment to improving the quality of its 
reports to them. The time constraints, the necessary qualifications and the availability of 
accurate information remained major challenges in the reporting process. The Government 
had recently adopted the rules for timely reporting to international instruments. 
</p>
<p>49. The delegation reiterated that the Government regarded addressing the issue of 
human trafficking as a high priority. The Criminal Code had been amended to include the 
crime of human trafficking in order to prosecute perpetrators. However, problems remained 
to be addressed, including the lack of reporting of cases involving human trafficking. A 
new law on combating human trafficking was in the process of being drafted, in order to 
punish perpetrators and protect the rights of victims. The establishment of a national 
preventive mechanism was planned. A number of projects had been implemented, with the 
assistance of the international community and national non-governmental organizations, to 
effectively address the problem of human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>50. The Constitution prohibited discrimination on all grounds, including sexual 
orientation, and any law proved to be inconsistent with the Constitution should be amended 
to bring it into line with that document. Thus, any form of discrimination was unlawful. 
However, traditional stereotypes existed in society, and therefore the Government 
acknowledged the need for greater efforts in terms of public awareness activities and 
training to change persistent attitudes in society. 
</p>
<p>51. The delegation stated that the issue of poverty was one of the serious obstacles 
hindering the enjoyment of the socio-economic rights of the population. Therefore, the 
Government had continued to place top priority on poverty alleviation, while pursuing swift 
economic development. The expected rapid economic growth would provide better means 
to address poverty and create new job opportunities. 
</p>
<p>52. Regarding domestic violence, appropriate legislation was in place to address the 
issue. However, problems remained in practice. Police officers did not always attach 
sufficient importance to the issue, often considering it a domestic and private matter. 
Victims often failed to file complaints against perpetrators. The Government had continued 
to work to address those problems, including through the public awareness campaign, to 
shape a culture of intolerance towards domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>53. Efforts had been made to improve the relevant legislation, and a number of 
programmes had been implemented to address the needs of persons with disabilities. The 
access of persons with disabilities to public office needed to be further addressed. A lack of 
knowledge about the rights of persons with disabilities had been observed, and thus the 
Government would continue to enhance those measures to address the problem. 
</p>
<p>54. The delegation stated that, with a view to addressing nutritional issues and providing 
access to a variety of foods, the Government had introduced a programme to revive land 
cultivation, which had already produced good results. 
</p>
<p>55. While noting that Mongolia was party to main international human rights 
instruments, Turkey inquired whether the country was considering adhering to the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrants Workers and 
Members of their Families. Turkey welcomed the establishment of legal aid centres in all </p>


<p>provinces and the National Programme on the Promotion of Persons with Disabilities, and 
asked for further information in that regard. Turkey noted the high school and university 
enrolment rates and encouraged Mongolia to raise awareness about birth registration. 
Turkey stated that Mongolia should be supported by international organizations in 
combating human trafficking. Turkey made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>56. Italy commended Mongolia for the moratorium on the death penalty announced by 
the President in January 2010, and welcomed its participation in the International 
Commission against the Death Penalty. Italy noted with concern that corporal punishment 
was still being used and that children were increasingly involved in hazardous labour. Italy 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. The Republic of Korea recognized the considerable progress made in promoting 
human rights and the efforts to ratify international conventions and improve domestic 
institutions on human rights. It hoped that the Gender Equality Law would soon be enacted 
and encouraged more rigorous enforcement of existing laws. It welcomed steps taken to 
enhance the political rights of citizens and stated that further consideration should be given 
to the election rights of vulnerable groups. The Republic of Korea made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>58. The Czech Republic welcomed the moratorium on the death penalty. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. New Zealand expressed concern at the reported cases of torture and the excessive 
use of force by the police. New Zealand welcomed the moratorium on the use of the death 
penalty in 2010. It expressed concern at the lack of legislation on violence against women. 
New Zealand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. The United States expressed concern over discrimination against women and girls 
and the fact that the level of domestic violence remained high, but was encouraged by 
increasing rates of prosecution and conviction for child abuse, domestic violence, rape and 
incest. It also expressed concern at the discrimination based on disabilities, human 
trafficking and the difficulties faced by religious minorities in registering and building 
places of worship. The United States made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Pakistan noted efforts made in promoting and protecting human rights, as reflected 
in the ratification of seven core international human rights instruments. Pakistan welcomed 
the fact that Mongolia held regular informal human rights training courses for the 
population and asked for additional information in that regard. It also asked for further 
information about the child protection system entitled &#8220;Friend 19-79&#8221;. Pakistan noted the 
environmental challenges faced by Mongolia. Pakistan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Paraguay believed that it was important that Mongolia give priority to protecting the 
human rights of national minorities, and asked how international cooperation could help the 
country in that regard and how the Government was being supported, especially in the 
implementation of public policies. Paraguay, a landlocked country like Mongolia, referred 
to the United Nations Development Assistance Framework, indicating that Mongolia&#8217;s 
vulnerability was heightened by its geographic location. That issue could be tackled as part 
of increasing regional cooperation within the framework of Millennium Development Goal 
</p><p>8. 
</p>
<p>63. Argentina noted the moratorium on the death penalty and the draft law to ratify the 
Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It 
noted the efforts made on gender matters and asked about measures to ensure equal pay and 
measures regarding domestic violence and penalizing marital rape. Argentina also asked 
about legislative measures to combat child labour and to raise the minimum age for 
employment. Argentina made recommendations. </p>


<p>64. Spain recognized progress made in the field of human rights since the adoption of 
the 1992 Constitution, as well the ratification of most international human rights 
instruments. Spain regretted that the death penalty remained in force. It welcomed the 
adoption of the law on gender violence. Although homosexuality had not been 
criminalized, Spain stated that provisions of the Penal Code might be used against lesbian, 
gay, bisexual and transgender persons. Spain asked for information about tangible measures 
taken to investigate the July 2008 events in Sukhbaatar Square. Spain made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Switzerland welcomed the progress made in the field of human rights and the 
moratorium on the death penalty. It noted a lack of independence and efficiency on the part 
of institutions responsible for countering corruption. Switzerland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Portugal acknowledged with appreciation the moratorium on the death penalty and 
raised questions about its de jure abolition and the classification of the death penalty as a 
State secret. It also asked about the plan to reduce the number of street children and to 
ensure the prohibition of child labour. Portugal welcomed the bilateral agreement between 
Mongolia and the Macao Special Administrative Region on human trafficking. Portugal 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Slovenia commended Mongolia for its standing invitation to special procedures 
mandate holders and for the moratorium on the death penalty. Slovenia inquired about 
measures taken to review and amend legal provisions discriminating against women, 
activities to enhance access for rural women to various basic services, and the right to 
education of various categories of children, including the children of herders.  Slovenia

Committee for Gender Equality in 2005, but echoed concerns expressed by the Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women about the lack of visibility and 
resources of the Committee. Ghana made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>69. The Netherlands commended Mongolia for its moratorium on the death penalty and

<p>72. Nepal noted with appreciation that human rights were guaranteed under the 
Constitution and through specific laws and regulations. The establishment of the National 
Human Rights Commission was a praiseworthy step. As a landlocked country, Nepal 
acknowledged Mongolia&#8217;s enormous development challenges. It commended the measures 
adopted to protect the environment and mitigate the effects of climate change. Nepal also 
welcomed the moratorium on the death penalty and encouraged Mongolia to move towards 
abolition. 
</p>
<p>73. Republic of Moldova congratulated Mongolia on having a National Human Rights

<p>74. Bangladesh identified the prevalence of poverty in Mongolia as one of the greatest 
challenges. It noted that Mongolia was prone to natural disasters, which, together with 
desertification and climate change, had negative impacts on the population&#8217;s enjoyment of 
human rights. Bangladesh noted with appreciation the provisions relating to human rights in 
the 1992 Constitution, the existence of a National Human Rights Commission with &#8220;A&#8221; 
status and the high primary school and higher education enrolment rates. Bangladesh made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. Kyrgyzstan stated that over the past 18 years, Mongolia had attached great 
importance to promoting the rights and freedoms of its citizens, and had created a political 
and legal environment in which human rights could thrive. In addition, Mongolia had been 
promoting rights and freedoms through cooperation with other democratic systems. 
Kyrgyzstan referred to the strong institutional structure for human rights protection, 
including the National Committee within the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs, headed 
by the Prime Minister, whose main task was coordinating the human-rights-related 
activities of State authorities. Kyrgyzstan called on Mongolia to take further efforts to 
strengthen the national human rights potential in order to guarantee the cultural and social 
rights of its population. 
</p>
<p>76. Ukraine welcomed the adoption of national action programmes for human rights. It 
shared the concern of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
over the lack of measures to eliminate discrimination against women with regard to access

Committee on the Rights of the Child about the social exclusion of children with 
disabilities. Ukraine made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>77. The Islamic Republic of Iran expressed appreciation for Mongolia&#8217;s efforts and

</p>
<p>78.  The delegation noted that a number of important issues related to the human rights 
system had been raised. The issue of human rights training at secondary schools had been 
debated at the meeting of the Committee on the National Action Programme, specifically 
how to integrate the human rights programme into a comprehensive approach, including a 
human rights culture in the education system as a whole. Interaction among students and 
teachers as well as teaching materials seemed noteworthy elements of that approach. The </p>


<p>delegation expressed the view that human rights issues had already been covered by the 
education system but that a comprehensive and consistent approach was still needed. 
</p>
<p>79. As to the issue of the legal framework applicable to foreign residents, Mongolia had 
had a discriminatory system for foreign investors in the past, which had recently been 
changed through the establishment of parity between local and foreign investors. Visa 
requirements were very liberal, and visas could be obtained at the airport. 
</p>
<p>80. Referring to the incident in July 2008, the delegation stated that, although Mongolia 
had always been proud of its peaceful democratic transition, the protest against the election 
results had revealed that it should make further efforts in that regard and that the loss of five 
lives was unacceptable. In addition to the normal legal due process, the parliamentary 
human rights subcommittee had held a public hearing on the 1 July event and had publicly 
interviewed police officers and the protesters. 
</p>
<p>81. Regarding the number of street children, the delegation acknowledged that it 
remained a persistent issue, and the Government continued to strive to address it. The 
delegation stated that the issue was the result of poverty and described positive trends as 
well as efforts to establish orphanages to care for such children. Commending international 
aid as helpful in the establishment of orphanages, the delegation expressed the view that a 
long-term solution needed to be found and that the Government needed to allocate greater 
resources to solve the problem. 
</p>
<p>82. Addressing the pollution situation of the capital city, the delegation stated that, 
owing to climate change, many herders who had lost animals had had to move to 
Ulaanbaatar city, which had been overloaded in terms of infrastructure as a result of the 
increased population. The Government had designed various programmes to provide 
housing, but 40 per cent of approximately 1 million people still lived in traditional 
dwellings and burned coal in winter. As a result, the city environment was very polluted in 
winter. The solution was to build more modern, convenient and affordable housing, which 
would not be easy. Water pollution was due to the increased number of new factories and 
had raised serious concerns. The Government had tightened environment controls and had 
tried to make polluters pay for the costs related to pollution. The Government was 
committed to continuing to strive to resolve the issue of air pollution. 
</p>
<p>83. Regarding the phenomenon whereby the number of women in Parliament was 
decreasing although the number of women candidates was increasing, the delegation stated 
that there had been an internal quota policy requiring a political party to have 30 per cent 
women candidates. Parliament had also taken measures such as the draft Law on Gender 
Equality.
