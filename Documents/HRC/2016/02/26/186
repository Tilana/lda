<p><b>  Comments for the Government of Turkey to the Follow-up 
report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions, Christof Heyns on the mission to 
Turkey. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The following document represents the views and comments of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government of Turkey in respect of the Follow-up report of the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Christof Heyns, on the mission to Turkey from 26 to 30 November 
</b></p>
<p><b>2012.  
</b></p>
<p>It is considered that it should be beneficial to convey the following additional information 
</p>
<p>regarding Clause B of the 4th Chapter of the report which will be submitted by the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions about 
</p>
<p>Turkey in the 29th Session of the  Commission on Human Rights which will be organized 
</p>
<p>in 2015. 
</p>
<p>As the duration of the National Action Plan on Combating Violence against Women (2012-
</p>
<p>2015) referred in the 40th  Paragraph  expires by the end of this year, updating activities of 
</p>
<p>the National Action Plan on Combating Violence against Women have been started for 
</p>
<p>2016 and 2019. The new Action is aimed to be inclusive of the progress recorded in 
</p>
<p>national and international legislation, strong commitments and liabilities in terms of 
</p>
<p>relevant institutions and be one that has a more binding power. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A &#8220;Cooperation Protocol on the Pilot Implementation of the Technical Surveillance 
</p>
<p>within the scope of Combating Violence against Women&#8221; was signed on March 8, 
</p>
<p>2015 among the Ministry of Family and Social Policies, the Ministry of Justice and 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Interior. The pilot application has been started in Ankara and &#304;zmir. 
</p>
<p>The pilot application started the &#8220;electronic bracelet&#8221; practice which is an active 
</p>
<p>model in which the victims of violence as well as the perpetrator are both monitored 
</p>
<p>at the same time.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; The &#8220;Impact Analysis Study of the Law No. 6284&#8221; which aims to measure the effect 
</p>
<p>and efficiency of the Law holding interviews with the victims of violence, men 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of violence and the law   implementers in relation to the Law No. 6284 
</p>
<p>on Protection of Family and Prevention of Violence against Women, which has been 
</p>
<p>in effect since 2012 via qualitative and quantitative methods. The evaluations are 
</p>
<p>still continuing regarding the Impact Analysis Study, which is planned to be 
</p>
<p>completed by the first half of 2015.  It is planned to introduce improvements to the 
</p>
<p>national legislation and implementation processes in parallel to the opinions and 
</p>
<p>recommendations submitted in the &#304;mpact Analysis study.     
</p>
<p>It is deemed appropriate to add the following paragraph to the 44th Article of the Clause B 
</p>
<p>of the 4th Chapter to be followed after the first sentence:    
</p>
<p><i>The project is addressing coordination and quality of shelter service provisions, training 
</i></p>
<p><i>for service providers and public awareness raising activities. Therefore, this project can be 
</i></p>
<p><i>characterised as a capacity building, training and cooperation project. Expected results 
</i></p>
<p><i>also include the enhanced collaboration by central and local governing bodies and local 
</i></p>
<p><i>NGOs for improved mechanisms to combat violence against women in 26 project 
</i></p>
<p><i>provinces. In addition, under the Grant Component of the project, there have been grants 
</i></p>
<p><i>given to civil society organizations for 19 projects in 11 provinces to strengthen the 
</i></p>
<p><i>capacity combating violence against women</i>. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.7

</b></p>
<p> Besides, another project  &#8220;Enhancing the Protective Measures for Women Subjected to 
</p>
<p>Violence: Electronic and Monitoring Supply of Equipment&#8221; have been implementing with 
</p>
<p><i>the aim of purchasing vehicles (completed)  for shelters and evaluation of pilot electronic 
</i></p>
<p><i>monitoring system application (ongoing</i>). 
</p>
<p>The statement &#8220;Any staff member taking charge in counterterrorism is provided with the 
</p>
<p>Basic Training on Counterterrorism, Training on Police Defence Tactics and Course on 
</p>
<p>Methods of Arrestment and Taking into Custody, and the Course of Human Rights is 
</p>
<p>contained in the Curriculum&#8221; has been added verbatim as 22nd paragraph. However, it is 
</p>
<p>seen that whether the training curriculums comprise international principles or not, and 
</p>
<p>more detailed information on the trainings are required by the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>Within this framework the personnel in charge in the Central and Provincial Units of the 
</p>
<p>Counterterrorism Department are enabled to participate in the in-service courses regularly 
</p>
<p>in coordination with the Department of Counterterrorism for the purpose of ensuring that 
</p>
<p>they will perform their duty in line with preventing the acts deemed terrorist crimes, 
</p>
<p>protecting personal rights and freedoms as well as public order and security, and public 
</p>
<p>peace and within the framework of an understanding of duty respectful to the principles of 
</p>
<p>state of law and human rights. The curriculums contain subjects on European Council, 
</p>
<p>European Convention on Human Rights, Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>European Court of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>It is recommended in the Rapporteur&#8217; s Additional Follow-up Report that offering refresher 
</p>
<p>courses would be beneficial for the competent personnel to use Nonlethal Gas and Defence 
</p>
<p>Guns which they have taken  course on. Regarding this, the whole personnel competent to 
</p>
<p>use Tear Gas and Defence Guns, and the ranked personnel competent to give order for their 
</p>
<p>use have been offered advanced training (12678 in total) in distance, in smart class 
</p>
<p>environments and onsite as in-service training between the dates of 25th March-05th April 
</p>
<p>2015.  
</p>
<p>Besides studies on regulating the &#8220;Draft Directive on Using Tear Gas and Defence Guns 
</p>
<p>and Related  Equipment and Ammunition&#8221; to arrange general principles and procedures to 
</p>
<p>using tear gas and defence guns in the inventory of the Riot Police are continuing. &#8220;The 
</p>
<p>Directive on the Operational Principles and Procedures in Assemblies and Demonstrations 
</p>
<p>for the Personnel Charged in Social Events&#8221; has been published for the purposes of 
</p>
<p>possessing a countrywide standard application and ensuring a proportionate use of force by 
</p>
<p>police through setting forth the stages of   using force, the technique-tactic adjustment to be 
</p>
<p>used and means of using force in line with the plans of prevention and intervention to be 
</p>
<p>prepared, in coordination with the other units, before the social event organized unlawfully 
</p>
<p>or post facto organized unlawfully or transformed subsequently into an unlawful form, and 
</p>
<p>needing to be responded by Riot Police and other related units. In the mentioned directive, 
</p>
<p>studies of amendments are continuing for the principle of proportionate use of force to 
</p>
<p>disperse the demonstrators at the stages of use of  force  in case of any resistance by the 
</p>
<p>protesters to disperse despite the warning performed by security forces during the 
</p>
<p>assemblies and demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>Possible comments on related articles in the unedited version of the follow up report to the 
</p>
<p>recommendations contained in Mr Christof Heyns&#8217;s country visit report to Turkey have 
</p>
<p>already been taken into consideration by Turkish officials as mentioned in his letter dated 
</p>
<p>19 March 2015. The possible comments made on the articles below are as follows: 
</p>
<p>Article 66: Turkey needs to make sure a working independent complain mechanism, as 
</p>
<p>recommended by the Rapporteur in this article, in preventing a culture of impunity against 
</p>
<p>public officials. 
</p>
<p>Article 71: Prosecutorial and judicial discretion needs working properly in any country let 
</p>
<p>alone Turkey as it is essential to maintain it for a democratic society based upon the rule of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 </b> 
</p>
<p>law. Turkey is in need of taking serious measures in this matter as recommended by the 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur in this article though the claim for the lack of accountability of Turkey in this 
</p>
<p>matter is somehow needs further investigation. 
</p>
<p>Article 72: As for concerns mentioned in this article Turkey is trying to resolve possible 
</p>
<p>wrongs made against people. However the concerns relating to the public officials receiving 
</p>
<p>lighter sentences when found guilty of tortures, ill-treatment or fatal shootings, in my view, 
</p>
<p>need much deeper investigation by the Rapporteur. Recommendations made by the 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur are also significant. 
</p>
<p>Article 73: The Rapporteur has every freedom and right to make his personal comments 
</p>
<p>relating to the Article 29 of the Criminal Code. However it is up to Turkish judges how to 
</p>
<p>interpret the article 29 of the Criminal Code as it is obvious that it establishes the mitigating 
</p>
<p>factors. Hence any rule in the law can be misinterpreted or misused if it is an abstract and 
</p>
<p>general one. However, there is a working appeal system to prevent these kind of misuses in 
</p>
<p>Turkish Criminal Justice as mentioned by the Rapporteur himself in his report. 
</p>
<p>Article 74: In this article the Rapporteur is absolutely right that the appeal remedies may be 
</p>
<p>hindered further by workload and case backlog in the judicial system. Therefore the district 
</p>
<p>and regional courts have been established though they have not started to work yet due to 
</p>
<p>the lack of qualified staff. 
</p>
<p>As for the conclusion there might be/are lack of practising appropriate measures to prevent 
</p>
<p>some misuses and wrongs in the Turkish Criminal Justice System. However some of the 
</p>
<p>concerns of the Rapporteur need further investigation. Some of the concerns are not related 
</p>
<p>only to prosecutorial and judicial discretion, they are also deeply related to the cultural and 
</p>
<p>democratic issues as every individual needs to prioritize those values in their life to 
</p>
<p>establish a democratic society. It might take time to do so although Turkey is trying her best 
</p>
<p>to make sure the international human rights standards are up to the level expected. 
</p>
<p>Therefore time and education are needed for Turkey developing towards a more democratic 
</p>
<p>society. Most recommendations suggested by the Rapporteur are welcome to be 
</p>
<p>implemented although some issues and concerns raised in the report are discussible and 
</p>
<p>need further investigation as they do not reflect the whole facts of the matters.  
</p>
<p><b>  Amendment 1 by the Committee on Equal Opportunity for Women and Men 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Taking into consideration following contribution for the 40th Paragraph: 
</i></p>
<p>It should be stated that Turkey is the first state which signed and ratified the Convention on 
</p>
<p>Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, also known 
</p>
<p>as Istanbul Convention. 
</p>
<p><b>  Amendment 2 by the Committee on Equal Opportunity for Women and Men 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Amending the 43rd Paragraph: 
</i></p>
<p>Amending the clause &#8220;infrastructure&#8221; in the first sentence of the 43rd Paragraph as &#8220;legal 
</p>
<p>and administrative infrastructure&#8221; which will be more accurate expression. 
</p>
<p><b>  Amendment 3 by the Committee on Equal Opportunity for Women and Men 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Taking into consideration following contribution for the 45th Paragraph: 
</i></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur recommended that Turkey enact comprehensive and specific 
</p>
<p>legislation on hate crimes in accordance with international standards and review legislation 
</p>
<p>to include language sensitive to gender identity and sexual orientation. Here, it can be said </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.7 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>that the Turkish Penal Code contains several provisions on hate crimes, such as Article 115, 
</p>
<p>125/3, 216 even if there is no specific legislative regulations for such crimes.   
</p>
<p>Moreover, within the context of the Project (Fostering an Enabling Environment for Gender 
</p>
<p>Equality in Turkey) carried out in cooperation with the UN Women, the Committee on 
</p>
<p>Equality of Opportunity for Women and Men as a standing committee of the Grand 
</p>
<p>National Assembly of Turkey has reviewed thirty one acts in the fields of education, health, 
</p>
<p>local governments, family-woman-child, political life, organizational laws, media, and 
</p>
<p>employment from the gender equality point of views.   
</p>
<p><b>  Amendment 4 by the Committee on Human Rights Inquiry 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Amending Appendix A.7 as follows: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8220;The Committee on Human Rights Inquiry at the Grand National Assembly of Turkey 
</p>
<p>adopted Inquiry Report on Uludere Incident in the date of 27th March, 2013 which was 
</p>
<p>shared with the public. The Committee obtained all the information and evidence relating to 
</p>
<p>the event that was included in the report in an objective and transparent manner. Besides, 
</p>
<p>including the dissenting opinion given by MPs from the Opposition on the report was 
</p>
<p>shared with the public.
