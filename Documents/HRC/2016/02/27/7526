</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
</p>
<p> The Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights 
</p>
<p>and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination visited Comoros 
</p>
<p>from 7 to 16 May 2014 at the invitation of the Comorian Government. In accordance with 
</p>
<p>its mandate, the Working Group gathered information on mercenary-related activities, as 
</p>
<p>well as on the effects of activities of private military and security companies on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights. 
</p>
<p> Despite the progress made by Comoros since the early 2000s, the Working Group 
</p>
<p>took note at the start of its visit of the country&#8217;s difficult and turbulent history since its 
</p>
<p>independence in 1975. A series of coups d&#8217;&#233;tat instigated by mercenaries and the political 
</p>
<p>instability that prevailed during the three decades following independence prevented the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s political, economic and social development. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group recognizes the profound negative and interdependent effects of 
</p>
<p>mercenarism, separatism and the Mayotte issue on the human rights of Comorians. The 
</p>
<p>overthrow of successive governments by mercenaries and a lack of stability have severely 
</p>
<p>hampered the right of the Comorian people to self-determination. Political instability has 
</p>
<p>also prevented Comorians from achieving national unity, leaving Comorian society

<p>fragmented and State institutions weak and unable to cater properly to the needs of the 
</p>
<p>population. Being a fledgling democracy also contributes to its continued fragility.  
</p>
<p> However, despite the immense obstacles faced by Comorians, the Working Group 
</p>
<p>noted positive developments that have brought relative stability to Comoros. The 2009 
</p>
<p>amendment of the Constitution allowing for the rotation of the presidency has helped 
</p>
<p>counter the problem of separatism and attempted coups d&#8217;&#233;tat. 
</p>
<p> With respect to private security companies, the Working Group notes that the 
</p>
<p>presence of natural resources in Comoros has the potential to attract investment from 
</p>
<p>multinational corporations in the extractive industry, which often use private security 
</p>
<p>companies to protect their facilities. The likelihood of an increase in the number of private 
</p>
<p>security companies operating in Comoros and ongoing concerns surrounding maritime 
</p>
<p>delimitation issues require the introduction of appropriate regulations.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted pursuant to resolution 2005/2 of the Commission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, in which the Commission established the mandate of the Working Group on the use 
</p>
<p>of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right 
</p>
<p>of peoples to self-determination, and Human Rights Council resolutions 7/21, 15/12 and 
</p>
<p>24/13, in which the Council extended that mandate. 
</p>
<p>2. Pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/2 and Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 24/13, the Working Group is called upon to monitor mercenaries and 
</p>
<p>mercenary-related activities in all their forms and manifestations in different parts of the 
</p>
<p>world, as well as to study the effects on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly the 
</p>
<p>right of peoples to self-determination, of the activities of private companies offering 
</p>
<p>military security services on the international market. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group visited Comoros from 7 to 16 May 2014, at the invitation of the 
</p>
<p>Comorian Government. In accordance with its general practice, the Working Group was 
</p>
<p>represented by two of its members: its Chairperson-Rapporteur, Patricia Arias, and Gabor 
</p>
<p>Rona.1 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group is grateful to the Government of Comoros for its invitation and 
</p>
<p>for its cooperation throughout the planning and conduct of the mission. In accordance with 
</p>
<p>its mandate, the Working Group focused on the period of Comoros&#8217; past immediately 
</p>
<p>following independence that was tainted by mercenarism and marked by a series of coups 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;&#233;tat and attempted coups d&#8217;&#233;tat. It also considered the investigations and prosecutions 
</p>
<p>relating to the alleged attempted coup d&#8217;&#233;tat of April 2013, which reportedly involved 
</p>
<p>mercenaries, and examined the activities of private security companies operating in 
</p>
<p>Comoros.  
</p>
<p>5. In the present report, the Working Group uses the term &#8220;mercenary&#8221; as defined in 
</p>
<p>article 1 of the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and 
</p>
<p>Training of Mercenaries, namely, any person who (a) is especially recruited locally or 
</p>
<p>abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict; (b) is motivated to take part in the hostilities 
</p>
<p>essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a party 
</p>
<p>to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to 
</p>
<p>combatants of similar rank and functions in the armed forces of that party; (c) is neither a 
</p>
<p>national of a party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a party to the 
</p>
<p>conflict; (d) is not a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict; and (e) has not 
</p>
<p>been sent by a State which is not a party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its 
</p>
<p>armed forces. 
</p>
<p>6. Article 1 of the Convention also provides that the term &#8220;mercenary&#8221; refers to any 
</p>
<p>person who, in any other situation (a) is specially recruited locally or abroad for the purpose 
</p>
<p>of participating in a concerted act of violence aimed at (i) overthrowing a Government or 
</p>
<p>otherwise undermining the constitutional order of a State; and (ii) undermining the 
</p>
<p>territorial integrity of a State; (b) is motivated to take part therein essentially by the desire 
</p>
<p>for significant private gain and is prompted by the promise or payment of material 
</p>
<p>compensation; (c) is neither a national nor a resident of the State against which such an act 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 The Working Group is composed of five independent experts serving in their personal capacities. Ms. 
</p>
<p>Patricia Arias (Chile) is the Chairperson-Rapporteur. The other members are Ms. El&#380;bieta Karska 
</p>
<p>(Poland), Mr. Anton Katz (South Africa), Mr. Saeed Mokbil (Yemen) and Mr. Gabor Rona (United 
</p>
<p>States of America/Hungary). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-09907 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>is directed; (d) has not been sent by a State on official duty; and (e) is not a member of the 
</p>
<p>armed forces of the State on whose territory the act is undertaken. 
</p>
<p>7. In the present report, a private military and/or security company is to be understood 
</p>
<p>as a corporate entity which provides on a compensatory basis military and/or security 
</p>
<p>services by physical persons and/or legal entities.2 
</p>
<p>8. The term &#8220;military services&#8221; refers to specialized services related to military actions 
</p>
<p>including strategic planning, intelligence, investigation, land, sea or air reconnaissance, 
</p>
<p>flight operations of any type, manned or unmanned, satellite surveillance, any kind of 
</p>
<p>knowledge transfer with military applications, material and technical support to armed 
</p>
<p>forces and other related activities. Security services include armed guarding or protection of 
</p>
<p>buildings, installations, property and people, any kind of knowledge transfer with security 
</p>
<p>and policing applications, development and implementation of informational security 
</p>
<p>measures and other related activities. 
</p>
<p>9. During its visit, the Working Group went to Moroni (Grande Comore). For technical 
</p>
<p>reasons, the Working Group was unable to carry out its planned visit to the island of 
</p>
<p>Anjouan. It was, however, able to meet the Governor of Anjouan, who was visiting Moroni, 
</p>
<p>and is grateful to him for agreeing to that meeting. The Working Group is the first human 
</p>
<p>rights protection mechanism to have undertaken a mission to Comoros and hopes that this 
</p>
<p>visit will pave the way for other visits by Human Rights Council special procedures 
</p>
<p>mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation met the President of Comoros and his Chef de Cabinet (who is also 
</p>
<p>Secretary of State for Defence), the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Justice, the 
</p>
<p>Minister of the Interior, the Prosecutor-General, the State Prosecutor, the President of the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Court, the President of the National Assembly, the National Directorate for 
</p>
<p>Territorial Security (DNST), the Chief of the National Police, the National Defence and 
</p>
<p>Security Commission, the Commander of the National Gendarmerie, the National 
</p>
<p>Directorate for Documentation and State Protection (DNDPE), the Governors of the islands 
</p>
<p>of Grande Comore and Anjouan, the National Commission for Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>Freedoms, the Ambassadors of France and South Africa, the United Nations country team 
</p>
<p>and civil society representatives, including non-governmental organizations, journalists and 
</p>
<p>academics. The Working Group would like to thank the various persons it met for its 
</p>
<p>fruitful discussions with them during its visit. 
</p>
<p><b> II. International human rights commitments 
</b></p>
<p>11. Comoros is party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination (2004), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women (1994) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1993) 
</p>
<p>and its Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
</p>
<p>(2007). Comoros has twice undergone the universal periodic review &#8211; in May 2009 and 
</p>
<p>January 2014. During its visit, the Working Group was informed that the National 
</p>
<p>Assembly had approved the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, but that the 
</p>
<p>instruments of ratification had not yet been deposited with the Secretary-General of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations. The Working Group has encouraged the Government of Comoros to 
</p>
<p>finalize promptly the ratification process. 
</p>
<p>12. As regards mercenarism, Comoros has been a party to the Organization of African 
</p>
<p>Unity Convention for the Elimination of Mercenarism in Africa since 2004. It is not a party 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 See A/HRC/15/25, Annex, art. 2. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.14-09907 
</p>
<p>to the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of 
</p>
<p>Mercenaries. The Working Group has also called on the Government of Comoros to ratify 
</p>
<p>this international instrument. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Historical context 
</b></p>
<p>13. One of the main challenges encountered by the Working Group during its visit was a 
</p>
<p>lack of written information, including historical facts. There is a strong oral tradition in 
</p>
<p>Comoros and most of the information collected by the delegation was based on memories 
</p>
<p>and personal experience. However, evidence gathered by the Working Group from a great 
</p>
<p>many interviewees did indicate a direct link between the country&#8217;s attainment of 
</p>
<p>independence and the mercenarism that prevailed for more than two decades. 
</p>
<p>14. Comoros officially became a French colony in 1912. Under the leadership of Ahmed 
</p>
<p>Abdallah, Comoros unilaterally declared independence on 6 July 1975, followed by a series 
</p>
<p>of coups d&#8217;&#233;tat that, plunged the country into political and social upheaval.  
</p>
<p>15. On 3 August 1975, barely a month after independence, the first coup d&#8217;&#233;tat took 
</p>
<p>place, with Ahmed Abdallah being replaced by Sa&#239;d Mohammed Jaffar. Jaffar did not 
</p>
<p>remain in power long. In 1976, Ali Soilih seized power by force, retaining it for two years 
</p>
<p>until 1978, when another coup d&#8217;&#233;tat was instigated by Ahmed Abdallah and carried out 
</p>
<p>with the assistance of a well-known mercenary and former French army officer, Bob 
</p>
<p>Denard, whose real name was Gilbert Bourgeaud. Abdallah remained in power until 1989. 
</p>
<p>At the beginning of that period, the Presidential Guard was established under the leadership 
</p>
<p>of Bob Denard. The Guard was made up of both heavily armed mercenaries, brought to 
</p>
<p>Comoros by Denard, and Comorians, belonging for the most part to the national army. The 
</p>
<p>Guard, armed and commanded by Denard, was responsible for protecting the President and 
</p>
<p>maintaining him in power. Denard was thus able to continue to exercise decisive influence 
</p>
<p>during the years that followed. 
</p>
<p>16. On 26 November 1989, Abdallah was assassinated in murky circumstances. Reports 
</p>
<p>received by the Working Group indicate that Denard was present at and involved in the 
</p>
<p>assassination. Although Denard attributed the killing to the army, he was soon considered 
</p>
<p>to be its instigator. After Abdallah&#8217;s death, Bob Denard reportedly assumed political power 
</p>
<p>in the country. On 29 November 1989 &#8212; three days after Abdallah&#8217;s death &#8212; Denard and 
</p>
<p>the Presidential Guard carried out a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat, during which a number of police officers 
</p>
<p>were reportedly killed, hundreds of people arrested and the regular army disarmed. The 
</p>
<p>President of the Supreme Court, Abdallah&#8217;s constitutional successor, was ousted and 
</p>
<p>replaced by Mohamed Sa&#239;d Djohar, said to have been chosen by Denard. On 7 December 
</p>
<p>1989, Djohar reportedly ordered a violent crackdown on demonstrations by students and 
</p>
<p>workers. The general strike that followed caused Denard to surrender to French forces on 
</p>
<p>15 December 1989. Along with some of his associates, he was flown to Pretoria. On his 
</p>
<p>return to France in February 1993, he was tried and found not guilty of Abdallah&#8217;s murder. 
</p>
<p>Two years later, he returned to Comoros for one last time in an unsuccessful attempt to 
</p>
<p>regain power. 
</p>
<p>17. According to information received by the Working Group, at least 20 coups d&#8217;&#233;tat or 
</p>
<p>attempted coups d&#8217;&#233;tat took place in Comoros during the 20 years following independence. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group received reports consistently indicating an inextricable link between 
</p>
<p>the country&#8217;s three decades of political instability and the resulting mercenarism and violent 
</p>
<p>coups d&#8217;&#233;tat and associated human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>18. The question of Mayotte was also mentioned on several occasions as a crucial 
</p>
<p>feature of mercenarism in Comoros. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-09907 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>19. Historically, Mayotte is part of the Comoros archipelago. In referendums in 1974 
</p>
<p>and 1976, the island voted against independence, choosing to remain French. However, to 
</p>
<p>this day, Comorians consider Mayotte to be an integral part of Comoros and challenge the 
</p>
<p>legitimacy of the referendum. However, France has always maintained that Mayotte is part 
</p>
<p>of its territory, and in 2011 the island became a French overseas department. 
</p>
<p>20. The question of Mayotte has also been discussed by the international community. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group notes a number of General Assembly resolutions between 1976 and 
</p>
<p>1994 recognizing Mayotte as forming part of Comoros.3 Several of those whom the 
</p>
<p>Working Group met expressed the view that the question of Mayotte was inseparable from 
</p>
<p>mercenarism and the country&#8217;s political instability. 
</p>
<p>21. Many of the people interviewed by the Working Group were also of the opinion that 
</p>
<p>the mercenaries had acted with a view to destabilizing Comoros following its independence 
</p>
<p>and weakening it politically, socially and economically. They stressed that the higher 
</p>
<p>standard of living in Mayotte as compared to the rest of the Comoros archipelago 
</p>
<p>highlighted the disastrous state of post-independence Comoros. 
</p>
<p>22. As to the involvement of foreign powers during the period of mercenarism, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group received numerous reports about the prominent role played by France and 
</p>
<p>South Africa at that time. Many people believe, for example, that France was involved in 
</p>
<p>despatching mercenaries such as Bob Denard to Comoros in order to overthrow successive 
</p>
<p>governments, exacerbate political instability and divert attention from Mayotte. In their 
</p>
<p>opinion, destabilization was used by mercenaries to bolster the view that independence, 
</p>
<p>rather than being a source of progress for Comoros, was the cause of crises and 
</p>
<p>impoverishment. Others believe, however, that the mercenaries were simply individuals 
</p>
<p>attracted by the prospect of financial gain and power. The lack of judicial investigations in 
</p>
<p>both Comoros and the countries concerned by mercenarism and the absence of 
</p>
<p>comprehensive historical and political research make it difficult to establish with certainty 
</p>
<p>the truth about any link that might have existed between Bob Denard &#8212; and his 
</p>
<p>mercenaries &#8212; and foreign powers, notably France. 
</p>
<p>23. With the information available to it, the Working Group cannot establish the extent 
</p>
<p>of the responsibility of foreign powers for the country&#8217;s permanent instability. It has, 
</p>
<p>however, taken note of the concerns expressed by many of the people it met. The question 
</p>
<p>of South Africa&#8217;s presence in Comoros was also raised in the context of the international 
</p>
<p>isolation of the apartheid regime. 
</p>
<p>24. According to some of those interviewed, South Africa supported the Abdallah 
</p>
<p>Government between 1978 and 1989 because it did not impose sanctions on the apartheid 
</p>
<p>regime. During that period, Comoros became a destination of choice for South African 
</p>
<p>businesses and tourists, thereby providing a source of considerable income for the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>economy. The revenues thus generated helped to keep some of the mercenary-era 
</p>
<p>governments in power. The Working Group was also informed that, following the 
</p>
<p>assassination of President Abdallah in 1989, Bob Denard found refuge in South Africa and 
</p>
<p>lived there until 1993. Shortly thereafter, in 1995, he was again involved in a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 United Nations General Assembly resolutions 31/4, 37/65, 39/48, 40/62, 41/30, 42/17, 43/14, 44/9, 
</p>
<p>45/11, 46/9, 47/9, 48/56 and 49/18. In 1976, by resolution S/11967, the United Nations Security 
</p>
<p>Council called on the Government of France to desist from proceeding with the holding of the 
</p>
<p>referendum in Mayotte and to &#8220;respect the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Comorian 
</p>
<p>State and to refrain from taking any action which may jeopardize the independence, sovereignty, 
</p>
<p>unity and territorial integrity of the Comorian State &#8230; composed of the islands of Anjouan, Grande-
</p>
<p>Comoro, Mayotte and Moheli&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/50/Add.1

<p><b>8</b> GE.14-09907 
</p>
<p>Comoros. Bob Denard&#8217;s stay in South Africa was the subject of a 1995 communication by 
</p>
<p>the former Special Rapporteur on mercenaries4 
</p>
<p>25. The question of Mayotte is today still high on the country&#8217;s political agenda. The 
</p>
<p>comparatively higher standard of living enjoyed by the inhabitants of Mayotte is a factor 
</p>
<p>that still influences the lives of Comorians, with many of them attempting to reach that 
</p>
<p>island in the hope of a better future. However, inhabitants of Comoros cannot currently 
</p>
<p>travel to Mayotte without a visa, which is difficult to obtain. The Working Group was told 
</p>
<p>that, as a result, large numbers regularly try to cross the sea from the neighbouring 
</p>
<p>Comorian islands, in particular from the island of Anjouan. According to reports, many of 
</p>
<p>them are returned forcibly or perish in the attempt. 
</p>
<p>26. The Working Group was informed that most of the coups d&#8217;&#233;tat &#8212; albeit instigated 
</p>
<p>by mercenaries &#8212; also involved the collusion of Comorians, attracted not only by the 
</p>
<p>prospect of financial gain but also by political power. The consequences of that difficult 
</p>
<p>past should not be underestimated. The question of Mayotte and successive governments&#8217; 
</p>
<p>use of force and violence to seize power created an environment in Comoros that was ripe 
</p>
<p>for long-term political instability. This had a profound impact on the daily lives of 
</p>
<p>Comorians and created a vicious circle preventing the country&#8217;s development. 
</p>
<p>27. In analysing the history of Comoros, the Working Group notes that the right of 
</p>
<p>Comorians to self-determination has been seriously impeded by mercenarism. Acts of 
</p>
<p>mercenarism, often associated with violence, have undermined the fundamental rights of 
</p>
<p>Comorians, including their right to life, security, liberty and physical integrity, as well as 
</p>
<p>the economic and social rights needed for the development and proper functioning of 
</p>
<p>Comorian society. In the short term, mercenarism ruined many lives, led to material losses 
</p>
<p>and made economic development impossible. The long-term effects for Comoros have been 
</p>
<p>no less serious. During its visit, the Working Group observed that many political, economic 
</p>
<p>and social challenges, such as those posed by government structures unable to cope with the 
</p>
<p>daily struggle against poverty, inequality and corruption, are clearly related to the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>past. It noted that many Comorians expressed the desire to erase the stigmatization of 
</p>
<p>Comoros linked to mercenarism, and widespread weariness over the country&#8217;s constant 
</p>
<p>association with mercenaries. Nevertheless, the Working Group gathered a wealth of 
</p>
<p>information about past events and is grateful to the persons it met who wished to share with 
</p>
<p>it their personal experiences and knowledge of the subject. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Separatism and its possible causes 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Working Group was also informed about the separatist tendencies that have 
</p>
<p>posed a greater threat to national unity and provoked political instability in Comoros. The 
</p>
<p>constant changes of government and the lure of political gain have given rise to many 
</p>
<p>factions and led to rivalry between, on the one hand, the three Comorian islands of Anjouan, 
</p>
<p>Moh&#233;li and Grande Comore, where the capital Moroni is located, and Mayotte, on the other. 
</p>
<p>29. In 1997, the inhabitants of the islands of Anjouan and Moh&#233;li declared their wish to 
</p>
<p>be reunited with France. A referendum was held on Anjouan, the majority voting in favour 
</p>
<p>of the establishment of an independent state. However, France reportedly failed to support 
</p>
<p>the claims of the separatists. The Comorian armed forces subsequently invaded the island 
</p>
<p>of Anjouan, which led to further calls for the creation of an independent Anjouan state. The 
</p>
<p>conflict led to bloody clashes between the rival forces. Persons interviewed by the Working 
</p>
<p>Group also reported gross violations of human rights. Another coup d&#8217;&#233;tat took place in 
</p>
<p>1999, instigated by Azali Assoumani, who seized power while the Government was busy 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/50/Add.1

<p>GE.14-09907 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>dealing with the separatist crisis. A compromise was reached years later through an 
</p>
<p>agreement to adopt a new constitution aimed at improving relations between the three 
</p>
<p>islands. 
</p>
<p>30. Many reports stressed that the separatist movement was rooted in the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>economic decline and the people&#8217;s desire for living conditions similar to those enjoyed on 
</p>
<p>the neighbouring island of Mayotte. According to those reports, the movement can also be 
</p>
<p>explained by the inequalities experienced by the inhabitants of Anjouan and Moh&#233;li, since 
</p>
<p>most of the financial assistance received by Comoros goes primarily to the island of Grande 
</p>
<p>Comore. On Anjouan, the most densely populated of the islands, the main reason for the 
</p>
<p>popular uprising was the demand for equitable resource management.  
</p>
<p>31. Although separatist movements were born out of economic grievances, they have 
</p>
<p>exacerbated regionalism and national divisions within Comoros and undermined efforts to 
</p>
<p>introduce political stability. Even today, separatism remains a sensitive issue and many 
</p>
<p>interviewees emphasized that the Comorian Government needs to ensure the even 
</p>
<p>distribution of resources among the islands so as to prevent any resurgence of separatist 
</p>
<p>movements. 
</p>
<p>32. The Governor of Anjouan told the Working Group that weapons previously 
</p>
<p>belonging to Anjouan separatists had not been recovered by the Comorian army and were 
</p>
<p>reportedly concealed on the island. He expressed concern that those weapons might fall into 
</p>
<p>the hands of mercenaries or persons wishing once more to destabilize the country. 
</p>
<p>33. The Working Group sought to ascertain whether there was a link between 
</p>
<p>separatism and mercenarism. While some interviewees said that the two were clearly 
</p>
<p>connected, most accounts tended instead to reject any such link. Some French nationals had 
</p>
<p>reportedly supported the Anjouan separatists, but they were said to have acted for personal 
</p>
<p>reasons rather than for money. However, most of the people who spoke to the Working 
</p>
<p>Group did link separatism with the question of Mayotte. According to information received, 
</p>
<p>the island of Mayotte served as a support base for the mercenaries during their period of 
</p>
<p>activity. Several separatist leaders are also reported to have been living in Mayotte at the 
</p>
<p>time of the 1999 separatist crisis. Some interviewees expressed the view that France had 
</p>
<p>stirred up separatism in order to divert the attention of the Comorian Government away 
</p>
<p>from the question of Mayotte. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Impact of mercenarism on the enjoyment of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>34. Given the difficulties encountered in collecting historical information during its visit, 
</p>
<p>due mainly to the absence of records and written documents, the lack of judicial 
</p>
<p>investigations in both Comoros and the countries concerned by mercenarism, and the 
</p>
<p>absence of comprehensive historical and political research, the Working Group is of the 
</p>
<p>view that it is difficult for it at this stage to establish the facts with certainty and to 
</p>
<p>determine the degree of foreign countries&#8217; responsibility for mercenarism in Comoros. Be 
</p>
<p>that as it may, it clearly recognizes that the collective actions of foreign actors and local 
</p>
<p>nationals were responsible for the continued destabilization of Comorian society and that 
</p>
<p>they effectively impeded the right of the Comorian people to self-determination.  
</p>
<p>35. The Working Group was struck by the negative impact left by mercenarism on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights today, an impact which can still be seen in the weakness of 
</p>
<p>Comorian State institutions, in particular. The Comorian people lived through a series of 
</p>
<p>coups d&#8217;&#233;tat and attempted coups d&#8217;&#233;tat closely linked to the issue of mercenarism, which 
</p>
<p>profoundly destabilized Comoros and its institutions for nearly three decades. This long 
</p>
<p>period of political turmoil crippled the country from its earliest days, and it has never been 
</p>
<p>able to make significant political, social or economic progress. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.14-09907 
</p>
<p>36. The representatives of Comorian State institutions that the Working Group met, like 
</p>
<p>those from civil society and the National Commission for Human Rights and Freedoms, 
</p>
<p>confirmed that serious and systematic human rights violations had been committed between 
</p>
<p>1975 and 1989 by mercenaries and elements of the Presidential Guard formed by Bob 
</p>
<p>Denard. The Working Group heard reports of numerous cases of enforced disappearances, 
</p>
<p>torture, rape and summary executions during that period. According to those reports, a 
</p>
<p>number of armed forces personnel who had attempted to fight the mercenaries were 
</p>
<p>reportedly executed and their bodies sent to their families. The Working Group notes with 
</p>
<p>regret that to date there have been no judicial inquiries into these offences, no prosecutions, 
</p>
<p>nor, <i>a fortiori</i>, any penalties handed down against the perpetrators or any redress provided 
</p>
<p>to the victims and their families. 
</p>
<p>37. It was widely reported that the absence of political alternation was a key element in 
</p>
<p>both the successive coups d&#8217;&#233;tat and the question of mercenarism, since, in the context of a 
</p>
<p>country with little experience of democracy, it encouraged Comorian politicians wishing to 
</p>
<p>gain power to do so by force with the support of mercenaries from abroad. In this 
</p>
<p>connection, the Working Group welcomes the adoption of the 2001 Constitution and its 
</p>
<p>2009 amendment introducing the principle of a rotating presidency among the Comorian 
</p>
<p>islands, which represents an important factor of stability for the country. The Working 
</p>
<p>Group was informed that, by ensuring a democratic change of power every five years 
</p>
<p>among the islands, the strategy of presidential rotation is aimed at preventing further coups 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;&#233;tat. Article 8 of the Referendum Act amending the Constitution of the Union of the 
</p>
<p>Comoros of 23 December 2001 provides that &#8220;the President and Vice-President shall be 
</p>
<p>elected together by direct universal suffrage on the basis of majority vote in one round for a 
</p>
<p>term of five (5) years, subject to rotation among the islands&#8221;. Article 11 of the Act further 
</p>
<p>states that &#8220;the Assembly of the Union shall be composed of twenty-four (24) 
</p>
<p>representatives of the Nation, elected by universal suffrage in single-member constituencies 
</p>
<p>on the basis of majority vote in two rounds; [and] representatives of the autonomous islands 
</p>
<p>appointed by the Island Councils from among their members (three representatives per 
</p>
<p>autonomous island) &#8230;&#8221;. Article 7-2 of the Act states: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the autonomous islands, the executive and deliberative functions shall be 
</p>
<p>exercised by different organs. The executive function shall be exercised by a 
</p>
<p>governor assisted by commissioners. The Governor shall be elected by direct 
</p>
<p>universal suffrage in one round for a term of five years, renewable for one further 
</p>
<p>term. The Governor shall be the head of the autonomous island. He shall exercise by 
</p>
<p>way of order the powers assigned to him under the Constitution and the statutory act 
</p>
<p>of the autonomous island &#8230; . The deliberative function shall be exercised by an 
</p>
<p>island council. The Island Council shall regulate the affairs of the autonomous island 
</p>
<p>through its deliberations. The Councillors of the Island shall be elected together with 
</p>
<p>their alternates by majority vote in single-member constituencies for a term of five 
</p>
<p>years. A law of the Union shall determine the number of constituencies and the 
</p>
<p>modalities of the vote.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>38. Despite the progress made by Comoros since the early 2000s and the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>relative stability, the direct and indirect consequences of mercenarism on Comorian society 
</p>
<p>are reflected today in a number of deficiencies that affect Comorians&#8217; enjoyment of their 
</p>
<p>human rights. 
</p>
<p>39. The primary direct consequence of mercenarism has been the restriction on the right 
</p>
<p>of the Comorian people to self-determination. The successive coups d&#8217;&#233;tat that have 
</p>
<p>occurred since independence have prevented the Comorian people from experiencing 
</p>
<p>genuine democracy and from building institutions in accordance with the principles of the 
</p>
<p>rule of law. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-09907 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>40. Attacks linked to mercenarism, which began immediately after the emergence of the 
</p>
<p>Comorian State, have severely hampered the country&#8217;s development, leading in particular 
</p>
<p>to fragile State institutions, a lack of coordination among those institutions and a shortage 
</p>
<p>of State resources. As a result, the State is unable to meet the needs of Comorians or to 
</p>
<p>guarantee their economic, social, civil and political rights. 
</p>
<p>41. The frequent changes of government have undermined all attempts at nation-
</p>
<p>building and made for a lack of trust in the public service, which is still quite noticeable 
</p>
<p>today. The Working Group noted that, because of the past political turmoil, Comorians 
</p>
<p>nowadays rely more on their local communities than on the Government to meet their daily 
</p>
<p>needs. In many respects, Comoros has remained in a political and economic limbo, while 
</p>
<p>most of the neighbouring countries have advanced and even prospered in recent decades. 
</p>
<p>42. In its discussions with civil society organizations, the Working Group was informed 
</p>
<p>that poverty continues to be one of the most serious consequences of the mercenary 
</p>
<p>activities associated with the coups d&#8217;&#233;tat and political instability. The resulting serious 
</p>
<p>social and economic problems have made Comoros one of the poorest countries in the 
</p>
<p>world, with a high mortality rate and a low level of education. To a large extent, its 
</p>
<p>economy depends on foreign aid and remittances from families living abroad. In this 
</p>
<p>connection, the Working Group was informed that several hundred Comorians drown every 
</p>
<p>year attempting to flee poverty by reaching Mayotte in makeshift craft. 
</p>
<p>43. Owing to the political instability, foreign investment is sadly lacking, while private 
</p>
<p>sector development is non-existent. Despite the Government&#8217;s efforts to attract investment, 
</p>
<p>basic infrastructure and the education and health sectors continue to be funded by local 
</p>
<p>communities rather than by the Government. Hospital equipment and road infrastructure 
</p>
<p>are in poor condition. The unemployment rate is high, and State institutions are short of 
</p>
<p>specialized staff in various fields, including justice and human rights. 
</p>
<p>44. Besides the weakness of Comorian institutions, the Working Group considers that a 
</p>
<p>further barrier to good governance lies in the complexity and lack of transparency of the 
</p>
<p>institutional architecture inherited from the past. Another aggravating factor is the 
</p>
<p>corruption affecting Comorian institutions, denounced by the President of the Republic 
</p>
<p>during his meeting with the Working Group. Today the Government is the main employer 
</p>
<p>in Comoros. The Working Group noted the abysmally low level of coordination between 
</p>
<p>ministries and departments and between those bodies and the private sector and civil 
</p>
<p>society, a lack of coordination evident when officials at times gave contradictory replies to 
</p>
<p>questions about Government policies and activities. 
</p>
<p>45. During its meetings with the Comorian authorities, the Working Group was struck 
</p>
<p>by the lack of institutional memory, particularly with regard to the issue of mercenarism. 
</p>
<p>For instance, the Working Group was unable to obtain from Government officials 
</p>
<p>documents that would enable an official timeline of the coups d&#8217;&#233;tat and attempted coups 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;&#233;tat involving mercenaries to be established. This was due to the lack of historical 
</p>
<p>documents and the oral tradition that prevails in Comoros. 
</p>
<p>46. The Working Group noted the need for the Government and the Comorian people to 
</p>
<p>undertake work related to historical memory, documentation and data collection in order to 
</p>
<p>demonstrate the link between the past and the current impact of mercenarism and the 
</p>
<p>destabilization of Comoros. The aim of that work would be to prevent history from 
</p>
<p>repeating itself. The Working Group observed that the absence of statistics and written 
</p>
<p>information has prevented the Government from carrying out an in-depth analysis of the 
</p>
<p>causes of mercenarism and from learning from the past. 
</p>
<p>47. One of the notable effects of mercenarism is the culture of impunity that is still rife 
</p>
<p>present in Comoros. To date, no case of mercenarism has been tried there, even though 
</p>
<p>mercenaries have been implicated in most of the coups d&#8217;&#233;tat and attempted coups d&#8217;&#233;tat </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.14-09907 
</p>
<p>and that allegedly committed serious violations of human rights. It should be emphasized 
</p>
<p>that the problem of impunity is aggravated by the fact that most of the foreigners implicated 
</p>
<p>in those mercenary activities have also not stood trial in their countries of origin for those 
</p>
<p>acts or the alleged human rights violations. For instance, in June 2006 Bob Denard was 
</p>
<p>sentenced to a 5-year suspended prison term by the Paris Criminal Court solely for his 
</p>
<p>participation in the 1995 coup d&#8217;&#233;tat. He was found guilty only of the arrest and illegal 
</p>
<p>restraint of Sa&#239;d Mohamed Djohar, the former President of Comoros. His 26 associates, 
</p>
<p>who were tried along with him, were also sentenced to suspended prison terms or convicted 
</p>
<p>but exempted from punishment. 
</p>
<p>48. The Working Group received reports that former elements of the Presidential Guard 
</p>
<p>&#8212; Comorians and persons close to the mercenaries &#8212; joined the army or took senior posts 
</p>
<p>in the public service and still hold those positions today. The Working Group considers that 
</p>
<p>this aggravating circumstance has contributed to perpetrators of human rights violations 
</p>
<p>remaining unpunished and victims not receiving redress. It notes that the new draft criminal 
</p>
<p>code provides for the punishment of Comorian citizens who perform actions to destabilize 
</p>
<p>the Comorian State, but that it does not cover actions relating to mercenarism involving 
</p>
<p>foreign nationals, thereby leaving a serious gap in Comorian law. 
</p>
<p>49. The Working Group also received reports that impunity extends to human rights 
</p>
<p>violations committed at present, including violence against women and children, arbitrary 
</p>
<p>detention, denial of the rights of detainees, lack of independence of the judiciary and 
</p>
<p>reprisals against human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>50. The Working Group also observed that the Comorian judicial system fails to meet 
</p>
<p>the needs of the population. It considers this to be one of the many indirect consequences of 
</p>
<p>mercenarism, the vicious circle of coups d&#8217;&#233;tat and the political destabilization that have 
</p>
<p>affected Comorian institutions. Furthermore, according to information received by the 
</p>
<p>Working Group, the fundamental rights of detainees are not guaranteed and the 
</p>
<p>presumption of innocence is not respected. 
</p>
<p>51. Reports indicate inhuman conditions of detention, prison overcrowding (facilities 
</p>
<p>operating at 300 per cent of capacity), a failure to separate adult and juvenile detainees and 
</p>
<p>ill-treatment of detainees resulting in some deaths in custody. Representatives of the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice confirmed that under Comorian law a confession constitutes evidence 
</p>
<p>which is valid in itself, and this in a context in which, as those representatives 
</p>
<p>acknowledged, there is an acute lack of resources available for the verification of 
</p>
<p>information obtained in this way. In fact, investigations by the judicial police are very 
</p>
<p>summary in nature, since forensic medicine is still in its infancy and the police do not have 
</p>
<p>the necessary scientific resources. This creates a significant risk of judicial error. There 
</p>
<p>were also reports that no written decisions were made in some criminal cases. 
</p>
<p>52. The Working Group took note of the efforts made by the Ministry of Justice to train 
</p>
<p>judges but remains convinced that more resources and technical support are needed to 
</p>
<p>strengthen the judicial system and ensure its proper functioning. 
</p>
<p>53. The Working Group is also concerned that the army is responsible for providing 
</p>
<p>public security, a role that should be carried out by the national police. It noted the lack of 
</p>
<p>training for police officers, who are trained on the job. It also noted that the national police, 
</p>
<p>unlike the army, does not have an adequate operating budget. The Working Group raised 
</p>
<p>the issue of the risk of human rights violations arising from the fact that the army&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>responsibility for public security, although it is not trained to interact with the civilian 
</p>
<p>population. 
</p>
<p>54. The Working Group notes the creation of the National Defence and Security 
</p>
<p>Commission, following a seminar on defence held in March 2014 with a view to 
</p>
<p>introducing a new security policy. The Commission is tasked with following up on the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-09907 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>recommendations made at the seminar. It consists of representatives of the defence and 
</p>
<p>security sector, including the national police, and the President of the National Commission 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights and Freedoms. Those recommendations are intended to form the basis of 
</p>
<p>a future Green Paper aimed at defining a comprehensive and multi-sectoral defence and 
</p>
<p>national security policy. The Green Paper will seek to address a number of shortcomings, 
</p>
<p>including the politicization of the defence and security forces, the lack of internal 
</p>
<p>coordination, the absence of a clear hierarchy, lax staff recruitment procedures and poor 
</p>
<p>training. 
</p>
<p>55. According to information received by the Working Group, one of the direct 
</p>
<p>consequences of mercenarism and the resulting instability is the continuing fear on the part 
</p>
<p>of the Comorian authorities and people of having to face a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat. Indeed, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group heard various reports about frequent rumours of coups d&#8217;&#233;tat; this shows that the 
</p>
<p>stability enjoyed by Comoros for the last decade or so continues to be fragile and that the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s institutions must be strengthened. 
</p>
<p>56. The Working Group spoke to various people about the &#8220;power grab&#8221; of April 2013. 
</p>
<p>Some of those interviewed said there had been a foiled coup attempt aimed at ousting the 
</p>
<p>serving President, involving not only Comorian nationals but also mercenaries from the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chad and Niger. Mention was also made of a French 
</p>
<p>national, close to the mercenary Bob Denard, who is reported to have been the instigator of 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;power grab&#8221;. Other interviewees, however, seemed to contradict the theory of an 
</p>
<p>attempted coup, arguing that those involved had no weapons and that they had been used 
</p>
<p>for political ends. 
</p>
<p>57. The Working Group has not been able to obtain information about the current 
</p>
<p>investigation that is under way and which remains confidential at this stage of the 
</p>
<p>proceedings. However, it was informed that those suspected of participating in the 
</p>
<p>organization of the alleged coup attempt are still detained and awaiting trial. The Working 
</p>
<p>Group was also informed of the existence of a letter of request to allow the investigating 
</p>
<p>judge assigned to the case to travel to France in the near future in order to consult the 
</p>
<p>minutes of the hearing of the French national who might be involved in this case. 
</p>
<p>According to information received by the Working Group, an agreement on mutual legal 
</p>
<p>assistance between Comoros and France, drawn up on the latter&#8217;s initiative, is due to be 
</p>
<p>considered shortly by the Assembly. If approved, the agreement will allow for the 
</p>
<p>systematic exchange of information in criminal matters. 
</p>
<p>58. The Working Group is concerned that persons suspected of participating in coups 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;&#233;tat or attempts to overthrow the Government are tried by a special court, established 
</p>
<p>during the mercenary period, and that those convicted cannot appeal the court&#8217;s decisions 
</p>
<p>on the merits. The Working Group emphasizes that the right of a convicted person to appeal 
</p>
<p>a conviction remains a fundamental right, and encourages the Comorian Government to 
</p>
<p>consider abolishing that special court and to declare ordinary criminal courts competent to 
</p>
<p>try cases connected to State security. 
</p>
<p>59. The events of April 2013, in which a number of foreign nationals and Comorians are 
</p>
<p>suspected of conspiring to violate State security, demonstrate the country&#8217;s continuing 
</p>
<p>fragile state. The Working Group notes with regret that the matter is yet to be resolved and 
</p>
<p>encourages the Comorian Government to ensure that the accused are brought to trial 
</p>
<p>promptly, with all the judicial guarantees that are recognized as indispensable under 
</p>
<p>international law, or that they are released if the allegations against them cannot be 
</p>
<p>confirmed. </p>

</p>
<p><b> VI. Private security companies 
</b></p>
<p>60. In accordance with its mandate, the Working Group considered the issue of private 
</p>
<p>military and security companies operating in Comoros. It was informed that there are no 
</p>
<p>private military companies in Comoros, but that some five private security companies are 
</p>
<p>operating in the country. Most of those companies provide services such as custodial 
</p>
<p>services and the protection of buildings such as ministries, embassies and the central prison. 
</p>
<p>61. A number of people reported that hydrocarbons, including oil and natural gas, had 
</p>
<p>recently been discovered in Comoros and that this would increase the presence of 
</p>
<p>exploration companies there. The number of private security companies could also increase 
</p>
<p>as a result. 
</p>
<p>62. The Working Group was informed that there was no legal framework in place to 
</p>
<p>regulate the activities of private security companies, but that the Government had recently 
</p>
<p>begun work on a bill to address that issue. Given the possible rapid expansion of this 
</p>
<p>industrial sector, the Working Group underlined the need to regulate the activities of private 
</p>
<p>security companies and promptly to enact relevant legislation. 
</p>
<p>63. The Working Group has recommended that the Government require that all private 
</p>
<p>security companies must register in order to be allowed to operate in Comoros. It has 
</p>
<p>further suggested that the Government require that, as a precondition for registration, all 
</p>
<p>private security companies should join the International Code of Conduct for Private 
</p>
<p>Security Providers&#8217; Association (ICoCA).5 The Code of Conduct sets forth the obligations 
</p>
<p>of private security companies in respect of international humanitarian law and international 
</p>
<p>human rights law. The Working Group has recommended that the Government should draw 
</p>
<p>on the provisions of the Code of Conduct when deciding on the major elements to be 
</p>
<p>included in the future law on private security companies. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Working Group wishes to reiterate its gratitude to the Government of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Comoros for its invitation that made the visit possible. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>From the beginning of its visit, the Working Group noted the difficult and 
</b></p>
<p><b>turbulent nature of the country</b>&#8217;<b>s history since independence in 1975. National 
</b></p>
<p><b>political, economic and social development was stalled by a series of coups d</b>&#8217;<b>&#233;tat 
</b></p>
<p><b>instigated by mercenaries and the political instability that prevailed over the three 
</b></p>
<p><b>subsequent decades. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>Despite the actual long-term presence of mercenaries in the country, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group regrets that it did not receive any written information on the various 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues raised, particularly on past mercenary interventions. The Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>noted that the period of mercenarism was a painful episode in Comorian history and 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the lack of historical information is a consequence of both the oral tradition and 
</b></p>
<p><b>reluctance on the part of the Government and the Comorian people to face up to a 
</b></p>
<p><b>difficult past. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Working Group recognizes the profound negative and interdependent 
</b></p>
<p><b>effects of mercenarism, separatism and the issue of Mayotte on the human rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Comorians. The overthrow of successive administrations by mercenaries and a lack of 
</b></p>
<p><b>stability have severely undermined the right of the Comorian people to self-
</b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-09907 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b>determination. The failure to bring perpetrators of past human rights violations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including mercenaries and political leaders active during the period in question, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>trial, has spawned a culture of impunity that still prevails, thanks in part to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>continued absence of a stable and effective judicial system. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Working Group further notes that, in addition to the political instability 
</b></p>
<p><b>brought about by mercenarism, the country still faces the major issue of its precarious 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic situation. Throughout the course of its visit, the Working Group pointed out 
</b></p>
<p><b>that it was important to make a connection between the history of mercenarism in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Comoros and the many human rights challenges that the country must address, such 
</b></p>
<p><b>as poverty. The Working Group believes that, by making that vital link with the past, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the country will finally be able to tackle contemporary issues. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>However, notwithstanding the huge obstacles Comorians have had to face, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group noted positive developments that have led to relative stability in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country: for example, an amendment to the Constitution allowing for the rotation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the presidency, which has helped counter the problem of separatism and attempted 
</b></p>
<p><b>coups d</b>&#8217;<b>&#233;tat. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Working Group welcomes the establishment of the National Commission 
</b></p>
<p><b>for Human Rights and Freedoms and notes with satisfaction the amendments to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure currently before the Assembly 
</b></p>
<p><b>for consideration. A number of those amendments will help strengthen legislation on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the protection of the rule of law against future coups d</b>&#8217;<b>&#233;tat. There is an increased 
</b></p>
<p><b>diplomatic presence in the country, proof that a number of States wish to work closely 
</b></p>
<p><b>with Comoros and to provide financial assistance for development. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Notwithstanding the lack of foreign investment in the country, the presence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>natural resources has the potential to attract investors in the form of multinational 
</b></p>
<p><b>companies in the extractive industry, which often employ private security companies 
</b></p>
<p><b>to protect their facilities. The likelihood of an increase in the number of private 
</b></p>
<p><b>security companies operating in Comoros and current concerns surrounding 
</b></p>
<p><b>maritime delimitation issues require the introduction of appropriate legal regulations. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Working Group benefited from full Government cooperation during its 
</b></p>
<p><b>visit and welcomes the Government</b>&#8217;<b>s willingness to move forward and to tackle the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights challenges currently facing the country. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>In the light of the above, the Working Group makes the following 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>To the Government of Comoros: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Good governance is vital if Comoros is to make progress and achieve 
</b></p>
<p><b>significant development. The Government is invited to focus on actions and measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>to boost and strengthen democracy and respect for human rights. Efforts to bolster 
</b></p>
<p><b>multisectoral institutions such as the judiciary, the National Commission for Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights and Freedoms, the Anti-Corruption Commission and law-enforcement bodies 
</b></p>
<p><b>would also be valuable in that regard; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Improved coordination between state institutions and with civil society is 
</b></p>
<p><b>both necessary and essential in terms of strengthening national infrastructure, 
</b></p>
<p><b>enhancing knowledge sharing and transparency regarding public management and 
</b></p>
<p><b>boosting collective efforts to promote and safeguard human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Human rights training and capacity building must be promoted and 
</b></p>
<p><b>extended to all three branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial) and 
</b></p>
<p><b>to civil society. There is a serious lack of appropriate training within many institutions, </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.14-09907 
</p>
<p><b>such as the police force and the judiciary. The Working Group wishes to reassert the 
</b></p>
<p><b>importance of providing judicial training with a human rights standards component; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Robust institutions and solid legislation built on the principles of the rule 
</b></p>
<p><b>of law can offer a measure of protection against mercenarism and potential coups 
</b></p>
<p><b>d</b>&#8217;<b>&#233;tat. In order to make progress in that regard, the Government must take a firm 
</b></p>
<p><b>stance against impunity by strengthening the legislation in force. Mercenarism is not 
</b></p>
<p><b>specifically prohibited under Comorian law. The draft Criminal Code contains 
</b></p>
<p><b>provisions on crimes against State security. However, the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends incorporating a specific offence regarding mercenarism into the new 
</b></p>
<p><b>Code to close any legal loopholes giving rise to impunity. The Government may wish 
</b></p>
<p><b>to refer to the provisions of the International Convention against the Recruitment, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries, which contain significant elements that 
</b></p>
<p><b>could be taken into account in Comorian law. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) In order to safeguard both the independence of the judiciary and access 
</b></p>
<p><b>to effective justice, the Working Group urges the Government to abolish the Court of 
</b></p>
<p><b>State Security, which seems to operate on an ad hoc basis, and to use the ordinary 
</b></p>
<p><b>criminal courts to try cases involving national security offences; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) As to criminal justice, the Working Group is concerned at the fact that 
</b></p>
<p><b>uncorroborated confessions constitute evidence sufficient in itself for a conviction. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>that regard, information obtained as a part of a confession should be carefully verified 
</b></p>
<p><b>during the investigation stage. The Working Group also recommends that 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate training be provided to law enforcement agents carrying out criminal 
</b></p>
<p><b>inquiries. The Working Group wishes to point out that, in order to ensure access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective justice, specialists such as forensic doctors must be recruited. The Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group recommends establishing a unit made up of technical and scientific police 
</b></p>
<p><b>officials, as well as forensic reports, to ensure that confessions are not treated as 
</b></p>
<p><b>evidence which is valid in itself and to avoid judicial errors. The Working Group also 
</b></p>
<p><b>points out that it is vital to safeguard the rights of detainees when obtaining 
</b></p>
<p><b>confessions. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Civil society participation is essential to the consolidation of a culture of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights. The Working Group recognizes that more resources must be provided 
</b></p>
<p><b>in support of civil society efforts and that there is a pressing need for capacity-
</b></p>
<p><b>building and technical assistance. Aware of the huge human rights challenges facing 
</b></p>
<p><b>the country, such as poverty, inadequate social services and increasing violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>against women and children, the Working Group calls for civil society to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthened; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) The Working Group recommends that the Government and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Comorian people begin the process of documenting the mercenary period, in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>establish a link between the past and its consequences, which are hampering national 
</b></p>
<p><b>development. Such an approach would contribute to a better understanding of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>effects of the </b>country&#8217;s <b>destabilization by the mercenaries and to efforts to prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>history from repeating itself. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) The Working Group recommends shielding light on the alleged 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibility of foreign powers regarding the role of mercenaries, such as Bob 
</b></p>
<p><b>Denard and his allies, in Comorian history. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) The Working Group invites the Government and the States of origin of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the mercenaries to improve cooperation and the free exchange of information in order 
</b></p>
<p><b>to facilitate inquiries into mercenarism and to swiftly bring those responsible to 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice. Such an approach would also make it possible to strengthen measures against </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-09907 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>impunity and to address the issues surrounding transborder investigations, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>often arise in cases of mercenarism. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) As to those persons detained in connection with the events of April 2013, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Working Group requests the Government to ensure that they are tried promptly, 
</b></p>
<p><b>in line with all the legal guarantees provided for under international human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The detainees should be released if none of the charges against them can be proven; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) Regarding military and private security companies, the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that the Government adopt a law regulating their activities and those of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their staff. The Working Group urges the Government to ensure that private security 
</b></p>
<p><b>companies are registered and that they have joined the International Code of Conduct 
</b></p>
<p><b>for Private Security Providers</b>&#8217;<b> Association (ICoCA) prior to registration;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) The Working Group welcomes the ratification by Comoros of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Organization of African Unity (OAU) Convention for the Elimination of Mercenarism 
</b></p>
<p><b>in Africa in 2004 and recommends that the Comorian State also consider ratifying the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Mercenaries, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (n) The Working Group recommends that the National Defence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Security Commission set out an overall, multisectoral, national defence and security 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategy protecting and promoting human rights. The Group urges the Commission to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that members of the armed forces and the police force are held responsible for 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights violations and for involvement in activities linked to mercenarism; 
</b></p>
<p><b>To the United Nations specialized agencies: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (o) The Working Group recommends that the United Nations specialized 
</b></p>
<p><b>agencies increase technical assistance for capacity-building of the National 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission for Human Rights and Freedoms, so that it can operate as a fully 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent and effective body; 
</b></p>
<p><b>To the international community: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (p) The Working Group requests the international community to take steps 
</b></p>
<p><b>to provide resources and technical assistance to Comoros to help the country build its 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutional capacities and improve </b>the people&#8217;s<b> living conditions. A collective effort 
</b></p>
<p><b>to provide this crucial aid would help to maintain national stability, strengthen 
</b></p>
<p><b>democratic structures and make for all citizens</b>&#8217;<b> better enjoyment their human rights. 
</b></p>
