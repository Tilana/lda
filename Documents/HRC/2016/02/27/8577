<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur undertook an official visit to the United Arab Emirates 
between 12 and 18 October 2009. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with stakeholders 
in the Emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah. The Special 
Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United Arab Emirates for its hospitality and 
collaboration in organizing meetings with relevant government officials and its cooperation.  
</p>
<p>2. In Abu Dhabi, the Special Rapporteur met with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the 
Ministry of Health, the Ministry of the Interior, the Abu Dhabi Police, the Ministry of 
Justice, the Ministry of Education, the Secretariat of the National Committee to Combat 
Human Trafficking and the Federal National Council. In Dubai, she met with the Ministry 
of Social Affairs, the Dubai Courts and the Dubai Police. In Sharjah, she met with 
representatives of the judicial corps, the prosecutor and the Higher Council for Family 
Affairs.   
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited the Social Services Department of Abu Dhabi Police 
Headquarters, the Emirates Human Rights Association, the Abu Dhabi shelter for victims 
of trafficking (Ewa&#8217;a), the General Women&#8217;s Union, the Dubai Community Development 
Authority, the Dubai Foundation for Women and Children, the Sharjah City for 
Humanitarian Services and the Sharjah Social Services Department.  
</p>
<p>4. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur also engaged with members of civil society, 
academics and other organizations and individuals.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the United Nations Country Team for its 
assistance and support. She met with the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations 
Development Programme and with representatives of the Office of the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) in Abu Dhabi.  
</p>
<p>6. In her report to the ninth session of the Human Rights Council in September 2008 
(A/HRC/9/21), the Special Rapporteur identified the following objectives of her mandate: 
</p>
<p> (a)  A better understanding of the situation of the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography and of contributing factors (socio-economic, cultural 
and environmental); 
</p>
<p> (b) Implementation of a comprehensive child protection system that ensures the 
best interest of the child and encompasses prevention and care as well as medical, 
psychological, social and legal support, rehabilitation and social reintegration of child 
victims, and promotion of the rights of the child; and 
</p>
<p> (c) Effective and concerted national, regional and international coordination and 
cooperation.  
</p>
<p>7. With this in mind, the objective of the visit was to explore the incidence of sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography in the United Arab Emirates, and to 
examine initiatives and measures undertaken by the Government and civil society in the 
area of child protection more generally. The Special Rapporteur paid particular attention to 
efforts to prevent these phenomena by exploring the situation of children vulnerable to 
these practices, including children in difficult family situations, children with unknown 
parents, orphans, migrant children and children living in more remote areas. Throughout the 
visit, the Special Rapporteur solicited the views of all stakeholders regarding the situation 
of the rights of the child in the country, on measures which have had some success, as well 
as on those which needed to be strengthened, with a view to making targeted conclusions 
and recommendations that would ultimately be owned by the stakeholders themselves. At </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.2 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>the end of the visit, the Special Rapporteur shared her preliminary observations with the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the press. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background  
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Brief country profile 
</b></p>
<p>8. The United Arab Emirates is composed of seven Emirates: Abu Dhabi (capital), 
Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm al-Qiwain. It has undergone 
significant changes in a relatively short period of time. Its population grew from 1 million 
people in 1980 to approximately 8.19 million people (national and non-national) in 2009. It 
is estimated that 73.9 per cent of the population in the 15&#8211;64 age group is non-national. Its 
growth rate, estimated in 2009 at 3.69 per cent per year is, according to some reports, the 
highest in the world. The economic boom and vast entrepreneurship mostly in Abu Dhabi 
and Dubai also led to a significant increase in tourism to the two Emirates.  
</p>
<p>9. The Constitution defines the objectives and the institutions of the Federation and 
provides that the Federation exercises its sovereignty inside the international borders of the 
member Emirates, while the member Emirates exercise their sovereignty over all matters 
for which the Federation does not have competence under the Constitution. The 
Constitution further provides that Islam is the official religion, Arabic is the official 
language and that Islamic sharia is a main source of legislation.  
</p>
<p>10. The Federal system of government includes a Supreme Council, a Council of 
Ministers (Cabinet) and the Federal National Council. The Supreme Council, which is 
composed of the ruler of each of the seven Emirates, is the top policymaking body of the 
United Arab Emirates, and is charged with ratification of international treaties and 
agreements (Constitution, art. 47). The Federal National Council has both a legislative and 
supervisory role under the Constitution. It is responsible for examining, and amending, if 
necessary, all proposed federal legislation. Since late 2006, half of its members were 
elected by indirect vote through local councils. Prior to then, all its members had been 
appointed by the rulers of the constituent Emirates. Finally, each of the seven Emirates has 
its own local government. 
</p>
<p>11. The Federal Judiciary is composed of the Federal Supreme Court and Courts of First 
Instance. Neither Abu Dhabi, Dubai nor Ras Al Khaimah are part of the federal judicial 
system. In the Dubai court system, the Court of First Instance includes the Civil Court, the 
Criminal Court and the Sharia Court. The Sharia Court governs cases related to divorce, 
alimony, child custody and personal status and is regulated under the law and sharia.   
</p>
<p><b> B. International and regional human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>12. The United Arab Emirates is a State party to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>13. The United Arab Emirates is not a party to the following human rights instruments: 
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (nor its Optional Protocol), the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (nor its Optional Protocol), the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (nor its Optional Protocol), the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities nor the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. In 
addition, the United Arab Emirates has ratified neither the 1954 Convention relating to the 
Status of Stateless Persons nor the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. 
</p>
<p>14. More specifically, the United Arab Emirates is not a party to either of the two 
Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, on the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography, and on the involvement of children in armed 
conflict. The United Arab Emirates has made reservations to articles 7, 14, 17 and 21 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child.1     
</p>
<p>15. The United Arab Emirates has ratified the International Labour Organization 
Convention No. 138 (1973) concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment and 
Convention No. 182 (1999) concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the 
Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour. The United Arab Emirates has also 
ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially 
Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime (Palermo Protocol). 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur took the opportunity during the visit to recall to the 
Government that its second periodic report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child has 
been overdue since 2004. 
</p>
<p>17. At the regional level, the United Arab Emirates is a member state of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council. The objectives of the Council include achieving coordination and 
integration among its member States and the development of similar regulations in a wide 
range of fields, including legislation, and in educational, social, cultural, tourism, and 
collaboration with the private sector. The United Arab Emirates has ratified the Arab 
Charter for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Situation analysis  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Scope of sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography  
</b></p>
<p>18. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur received a low number of reported cases of 
sale of children and of trafficking of children for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The 
Abu Dhabi Police informed the Special Rapporteur that there were no reported cases of sale 
or sexual exploitation of children in 2008. The Abu Dhabi Police also reported that the 
women who were arrested for engaging in prostitution were above 18 years of age. The 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Article 7: The United Arab Emirates is of the view that the acquisition of nationality is an internal 
</p>
<p>matter and one that is regulated and whose terms and conditions are established by national 
legislation. 
Article 14: The United Arab Emirates shall be bound by the tenor of this article to the extent that it 
does not conflict with the principles and provisions of Islamic law. 
Article 17: While the United Arab Emirates appreciates and respects the functions assigned to the 
mass media by the article, it shall be bound by its provisions in the light of the requirements of 
domestic statues and laws and, in accordance with the recognition accorded them in the preamble to 
the Convention, such a manner that the country's traditions and cultural values are not violated. 
Article 21: Since, given its commitment to the principles of Islamic law, the United Arab Emirates 
does not permit the system of adoption, it has reservations with respect to this article and does not 
deem it necessary to be bound by its provisions. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>authorities also reported on one case of trafficking of children for sexual exploitation 
involving two girls, who are in a shelter. This case is currently with the prosecutor&#8217;s office.  
</p>
<p>19. Judges at the Dubai courts informed the Special Rapporteur that they have dealt with 
perhaps one case of sexual exploitation of a child in their courts in the past 5 to 10 years. 
Cases of prostitution, they report, involve women over 18 years of age. The Secretariat of 
the National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking reported that there were 20 cases of 
human trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation registered with the National 
Committee in 2008, the largest number emanating from Dubai. There were a total of 32 
victims and 43 accused persons. The Special Rapporteur also received information about 
successful operations to dismantle trafficking networks, in cooperation with Kazakhstan 
and Tajikistan. The Special Rapporteur regrets, however, that existing statistics are not 
disaggregated by form of trafficking nor by age and gender of the victims.  
</p>
<p>20. The Dubai Foundation for Women and Children reported that they worked with 43 
victims of trafficking in 2008, and 22 victims of trafficking in the first half of 2009. 
According to the Foundation, on average, children represent 26 per cent of the victims of 
trafficking staying at the shelter, whereas in the first half of 2009, children represented 32 
per cent of the victims of trafficking staying at the shelter, i.e., seven victims of trafficking.  
</p>
<p>21. The Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office in Sharjah informed the Special Rapporteur that his 
office has one pending case of sale of a child, as a result of an &#8220;illegal relationship&#8221; 
between a woman and an unknown father. The trial date has yet to be fixed, so the Special 
Rapporteur encourages the United Arab Emirates to keep her informed of developments 
regarding this case, ensuring that the child is provided with adequate care, protection and 
follow-up.  
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur notes that knowledge about the use of children in 
pornography is limited. She observed that child pornography is understood as children 
viewing pornography, rather than the use of children in pornographic materials, which 
many in society still do not believe can occur.  
</p>
<p>23. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the file relating to the use of 
child camel jockeys is now closed. The authorities stated that all former child camel 
jockeys have been repatriated and that there are no new cases of children being used in such 
activities. More information on this issue is provided below, in paragraphs 65&#8211;69. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur notes the lack of a centralized and standardized information 
system for gathering data on the phenomena of sale of children and sexual exploitation of 
children, analysis of such data, sharing of information and reporting. The absence of such a 
system would explain disparities in data provided by various stakeholders on the incidence 
of these phenomena. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Domestic legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates provides for a range of human rights 
that are relevant to the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. For instance, article 15 provides 
that &#8220;the family is the basis of society. It is founded on morality, religion, ethics and 
patriotism. The law shall guarantee its existence, safeguard and protect it from corruption&#8221;. 
Article 16 provides that &#8220;society shall be responsible for protecting childhood and 
motherhood and shall protect minors and others unable to look after themselves for any 
reason, such as illness or incapacity or old age or forced unemployment. It shall be 
responsible for assisting them and enabling them to help themselves for their own benefit 
and that of the community&#8221;. The Constitution also provides that education shall be 
compulsory in its primary stage and free of charge at all stages (art. 17).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>26. In 2002, the Committee on the Rights of the Child observed that several rights 
contained in the Convention (such as non-discrimination) are not adequately reflected in 
domestic law (CRC/C/15/Add.183, para. 7). The Special Rapporteur learned of a draft law 
on child protection which has reportedly been submitted for approval to the Federal 
National Council. This bill, a copy of which the Special Rapporteur was not able to review 
despite her repeated requests, allegedly brings together elements of the existing Juvenile 
Delinquency and Vagrancy Act, the Criminal Code and the rights contained in the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. While welcoming the initiative taken to prepare a 
law on child protection, the Special Rapporteur is not in a position to comment on the draft 
law&#8217;s compatibility with the State&#8217;s obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, given that she was not provided with a copy thereof. She nevertheless stands ready to 
provide any guidance or assistance in this respect. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Sale of children 
</b></p>
<p>27. Article 346 of the Penal Code (Federal Act No. 3 of 1987) prohibits the sale of 
persons for enslavement and provides that &#8220;whoever brings into or out of the country any 
person with the intent to possess or dispose of that person and whoever possesses, 
purchases, sells, offers for sale or transacts in any manner any person as a slave, shall be 
punished with provisional imprisonment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>28. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur notes the absence of specific provisions 
defining and prohibiting the sale of children. By way of indication, article 2 of the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography defines the sale of children as any act or transaction 
whereby a child is transferred by any person or group of persons to another for 
remuneration or any other consideration.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Child prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>29. Article 358 of the Penal Code stipulates that &#8220;anyone who commits an indecent act, 
even in private, with a girl or boy under the age of 15 shall be sentenced to not less than one 
year in prison&#8221;. Furthermore, article 363 of the Penal Code provides that &#8220;anyone who uses 
any means to incite, recruit or seduce a male or female with a view to engaging him or her 
in acts of debauchery or prostitution shall be sentenced to a term of not less than one year in 
prison and a fine&#8221;. If the victim was under the age of 18, the perpetrator shall be sentenced 
to at least two years in prison and a fine. 
</p>
<p>30. Article 42 of the Juvenile Vagrants and Delinquents Act provides that: &#8220;a penalty of 
up to one year in prison or a fine of from 2,000 to 5,000 dirhams shall be imposed on 
anyone who exposes a minor to delinquency, by preparing him for it, inciting him to engage 
in such behaviour or in any way facilitating his involvement therein, even if the 
delinquency does not actually materialize as far as the law is concerned. According to 
article 13 of the Act, delinquency is a situation in which a person &#8220;commits acts involving 
prostitution, depravity, moral turpitude, gambling or drugs&#8221;. This article would thus 
presumably cover situations of use of children in pornography.  
</p>
<p>31. In the aftermath of the visit, the Special Rapporteur received information about the 
drafting of a new law which would create the specific offence of possession of child 
pornography. The law would also set up a register for those convicted of sex offences 
against children and provide for the establishment of a child protection centre to deal with 
cases of child sexual abuse. Since the Special Rapporteur has not seen a copy of the draft 
legal provisions, she invites the Government to keep her informed of all developments in 
this regard.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Trafficking in children 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur notes Federal Law No. 51 on Combating Human 
Trafficking Crimes (2006) which defines trafficking according to the definition contained 
in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women 
and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime (Palermo Protocol) and sets out the duties of the National Committee to 
Combat Human Trafficking. The law furthermore defines a child as any person who is less 
than 18 years old. However, the Special Rapporteur notes the absence of a specific article 
on trafficking in children. Such an article should provide that the recruitment, 
transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall 
be considered &#8220;trafficking in persons&#8221; even if this does not involve any of the means set 
forth in the definition (threat, use of force, coercion, kidnap, fraud, deceit, abuse of power, 
exploitation of a condition of weakness, offering or receiving money or advantages to 
secure consent of a person who is in control of another person).  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern at the absence of provisions in the 
Human Trafficking Act relating to protection measures for victims of trafficking. She 
learned that the Human Trafficking Act is currently being amended, notably with respect to 
provisions regarding the protection of witnesses and evidence. The Special Rapporteur 
encourages the Government to keep her informed of all developments in this regard, with a 
view to ensuring that all amendments are in keeping with international human rights 
standards. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Adoption of children 
</b></p>
<p>34. Article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that States parties 
that recognize and/or permit the system of adoption shall ensure that the best interests of the 
child shall be the paramount consideration and sets out certain conditions to ensure the 
safeguard of the child in both national and intercountry adoption processes. 
</p>
<p>35. Adoption is not permitted in the United Arab Emirates, as reflected in its reservation 
to article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Special Rapporteur learned 
about the elaboration of a draft law on children (national or not) with unknown parents, 
which provides for conditions under which a child may be taken under the care of by an 
adult (for instance, a family member). The Special Rapporteur did not see a copy of this 
draft, but once again expresses her willingness to provide any assistance or support in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>36. During the examination of its State report to the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child in 2002, the United Arab Emirates stated that the national committee monitoring the 
implementation of the Convention on the Rights was going to re-examine all the 
reservations to the Convention. More particularly, the United Arab Emirates stated that its 
reservation to article 21 would be withdrawn given the fact that its provisions are optional 
for those States which do not recognize or permit the system of adoption (CRC/C/SR.794, 
para. 30). The United Arab Emirates have not yet done so. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Nationality 
</b></p>
<p>37. Pursuant to article 2 of the Nationality Act, the following children are granted 
nationality in the United Arab Emirates: 
</p>
<p> (a) A child born in the State or abroad to a national father by law; 
</p>
<p> (b) A child born in the State or abroad to a national mother by law and whose 
affiliation to the father is not legally established; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p> (c) A child born in the State or abroad to a national mother by law and of 
unknown father or stateless; 
</p>
<p> (d) A child born in the State of unknown parents. Unless otherwise established, 
the foundling shall be deemed born in the State.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Juvenile justice 
</b></p>
<p>38.  The penalties of imprisonment and capital punishment are prohibited for juveniles 
(art. 9 of the Juvenile Delinquents and Vagrants Act). In accordance with article 10, the 
sentence must be commuted to a penalty of detention for a period not exceeding half of the 
prescribed maximum term and must be served in special establishments in which social 
welfare and educational facilities are available.  
</p>
<p>39. The age of criminal responsibility is set at 7 years of age (Juvenile Delinquents and 
Vagrants Act, art. 6), which the Special Rapporteur believes is too low as compared to 
international standards. A &#8220;juvenile&#8221; is defined under the Juvenile Delinquents and 
Vagrants Act as a person who, at the time of commission of the act, was less than 18 years 
of age. Under the terms of article 8 of the same Act, &#8220;if a juvenile over 16 years of age 
commits an offence punishable under the Penal Code or any other legislation, the judge 
may, at his discretion, sentence him to the measures provided for in this Act instead of the 
prescribed penalties&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>40. If a juvenile is charged for a first offence under the Juvenile Delinquents and 
Vagrants Act (Federal Act No. 9 of 1976), he/she receives a reprimand. If he/she commits 
another offence, he/she is placed under surveillance for which a judicial order is required. 
Placement in a detention centre is reportedly perceived as a measure of last resort. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>41. Various ministries deal with various aspects of the rights of the child, including the 
Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, the Ministry of 
Justice and the Ministry of the Interior. A specific unit, with a significant budget, within the 
Ministry of Social Affairs is tasked with issues related to the child. Furthermore, the 
Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that courts have judges specialized in the rights of 
the child and that there is an attorney general for children. 
</p>
<p>42. The Higher Council for Motherhood and Childhood was established by Decree No.1 
in 2003, but has yet to start functioning. According to Decree No. 1 of 2003, the aims of the 
Higher Council are to increase the level of attention to and follow-up of motherhood and 
childhood issues; to provide support and achieve security and safety of the child and 
mother; and to monitor and evaluate development plans. The Higher Council also promotes 
research and cultural dissemination on issues related to motherhood and childhood. 
Members include the Director of the General Women&#8217;s Union, the Secretary-General of the 
Red Crescent Society, the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Education.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur was given to understand that the Higher Council will be 
tasked with elaborating and monitoring the implementation of the National Child Protection 
Strategy, which is in the process of being elaborated in collaboration with UNICEF and the 
General Women&#8217;s Union, among others.  
</p>
<p>44. At the local level, the Special Rapporteur visited social services departments in both 
Abu Dhabi and Sharjah, as well as the Dubai Community Development Authority in Dubai. 
The authority was established by decree in July 2008, with the objective of working on 
development and social issues and preserving national identity, but currently only applies to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>the Emirate of Dubai. The authority is tasked with implementing the Dubai Strategic Plan 
(2007&#8211;2015).  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Establishment of a monitoring mechanism for the rights of the child 
</b></p>
<p>45. There is currently no independent national human rights institution in the United 
Arab Emirates. As such, there is no mechanism empowered to monitor the situation of the 
rights of the child within care centres or other institutions, to receive and address 
complaints, and to monitor the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child more generally. Article 4 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that 
States parties shall undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative, and other measures 
for the implementation of the rights recognized in the present Convention. In its general 
comment No. 2 (2002) on the role of independent national human rights institutions in the 
promotion and protection of the rights of the child, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child encourages States parties to establish an independent institution for the promotion 
and monitoring of implementation of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>46. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur echoes the recommendation of the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child in its most recent concluding observations on the United Arab 
Emirates (CRC/C/118, paras. 367&#8211;411). The Committee recommended that the 
Government establish an independent national human rights institution in accordance with 
the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection 
of human rights (Paris Principles) to monitor and evaluate progress in the implementation 
of the Convention at the national and local levels. The Special Rapporteur welcomes 
information about the foreseen establishment of a child rights monitoring mechanism. This 
institution should be accessible to children and empowered to receive and investigate 
complaints of violations of child rights in a child-sensitive manner and to address them 
effectively. The Special Rapporteur stands ready to provide any assistance or support 
regarding the modalities of such a mechanism. 
</p>
<p>47. Furthermore, the Ministry for Social Affairs informed the Special Rapporteur about 
discussions on the possibility of providing for a defender of the rights of the child in the 
Child Protection Act.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur met with the Secretariat of the National Committee to 
combat human trafficking, which derives its mandate from articles 12 and 13 of Law No. 
51 on Combating Human Trafficking Crimes. Its tasks include studying and updating 
legislation regarding human trafficking to ensure harmonization with international 
standards. In addition to preparing annual reports and raising awareness on the subject, the 
National Committee coordinates the various State authorities in relation to combating 
human trafficking.   
</p>
<p><b> D. Child protection strategies to address sale of children, child prostitution 
and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Assistance and protection to child victims of exploitation and abuse  
</b></p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn of six specialized tribunals for children, 
which have special spaces for children in the courts that she visited in Dubai, in order to 
guarantee confidentiality and protection to children. She was also encouraged to note the 
existence of specialized tribunals of first instance for minors within the Dubai criminal 
court system.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>50. Judges at the Dubai courts reported that if they are faced with a case of prostitution, 
they coordinate with embassies of the countries of origin of the prostitute and with those 
providing psychological assistance to the victim, and take into account the views of the 
psychologist. The judge considers the testimony of the child in accordance with his/her age 
and maturity.  
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur expresses her concerns regarding the fact that a child victim 
of sexual exploitation is exposed to being charged with having committed sexual crimes, 
and that corporal punishment is provided for in the law. Pursuant to the Juvenile 
Delinquents and Vagrants Act, a juvenile of 16 years of age and over may be punished 
under article 8 of the Penal Code, which provides for a punishment by flogging for 
numerous offences, including murder, violent assault, offences related to alcohol or drugs, 
theft and sexual crimes. In addition, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about a lack of 
clarity as to when cases related to the involvement of a child over 16 years of age should be 
referred to the civil courts and when they should be referred to sharia courts, as it appears to 
be left to the discretion of the judge. There is further confusion over when a juvenile should 
be placed in prison and when he/she should be sent to a juvenile care centre. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur visited a range of centres that provide services to, inter alios, 
victims of exploitation and abuse, especially women and children. These centres are all 
funded by the ruling families of the Emirates. The Special Rapporteur also learned about 
protection centres for children without parental care (e.g. the Al Zayed Foundation), but did 
not have the opportunity to visit any such centre.  
</p>
<p>53. In Abu Dhabi, the Social Support Centre of the Abu Dhabi Police Headquarters 
(Ministry of Interior) started operations in 2004 and is run by police officers in civilian 
clothes. Its objectives are to provide social support, assistance to victims, rehabilitation, 
assistance with settling family disputes and establish partnerships with charitable 
organizations and the Red Crescent Society.  
</p>
<p>54. The profile of the victims at the centre range from cases of runaway children to child 
victims of violence in the home. There is another such centre in Al Ain, but the Abu Dhabi 
Centre also covers the whole country and sometimes staff from the Centre travel to other 
parts of the country to provide assistance services in fields such as violence against 
children, including negligence, reintegration into families, social support to children with 
unknown parents and cases of violence in schools. The Special Rapporteur was informed 
that serious cases of violence are referred to the police. The centre also offers training 
sessions to teachers on how to address and counsel students who may be victims of 
violence in school. The centre also runs a hotline, which reportedly does not receive many 
phone calls. 
</p>
<p>55. The centre is currently examining the issue of developing a specialized unit to deal 
with exploitation and abuse of children on the Internet. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed of training sessions on these issues, which have been undertaken with the 
assistance of Microsoft. The centre is also in the process of creating a website and 
brochures, and providing materials for television programmes on such television channels 
as Al Jazeera for children, in order to raise awareness about the issues of violence against 
children, the centre and its work. Representatives of the centre informed the Special 
Rapporteur that they share experiences with similar centres in other countries.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur also visited the Abu Dhabi Shelter for victims of trafficking 
in women and children (Ewa&#8217;a shelter). It provides temporary and long-term services for 
female victims of internal and transnational trafficking in persons for sexual purposes, as 
well as to female domestic workers who have been physically and sexually exploited. It 
does not cover cases of domestic violence against women.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>57. It opened in January 2008 and can accommodate up to 30 individuals at one time. 
Thus far, it has worked on approximately 30 cases, all of whom were victims of trafficking 
for sexual exploitation. These cases were referred to the shelter by churches, hospitals, the 
Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office and the Red Crescent Society. The shelter also runs a hotline. 
The average age of the victims receiving assistance is between 18 and 29 years of age, and 
sometimes women stay with their children. The length of stay of victims at the shelter 
ranges between one and six months. The services provided include crisis intervention, 
reintegration and psychological, legal and medical assistance. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur was informed by shelter representatives that the main 
challenge remained to provide adequate treatment and assistance to the victims, as they 
stated that women arrive at the shelter in often severe conditions of mental and physical 
anguish. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged to learn about cooperation initiatives 
undertaken between the centre and civil society organizations in the countries of origin of 
the victims. For instance, the shelter arranges for return of victims and ensures, in 
cooperation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the country of origin, in order 
to ensure proper follow-up of victims once they return to their home country. The Ministry 
of the Interior is reportedly also considering levying fines against offenders with a view to 
providing compensation to victims of trafficking.2 The Secretariat of the National 
Committee to Combat Human Trafficking also informed of efforts to strengthen 
mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur also visited the Dubai Foundation for Women and Children 
and met with its representatives. The Foundation was established in late 2007 and runs a 
shelter for victims of various forms of violence, such as domestic violence or trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children. It currently consists of 150 lodgings, and at the 
time of the visit, was half full. 
</p>
<p>60. The Foundation provides support services (advocacy, outreach, work with the 
media), as well as protection and rehabilitation services directly to victims (psychologists, 
social workers and supervisors). The Special Rapporteur learned that the Foundation runs a 
hotline. If they receive a possible threat of violence over the hotline, the professionals 
contact the police.  
</p>
<p>61. According to statistics provided by representatives of the Foundation, victims of 
domestic violence represent 37 per cent of the cases referred to them, victims of trafficking 
28 per cent, victims of child abuse 25 per cent, and other 10 per cent. On average, children 
represent 26 per cent of the victims of trafficking, whereas in the first half of 2009, children 
represented 32 per cent of the victims of trafficking staying at the shelter. The Foundation 
reported that in 2008, they received 43 victims of trafficking, and 22 victims of trafficking 
in the first half of 2009.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur also visited the Sharjah Social Services Department, a 
sizeable programme created in 1984. Since its creation, it has worked with a total of 1,089 
children, 338 of whom benefited from the protection services of the Department&#8217;s centre 
and 202 were placed in foster families. The centre established transitory shelter services for 
children in difficult situations coming from all the Emirates in 2006, targeting their 
reintegration into foster families. In 2007, a counselling unit was created for children with 
mental and psychological difficulties, from difficult backgrounds, providing care, recovery 
and reintegration. In 2008, a programme was created to work on protection of children of 
prisoners, working with the children directly in the prisons; since its inception, this

</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>programme has assisted 128 children. The centre also operates as a day-care centre and 
offers psychological services, and works with children from unknown parents. The Special 
Rapporteur was pleased to learn about a system whereby complaints within the school 
system are transmitted to the Social Services Department. In 2008, 633 complaints were 
received. The Special Rapporteur regrets however that these statistics are not disaggregated 
by nature of complaint nor who is filing the complaint.  
</p>
<p>63. Finally, the Department has been running a hotline since 2007, which receives calls 
relating to neglect, exploitation and trafficking, among other concerns. During 2008, out of 
a total of 8,248 calls to the hotline, 625 callers were seeking information, while 403 calls 
related to particular cases. The following table illustrates the cases raised by the callers in 
2008 and between January and September 2009: 
</p>

</p>
<p>64. Regarding programmes to combat online child pornography, the Dubai Police 
reported that their Organized Crime Unit collaborates with the Research Department on 
Electronic Information, in order to detect irregular websites. Agents in the Organized Crime 
Unit also check different websites in order to detect prohibited material. 
</p>
<p><i>  Use of children as camel jockeys 
</i></p>
<p>65. Over the last two decades, children have been used as camel jockeys in the United 
Arab Emirates. Some children were trafficked from countries such as Bangladesh, 
Mauritania, Pakistan, Sudan and Yemen. The Special Rapporteur learned about 
considerable efforts made by the United Arab Emirates, in cooperation with other countries 
and international organizations, to tackle this problem and measures undertaken to assist 
and protect child victims. The Special Rapporteur is not in a position to assess the impact of 
the repatriation and rehabilitation efforts, having not met any former child camel jockeys. 
Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur learned that the United Arab Emirates enacted Law 
No. 15 of 2005 which prohibits the trafficking of children under 18 for camel racing. Under 
this law, offenders face up to three years in prison and/or a fine of at least 50,000 dirhams 
(approximately US$13,615).  
</p>
<p>66. In May 2005, the United Arab Emirates and UNICEF signed an agreement setting 
out a programme for the repatriation, rehabilitation, reintegration and protection of child 
jockeys. During a progress review in September 2006 by a number of States, 1,077 child 
camel jockeys were returned to their home countries in Asia and Africa. This program was 
estimated to cost 10 million dirhams (US$ 2.75 million), provided entirely by the United 
Arab Emirates, and was managed by the authorities of the United Arab Emirates, in 
association with the Ansar Burney Welfare Trust International in Pakistan and UNICEF.  
</p>
<p>67. In April 2007, the United Arab Emirates, UNICEF and delegates from Bangladesh, 
Mauritania and Sudan met to affirm their commitment to ending the use of camel jockeys 
and providing services and compensation to all children formerly involved in camel racing 
in the United Arab Emirates. The United Arab Emirates committed 29 million dirhams 
(US$8 million) to this programme, the focus of which was to help in country-based 
interventions by focusing on the establishment of monitoring mechanisms to prevent </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>children formerly involved in camel racing from re-entering hazardous or exploitative 
labour. This programme ended in May 2009.3  
</p>
<p>68. The Ministry of the Interior informed the Special Rapporteur about efforts 
undertaken to repatriate and rehabilitate former child camel jockeys and collaboration with 
UNICEF to train police officers in inspecting and responding to this issue. A working 
group has also been established, composed of representatives of the Ministry of the Interior, 
UNICEF and the authorities of four countries of origin in order to monitor the situation. In 
this regard, she encourages the Government to keep her informed of continued efforts to 
address and eradicate this phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>69. On 9 February 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, sent a letter to the United Arab 
Emirates regarding allegations that 988 Pakistani child camel jockeys who were previously 
trafficked to the United Arab Emirates have not been provided with compensation to date. 
This information indicates that the Government may not have undertaken adequate 
measures to ensure that the former child camel jockeys are repatriated, rehabilitated and 
adequately compensated for the damage suffered. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she 
has not yet received a response to this letter of allegation.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that the number of training sessions for 
police in identification of victims of trafficking is on the increase.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Capacity-building and awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p>71. Efforts to prevent the phenomena of the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography are multiple and interlinked, and include awareness-raising measures and 
elimination of the root causes and the demand for services that are exploitative of children.  
</p>
<p>72. Awareness-raising measures go a long way towards empowering the general public 
and professionals working in the field of child protection to detect and, in some cases, 
prevent violations of the rights of the child. Given the diverse ethnic composition of Emirati 
society, the Ministry of the Interior informed the Special Rapporteur about sensitization 
training offered to police. The Special Rapporteur also learned about ongoing training at the 
Judicial Institute on the rights of the child. The Special Rapporteur was informed about 
sensitization campaigns on the Convention on the Rights of the Child and on human rights 
more generally. Currently, human rights education filters into children&#8217;s learning through 
Arabic and Islamic law classes at schools, and teachers sometimes refer to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Justice admitted that a main 
challenge remains establishing how to increase awareness among the general public about 
international instruments and the domestic laws implementing them.  
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that the Dubai Foundation for Women 
and Children shares practices and exchanges information and research on a regular basis 
with other NGOs, academic institutions and United Nations agencies. The Foundation is 
regularly involved in advocacy campaigns on television and radio and provides training to 
social workers in schools. 
</p>
<p>74. The Ministry of the Interior also identified the important role of the family, 
particularly mothers, in efforts to prevent online child pornography. The Ministry of the 
Interior requested that additional seminars or training be organized and made available by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.

<p>75. After the visit, the Special Rapporteur was also informed about the opening of a 
&#8220;Human Rights village&#8221; in Dubai consisting of five domes addressing different human 
rights issues and which should be accessible to all. She welcomes this initiative, which she 
hopes will help raise awareness and educate people about human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Preventive actions addressing vulnerable children 
</b></p>
<p>76. Efforts to prevent the sexual exploitation of children must include effective 
measures to address the situation of children who are particularly vulnerable to these 
practices. The Special Rapporteur learned that there are some cases of children dropping 
out of school. However, because of the absence of a data collection system, it is difficult to 
know how many such cases there are, the profiles of those children and what their situation 
is. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that a new situation 
assessment of children in the United Arab Emirates was being prepared at the time of the 
visit.  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur was impressed by her visit to the Sharjah City for 
Humanitarian Services, which provides facilities, early intervention, rehabilitation and 
reintegration services for disabled children. It boasts 473 employees for 2,181 children; 
1,700 children attend the centre during the day only. The centre receives children who are, 
inter alia, hard of hearing, mentally disabled or autistic.  
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur was alarmed to hear first-hand accounts about the situation 
of children from <i>bidoon</i> communities.4 The Special Rapporteur received reports that 
children who are born to <i>bidoon</i> parents in hospital do not receive a health-care card and 
eventually cannot register to attend school. Birth registration of <i>bidoon</i> children is thus 
virtually non-existent in certain Emirates. She received reports that treatment of <i>bidoons</i> is 
disparate amongst the Emirates. Allegedly, only 10 per cent of <i>bidoon</i> children are in 
school, namely, in private institutions, as their parents can afford such education. She also 
heard about instances of sexual exploitation of these children and involvement in illegal 
activities.  
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur welcomes steps taken by the United Arab Emirates to grant 
citizenship to a certain number of <i>bidoons</i> in 2007 and again between September and 
November 2008. However, she regrets that the regularization process has been slow and 
incomplete and encourages the Government to accelerate this process to ensure that <i>bidoon</i> 
children have full access to social services (education, health, etc.) and protection from all 
forms of exploitation, neglect or violence.  
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern that some rights contained in the 
Constitution are only guaranteed for citizens and not non-citizens residing on the territory 
of the United Arab Emirates. For instance, article 19 provides that medical care and means 
of prevention and treatment of diseases and epidemics shall be ensured by the community 
for all citizens. In addition, all persons are equal before the law, without distinction between 
</p>
<p>  
 4 While definitions of the term <i>bidoon</i> tend to vary depending on the interlocutor, the individuals with 
</p>
<p>whom the Special Rapporteur met have been residing on the territory of the United Arab Emirates 
since before the creation of the federation in 1971 but have never been granted citizenship and are 
stateless. The term <i>bidoons</i> also include Arab-speaking individuals without recognized identification 
documents who have a genuine feeling of belonging to the United Arab Emirates, either because they 
were born on its territory before or after 1971, or because they had been raised on its soil. There are 
discrepancies regarding the total number of <i>bidoons</i> residing in the United Arab Emirates between 
official figures and those quoted by representatives of civil society. Government officials estimate 
that there are approximately 10,000 <i>bidoons</i>, whereas civil society representatives are of the view that 
the number of <i>bidoons</i> is much higher than the official figure of 10,000. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>citizens of the Union with regard to race, nationality, religious belief or social status (art. 
25). <b> 
</b></p>
<p>81. International human rights law provides that only a limited number of rights can be 
guaranteed only to citizens. Limited access to certain rights such as health and education by 
non-national children makes the latter more vulnerable to certain practices such as 
commercial sexual exploitation. The Special Rapporteur recalls the obligation of the United 
Arab Emirates, pursuant to article 2 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to take all 
necessary measures to ensure that all children within its jurisdiction enjoy all the rights set 
out in the Convention without discrimination. Furthermore, she echoes the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child which expressed its concern at the disparities in the enjoyment of 
economic and social rights, particularly regarding health and education, experienced by 
non-national children (see CRC/C/15/Add.183, para. 23).  
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that granting nationality through the mother 
solely in cases where the father&#8217;s affiliation is not legally established or where the father is 
unknown is discriminatory and can lead to discriminatory practices against the women and 
children concerned.5 She therefore remains concerned at the reservations made by the 
United Arab Emirates to article 9 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and to article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
regarding nationality.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Child participation 
</b></p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur met with the Sharjah Higher Council for Family Affairs and 
learned about their programmes. She was informed about programmes to increase 
awareness among children of their rights, in conformity with the principles of Islam, 
including freedom of expression, equality and their right to participate in matters affecting 
them. As an example of the work being done, there are summer camp programmes and nine 
websites accessible to children.  
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur also learned about the Sharjah Children&#8217;s Parliament. She 
was disappointed not to have met with the child members themselves, as she was told they 
were all in school at the time of the visit. The Parliament is divided into two councils (one 
for those aged between 10 and 12 years of age; and another for those aged between 12 and 
18 years of age). Representatives of this Parliament recently attended a conference bringing 
together representatives of children&#8217;s parliaments from other countries. For the time being, 
the Children&#8217;s Parliament only exists in Sharjah, but the wish was expressed that it be 
extended throughout the territory, which the Special Rapporteur strongly encourages.  
</p>
<p>85. The Ministry of Justice informed the Special Rapporteur that children are not 
involved in the elaboration of laws or policies affecting them, as children lack the necessary 
intellectual capacity to adequately participate in such processes. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur recalls article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of Child, which provides that 
States Parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the 
right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child 
being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child.  
</p>
<p>86. Despite efforts to promote the freedom of expression of children, the Special 
Rapporteur is of the view that such efforts do not entirely encompass a true understanding 
of the right of a child to express his/her views in all matters affecting him/her. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur echoes the concerns raised by the Committee on the Rights 
</p>
<p>  
 5 See also CEDAW/C/ARE/CO/1, concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women. </p>

</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>of the Child in 2002 in its concluding observations to the United Arab Emirates that 
children are not adequately informed about how to have input into policies that affect them, 
nor about how their views will be taken into consideration once they have been solicited 
(CRC/C/15/Add.183, para. 28).  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Promotion of the rights of the child 
</b></p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur observed a wide range of measures undertaken by the 
Government to secure rights of children, including access to education and health. For 
example, the Ministry of Education informed the Special Rapporteur about various 
programmes within schools designed to encourage child development. The establishment of 
the Higher Council for Motherhood and Childhood and the ongoing collaboration with 
UNICEF also point to a political will to promote the rights of the child.  
</p>
<p>88. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur observed that more can still be done in terms 
of promoting a veritable culture of the rights of the child, which views the child as an actor, 
not merely an object of rights, and a vector of proposals in all matters affecting him/her. In 
this regard, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that awareness-raising measures targeted 
to parents, teachers, prosecutors, judges and other concerned professionals (including 
psychologists, sociologists and legal aid workers) can be strengthened by ensuring a child 
rights-based approach based on the four guiding principles of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child: non-discrimination, adherence to the best interests of the child, the right to 
participate and the right to life, survival and development. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Ongoing actions 
</b></p>
<p>89. <i>Ratification of the Optional Protocol</i>: The authorities informed the Special 
Rapporteur that the ratification instruments relating to the Optional Protocol on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography had been deposited with the Council of 
Ministers for the final stages of ratification. 
</p>
<p>90. <i>Standardized system of data collection</i>: A recurring issue of concern is the absence 
of a reliable, nationwide and standardized system of data collection. For example, the 
Special Rapporteur is concerned about the discrepancy in the figures reported by the 
Ministry of the Interior (Abu Dhabi police) and those provided by care centres, such as the 
Dubai Foundation for women and children. The Special Rapporteur requested official 
statistics on child victims of sexual exploitation, including those trafficked for those 
purposes, but did not receive such figures. Such discrepancies point to the urgent need for a 
standardized system of data and information collection on these phenomena, and for such 
data to be disaggregated by age, gender, form of exploitation and other indicators. Data 
collection will go a long way towards providing more reliable information on the nature of 
these phenomena, their causes and their consequences and will assist the Government in its 
protection and prevention efforts.  
</p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that the Government is in the process 
of establishing such a database and encourages it to keep her updated on progress in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>92. <i>Pending legislation</i>: The Special Rapporteur highlights that certain laws are still 
pending in draft format, including the draft law on child protection and the law on children 
with unknown parents. Amendments to Federal Law No. 51 on Combating Human 
Trafficking Crimes are also pending. 
</p>
<p>93. <i>Higher Council for Motherhood and Childhood and National Child Protection 
Strategy</i>: In the light of the observations set out in this report, the Special Rapporteur </p>

<p>highlights the need for a national, integrated child protection strategy. She was informed 
that, within six months of her visit, a new situation assessment of the rights of the child in 
the United Arab Emirates was going to be prepared by the Higher Council for Motherhood 
and Childhood, in collaboration with UNICEF and other partners, such as the General 
Women&#8217;s Union. This assessment would then feed into the elaboration of a national child 
protection strategy. As mentioned above, the Higher Council for Motherhood and 
Childhood has been established by Decree but has yet to start functioning.  
</p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur welcomes such a process and encourages the Government 
and its partners to ensure that any such strategy consist of clear objectives and adopt a 
holistic view of the rights of the child. Children must be consulted and their views taken 
into account in the elaboration of this strategy and its implementation. The Strategy must be 
based on the best interest of the child, be accessible to all children in the country and at the 
local level, reflect complaint mechanisms and child protection systems and provide for 
effective evaluation and follow-up. The Special Rapporteur stands ready to provide any 
assistance or support in the elaboration or follow-up of this strategy.  
</p>
<p><b> V. International cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>95. As mentioned above, the Special Rapporteur commends the efforts of the United 
Arab Emirates regarding international cooperation to address the issue of rehabilitation and 
repatriation of child camel jockeys, particularly through the signing of eight bilateral 
agreements with sending countries in this regard.  
</p>
<p>96. Regarding online child pornography, the Ministry of the Interior reported various 
measures of cooperation to combat online child pornography and highlighted the 
importance of learning from other countries&#8217; experiences in this regard. The United Arab 
Emirates cooperate with the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) to 
report and detect cases, further to a programme of cooperation between the two. The 
Ministry of Social Affairs also reported that it participates in the Child Online Protection 
Initiative of the International Telecommunications Union, in which the private sector also 
participates.  
</p>
<p>97. The Abu Dhabi Police also joined the Virtual Global Taskforce, which is made up of 
law enforcement agencies from around the world working together to fight child abuse 
online. The taskforce is made up of the Australian Federal Police, the Child Exploitation 
and Online Protection Centre in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
the Italian Postal and Communication Police Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 
the United States Department of Homeland Security, the Abu Dhabi Police and 
INTERPOL. 
</p>
<p>98. The Abu Dhabi Social Support Centre expressed its view that its work would be 
more effective if it had direct access to police in other countries, rather than needing to pass 
through the respective Ministries of Foreign Affairs. They noted that such access would 
help them increase information-sharing, detection of criminals, protection and follow-up of 
victims.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the wide range of initiatives undertaken by 
the Government to guarantee the rights of the child and respond to emerging </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations of the rights of the child. The incidence of sale of children and sexual 
exploitation of children remains low. There have been strong efforts to fund the 
rehabilitation, reintegration and reparation of children used as camel jockeys. A 
number of programmes and centres have been created, run by various actors at the 
national and local level to address cases of child abuse, neglect, sexual exploitation of 
children, child victims of trafficking and challenges faced by disabled children. 
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur observed a keen interest on the part of the 
Government to share practices from other States and international organizations on 
how to further promote and protect the rights of the child.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that stronger efforts may be 
undertaken in the area of prevention, for example, by paying greater attention to the 
situation of certain children who may be particularly vulnerable to the 
abovementioned practices. She remains concerned at the disparate treatment of the 
rights of the child amongst the Emirates. Finally, several initiatives are still pending.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Special Rapporteur recalls that preventing and combating these 
phenomena is directly linked to the capacity of a society to adopt a holistic approach 
to the fundamental rights of children, and paving the way for the implementation of 
social policies which favour children, youth and the family and the elaboration of 
creative and innovative responses from both the public and the private sectors. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>In the spirit of cooperation and partnership, the Special Rapporteur makes the 
following specific recommendations to the Government, aimed at preventing the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography and building on efforts to ensure 
the protection of each child in the territory of the United Arab Emirates. She is 
assured that every effort will be made to implement them and stands ready to offer 
her full cooperation and assistance in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Regarding legislation, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the State 
party: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Accelerate the process of ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Define and criminalize the sale of children, in accordance with the 
definition provided in article 2 of the Optional Protocol; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure that all children under 18 years of age who are sexually exploited 
are not treated as criminals but rather as victims; all possible measures should be 
taken to avoid their stigmatization and social marginalization. This principle should 
be clearly established in all tribunals across all the Emirates;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Raise the minimum age of criminal responsibility in accordance with the 
principles and provisions of the Convention; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Include provisions in Federal Law No. 51 on Combating Human 
Trafficking Crimes regarding trafficking in children and protection of victims (care, 
rehabilitation, reintegration, repatriation, etc.) in accordance with the provisions of 
the Palermo Protocol; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Withdraw the reservations to articles 7, 17 and 21 of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child, and study its reservation to article 14, with a view to 
narrowing it, and in the longer term, to withdraw it in accordance with the Vienna </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Conference on Human Rights 
(1993); 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Withdraw the reservation to article 9 of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Ratify the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons 
and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Remove discriminatory Constitutional provision that health care is only 
guaranteed to citizens. Health care should be guaranteed to all children on the 
territory of the United Arab Emirates;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Outlaw corporal punishment in alternative care facilities and as a form 
of punishment for all those under 18 years of age. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Regarding the National Child Protection Strategy, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the State party: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Accelerate the process of elaborating the national child protection 
strategy, under the aegis of the Higher Council for Motherhood and Childhood, 
ensuring that it provides child protection systems accessible at the local level across 
the country, for all children without discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure that the Higher Council for Motherhood and Childhood becomes 
functional as soon as possible and that it be vested with clear objectives and decision-
making capacities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c)  Establish efficient coordination mechanisms at the national and local 
level. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Regarding information-gathering on the phenomena, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the State party: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a)  Complete the situation assessment of the rights of the child, in 
cooperation with UNICEF and the General Women&#8217;s Union; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b)  Accelerate the process of establishing a standardized and centralized 
information-gathering system which should provide for disaggregating data by sex, 
age, type of violation and measures taken, and by harmonizing methods of gathering 
and processing data. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Regarding child victims, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the State 
party: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Strengthen the child complaints monitoring mechanism, ensuring that it 
is easily accessible to all children on the territory of the United Arab Emirates 
without discrimination and guarantees the safety, protection and confidentiality of 
children; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Strengthen training given to relevant authorities on combating child 
online sexual exploitation, in order to effectively detect violations, and providing 
assistance to child victims of sexual exploitation while ensuring a child rights-based 
approach by means of an integrated and holistic system of care, reintegration and 
follow-up of children; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Implement the child victim protection guidelines, explicitly providing 
that children be consulted in the return and reintegration process; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d)  Provide durable solutions for those children who cannot return to their 
original home communities; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e)  Implement norms and standards in all childcare or detention 
institutions,  based on a child-rights approach. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Regarding vulnerable children, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
State party guarantee birth registration of all children born on the territory of the 
United Arab Emirates, and access to social services to all children, citizen or not. The 
situation of the <i>bidoon</i> children must urgently be regularized with a view to ensuring 
that they have access to health and education and thus decreasing their vulnerability 
to sexual exploitation.  
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>Regarding awareness-raising, the Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a)  Awareness-raising programmes should be continued in the longer term, 
targeting children, parents and the general public in order to promote behaviour and 
attitudes that guarantee the respect and promotion of the rights of the child, 
considering the child as a rights-holder; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b)  The media should be trained in the ethical treatment of cases of the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography and their role in awareness-
raising on the issue. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that child participation is increased by: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Informing, consulting and involving children in all matters involving 
them, including with respect to programmes and policies on the rights of the child;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensuring the participation of disadvantaged children (disabled, non-
registered and vulnerable children) without discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Empowering children and youth to engage in more positive and 
meaningful use of information and communication technologies;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Enhancing child and youth initiatives related to prevention, to fight 
sexual exploitation and to promote child rights. Children should be viewed as actors 
and vectors of proposals, not merely as subjects of rights.  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The State party should continue pursuing partnerships with the private sector, 
particularly tourism agencies, Internet service providers, telecommunication 
companies and banks in all efforts to combat the sexual exploitation of children, 
including child sex tourism and the exploitation of children online. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>Regarding independent monitoring of the situation of human rights, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that the State party: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Accelerate the establishment of an independent children&#8217;s rights 
mechanism, taking into account general comment No 2 (2002) of the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child on the role of independent national human rights institutions 
in the promotion and protection of the rights of the child. This body should play a 
key role in the independent monitoring of actions taken for the prevention of sale, 
trafficking and sexual exploitation, and protection of children from such exploitation 
and the restoration of the rights of children victims, in advocating for effective legal 
frameworks and enforcement and in ensuring, where necessary, that child victims 
have effective remedies and redress, including the possibility of filing complaints 
before this institution;</b>6<b>

</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Regarding international and regional cooperation, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a)  In view of the fact that the average age of victims of trafficking for 
sexual exploitation seems to be decreasing, the Government, in collaboration with 
countries of origin and transit, should strengthen comprehensive 
bilateral/subregional agreements to share information, to implement joint measures 
in order to prevent and combat child trafficking from the point of 
detection/identification to interim care and protection, and return and reintegration, 
and to prosecute offenders;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b)  Facilitate cooperation between the police forces of the United Arab 
Emirates and police forces in other States, for instance by alleviating procedures of 
establishing contact with each other; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c)  Increase and encourage the sharing of good practices, in cooperation 
with United Nations agencies and mechanisms regarding the child rights approach 
and the promotion of the rights of the child.
