Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On August 03, 2015, SAExploration Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) issued a press release
reporting its consolidated financial results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30,
2016.
 
A copy of the press release is being furnished as an exhibit to this Current Report and
incorporated by reference into this Item 2.02. The information set forth in this Item 2.02, including
Exhibit 99.2 attached hereto, is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be “filed” for the
purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise
subject to the liabilities of that Section. The information in this Item 2.02 shall not be incorporated
by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, except as otherwise expressly stated in such filing.
Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer
of Listing.    
On August 03, 2016, the Company received a deficiency notice from the NASDAQ Global Stock
Market (“NASDAQ”) stating that, based on the one remaining vacancy on the Company’s audit
committee, the Company is no longer in compliance with the audit committee requirements
required by NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605 (c)(2). As provided in the NASDAQ rules, the Company
has until the earlier of the Company’s next annual shareholders’ meeting or July 27, 2017, or if
the next annual shareholders’ meeting is held before January 23, 2017, then no later than
January 23, 2017. To regain compliance, the Company must submit to NASDAQ documentation,
including biographies of any new directors, evidencing compliance with the rules at any time on
or prior to the date.
The NASDAQ deficiency notices do not impact the Company’s listing on the NASDAQ Global
Market at this time, and the Company’s common stock will continue to trade of the NASDAQ
Global Market under the symbol “SAEX”. The notices also do not impact the Company’s
obligation to file periodic reports and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission
under applicable federal securities laws.
The Company expects to fill the remaining vacancy within the required amount of time to regain
compliance. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to do so.

an investors’ conference call to review the second quarter results will be held on Thursday,
August 04, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
 
The information in this Item 8.01, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being furnished and
shall not be deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. The information in this

pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as otherwise expressly stated in such
filing.
