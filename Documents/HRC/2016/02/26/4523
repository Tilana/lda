<p><i> Recalling </i>the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly 
entitled &#8220;Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first 
century&#8221;, the declaration adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women at its

</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2000/13 of 17 April 2000, 
2001/34 of 23 April 2001 and 2003/22 of 22 April 2003, as well as Council resolution 6/30 
of 14 December 2007 on integrating the human rights of women throughout the United 
Nations system and Council resolution 12/17 of 2 October 2009 on the elimination of 
discrimination against women,  
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>that international human rights treaties, including the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender and include guarantees 
to ensure the enjoyment by women and men, and girls and boys, of their civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights on a basis of equality, 
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>Deeply concerned</i> by the fact that women everywhere are still subject to significant 
disadvantage as the result of discriminatory laws and practices and that de jure and de facto 
equality has not been achieved in any country in the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that women face multiple forms of discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating </i>the need to intensify efforts to eliminate all forms of discrimination 
against women throughout the world, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>that the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of life is 
essential for the full and complete economic and social development of a country, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also</i> that the elimination of discrimination against women, in law and in 
practice, is primarily the responsibility of States, and that the United Nations human rights 
system plays an important role in contributing to these efforts,  
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful </i>of the fact that the elimination of discrimination against women requires the 
consideration of women&#8217;s specific socio-economic context, and recognizing that laws, 
policies, customs and traditions that restrict women&#8217;s equal access to full participation in 
development processes and public and political life are discriminatory and may contribute 
to the feminization of poverty, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>its resolution 5/1 on institution-building of the Council and resolution 5/2 
on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the Council, of 18 June 
2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance 
with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms </i>the obligation of States to take all appropriate measures to 
eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organization or enterprise; 
</p>
<p> 2<i>. Welcomes </i>the commitments made by the international community to fully 
implement the Millennium Development Goals, and stresses, in that context, the resolve of 
Heads of State to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women as effective 
ways to combat poverty, hunger and disease and to stimulate development that is truly 
sustainable; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also welcomes </i>the efforts made by States around the world to reform their 
legal systems in order to remove obstacles to women&#8217;s full and effective enjoyment of their 
human rights; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses concern </i>at the fact that, despite the pledge made at the Fourth 
World Conference on Women and the review conducted by the General Assembly at its </p>


<p>twenty-third special session to modify or abolish remaining laws that discriminate against 
women and girls, many of these laws are still in force and continue to be applied, thereby 
preventing women and girls from enjoying the full realization of their human rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon </i>States to fulfil their international obligations and commitments to 
revoke any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex and remove gender bias in 
the administration of justice, taking into account the fact that those laws violate the human 
right of women to be protected against discrimination; 
</p>
<p> 6<i>. Recognizes </i>that women&#8217;s inequality before the law has resulted in the lack of 
equal opportunities for women in education, access to health, economic participation and 
access to labour markets and disparities in, inter alia, salaries and compensation, public and 
political participation, access to decision-making processes, inheritance, ownership of land, 
financial services, including loans, and nationality and legal capacity, as well as increased 
vulnerability to discrimination and violence, and that all countries face challenges in these 
areas; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Acknowledges </i>the work undertaken by the Commission on the Status of 
Women, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Special 
Rapporteurs of the Council on violence against women, its causes and consequences, on 
trafficking in persons, especially in women and children, and on contemporary forms of 
slavery and other relevant United Nations bodies, agencies and mechanisms to eliminate 
discrimination in law and in practice throughout the world; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Emphasizes </i>the significant role that women play in economic development 
and in the eradication of poverty, and stresses the need for promoting equal pay for equal 
work or work of equal value and for promoting the recognition of the value of women&#8217;s 
unremunerated work, as well as for developing and promoting policies that facilitate the 
reconciliation of employment and family responsibilities; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure full representation and full and equal 
participation of women in political, social and economic decision-making as an essential 
condition for gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and a critical factor 
in the eradication of poverty; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Welcomes</i>, in particular, the work undertaken by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women on women&#8217;s equality before the law; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recognizes </i>the important role played by the Council in addressing the issue 
of discrimination against women, both in law and in practice; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Welcomes </i>the convening of a panel on equality before the law during the 
eleventh session of the Council; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Notes </i>that, although human rights treaty bodies and special procedures do, to 
some extent, address discrimination against women within their mandates, their attention to 
such discrimination is not systematic; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Also notes </i>the work undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Takes note</i> of the thematic study on discrimination against women, in law 
and in practice, and on how the issue is addressed throughout the United Nations human 
rights system, prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner;<footnote name="5">A/HRC/15/40. </footnote>  
</p>

<p> 16. <i>Welcomes</i> the half-day panel discussion on discrimination against women in 
law and in practice;  
</p>
<p><b> </b>17. <i>Calls upon</i> States to pay particular attention to discrimination against women 
in situations of vulnerability, such as women living in poverty, migrant women, women 
with disabilities and women belonging to minorities; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Decides</i> to establish, for a period of three years, a working group of five 
independent experts, of balanced geographical representation, on the issue of discrimination 
against women in law and in practice, whose tasks will be: 
</p>

terms of implementation or impact and, in that regard, to prepare a compendium of best 
practices; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To undertake a study, in cooperation with and reflecting the views of States 
and relevant United Nations entities, national human rights institutions and civil society

practice; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To make recommendations on the improvement of legislation and the 
implementation of the law, to contribute to the realization of the Millennium Development

<p>(<i>d</i>) To work in close coordination, in the context of the fulfilment of its mandate, 
with other special procedures and subsidiary organs of the Council, relevant United Nations 
entities, including the Commission on the Status of Women and UN Women and, in 
particular, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and other 
treaty bodies, within their respective mandates, with a view to avoiding unnecessary 
duplication; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) To take into account the views of other stakeholders, including relevant 
regional human rights mechanisms, national human rights institutions and civil society 
organizations;  
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) To submit an annual report to the Council, starting at its twentieth session, on 
the issue of discrimination against women in law and in practice, and on good practices in 
eliminating such discrimination, drawing upon the findings of the United Nations human 
rights machinery and the broader United Nations system; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to cooperate with and assist the working group in its 
task, to supply all necessary available information requested by it and to give serious
