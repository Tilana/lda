<p>7. <i>Strongly condemns</i> the reports of widespread use of sexual violence in

<p>law, and notes with grave concern the commission of inquiry&#8217;s finding that the Syrian 
</p>
<p>authorities have repeatedly used chlorine gas as an illegal weapon, which constitutes a

</p>
<p>and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction and is prohibited under 
</p>
<p>international law;

</p>
<p>and type of crimes committed, in which it assesses that crimes against humanity and war

<p>crimes have been and continue to be committed in the territory of the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Also notes</i> that the International Criminal Court was established to help to 
</p>
<p>end impunity for such crimes where the State is unwilling or unable to genuinely carry out 
</p>
<p>investigations or prosecutions;

</p>
<p>international humanitarian law or violations and abuses of human rights law are held to 
</p>
<p>account through appropriate fair and independent domestic or international criminal justice

</p>

</p>
<p>religion and ethnicity; </p>

<p>presence of large-scale refugee populations in those countries; 
</p>

</p>
<p>civilians, from whatever quarter, and in particular the Syrian authorities&#8217; denial of medical

</p>
<p>expeditiously to the Syrian humanitarian appeal and to fulfil previous pledges; 
</p>

</p>
