<p><b>HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN PALESTINE AND OTHER OCCUPIED

<p><b>Human Rights Council resolution 6/19 on religious and cultural rights

<p><b>Note of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present note is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 6/19 
of 28 September 2007 on religious and cultural rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem, in which the Council requested the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the Council, at its seventh session, on the 
implementation of that resolution.  
</p>
<p>2. The issue of access of Palestinians to their holy sites is dealt with, albeit to a limited 
extent, in the report that the High Commissioner recently submitted to the Council pursuant to its 
resolution S-6/1. The High Commissioner intends, however, to report in greater detail on any 
policies or measures taken by Israel which limit access of Palestinian residents in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory (both Christians and Muslims) to their religious sites located in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Late submission. </p>

<p>3. From 20 to 27 January 2008, Asma Jahangir, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief, visited Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Following her visit, the 
Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine and the Permanent Mission of Israel to the 
United Nations Office at Geneva were requested to share any comments or observations in 
relation to resolution 6/19 with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights. In order to benefit from the visit of the Special Rapporteur and her conclusions as 
well as from the information on the issue that might be provided by the respective permanent 
missions, and in the light of the report before the seventh session following resolution S-6/1, the 
report of the High Commissioner pursuant to resolution 6/19 will be submitted to the Council at 
its eighth session.
