CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS FOR PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF
THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
 
We have made statements in this document that constitute forward-looking statements, as that
term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations. The
words “believe”, “expect”, “estimate”, “anticipate” and similar expressions will generally identify
forward-looking statements. These statements may relate to information or assumptions about:
 
• capital and other expenditures;
• financing plans;
• capital structure;
• liquidity and cash flow;
• pending legal proceedings, claims and governmental proceedings, including environmental
matters;
• future economic and operating performance;
• operating income;
• management’s plans; and
• goals and objectives for future operations.
Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. While we believe the
assumptions or bases underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable and are made
in good faith, we caution that assumed facts or bases almost always vary from actual results, and
these differences can be material, depending upon the circumstances. We cannot assure you
that the statements of expectation or belief contained in our forward-looking statements will result
or be achieved or accomplished. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from estimates or projections contained in our forward-looking statements are
described in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the
risk factors described in the Form 10-K.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
 
Basis of Presentation
We prepared this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the rules and regulations of the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) as it applies to interim financial
statements. Because this is an interim period report presented using a condensed format, it does
not include all of the disclosures required by U.S. GAAP and should be read along with our 2015
Annual Report on Form  10-K. The condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30,
2016 and 2015 are unaudited. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has
been derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet included in our 2015 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.  In our opinion, all adjustments which are of a normal, recurring nature are
reflected to fairly present these interim period results. The results for any interim period are not
necessarily indicative of the expected results for the entire year. 
Significant Accounting Policies
There were no changes in significant accounting policies as described in the 2015 Annual
Report on Form 10-K.
New Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted
The following accounting standards have been issued but not yet adopted as of June 30, 2016.
Stock Compensation.  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting, which updates several aspects of the accounting for and disclosure of
share-based payment transactions. Adoption of this standard is required beginning in the first
quarter of 2017 and early adoption is allowed. We are evaluating the impact this update will have
in our financial statements.
Leases.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which requires lessees
to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information
about leasing arrangements.  Adoption of this standard is required beginning in the first quarter of
2019 and early adoption is allowed.  We are evaluating the impact this update will have in our
financial statements.
Revenue Recognition.  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers, which clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a
common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. In
July 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the new revenue standard by one year, with the
option of early adoption in 2017 or, if not adopted early, beginning in the first quarter of 2018.
Retrospective application of this standard is required upon adoption.  We are currently evaluating
the impact, if any, that this update will have on our financial statements.

2. Divestitures
In May 2016, we completed the sale of our assets located in the Haynesville and Bossier shales
for approximately $420 million (net cash proceeds of $390 million after customary adjustments).
We recorded a gain on the sale of approximately $83 million, with the buyer also assuming a
transportation commitment totaling $106 million. We classified the assets and liabilities
associated with the assets sold as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2015.
Summarized operating results and financial position data of our assets held for sale were as

3. Income Taxes
 
General. Our taxable income or loss is included in our parent's (EP Energy Corporation) U.S.
federal and certain state returns. EP Energy Corporation pays all consolidated U.S. federal and
state income tax directly to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions. We record income taxes on a
separate return basis in our financial statements as if we had filed separate income tax returns
under our existing structure. In certain states, we also file and pay directly to the state taxing
authorities.
Effective Tax Rate. Interim period income taxes are computed by applying an anticipated annual
effective tax rate to year-to-date income or loss, except for significant, unusual or infrequently
occurring items, which income tax effects are recorded in the period in which they occur.
Changes in tax laws or rates are recorded in the period they are enacted.
For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016, our effective tax rates were 0%. Our
effective tax rates differed from the statutory rate as a result of adjustments to the valuation
allowance on our deferred tax assets which offset deferred income tax expense by $24 million
and $59 million for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. We evaluate
the realization of our deferred tax assets and record a valuation allowance after considering
cumulative book losses, the reversal of existing temporary differences, the existence of taxable
income in prior carryback years, tax planning strategies and future taxable income for each of our
taxable jurisdictions. Based upon the evaluation of the available evidence, we maintained a
valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of $380 million as of June 30, 2016.
8
Table of Contents
Our effective tax rate for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2015 was relatively
consistent with the statutory tax rate. Our effective tax rates in 2015 were primarily impacted by
the effects of state income taxes (net of federal
income tax effects).
Other. The Company's and certain subsidiaries' income tax years remain open and subject to
examination by both federal and state tax authorities. Our parent's, EPE Acquisition LLC, 2013
U.S. tax return is under examination by the IRS.
4. Fair Value Measurements
 
We use various methods to determine the fair values of our financial instruments. The fair value
of a financial instrument depends on a number of factors, including the availability of observable
market data over the contractual term of the underlying instrument. We separate the fair value of
our financial instruments into three levels (Levels 1, 2 and 3) based on our assessment of the
availability of observable market data and the significance of non-observable data used to
determine fair value.  As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all derivative financial
instruments were classified as Level 2. Our assessment of the level of an instrument can change
over time based on the maturity or liquidity of the instrument.
The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our financial
instruments:

As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and accounts payable represent fair value because of the short-term nature
of these instruments. We hold long-term debt obligations with various terms. We estimated the
fair value of debt (representing a Level 2 fair value measurement) primarily based on quoted
market prices for the same or similar issuances, including consideration of our credit risk.
Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Derivative Instruments.  We attempt to mitigate a portion of our
commodity price risk and stabilize cash flows associated with forecasted sales of oil, natural gas
and NGLs through the use of financial derivatives.  As of June 30, 2016, we had fixed price
derivative contracts for 21 MMBbls (8 MMBbls of 2016 fixed price swap positions and 13 MMBbls
of 2017 fixed price swap positions) of oil. In addition, as of June 30, 2016 we had derivative
contracts that offset positions on 0.4 MMBbls of 2016 oil fixed price swaps. As of December 31,
2015, we had fixed price derivative contracts for 23 MMBbls of oil.  As of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, we also had derivative contracts on 11 TBtu of natural gas and 8 MMGal of
propane and 7 TBtu of natural gas and 15 MMGal of propane, respectively. In addition, we have
derivative contracts related to locational basis differences and/or timing of physical settlement
prices on our oil production. None of our derivative contracts are designated as accounting
hedges.
The following table presents the fair value associated with our derivative financial instruments as
of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. All of our derivative instruments are subject to master
netting arrangements which provide for the unconditional right of offset for all derivative assets
and liabilities with a given counterparty in the event of default. We present assets and liabilities
related to these instruments in our balance sheets as either current or non-current assets or
liabilities based on their anticipated settlement date, net of the impact of master netting
agreements.  On derivative contracts recorded as assets in the table below, we are exposed to
the risk that our counterparties may not perform.

For the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded derivative losses of $105 million
and $179 million, respectively, on our oil, natural gas and NGLs financial derivative
instruments. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a derivative loss of
$63 million and a derivative gain of $24 million, respectively. Derivative gains and losses on our
oil, natural gas and NGLs financial derivative instruments are recorded in operating revenues in
our consolidated statement of income. In June 2016, we exchanged LLS fixed price swaps on
our 2016 oil positions for 7.7 MMBbls of WTI three way collars in 2017. The exchange was non-
cash and no gain or loss was recognized on the transaction.
Interest Rate Derivative Instruments.  We have interest rate swaps with a notional amount of
$600 million that extend through March 2017 and are intended to reduce variable interest rate
risk. As of June 30, 2016, we had a net liability of $1 million and as of December 31, 2015, we
had a net asset of $1 million related to interest rate derivative instruments included on our
consolidated balance sheets.  For both of the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we
recorded $1 million of interest expense related to the change in fair market value and cash
settlements of our interest rate derivative instruments. For the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, we recorded $3 million and $5 million of interest expense, respectively, related to the
change in fair market value and cash settlements of our interest rate derivative instruments.
5.  Property, Plant and Equipment
 
Oil and Natural Gas Properties.  As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had
approximately $4.4 billion for both periods of total property, plant, and equipment, net of
accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization on our consolidated balance sheets,
substantially all of which relates to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties.
Our capitalized costs related to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties by area were
as follows:
 
 
Proved
    Eagle Ford
    Wolfcamp
    Altamont
        Total Proved
Unproved
    Wolfcamp
    Altamont
        Total Unproved
Less accumulated depletion
        Net capitalized costs for oil and natural gas properties $ 4,416
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we transferred approximately $7 million from
unproved properties to proved properties. For the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we
recorded less than $1 million and $4 million, respectively, of amortization of unproved leasehold
costs in exploration expense in our consolidated statement of income. For the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded less than $1 million and $8 million, respectively, of
amortization of unproved leasehold costs. Suspended well costs were not material as of June 30,
2016 or December 31, 2015. 
We evaluate capitalized costs related to proved properties at least annually or upon a triggering
event (such as a significant continued forward commodity price decline) to determine if
impairment of such properties has occurred.

Capitalized costs associated with unproved properties (e.g. leasehold acquisition costs
associated with non-producing areas) are also assessed for impairment based on estimated
drilling plans and capital expenditures which may also change relative to forward commodity
prices and/or potential lease expirations.
Commodity prices have a significant impact on our impairment assessments. While forward
commodity price changes as of June 30, 2016 did not result in any impairment charges of our
proved or unproved property costs during the quarter, future commodity price declines may cause
changes to our future capital, production rates, levels of proved reserves and development plans,
which may result in an impairment of the carrying value of our proved and/or unproved properties
in the future.
Leasehold acquisition costs associated with non-producing or unproved areas are assessed for
impairment based on our estimated drilling plans and capital expenditures relative to potential
lease expirations. Generally, economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas is not yet
supported by actual production or conclusive formation tests, but may be confirmed by continuing
exploration and development activities.  Our ability to retain our leases and thus recover our non-
producing leasehold costs will be dependent upon a number of factors including our levels of
drilling activity, which may include drilling the acreage on our own behalf or jointly with partners,
or our ability to modify or extend our leases. Should oil prices not justify sufficient capital
allocation to the continued development of properties where we have these non-producing
leasehold costs, we could incur impairment charges of our unproved property costs. In May 2016,
we amended our Wolfcamp development agreement with the University Lands to provide
flexibility to extend the time frame to hold our acreage by nearly four years to the end of 2021,
with an increase in annual well completion requirements from six wells per year to 34, 55 and 55
wells per year in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Currently, we have the intent and believe
we have the ability to fulfill our annual Wolfcamp drilling commitment and/or develop our
unproved areas prior to having to relinquish any associated leases. 
Asset Retirement Obligations.  We have legal asset retirement obligations associated with the
retirement of our oil and natural gas wells and related infrastructure. We settle these obligations
when production on those wells is exhausted, when we no longer plan to use them or when we
abandon them. We accrue these obligations when we can estimate the timing and amount of
their settlement.
In estimating the liability associated with our asset retirement obligations, we utilize several
assumptions, including a credit-adjusted risk-free rate between 7-9 percent on a significant
portion of our obligations and a projected inflation rate of 2.5 percent.  Changes in estimates
represent changes to the expected amount and timing of payments to settle our asset retirement
obligations. Typically, these changes result from obtaining new information about the timing of
our obligations to plug and abandon oil and natural gas wells and the costs to do so. The net
asset retirement liability as of June 30, 2016 on our consolidated balance sheet in other current
and non-current liabilities and the changes in the net liability from January 1 through June 30,
2016 were as follows: 
 
 
Net asset retirement liability at January 1$ 38
2016
(in millions)
Accretion expense
Net asset retirement liability at June 30 $ 40
2
Capitalized Interest.  Interest expense is reflected in our financial statements net of capitalized
interest.  We capitalize
interest primarily on the costs associated with drilling and completing wells until production
begins. The interest rate used is
the weighted average interest rate of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalized interest for the
quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016 was less than $1 million and approximately $2
million, respectively. Capitalized interest for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2015
was approximately $5 million and $9 million, respectively.

The RBL Facility (as defined below) carries interest at a specified margin over LIBOR of
2.50% to 3.50%, based on borrowing utilization.
(2)The term loan was issued at 99% of par and carries interest at a specified margin over the
LIBOR of 2.75%, with a minimum LIBOR floor of 0.75%.  As of
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the effective interest rate of the term loan was 3.50%.
(3)
The term loan carries interest at a specified margin over the LIBOR of 3.50%, with a minimum
LIBOR floor of 1.00%.  As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the effective interest rate
for the term loan was 4.50%.
(4)The term loans are secured by a second priority lien on all of the collateral securing the RBL
Facility, and effectively rank junior to any existing
and future first lien secured indebtedness of the Company.
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we paid approximately $360 million in cash to
repurchase a total of approximately $737 million in aggregate principal amount of our senior
unsecured notes and term loans which resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of
approximately $170 million and $366 million for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016
(including $5 million and $11 million, respectively, of non-cash expense related to eliminating
associated unamortized debt issue costs).  For both the quarter and six months ended June 30,
2016, we also recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $8 million related to
eliminating a portion of the unamortized debt issue costs due to the reduction of our RBL
borrowing base in May 2016.
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, we repurchased an additional $54 million of our senior unsecured
notes for approximately $34 million in cash. We classified the principal amount of this additional
long-term debt repurchased as short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30,
2016.
During the second quarter of 2015, we issued $800 million of 6.375% senior notes due in June
2023. We used a
substantial portion of the proceeds from the offering to purchase for cash all of our $750 million
senior secured notes due in
2019. In conjunction with repurchasing these notes, we recorded a $41 million loss on
extinguishment of debt, of which
$12 million was a non-cash expense related to eliminating associated unamortized debt
issuance costs.
Unamortized Debt Issue Costs. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had total
unamortized debt issue costs of $55 million and $80 million. Of these amounts, $14 million and
$23 million, respectively, are associated with our Reserve-Based Loan facility (RBL Facility) and
$41 million ($1 million of which is classified as short-term) and $57 million, respectively, are
associated with our senior secured term loans and senior notes. During the quarter and six
months ended June 30, 2016, we expensed approximately $13 million and $19 million,
respectively, in conjunction with the repurchase of a portion of our senior unsecured notes and
term loans and the reduction of our RBL borrowing base. During both of the quarters ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, we amortized $4 million of deferred financing costs into interest
expense.  For each of the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, amortization of deferred
financing costs was $8 million and $10 million, respectively.
Reserve-based Loan Facility. We have a reserve-based credit facility in place which allows us to
borrow funds or issue letters of credit. The RBL Facility is collateralized by certain of our oil and
natural gas properties and has a borrowing base subject to semi-annual redetermination.  In
May 2016, we completed our semi-annual redetermination, and the borrowing base of our RBL
Facility was reduced to $1.65 billion, reflecting significantly lower bank commodity price
forecasts, the sale of our Haynesville assets and the roll-off of certain hedge positions. Our next
redetermination date is in November 2016. Downward revisions of our oil and natural gas
reserves as a result of declines in commodity prices, performance revisions, or sales of
12
Table of Contents
assets, or the incurrence of certain types of additional debt, among other items, could cause a
further reduction of our borrowing base which could negatively impact our borrowing capacity
under the RBL Facility in the future.
The maturity of our RBL Facility is in May 2019, provided that we retire or refinance our 2018 and
2019 secured notes and term loans (collectively, the "second lien debt") at least six months prior
to their maturity. In the second quarter of 2015, we repurchased all of our senior secured notes
due in 2019. We will be required to retire or refinance remaining amounts outstanding under our
(i) $500 million senior secured term loans due 2018 by November 2017 and our (ii) $150 million
senior secured term loans due 2019 by November 2018.If we do not retire or refinance these term
loans on either of these respective dates, our RBL Facility will mature at that time.
As of June 30, 2016, we had $706 million of available capacity remaining with approximately $34
million of letters of credit issued and approximately $910 million outstanding under the facility. 
Guarantees.  Our obligations under the RBL Facility, term loan, secured and unsecured notes are
fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Company’s present and future
direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries.  EP Energy LLC has no
independent assets or operations. Any subsidiaries of EP Energy LLC, other than the subsidiary
guarantors, are minor.  The subsidiary guarantees are subject to certain automatic customary
releases, including the sale or disposition of the capital stock or substantially all of the assets of a
subsidiary guarantor, exercise of legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, or designation of a
subsidiary guarantor as unrestricted in accordance with the applicable indenture.  There are no
significant restrictions on the ability of the Company or any guarantor to obtain funds from its
subsidiaries by dividend or loan.
Restrictive Provisions/Covenants.  The availability of borrowings under our credit agreements
and our ability to incur additional indebtedness is subject to various financial and non-financial
covenants and restrictions. At June 30, 2016 we were in compliance with all of our debt
covenants. In conjunction with our RBL Facility redetermination in May 2016, we amended
certain covenants, the most significant of which suspended the requirement that our debt to
EBITDAX ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, not exceed 4.5 to 1.0 and replaced it with a
requirement that our ratio of first lien debt to EBITDAX not exceed 3.5 to 1.0. The 4.5 to 1.0 debt
to EBITDAX requirement will be reinstated beginning in April 2018. As part of the amendment,
we also agreed to limit debt repurchases occurring after the redetermination to $350 million
subject to certain future adjustments.
7. Commitments and Contingencies
 
Legal Matters
 
We and our subsidiaries and affiliates are parties to various legal actions and claims that arise in
the ordinary course of our business. For each matter, we evaluate the merits of the case or claim,
our exposure to the matter, possible legal or settlement strategies and the likelihood of an
unfavorable outcome. If we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and can be
estimated, we establish the necessary accruals. While the outcome of our current matters cannot
be predicted with certainty and there are still uncertainties related to the costs we may incur,
based upon our evaluation and experience to date, we believe we have established appropriate
reserves for these matters. It is possible, however, that new information or future developments
could require us to reassess our potential exposure and adjust our accruals accordingly, and
these adjustments could be material. As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately $2 million
accrued for all outstanding legal matters.
Indemnifications and Other Matters. We periodically enter into indemnification arrangements as
part of the divestitures of assets or businesses.  These arrangements include, but are not limited
to, indemnifications for income taxes, the resolution of existing disputes, environmental and other
contingent matters. In addition, under various laws or regulations, we could be subject to the
imposition of certain liabilities. For example, the recent decline in commodity prices has created
an environment where there is an increased risk that owners and/or operators of assets
previously purchased from us may no longer be able to satisfy plugging and abandonment
obligations that attach to such assets. In that event, under various laws or regulations, we could
be required to assume these plugging or abandonment obligations on assets no longer owned or
operated by us. As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately $8 million accrued related to these
indemnifications and other matters.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to existing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental
quality, pollution control and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Numerous governmental
agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), issue regulations which often
require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and
criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and
regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types,
quantities and concentrations
13
Table of Contents
of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and
production activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within
wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive and other protected areas, require action to prevent
or remediate pollution from current or former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or
closing pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and
authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial
liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or relate to our owned or operated facilities.
The strict and joint and several liability nature of such laws and regulations could impose liability
upon us regardless of fault. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other
third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the
release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment.
Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in
more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or
cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as
well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. Our management believes that we are in
substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not
experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental
requirements.
The environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject also require us to remove or
remedy the effect on the environment of the disposal or release of specified substances at current
and former operating sites. As of June 30, 2016, we had accrued and had exposure of
approximately $1 million for related environmental remediation costs associated with onsite,
offsite and groundwater technical studies and for related environmental legal costs. Our accrual
represents a combination of two estimation methodologies. First, where the most likely outcome
can be reasonably estimated, that cost has been accrued. Second, where the most likely
outcome cannot be estimated, a range of costs is established and if no one amount in that range
is more likely than any other, the lower end of the expected range has been accrued. Our
environmental remediation projects are in various stages of completion. The liabilities we have
recorded reflect our current estimates of amounts that we will expend to remediate these sites.
However, depending on the stage of completion or assessment, the ultimate extent of
contamination or remediation required may not be known. As additional assessments occur or
remediation efforts continue, we may incur additional liabilities.
Climate Change and Other Emissions.  The EPA and several state environmental agencies have
adopted regulations to regulate GHG emissions. Although the EPA has adopted a “tailoring”
rule to regulate GHG emissions, the U.S. Supreme Court partially invalidated it in an opinion
decided June 2014.  The tailoring rule remains applicable for those facilities considered major
sources of six other “criteria” pollutants and at this time we do not expect a material impact to our
existing operations from the rule. Any regulations regarding GHG emissions would likely
increase our costs of compliance by potentially delaying the receipt of permits and other
regulatory approvals; requiring us to monitor emissions, install additional equipment or modify
facilities to reduce GHG and other emissions; purchase emission credits; and utilize electric-
driven compression at facilities to obtain regulatory permits and approvals in a timely manner.
As part of the White House’s Climate Action Plan Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions, the
EPA, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) and the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM) have recently proposed or finalized new regulations affecting the oil
and gas industry. On October 13, 2015, the PHMSA published a proposed rule for oil pipelines,
in part requiring inspections in areas affected by natural disasters, expanding use of leak
detection systems, and increased use of inline inspection tools. On January 22, 2016, the BLM
released a proposed rule for oil and gas facilities on onshore federal and Indian leases to prohibit
venting, limit flaring, require leak detection, and allow adjustment of royalty rates for new leases.
Although we are examining these proposed regulations, it is uncertain what impact they might
have on our operations until they are implemented.
On September 18, 2015, the EPA published several proposed regulations under the Clean Air
Act to reduce methane and volatile organic compounds emissions, in part through green
completions at oil wells, fugitive emission surveys, limits on pneumatic pumps and controllers,
and draft guidelines for controls on equipment in ozone nonattainment areas. These rules were
finalized on June 3, 2016 and went into effect August 2, 2016. We are evaluating whether any
material capital expenditure will be required for initial and ongoing compliance with these rules.
Air Quality Regulations. The EPA has promulgated various performance and emission standards
that mandate air pollutant emission limits and operating requirements for stationary reciprocating
internal combustion engines and process equipment.  We do not anticipate material capital
expenditures to meet these requirements.
In August 2012, the EPA promulgated additional standards to reduce various air pollutants
associated with hydraulic fracturing of natural gas wells and equipment including compressors,
storage vessels, and pneumatic valves.  Additional amendments to the new standard were
finalized in 2013 and 2014.  We do not anticipate material capital expenditures to meet these
requirements.
14
Table of Contents
The EPA has promulgated regulations to require pre-construction permits for minor sources of air
emissions in tribal lands.  On September 18, 2015, the EPA proposed a federal implementation
plan (FIP), rather than a general permit, to effect these regulations. The FIP was finalized on
June 3, 2016, requiring registration of such new and modified minor sources beginning October
3, 2015 and incorporating emission limits and other requirements from six standards under the
Clean Air Act for the oil and gas industry. Additionally, the FIP requires an operator to document
compliance with the Endangered Species Act and National Historic Preservation Act. This rule
could delay pad construction and commencement of drilling if the EPA does not timely provide
written confirmation that requisites of the FIP have been met.
Hydraulic Fracturing Regulations. We use hydraulic fracturing extensively in our operations.
Various regulations have been adopted and proposed at the federal, state and local levels to
regulate hydraulic fracturing operations. These regulations range from banning or substantially
limiting hydraulic fracturing operations, requiring disclosure of the hydraulic fracturing fluids and
requiring additional permits for the use, recycling and disposal of water used in such operations.
In addition, various agencies, including the EPA and Department of Energy are reviewing
changes in their regulations to address the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing
operations. Until such regulations are implemented, it is uncertain what impact they might have
on our operations. In March 2015, the BLM published final rules for hydraulic fracturing on federal
and certain tribal lands, including use of tanks for recovered water, updated cementing and
testing requirements, and disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Several states and
the Ute Indian Tribe filed suit to challenge these rules. On September 30, 2015, a federal court
issued a preliminary injunction suspending the rules and, on June 21, 2016, ordered the rules set
aside as exceeding the BLM’s authority. The BLM has filed an appeal in the Tenth Circuit Court
of Appeals. No material cost is expected for the Company’s 2016 program.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) Matters.
As part of our environmental remediation projects, we are or have received notice that we could
be designated as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) with respect to one active site under the
CERCLA or state equivalents. As of June 30, 2016, we have estimated our share of the
remediation costs at this site to be less than $1 million. Because the clean-up costs are estimates
and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of
remediation required, and because in some cases we have asserted a defense to any liability,
our estimates could change. Moreover, liability under the federal CERCLA statute may be joint
and several, meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our pro-rata share of
remediation costs. Our understanding of the financial strength of other PRPs has been
considered, where appropriate, in estimating our liabilities. Accruals for these matters are
included in the reserve for environmental matters discussed above.
Waste Handling. Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply
with waste handling requirements imposed under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
as amended, and comparable state laws. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with
applicable requirements related to waste handling, and that we hold all necessary and up-to-date
permits, registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them
under such laws and regulations. Any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural
gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such
wastes.
It is possible that new information or future developments could require us to reassess our
potential exposure related to environmental matters. We may incur significant costs and liabilities
in order to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that other
developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws, regulations, and orders of
regulatory agencies, as well as claims for damages to property and the environment or injuries to
employees and other persons resulting from our current or past operations, could result in
substantial costs and liabilities in the future. As this information becomes available, or other
relevant developments occur, we will adjust our accrual amounts accordingly. While there are
still uncertainties related to the ultimate costs we may incur, based upon our evaluation and
experience to date, we believe our reserves are adequate.

8. Long-Term Incentive Compensation
 
Our long-term incentive (LTI) programs consist of certain equity and liability based compensation
awards including restricted stock, stock options and performance units. A summary of the
changes in our parent’s non-vested restricted shares for the six months ended June 30, 2016 is
presented below:

During the first quarter of 2016, our parent granted 83,150 performance units to certain members
of EP Energy's management team. Performance units have a target value of $100 per unit;
however, the ultimate value of each performance unit will range from zero to $200 depending on
the level of total shareholder return (TSR) relative to that of EP Energy’s peer group of
companies. The performance units vest in three separate tranches (1 year, 2 year and 3 year
calendar periods). For accounting purposes, the performance units are treated as a liability
award with the expense recognized on an accelerated basis. The fair value measured at the
grant date was approximately $8 million which is subsequently remeasured at the end of each
reporting period. As of June 30, 2016, the fair value of these awards (net of forfeitures) was
approximately $6 million. The fair value of the performance-based units granted was estimated
on the date of grant using a Monte-Carlo simulation for each of three separate performance
tranches based on the relative TSR results for each separate tranche period beginning
January 1, 2016. The performance units may be settled in either stock or cash at the election of
the board of directors of our parent. Assuming such amounts were settled in stock at June 30,
2016, the number of shares that we would issue upon settlement of the 2016 performance unit
grants, assuming the awards were vested and relative TSR performance was determined at that
date, would be approximately 3.1 million shares.
We record compensation expense on our LTI awards as general and administrative expense
over the requisite service period, net of estimates of forfeitures. Pre-tax compensation expense
related to all of our parent's LTI awards (both equity and liability based) was approximately $5
million and $10 million for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015,
respectively. As of June 30, 2016, we had unrecognized compensation expense of $65 million. 
We will recognize an additional $13 million related to our outstanding awards during the
remainder of 2016, $38 million over the remaining requisite service periods subsequent to 2016
and $14 million upon a specified capital transaction when the right to such amounts becomes
non-forfeitable.
9. Related Party Transactions
    
Affiliate Supply Agreement.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded
approximately $5 million and $44 million, respectively, in capital expenditures for amounts
expended under supply agreements entered into with an affiliate of Apollo Management, LLC to
provide certain fracturing materials to our Eagle Ford drilling operations. This agreement was
terminated effective May 2016.
Taxes. We are party to a tax accrual policy with our parent whereby our parent files U.S. and
certain state tax returns on our behalf. At both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had
federal income tax payable due to parent of $6 million.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the accompanying
notes presented in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion
contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including,
but not limited to, those described in the “Risk Factors” section of our 2015 Annual Report on
Form 10-K. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this
MD&A section to “we”, “our”, “us” and “the Company” refer to EP Energy LLC and each of its
consolidated subsidiaries.
Our Business
 
Overview.  We are an independent exploration and production company engaged in the
acquisition and development of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas properties in the
United States.  We are focused on creating shareholder value through the development of our
low-risk drilling inventory located in three core areas:  the Eagle Ford Shale (South Texas), the
Wolfcamp Shale (Permian Basin in West Texas) and the Altamont Field in the Uinta Basin
(Northeastern Utah).  In May 2016, we completed the sale of our assets located in the
Haynesville and Bossier shales for approximately $420 million (net proceeds of $390 million in
cash after customary adjustments) and recorded a gain on the sale of approximately $83 million.
We evaluate growth opportunities for our asset portfolio that are aligned with our core
competencies and that are in areas that we believe can provide us a competitive advantage.
Strategic acquisitions of leasehold acreage or acquisitions of producing assets can provide
opportunities to achieve our long-term goals by leveraging existing expertise in our core areas,
balancing our exposure to regions, basins and commodities, helping us to achieve risk-adjusted
returns competitive with those available within our existing drilling programs and by increasing
our reserves. We continuously evaluate our asset portfolio and will sell oil and natural gas
properties if they no longer meet our long-term goals.
Factors Influencing Our Profitability.  Our profitability is dependent on the prices we receive for
our oil and natural gas, the costs to explore, develop, and produce our oil and natural gas, and
the volumes we are able to produce, among other factors. Our long-term profitability will be
influenced primarily by:
•
growing our proved reserve base and production volumes through the successful execution of
our drilling programs or through acquisitions;
•finding and producing oil and natural gas at reasonable costs;
•managing cash costs; and
•managing commodity price risks on our oil and natural gas production.
In addition to these factors, our future profitability and performance will be affected by volatility in
the financial and commodity markets, changes in the cost of drilling and oilfield services,
operating and capital costs, and our debt level and related interest costs. Future commodity price
declines may cause changes to our future capital, production rates, levels of proved reserves and
development plans, all of which impact performance. Additionally, we may be impacted by
weather events, regulatory issues or other third party actions outside of our control.    
We attempt to mitigate certain risks by entering into longer term contractual arrangements to
control costs and by entering into derivative contracts to stabilize cash flows and reduce the
financial impact of unfavorable movements in both commodity prices and locational price
differences. Because we apply mark-to-market accounting on our derivative contracts, our
reported results of operations and financial position can be impacted significantly by commodity
price movements from period to period. Adjustments to our strategy and the decision to enter into
new contracts or positions or to alter existing contracts or positions are made based on the goals
of the overall company.
Derivative Instruments.  Our realized prices from the sale of our oil and natural gas are affected
by (i) commodity price movements, including locational or basis price differences that exist
between the commodity index price (e.g., WTI) and the actual price at which we sell our oil and
natural gas, and (ii) other contractual pricing adjustments contained in our underlying sales
contracts.  In order to stabilize cash flows and protect the economic assumptions associated with
our capital investment programs, we enter into financial derivative contracts to reduce the
financial impact of downward commodity price movements and locational price differences.

Table of Contents
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we (i) settled commodity index hedges on
approximately 99% of our oil production, 78% of our total liquids production and 17% of our
natural gas production at average floor prices of $80.29 per barrel of oil, $0.55 per gallon of NGLs
and $4.20 per MMBtu of natural gas, respectively and (ii) hedged basis risk on approximately
99% of our year-to-date Eagle Ford oil production.  To the extent our oil and natural gas
production is unhedged, either from a commodity index or locational price perspective, our
financial results will be impacted from period to period.  The following table and discussion that
follows reflects the contracted volumes and the prices we will receive under derivative contracts

Volumes presented are MBbls for oil, TBtu for natural gas and MMGal for propane. Prices
presented are per Bbl of oil, MMBtu of natural gas and Gal for propane.
If market prices settle at or below $46.24 in 2017, we will receive a “locked-in” cash settlement
of the market price plus $14.38 per Bbl.
(3)EP Energy receives WTI plus the basis spread listed and pays LLS.
(4)EP Energy receives Brent plus the basis spread listed and pays LLS.
(5)EP Energy receives Cushing plus the basis spread listed and pays Midland.

(7)
EP Energy receives WTI trade month (TM) plus the spread listed and pays WTI calendar
month (CM).
These positions hedge the timing risk associated with our physical sales. We generally sell oil
for the delivery month at a sales price based on the average NYMEX WTI price during that
month, plus an adjustment calculated as a spread between the weighted average prices of the
delivery month, the next month and the following month during the period when the delivery
month is prompt (the "trade month roll").
Included in the table above are 7.7 MMBbls of 2017 WTI three way collars that we exchanged
in the second quarter for existing LLS fixed price swaps on our 2016 oil positions. The exchange
was non-cash and no gain or loss was recognized on the transaction. In addition to the derivative
contracts presented in the table above, during 2016 we have entered into contracts offsetting 368
MBbls of 2016 LLS fixed price swaps, 1,104 MBbls of 2016 LLS vs. Brent basis swaps and 4,785
MBbls of 2016 WTI - CM vs. TM of our remaining derivative contracts. By entering into these
offsetting positions, we effectively “locked-in” additional net cash settlements of approximately $6
million which will be received during the remainder of 2016.
For the period from July 1, 2016 through August 3, 2016, we have entered into additional
derivative contracts on approximately 3.7 TBtu of 2017 natural gas fixed price swaps with an
average price of $3.13 per MMBtu.
Summary of Liquidity and Capital Resources.  As of June 30, 2016, we had available liquidity,
including existing cash, of approximately $745 million reflecting a revised RBL borrowing base of
$1.65 billion. During 2016, we have taken a number of steps to maintain or improve our liquidity,
strengthen our balance sheet and expand our financial flexibility. These steps have included (i)
completing the sale of our Haynesville and Bossier Shale assets in May 2016, (ii) repurchasing
over $700 million of our unsecured notes and term loans for cash at a discount (iii) amending
certain restrictive debt covenants in our RBL Facility through the first quarter of 2018, and (iv)
entering into hedge transactions to provide additional 2017 price protection. See additional
details of these transactions in “Liquidity and Capital Resources”.

•
Our oil production declines in our Eagle Ford, Wolfcamp and Altamont core areas reflect the
slowed pace of development in our drilling programs due to reduced capital spending in the latter
part of 2015 and the first half of 2016. Future volumes will be impacted by our levels of capital
spending and the timing of that spending. In the current commodity price environment, we could
see continued low spending levels which may result in lower reported volumes in the future.

Oil prices for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016 are calculated including a
reduction of less than $1 million and approximately $1 million, respectively, for oil purchases
associated with managing our physical sales. Natural gas prices for the quarter and six
months ended June 30, 2016 are calculated including a reduction of approximately $3 million
and $7 million, respectively, for natural gas purchases associated with managing our physical

sales. Natural gas prices for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2015 are calculated
including a reduction of $8 million and $15 million, respectively, for natural gas purchases
associated with managing our physical sales.
Changes in realized oil and natural gas prices reflect the effects of unfavorable unhedged
locational or basis differentials, unhedged volumes and contractual deductions between the
commodity price index and the actual price at which we sold our oil and natural gas.
The quarters ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, include approximately $153 million and $150
million of cash received, respectively, for the settlement of crude oil derivative contracts and
approximately $4 million and $25 million of cash received, respectively, for the settlement of
natural gas financial derivatives.  The six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, include
approximately $360 million and $344 million of cash received, respectively, for the settlement
of crude oil derivative contracts and approximately $8 million and $45 million of cash received,
respectively, for the settlement of natural gas financial derivatives. The quarters ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015 also include less than $1 million and approximately $2 million of
cash received, respectively, for the settlement of NGLs derivative contracts. The six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 include approximately $1 million and $2 million of cash
received, respectively, for the settlement of NGLs derivative contracts. No cash premiums
were received or paid for the quarters or six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

Physical sales.  Physical sales represent accrual-based commodity sales transactions with
customers. For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016, physical sales decreased by
$163 million (44%) and $271 million (41%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015.
Physical sales have decreased due to lower commodity prices across all commodity types and
lower oil volumes reflecting the slowed pace of development in our drilling programs due to
reduced capital spending in the latter part of 2015 and the first half of 2016. The table below
displays the price and volume variances on our physical sales when comparing the quarters and
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

Oil sales for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in
2015 decreased by $142 million (46%) and $242 million (45%), respectively, due primarily to
lower oil prices and a decline in oil volumes in all of our oil programs.  For the quarter and six
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, Eagle Ford oil production
decreased by 34% (14.2 MBbls/d) and 25% (10 MBbls/d), respectively, Wolfcamp oil production
decreased by 24% (2.2 MBbls/d) and 26% (2.4 MBbls/d), respectively, and Altamont oil
production decreased by 15% (1.9 MBbls/d) and 11% (1.4 MBbls/d), respectively, reflecting the
slowed pace of development of our core areas.
Natural gas sales decreased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
the same periods in 2015 primarily due to lower natural gas prices, offset by natural gas volume
growth primarily in Wolfcamp for the six months ended June 30, 2016. In May 2016, we sold our
Haynesville Shale assets and as a result expect natural gas volumes to decrease in future
periods. For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016, our Haynesville Shale produced a
total of 38 MMcf/d and 75 MMcf/d, respectively, of natural gas.
Our oil and natural gas is sold at index prices (WTI, LLS and Henry Hub) or posted prices at
various delivery points across our producing basins.  Realized prices received (not considering
the effects of hedges) are generally less than the stated index price as a result of fixed or variable
contractual deducts, differentials from the index to the delivery point, adjustments for time, and/or
discounts for quality or grade.  Generally as the index price of our commodities decreases, the
fixed contractual deducts in our physical sales contracts reduce the realized prices we receive on
a percentage of NYMEX basis.
In the Eagle Ford, our oil is sold at prices tied to benchmark LLS crude oil.  In Wolfcamp, physical
barrels are generally sold at the WTI Midland Index, which trades at a spread to WTI Cushing. 
Pricing for both areas has been influenced by the weakening average price adjustments we
receive on physical sales. In Altamont, market pricing of our oil is based upon NYMEX based
agreements which reflect transportation and handling costs associated with moving wax crude to
end users.  Across all regions, natural gas realized pricing is influenced by factors such as
excess royalties paid on flared gas and the percentage of proceeds retained under processing
contracts, in addition to the normal seasonal supply and demand influences and those factors
discussed above. The table below displays the weighted average differentials and deducts on
our oil and natural gas sales on an average NYMEX price.

The lower realization percentage in the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016 relative to
the same periods in 2015 was primarily a result of a reduced LLS premium relative to NYMEX in
Eagle Ford, partially offset by improved physical sales contract pricing in Altamont and improved
Midland-Cushing basis spread in Wolfcamp. The smaller natural gas differentials and deducts in
the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016 were primarily a result of improved locational
basis differentials and contract restructuring in the Haynesville area, and lower excess royalties
paid on flared gas. In the Eagle Ford area, flared volumes were lower in 2016 compared to the
same periods in 2015.
NGLs sales remained flat for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and decreased for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Average realized prices decreased
for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, due to lower
pricing on all liquids components. NGLs pricing is largely tied to crude oil prices. NGLs volumes
increased for the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of lower flaring in our
Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp drilling programs.
Future growth in our overall oil sales (including the impact of financial derivatives) will largely be
impacted by commodity pricing, our ability to maintain or grow oil volumes, by the location of our
production and by the nature of our sales contracts. Based on our hedges in place as of June 30,
2016, we have approximately 8 MMBbls hedged for 2016 at a weighted average price of $80.67
per barrel. We also have contracts that effectively "lock-in" additional cash settlements, on 0.4
MMBbls of 2016 LLS fixed price swaps, 1,104 MBbls of 2016 LLS vs. Brent basis swaps and
4,785 MBbls of 2016 WTI - CM vs. TM, representing approximately $6 million which will be
received during the remainder of 2016. See "Our Business" for further information on our
derivative instruments.
Gains or losses on financial derivatives.  We record gains or losses due to changes in the fair
value of our derivative contracts based on forward commodity prices relative to the prices in the
underlying contracts. We realize such gains or losses when we settle the derivative position.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we recorded $105 million of derivative losses compared
to derivative losses of $179 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2015.  For the six months
ended June 30, 2016, we recorded $63 million of derivative losses compared to derivative gains
of $24 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Operating Expenses
Oil and natural gas purchases.  We purchase and sell oil and natural gas on a monthly basis to
improve the prices we would otherwise receive for our oil and natural gas or to manage firm
transportation agreements. Oil and natural gas purchases for the quarter and six months ended
June 30, 2016 were $3 million and $7 million, respectively, compared to $8 million and $15
million for the same periods in 2015. For both the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016,
natural gas purchases decreased as a result of the sale of Haynesville, partially offset by an
increase in oil purchases.
Lease operating expense.  Lease operating expense for the quarter and six months ended
June 30, 2016 were $38 million and $80 million, respectively, compared to $47 million and $94
million for the same periods in 2015. We experienced a decrease in lease operating expense in
our three core areas for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016. In Wolfcamp the
decrease was approximately $4 million and $8 million, respectively, due to lower disposal costs,
lower flowback and lower maintenance and repair costs. In Altamont, the decrease for the quarter
and six months ended June 30, 2016 was approximately $2 million and $4 million, respectively,
primarily due to lower disposal and chemical costs. In Eagle Ford, the decrease was
23
Table of Contents
approximately $2 million and $1 million, respectively, due to lower flowback and lower disposal
costs. We also experienced a general decrease in costs across all programs due to ongoing
contract negotiations.
General and administrative expenses.  General and administrative expenses for the quarter and
six months ended June 30, 2016 were $32 million and $70 million, respectively, compared to $35
million and $82 million for the same periods in 2015. Lower costs during the quarter and six
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 2015 reflected lower payroll, benefits and
administrative costs of $6 million and $10 million, respectively, resulting primarily from a general
and administrative headcount reduction of approximately 17% in response to the lower
commodity price environment. The decrease during the quarter and six months ended June 30,
2016 was offset by higher severance charges of $2 million recorded in the second quarter of
2016.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Depreciation, depletion and amortization
expense for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016 were $97 million and $210 million,
respectively, compared to $253 million and $477 million for the same periods in 2015. Our
depreciation, depletion and amortization costs decreased in 2016 compared to the same period
in 2015 due primarily to the impact of the non-cash impairment charge on our proved properties
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, the sale of our Haynesville Shale assets in May 2016 and
an overall decrease in production volumes. Our average depreciation, depletion and amortization
costs per unit for the quarters and six months ended June 30 were:

Six months ended 
 
 June 30,
 June 30,

Our depreciation, depletion and amortization rate in the future will be impacted by the level and
timing of capital spending, overall cost savings on capital and the level and type of reserves
recorded on completed projects.
Gain on sale of assets. For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded an $83
million gain related to the sale of our assets in the Haynesville and Bossier shales completed in
May 2016.
Exploration and other expense.  For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016, we
recorded $1 million and $2 million, respectively, of exploration expense compared to $6 million
and $12 million for the same periods in 2015.  Included in exploration expense for both the
quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016, are less than $1 million of amortization of unproved
leasehold costs compared to $4 million and $8 million for the same periods in 2015. In addition,
in the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded approximately $2 million as other expense
in conjunction with the early termination of a contract for drilling rigs during the first quarter of
2015.
Taxes, other than income taxes.  Taxes, other than income taxes, for the quarter and six months
ended June 30, 2016 were $14 million and $28 million, respectively, compared to $23 million
and $45 million for the same periods in 2015.  Production taxes decreased in 2016 compared to
the same period in 2015 due to lower oil volumes and the significant impact on severance taxes
of lower commodity prices.
Cash Operating Costs and Adjusted Cash Operating Costs.  We use a non-GAAP measure
when describing the costs required to produce our oil and natural gas. These measures are cash
operating costs and adjusted cash operating costs. Our cash operating costs measure is a non-
GAAP measure calculated on a per Boe basis as total operating expenses less depreciation,
depletion and amortization expense, transportation costs, exploration expense, oil and natural
gas purchases, gains and losses on sales of assets and other expenses. Adjusted cash
operating costs is a non-GAAP measure calculated as cash operating costs less transition,
restructuring and other costs that affect comparability, and the non-cash portion of compensation
expense (which represents compensation expense under long-term incentive programs adjusted
for cash payments made under long-term incentive plans). We believe cash operating costs and
adjusted cash operating costs per unit provides management and investors valuable measures
of operating performance and efficiency relative to other industry participants and relative to our
historical results; however, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
used by other companies and should not be used as a substitute to the comparable GAAP
measure of operating expenses. The table below represents a reconciliation of our GAAP
operating expenses to non-GAAP cash operating costs and adjusted cash operating costs for the
quarters and six months ended June 30:

Other Income Statement Items.
Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt. During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016,
we paid approximately $217 million and $360 million, respectively, in cash to repurchase a total
of approximately $392 million and $737 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of
our senior unsecured notes and term loans. We recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of
approximately $170 million in the second quarter and $366 million year to date which included
$5 million and $11 million, respectively, of non-cash expense related to eliminating associated
unamortized debt issue costs.
In addition, for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a loss on
extinguishment of debt of approximately $8 million related to eliminating a portion of the
unamortized debt issue costs on our RBL Facility due to the reduction of our borrowing base in
May 2016.
For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded $41 million ($12 million of
which was non-cash) in losses on extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the early repayment
and retirement of our $750 million senior secured notes due 2019.
Interest Expense. Interest expense for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $73
million and $157 million, respectively, compared to $81 million and $165 million for the same
periods in 2015.  Interest expense decreased in 2016 primarily due to the effects of our 2016 debt
repurchases.  The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by higher interest expense
related to our RBL Facility. We estimate that out debt repurchases will reduce our annual interest
expense by approximately $62 million.
Income Taxes. For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016, our effective tax rates were
0%. Our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate as a result of adjustments to the
valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets which offset deferred income tax expense by $24
million and $59 million for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016 (See Part I, Item 1,
Financial Statements, Note 3). The effective tax rate for the quarter and six months ended
June 30, 2015 was relatively consistent with the statutory tax rate. Our effective tax rates in 2015
were primarily impacted by the effects of state income taxes (net of federal income tax effects).

Table of Contents
Supplemental Non-GAAP Measures
 
We use the non-GAAP measures “EBITDAX” and “Adjusted EBITDAX” as supplemental
measures. We believe these supplemental measures provide meaningful information to our
investors. We define EBITDAX as net income (loss) plus interest and debt expense, income
taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization and exploration expense. Adjusted EBITDAX is
defined as EBITDAX, adjusted as applicable in the relevant period for the net change in the fair
value of derivatives (mark-to-market effects of financial derivatives, net of cash settlements and
cash premiums related to these derivatives), the non-cash portion of compensation expense
(which represents non-cash compensation expense under long-term incentive programs
adjusted for cash payments made under long-term incentive plans), transition, restructuring and
other costs that affect comparability, gains and losses on sales of assets and gains and losses on
extinguishment of debt.
We believe that the presentation of EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX is important to provide
management and investors with additional information (i) to evaluate our ability to service debt
adjusting for items required or permitted in calculating covenant compliance under our debt
agreements, (ii) to provide an important supplemental indicator of the operational performance of
our business without regard to financing methods and capital structure, (iii) for evaluating our
performance relative to our peers, (iv) to measure our liquidity (before cash capital requirements
and working capital needs) and (v) to provide supplemental information about certain material
non-cash and/or other items that may not continue at the same level in the future. EBITDAX and
Adjusted EBITDAX have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation
or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP or as an alternative to net
income (loss), operating income (loss), operating cash flows or other measures of financial
performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.

EBITDAX:

Commitments and Contingencies
 
For a further discussion of our commitments and contingencies, see Part I, Item 1, Financial
Statements, Note 7.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated by our operations and borrowings under our
RBL Facility. Our primary uses of cash are capital expenditures, debt service including interest,
and working capital requirements. Our available liquidity was approximately $745 million as of
June 30, 2016.
During 2016, we have taken steps to improve our liquidity, strengthen our balance sheet and
expand our financial flexibility, including (i) completing the sale of our Haynesville and Bossier
shale assets for approximately $420 million (net proceeds of approximately $390 million after
customary adjustments) in May 2016, (ii) repurchasing for cash a total of $791 million in
aggregate principal amount of our unsecured notes and term loans for approximately $394
million in cash which is expected to reduce our annual interest expense costs by approximately
$62 million, (iii) amending certain restrictive debt covenants in our RBL Facility through the first
quarter of 2018, and (iv) entering into hedge transactions to provide additional 2016 and 2017
commodity price protection.
In May 2016, our RBL borrowing base was reduced to $1.65 billion, reflecting significantly lower
bank commodity price forecasts, the sale of our Haynesville assets and the roll-off of certain
hedge positions. In addition, we amended certain restrictive debt covenants for 2017 and through
the first quarter of 2018, the most significant of which suspended the requirement that our debt to
EBITDAX ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, not exceed 4.5 to 1.0 which was replaced
with a requirement that our ratio of first lien debt to EBITDAX not exceed 3.5 to 1.0. The 4.5 to 1.0
debt to EBITDAX requirement will be reinstated beginning in April 2018. We also agreed to limit
debt repurchases occurring after the redetermination to $350 million subject to certain future
adjustments. Our RBL facility matures in 2019 subject to retiring or refinancing certain senior
secured term loans six months prior to their maturity as further noted in Long-Term Debt below
and Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 6. The next redetermination date for the RBL
Facility is in November 2016. Downward revisions of our oil and natural gas reserves volume
and value due to declines in commodity prices, the impact of lower estimated capital spending in
response to lower prices, performance revisions, sales of assets or the incurrence of certain
types of additional debt, among other items, could cause a reduction of our borrowing base in the
future, and these reductions could be significant.
For the remainder of 2016, we have derivative contracts providing us commodity price protection
on a significant portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production. These derivative
contracts, which are fixed price swaps, allow us to realize a weighted average price of $80.67 per
barrel on a remaining 8 MMBbls of oil and $3.39 on 11 TBtu of natural gas in 2016. We also have
derivative contracts where we have effectively “locked-in” additional cash settlements on 0.4
MMBbls of oil in 2016. For 2017, we have derivative contracts on 13 MMBbls of our anticipated
oil production at a weighted average price of $62.34 per barrel of oil. See "Our Business" for
further information on our derivative instruments.
Based upon our actions to date, we believe our liquidity, and expected cash flows from
operations will be sufficient to fund our capital program and meet current obligations and
projected working capital requirements through the next twelve months.
Our ability to (i) generate sufficient cash flows from operations or obtain future borrowings under
the RBL Facility, (ii) repay or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable
terms or at all, or (iii) obtain additional capital if required on acceptable terms or at all to fund our
capital programs or any potential future acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar transactions,
will depend on prevailing economic conditions many of which are beyond our control. The
extreme ongoing volatility in the energy industry and commodity prices will likely continue to
impact our outlook. Our plans are intended to address the impacts of the current volatility in
commodity prices while (i) maintaining sufficient liquidity to fund capital in our core drilling
programs, (ii) meeting our debt maturities, and (iii) managing and working to strengthen our
balance sheet. We continue to implement various cost saving measures to reduce our capital,
operating, and general and administrative costs including renegotiating contracts with
contractors, suppliers and service providers, reducing the number of staff and contractors and
deferring and eliminating various discretionary costs. We will continue to be opportunistic and
aggressive in managing our cost structure and in turn, our liquidity to meet our capital and
operating needs.
To the extent commodity prices remain low or decline further, or we experience disruptions in the
financial markets impacting our longer-term access to or cost of capital, our ability to fund future
growth projects may be further impacted. We continually monitor the capital markets and our
capital structure and may make changes to our capital structure from time to time, with the goal of
maintaining financial flexibility, preserving or improving liquidity and/or achieving cost efficiency.
For example, we could (i) elect to continue to repurchase additional amounts of our outstanding
debt in the future for cash through open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions
with certain of our debtholders subject to the limitation described previously or (ii) issue
additional secured debt as permitted under our debt agreements, although there is no assurance
we
28
Table of Contents
would do so. It is also possible additional adjustments to our plan and outlook may occur based
on market conditions and the needs of the Company at that time, which could include selling
additional assets, liquidating all or a portion of our hedge portfolio, seeking additional partners to
develop our assets, and/or further reducing our planned capital program.
Capital Expenditures.  For the full year 2016, we expect our capital expenditures will be between
$475 million to $505 million, exclusive of acquisition capital. Our capital expenditures and
average drilling rigs by area for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were:

Debt. As of June 30, 2016, our total debt was approximately $3.9 billion, comprised of $2.5 billion
in senior notes due in 2020, 2022 and 2023, $609 million in senior secured term loans with
maturity dates in 2018 and 2019 and $910 million outstanding under the RBL Facility expiring in
2019 (provided that we refinance or retire remaining amounts outstanding under our (i) $500
million senior secured term loans due 2018 by November 2017 and (ii) $150 million senior
secured term loans due 2019 by November 2018). For additional details on our long-term debt,
including maturities, borrowing capacity and restrictive covenants under our debt agreements,

Financing Obligations (Principal and Interest). Debt obligations included in the table above
represent
stated maturities. Interest payments are shown through the stated maturity date of the related debt
based on (i) the contractual
interest rate for fixed rate debt and (ii) current market interest rates and the contractual credit
spread for variable rate debt. The maturity of our RBL Facility is May 2019, provided that we retire
or refinance our 2018 and 2019 secured term loans at least six months prior to their maturity. The
table above assumes these refinancings occur and our RBL Facility matures in 2019.
Accordingly, we will be required to retire or refinance remaining amounts outstanding under our
(i) $500 million senior secured term loans due 2018 by November 2017 and (ii) $150 million
senior secured term loans due 2019 by November 2018. Subsequent to June 30, 2016, we
repurchased $54 million of our senior unsecured notes.
Liabilities from Derivatives. These amounts include the fair value of our commodity-based and
interest rate derivative
liabilities.
Operating Leases. Amounts include leases related to our office space and various equipment.
Other Contractual Commitments and Purchase Obligations. Other contractual commitments and
purchase obligations
are legally enforceable agreements to purchase goods or services that have fixed or minimum
quantities and fixed or minimum
variable price provisions, and that detail approximate timing of the underlying obligations.
Included are the following:
•
Volume and Transportation Commitments. Included in these amounts are commitments for
demand charges for firm access to natural gas transportation, volume deficiency contracts and
firm oil capacity contracts.
•
Other Obligations. Included in these amounts are commitments for drilling, completions and
seismic
activities for our operations and various other maintenance, engineering, procurement and
construction
contracts. Our future commitments under these contracts may change reflecting changes in
commodity prices
and any related effect on the supply/demand for these services. We have excluded asset
retirement
obligations and reserves for litigation and environmental remediation, as these liabilities are not
contractually
fixed as to timing and amount.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of June 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and our Chief
Financial Officer (CFO), as to the effectiveness, design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures. This evaluation considered the various processes carried out under the
direction of our disclosure committee in an effort to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reports we file or submit under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), is accurate, complete and timely.
Our management, including our CEO and our CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal controls will prevent and/or detect all errors and all fraud. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must
be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our CEO and
CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective as of June 30, 2016.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
     There were no changes in EP Energy LLC’s internal control over financial reporting during the
first six months of 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
