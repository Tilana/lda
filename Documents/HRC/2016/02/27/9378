</b></p>
<p><b>1.  First step (before the selection process) 
</b> (a) In accordance with paragraph 12 of the institution-building text annexed to Council 
resolution 5/1, Member and Observer States may volunteer to be reviewed as a matter of priority. 
Expressions of interest should reach the Secretariat <i>before 21 September 2007</i>; 
</p>
<p> (b) The Secretariat will prepare five lists of countries in alphabetical order, each list 
corresponding to a regional group. The lists of regional groups will be based on groupings drawn 
up in New York in similar circumstances; 
</p>
<p> (c) In accordance with paragraph 9 of the institution-building text, Council members 
whose terms of membership ended in June 2007 or will end in June 2008 will be clearly 
identified* in each list. Those countries volunteering for review will also be identified in each 
list (see appendix I); 
</p>
<p> (d) In order to maintain a good balance between members and non-members, Council 
members whose terms of membership will end in June 2009 or later, will also be identified as 
appropriate. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Second step (selection process) 
</b> (a) On 21 September 2007, the President will draw by lot the first Member or Observer 
State, the name of which will serve to reorganize the above lists accordingly. Each list will be 
recomposed taking into account the priorities mentioned in paragraph 1 (c). Those countries 
whose terms of membership ended in June 2007 will be moved up in the list, followed by those 
whose terms of membership will end in June 2008, as well as the volunteers. Members whose

 <p> 
</p>
<p>terms of membership will end in June 2009 and those non-initial members of the Council whose 
terms of membership will end in 2010 will be placed in the list at the first possible opportunity in 
the year during which their terms of membership will end; 
</p>
<p> (b) In accordance with paragraph 14 of the institution-building text, 48 countries will be 
reviewed per year, thus corresponding to 16 countries to be reviewed per session of the Working 
Group on UPR. In this regard, and so as to ensure full respect for equitable geographic 
distribution (paragraph 11 of the institution-building text), the calendar for 2008 and following 
years will be drawn up based on the tables contained in appendix 2; 
</p>
<p> (c) The President will then draw by lot the order in which countries selected for the first 
UPR session will be considered. Similar drawings will take place at each plenary session for the 
subsequent UPR Working Group sessions; 
</p>
<p> (d) Lastly, all States to be reviewed in 2008 will be invited to indicate before 
15 November 2007 whether they intend to request that one of the three rapporteurs be from its 
own regional group (an option provided for in paragraph 19 of the institution-building text 
annexed to resolution 5/1). </p>
