<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1. The United Nations Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence 
</p>
<p>against Women is a global, multilateral, grant-making mechanism established in 
</p>
<p>1996 pursuant to General Assembly resolution 50/166. It is administered by the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  
</p>
<p>(UN-Women) on behalf of the United Nations system. UN-Women provides the 
</p>
<p>Trust Fund with a strong institutional foundation and field support through its 
</p>
<p>regional, multi-country and country offices. The Trust Fund supports and 
</p>
<p>strengthens the work of UN-Women to prevent and address violence against women 
</p>
<p>and girls and works closely with the rest of the United Nations system through the 
</p>
<p>members of its Programme Advisory Committee.1 Working in synergy with  
</p>
<p>UN-Women, other United Nations agencies and members of the Programme 
</p>
<p>Advisory Committee, the Trust Fund plays a vital role in driving forward collective 
</p>
<p>efforts that engage the wider community &#8212; women and men, girls and boys. The 
</p>
<p>Trust Fund continues to ensure that its work integrates the Framework for Action of 
</p>
<p>the Secretary-General&#8217;s campaign UNiTE to End Violence against Women. 
</p>
<p>2. The Trust Fund is exclusively dedicated to addressing violence against women 
</p>
<p>and girls in all its forms. It supports national, regional and cross -regional initiatives 
</p>
<p>that work to systematically prevent, address, respond to and, with persistence, 
</p>
<p>eliminate this global pandemic. To date, the Trust Fund has awarded $103 million to 
</p>
<p>393 initiatives in 136 countries and territories. Its current portfolio consists of  
</p>
<p>95 grants for projects in 75 countries and territories, for a total value of $56,311,108.  
</p>
<p>3. A commitment to and strategic implementation of a results-driven resource 
</p>
<p>mobilization strategy enabled the Trust Fund to significantly increase its overall 
</p>
<p>resources for grant making in 2014 and meet its target of raising $15 million. The 
</p>
<p>financial contributions and political support of a range of partners were critical to 
</p>
<p>the Trust Fund&#8217;s success.  
</p>
<p>4. As of December 2014, the Governments of Australia, Germany, Iceland, 
</p>
<p>Ireland, Israel, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland had contributed to the Trust Fund&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>eighteenth grant-making cycle. Zonta International and the UN Women for Peace 
</p>
<p>Association continued to support Trust Fund initiatives. The Trust Fund also 
</p>
<p>received support from Benetton as well as the UN Women National Committees of 
</p>
<p>Finland, Iceland, Japan and Switzerland.

<p>5. The Trust Fund focuses its funding on three priority programme areas: 
</p>
<p>preventing violence against women and girls; expanding survivors &#8217; access to 
</p>
<p>support services; and strengthening the implementation of laws, policies and action 
</p>
<p>plans. The Trust Fund has also created three special Thematic Windows to support 
</p>
<p>global learning initiatives. Each of the Windows groups together grantees working 
</p>
<p>on similar types of interventions in the areas of: violence against women in conflict, 
</p>
<p>post-conflict and transitional settings; the intersection between HIV/AIDS and 
</p>
<p>violence against women and girls; and violence against adolescent girls. In addition 
</p>
<p>to giving sustained visibility to these issues, the Thematic Windows help to identify 
</p>
<p>good and promising practices and generate knowledge about effective methods of 
</p>
<p>and approaches to eliminating violence against women and girls.  
</p>
<p>6. The present report, prepared for the fifty-ninth session of the Commission on 
</p>
<p>the Status of Women and the twenty-ninth session of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>describes the impact and achievements of the Trust Fund in 2014.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three women worldwide 
</p>
<p>will experience either physical or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner 
</p>
<p>sexual violence in her lifetime.2 The most common form of violence experienced by 
</p>
<p>women is intimate partner violence; a global study on homicide found that almost 
</p>
<p>half of female homicide victims are killed by members of their family or intimate 
</p>
<p>partners, whereas the equivalent figure for male victims is just over one fifth.3 
</p>
<p>Current economic crises have exacerbated women&#8217;s economic disadvantage and 
</p>
<p>subsequent cutbacks in social spending on health and education have increased 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s risk of exploitation and violence (see A/HRC/26/39). 
</p>
<p>8. The Trust Fund recognizes that violence against women and girls can often be 
</p>
<p>directly linked to their lack of economic empowerment and that precarious and 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged economic situation can further facilitate women &#8217;s exploitation or 
</p>
<p>abuse by partners, relatives, employers, and others in their communities. It can also 
</p>
<p>prevent women and girls from escaping violence and building new lives for 
</p>
<p>themselves and their families. To truly transform the existing social beliefs, 
</p>
<p>practices and cultural models that fuel violence, it is necessary to address and bring 
</p>
<p>to an end the multiple and interconnected disadvantages, including all forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination and exclusion that girls and women experience worldwide.  
</p>
<p>9. The year 2015 will be a critical juncture for future efforts to end violence 
</p>
<p>against women and girls. Discussions about the post-2015 development agenda, 
</p>
<p>including the sustainable development goals, and debates surrounding the upcoming 
</p>
<p>twentieth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women and the Beijing 
</p>
<p>Declaration and Platform for Action (1995), will provide a pivotal opportunity to 
</p>
<p>reposition the issue of violence against women and girls and ensure that it is placed 
</p>
<p>at the centre of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda. In this context, the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Trust Fund is more determined than ever to support the

</p>
<p><b> III. Trust Fund grantee achievements in 2014 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>10. The sustainability both of the programmes themselves and of the 
</p>
<p>improvements in the lives of women and girls that they bring about, is a key 
</p>
<p>criterion for the Trust Fund in assessing its long-term impact. This in turn depends 
</p>
<p>on building capacity among grantees to determine the effectiveness of initiatives 
</p>
<p>and methodologies and to sustain them beyond the life of the grant. In 2014, one of 
</p>
<p>the Trust Fund&#8217;s key annual capacity-building and monitoring initiatives, its 
</p>
<p>development workshop for new grantees, was held in Turkey in March. The event 
</p>
<p>aimed at enabling the 17 grantee organizations that attended to implement, monitor 
</p>
<p>and evaluate their projects more effectively and in line with the Trust Fund &#8217;s vision. 
</p>
<p>In addition, it provided grantees with a valuable opportunity to exchange knowledge 
</p>
<p>and share experiences and promising practices.  
</p>
<p>11. Drawing on the United Nations Trust Fund monitoring missions implemented 
</p>
<p>this year, annual evaluation reports from grantees and discussions with partners and 
</p>
<p>donors, the present report highlights Trust Fund grantee results in the following 
</p>
<p>areas: preventing violence against young and adolescent girls through leadership 
</p>
<p>development and education; implementing laws and policies to respond effectively 
</p>
<p>to violence against women and girls; advancing transitional justice and addressing 
</p>
<p>violence against women and girls in emergency settings; and engaging the private 
</p>
<p>sector in prevention and response efforts.  
</p>
<p>12. Throughout 2014, the Trust Fund undertook extensive monitoring missions to 
</p>
<p>13 countries in four regions in order to validate the results and effectiveness of Tru st 
</p>
<p>Fund-supported programmes. The Trust Fund visited seven grantees from Eastern 
</p>
<p>Europe and Central Asia in six countries (Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and 
</p>
<p>Herzegovina, Serbia, Turkey and Ukraine); seven grantees from Asia in three 
</p>
<p>countries (Cambodia, China and Thailand); four grantees from Africa in two 
</p>
<p>countries (Nigeria and Uganda); and two grantees from the Caribbean (Belize and 
</p>
<p>Grenada). These missions included meetings with grantee organizations, partner 
</p>
<p>organizations, primary and secondary beneficiaries and key stakeholders and visits 
</p>
<p>to key project sites.  
</p>
<p>13. In 2014, the implementation of Trust Fund programmes benefited over 
</p>
<p>1 million women, girls, men and boys. In total, over 700,000 women and girls were 
</p>
<p>involved in programme activities, including 89,802 survivors of violence,  
</p>
<p>38,102 women and girls living with HIV/AIDS and 4,385 women human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders. In addition, Trust Fund-supported programmes engaged 208,658 men and 
</p>
<p>boys and strategically reached over 22 million people through awareness -raising, 
</p>
<p>social media campaigns, radio and television shows, theatre and other forms of 
</p>
<p>education-entertainment. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>  Preventing violence against young and adolescent girls through leadership and 
</b></p>
<p><b>education strategies 
</b> 
</p>
<p>14. Violence against children often goes unnoticed and unreported. Although both 
</p>
<p>boys and girls are victims of violence, their experiences of and vulnerabilities to </p>

</b></p>
<p>violence differ.4 The availability of data on violence against young and adolescent 
</p>
<p>girls at the national level remains scarce. However, a recent study carried out by the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) in 42 countries found that the proportion 
</p>
<p>of adolescent girls who reported experiencing some form of physical violence 
</p>
<p>between the ages of 15 and 19 ranged from 4 per cent in Kazakhstan to more than 
</p>
<p>50 per cent in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda.5 Up to 12 per 
</p>
<p>cent of girls aged 15 to 19 in countries with available comparable data reported 
</p>
<p>incidents of sexual violence during the previous year.

</p>
<p>15. Efforts by the Trust Fund to address this critical situation include programmes 
</p>
<p>targeting young and adolescent girls in school and after-school settings, raising 
</p>
<p>awareness of girls&#8217; rights among boys and girls, empowering girls through sports, 
</p>
<p>leadership, capacity-building and sensitizing teachers and administrators. The Trust 
</p>
<p>Fund is currently investing more than $9 million in this area to support 18 grants 
</p>
<p>that address violence against young girls and adolescent girls.  
</p>
<p>16. Increasing knowledge and self-protection capabilities is crucial for effective 
</p>
<p>violence-reduction initiatives. This was, therefore, a core component of many 
</p>
<p>grantees&#8217; initiatives. Several placed particular emphasis on raising awareness among 
</p>
<p>the young and focused on their potential to drive forward changes in social attitudes 
</p>
<p>that will provide sustainable progress towards eliminating violence against women 
</p>
<p>and girls. For example, one grantee, the Beijing Cultural Development Cent re for 
</p>
<p>Rural Women, finalized implementation of the three-year project to address violence 
</p>
<p>against &#8220;left-behind&#8221; girls &#8212; girls abandoned in their villages by migrant parents &#8212; 
</p>
<p>in Suizhou City, Hubei Province, China. Both quantitative surveys and qualitative 
</p>
<p>interviews indicated that the project had been effective in disseminating knowledge 
</p>
<p>and increasing the capacity of &#8220;left-behind girls&#8221;, their guardians and teachers. By 
</p>
<p>the close of the project at the end of 2013, in total 500 local teachers, 5,000 students 
</p>
<p>and 2,200 guardians participated in training and awareness-raising activities on 
</p>
<p>preventing child abuse. Six resource centres were set up in communities, which led 
</p>
<p>to creation of the first local non-governmental organization to offer services to 
</p>
<p>young people and children, providing a platform for preventing sexual abuse to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;left-behind&#8221; children.  
</p>
<p>17. In Malawi, with Trust Fund support, the civil society organization Concern 
</p>
<p>Worldwide is implementing a programme to ensure a safe school environment free 
</p>
<p>from violence and discrimination in 17 primary schools in Nsanje province. More 
</p>
<p>than 6,800 girls and 7,200 boys are participating in Student Councils, peer-led 
</p>
<p>spaces of reflection, to advocate for gender equality and ending violence against 
</p>
<p>girls. The project has also involved more than 5,233 teachers in developing positive 
</p>
<p>discipline policies. In addition to focusing on raising awareness and increasing 
</p>
<p>knowledge, the programme will also seek to ensure that girls have responsive 
</p>
<p>structures, where they can report abuse. 
</p>
<p>18. In Peru, more than 227 young people took part in leadership training 
</p>
<p>developed by Trust Fund grantee, the Asociaci&#243;n de Comunicadores Sociales

<p>Calandria (Calandria Social Communicators&#8217; Association). The training 
</p>
<p>implemented an intercultural and participatory programme involving  
</p>
<p>Afro-descendant, Indigenous and Andean adolescent boys and girls. The project&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>greatest impact was in enhancing participants&#8217; self-esteem, self-confidence and 
</p>
<p>communication skills. Trainees created a network and established a &#8220;gender agenda&#8221; 
</p>
<p>with specific proposals to prevent violence against adolescent girls in their 
</p>
<p>communities. In all three locations where the programme was implemented, 
</p>
<p>networks of young people were formed. This strengthened their ability not only to 
</p>
<p>make their voices heard, but also to have their views acted upon by local 
</p>
<p>policymakers. Families reported that adolescent girls shared their new knowledge 
</p>
<p>within the household and that the impact of the project positively influenced family 
</p>
<p>dynamics. Among the most notable changes was girls&#8217; greater ability to plan and 
</p>
<p>build a future for themselves in which marriage and motherhood were contemplated 
</p>
<p>at a later age and the value of personal and/or professional development and 
</p>
<p>contributing to the community was more highly regarded.  
</p>
<p>19. The Trust Fund-supported project implemented by the European Centre for 
</p>
<p>Minority Issues Kosovo focuses on reducing the risk of domestic violence and early 
</p>
<p>and forced marriage faced by women and girls from minority communities. The 
</p>
<p>project primarily targets women and girls from Serb, Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian 
</p>
<p>communities, but beneficiaries also include community-based groups, educational 
</p>
<p>professionals, as well as boys and men.  
</p>
<p>20. The initial phase of the project, the first of its kind in Kosovo (under Security 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 1244 (1999)), is focusing on training activists from the targeted 
</p>
<p>communities to act as community-based paralegals. After receiving training, 
</p>
<p>paralegals have conducted 250 home visits and begun a programme of reaching out 
</p>
<p>to more women through quarterly meetings in each municipality. In particular, the 
</p>
<p>paralegals are active in raising awareness about women&#8217;s rights and providing legal 
</p>
<p>advice on issues related to divorce, child custody, adoption rights, property rights 
</p>
<p>and social, medical and food assistance. In addition to gaining increased trust within 
</p>
<p>communities, paralegals are also establishing synergies with other relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including community police officers and representatives from the 
</p>
<p>Centres for Social Welfare, which helped to facilitate the referral of 
</p>
<p>victims/survivors. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>  Implementing laws and policies to respond to violence against women and girls  
</b> 
</p>
<p>21. States have progressively put into place laws and policies to prevent and 
</p>
<p>respond to violence against women. However, implementation in many countries  
</p>
<p>remains slow. Implementation efforts that have had most success are those involving 
</p>
<p>multisectoral strategies that include partnerships between Governments and civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations; effective prevention systems and support services for 
</p>
<p>survivors; adequate budgets; extensive data collection and analysis; specific 
</p>
<p>timelines and targets; and strong monitoring and evaluation mechanisms  (see 
</p>
<p>A/69/222, para. 22). These elements are, therefore, critical in identifying initiatives 
</p>
<p>that are likely to have greatest impact.  
</p>
<p>22. An effective holistic response strategy should not only criminalize violence 
</p>
<p>against women and girls, but it must also provide preventative measures and support 
</p>
<p>for survivors so that they can access justice (ibid., para. 10). The Trust Fund 
</p>
<p>supports programmes that work to establish or to strengthen coordinated </p>

</p>
<p>actors in enforcing laws and policies to address violence against women and girls. 
</p>
<p>Sur Corporaci&#243;n focused on addressing the need to strengthen police recording and 
</p>
<p>follow-up of reports of violence against women through the implementation of an 
</p>
<p>in-person and online course on policing and women&#8217;s right to live in a city free of 
</p>
<p>violence. In total these courses have engaged almost 700 police officers, enhancing

<p>their knowledge of the different types and modalities of violence against women.  
</p>
<p>24.  From the start, the high level of commitment on the part of the various 
</p>
<p>institutions was reflected in attendance, participation and engagement. The project 
</p>
<p>has also fostered improved communication between the police and women &#8217;s 
</p>
<p>organizations in all three countries, helping to establish a common language and 
</p>
<p>understanding of violence against women and girls. Comprehensive follow-up 
</p>
<p>workshops provided an important space where representatives from the police and 
</p>
<p>from women&#8217;s organizations were able to identify critical aspects of procedures and 
</p>
<p>protocols for preventing and addressing gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>25. The Jordanian Women&#8217;s Union implemented a three-year project supported by 
</p>
<p>the Trust Fund, to formulate a regional holistic response to eliminate trafficking of 
</p>
<p>women. The project was implemented in partnership with the Egyptian Centre for 
</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s Assistance and Union de l&#8217;Action Feminine (Union for Women&#8217;s Action) 
</p>
<p>in Morocco. In addition to the training of 35 organizations in providing services to 
</p>
<p>trafficked women, shelters and hotlines were able to ensure that 388 survivors of 
</p>
<p>trafficking were given access to psychosocial and legal support, with the overall 
</p>
<p>objective of reintegration into their families and communities. More than  
</p>
<p>1,000 women in Egypt and Morocco participated in awareness-raising sessions on 
</p>
<p>the risks associated with trafficking, including their rights under the law. These 
</p>
<p>focused particularly on those living in areas targeted by traffickers, primarily in 
</p>
<p>rural and poor communities.  
</p>
<p>26. Other key results of the project included establishing effective coordination 
</p>
<p>and networking among partners and coalitions, including local and national  
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations and government and judicial and law  enforcement 
</p>
<p>representatives; the drafting of anti-trafficking model laws, which incorporated the 
</p>
<p>definition of trafficking as specified in the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, 
</p>
<p>Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children; and 
</p>
<p>the training of 120 police officers, judges and prosecutors on trafficking as a human 
</p>
<p>rights issue.  
</p>
<p>27. In Cabo Verde, more than 2,000 survivors of violence were reached in 2014 by 
</p>
<p>a project implemented by Trust Fund grantee, the national institute of Cabo Verde 
</p>
<p>for gender equality and equity (Instituto Caboverdiano para a Igualdade e Equidade 
</p>
<p>de G&#233;nero). Support centres for survivors were opened in Santiago, Fogo and 
</p>
<p>Boavista and further centres are under discussion with the Ministry of Justice. In 
</p>
<p>March, the project was featured by the Cabo Verde Music Awards, an important 
</p>
<p>cultural event in the country. This was a significant step in ensuring wider publicity 
</p>
<p>for issues of gender, gender-based violence and effective responses to intimate 
</p>
<p>partner violence.  </p>

</p>
<p>Population Fund (UNFPA) and UNICEF and the International Organization for 
</p>
<p>Migration to strengthen capacity to prevent and address intimate partner vio lence 
</p>
<p>through the creation of multisectoral teams and the development of Cooperation 
</p>
<p>Protocols. In addition, referral mechanisms were established in three pilot sites 
</p>
<p>(Minsk; the Moskovskiy district of Brest City; and the Kobryn and Kamieniec 
</p>
<p>districts of Brest oblast) to strengthen access to social and legal services for 
</p>
<p>survivors of intimate partner violence. More than 3,700 callers have benefited from 
</p>
<p>a nationwide toll-free hotline for domestic violence, staffed by five trained 
</p>
<p>specialists who provide psychological, legal and social support. 
</p>
<p>29. In Grenada, the standard operating procedures for medical personnel and 
</p>
<p>stakeholders were approved by the Cabinet in May 2014. These were developed by 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Social Development, a Trust Fund grantee, in collaboration with the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Health and the Pan-American Health Organization and were designed to 
</p>
<p>facilitate the implementation of a multisectoral initiative to increase outreach to 
</p>
<p>survivors and improve the quality of health and justice services.  
</p>
<p>30. The Albanian Network against Gender Violence and Trafficking, led by the 
</p>
<p>Refleksione Association, piloted a multisectoral project aimed at ensuring the 
</p>
<p>effective implementation of new legislation in Albania on domestic violence. By  
</p>
<p>the end of the project, a referral mechanism for women experiencing domestic 
</p>
<p>violence has been established not only in the 10 municipalities targeted by the 
</p>
<p>project, but also in 12 others where the United Nations Development Programme 
</p>
<p>(UNDP) and the Refleksione Association had initiated similar projects; that is, in a 
</p>
<p>total of 22 of Albania&#8217;s 65 municipalities. A network of 12 shelters and counselling 
</p>
<p>centres was also established, to ensure the development and implementation of 
</p>
<p>harmonized standards of services throughout Albania.

</p>
<p>international attention. In June, the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Foreign 
</p>
<p>and Commonwealth Affairs and Angelina Jolie, Special Envoy for the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, co-chaired the Global Summit to End

</p>
<p>Investigation of Sexual Violence in Conflict: Basic Standards of Best Practice on 
</p>
<p>the Documentation of Sexual Violence as a Crime under International Law is a 
</p>
<p>result of this initiative. A current Trust Fund grantee, Physicians for Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>was instrumental in designing the Protocol.6 
</p>
<p>32. In addition, in June the Secretary-General issued a guidance note on 
</p>
<p>reparations for conflict-related sexual violence that develops policy and operational 
</p>
<p>guidance for United Nations action.7 The note mentions that the Trust Fund has 
</p>
<p>been a key resource for funding reparations for survivors of sexual violence in 
</p>
<p>Sierra Leone.

<p>33. Trust Fund grantee, the Ukrainian Foundation for Public Health responded to 
</p>
<p>the heightened need for services resulting from the escalating conflict i n the 
</p>
<p>Donetsk region, which continued to fuel increased instability and violence in the 
</p>
<p>region. Nearly 300 state and non-governmental organization service providers 
</p>
<p>engaged in training on responding to cases of violence against women, with a 
</p>
<p>special focus on girls and young women living and working on the streets and  
</p>
<p>HIV-positive women and girls. In addition, a protocol drafted by the Ukrainian 
</p>
<p>Foundation for Public Health was approved by members of a multisectoral working 
</p>
<p>group, partner agencies and the Ministry of Social Policy.  
</p>
<p>34. A total of 306 survivors of violence against women &#8212; 117 in Kyiv and 189 in 
</p>
<p>three up-scale cities &#8212; were identified, referred and received assistance. The 
</p>
<p>number of clients receiving programme services rose to 329 and 176 survivors of 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence, including HIV-positive and/or street-involved women and 
</p>
<p>girls, were engaged in the empowerment training programme.  
</p>
<p>35. With support from the Trust Fund, the Women&#8217;s Initiatives for Gender Justice 
</p>
<p>is implementing a project that seeks to address violence against women in conflict, 
</p>
<p>post-conflict and transitional settings in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
</p>
<p>Libya, Sudan and Uganda. The project&#8217;s goal is to advance gender justice in 
</p>
<p>countries under investigation by the International Criminal Court. Working with a 
</p>
<p>wide range of local partners, Women&#8217;s Initiatives for Gender Justice documentation 
</p>
<p>data and advocacy directly contributed to the gathering of evidence that supported 
</p>
<p>the prosecution of sexual and gender-based crimes in nine cases relating to the four 
</p>
<p>project countries. In 2014, the project reached 4,959 women and girls and  
</p>
<p>31,612 secondary beneficiaries across the target countries.  
</p>
<p>36. In Uganda, the Parliament adopted a landmark resolution calling for 
</p>
<p>reparations for war-affected women and other victims of the Lord&#8217;s Resistance 
</p>
<p>Army. The resolution followed years of advocacy by the women &#8217;s movement, 
</p>
<p>including the Women&#8217;s Initiatives for Gender Justice and their partners. The 
</p>
<p>resolution came at a crucial moment and helped to create greater momentum for 
</p>
<p>gender justice. 
</p>
<p>37. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, local partners highlighted continued 
</p>
<p>improvements in documentation, thanks to the Women&#8217;s Initiatives for Gender 
</p>
<p>Justice project. The Women&#8217;s Initiatives for Gender Justice documentation was used 
</p>
<p>to identify witnesses and directly contributed to the inclusion of additional charges 
</p>
<p>of rape and sexual slavery of child soldiers in the International Criminal Court 
</p>
<p>indictment of Bosco Ntaganda. This was the first time that a military leader had 
</p>
<p>been indicted under international law for acts of sexual violence committed against 
</p>
<p>child soldiers within his own militia.  
</p>
<p>38. Almost 774 survivors of gender-based violence who would otherwise not have 
</p>
<p>had access to medical support were referred through the Women&#8217;s Initiatives for 
</p>
<p>Gender Justice-supported Transit House project in North Kivu, the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo. Survivors received an initial medical assessment and 
</p>
<p>psychosocial support; 70 per cent went on to receive specific medical treatment, 
</p>
<p>including surgery for rape-related injuries.

<p><b>  Integrating the private sector into prevention efforts  
</b> 
</p>
<p>39. Globally, 53 per cent of women are employed in vulnerable jobs &#8212; either 
</p>
<p>informal or unpaid &#8212; which can increase the risk of experiencing violence. This 
</p>
<p>problem is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where more than  
</p>
<p>80 per cent of women are in this type of employment.8 In addition, 79 countries still 
</p>
<p>have laws that restrict the types of jobs women can perform.9 A recent publication 
</p>
<p>commissioned by the World Bank asserts that the private sector has been 
</p>
<p>insufficiently involved in efforts to prevent and address violence against women. In 
</p>
<p>order for this situation to change, workplaces need to adopt anti -harassment codes 
</p>
<p>and guidelines to make the workplace a safe space for women and establish 
</p>
<p>alliances with women&#8217;s rights organizations.10 
</p>
<p>40. The Trust Fund invests in programmes that address these challenges and that 
</p>
<p>aim to fully integrate the private sector as a key stakeholder in ending violence 
</p>
<p>against women.  
</p>
<p>41. Trust Fund grantee CARE International in Cambodia helped to create safe 
</p>
<p>workplaces and communities. Building on a successful initiative previously 
</p>
<p>supported by the Trust Fund, the project is working to scale up effective 
</p>
<p>participatory community and workplace interventions in the garment, tourism and 
</p>
<p>hospitality industries to promote safer workplaces. The project continued to work 
</p>
<p>with police, for example, building on its collaboration with the Ministry of the 
</p>
<p>Interior and training police focal points. It focused on initial engagement methods 
</p>
<p>with garment factory workers to create effective policies within factories to reduce 
</p>
<p>sexual harassment and gender-based violence and to ensure that workers can report 
</p>
<p>abuse if it does occur. A curriculum for garment factory workers was developed for 
</p>
<p>specific workplaces by adapting the International Labour Organization publication 
</p>
<p>entitled <i>Equality and non-discrimination at work in Cambodia: Manual</i>. This was 
</p>
<p>piloted with 71 garment factory workers and 87 hospitality workers. The Garment 
</p>
<p>Manufacturers Association in Cambodia agreed to support CARE&#8217;s efforts to end 
</p>
<p>harassment at the workplace.  
</p>
<p>42. Trust Fund grantee the Fair Wear Foundation adopted a holistic approach, 
</p>
<p>including awareness-raising and training, to address harassment and violence 
</p>
<p>against women in export-orientated garment factories in Bangladesh and India. Over 
</p>
<p>3,500 workers in India and Bangladesh received direct training in 24 factories, 
</p>
<p>while another 15,000 workers were trained via peer-to-peer education as part of the 
</p>
<p>preventing workplace violence project. Twenty anti-harassment committees, 
</p>
<p>composed of workers&#8217; representatives, factory management and non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organization representatives, were operational in Bangladesh and India in 2014. The 
</p>
<p>programme also completed supervisors&#8217; training in at least six factories, reaching 
</p>
<p>121 participants. Advanced training for anti-harassment committee members was 
</p>
<p>conducted at nine factories reaching nearly 100 people &#8212; 82 women and 17 men.  
</p>
<p>43. One of the project&#8217;s major achievements was the higher level of reporting of 
</p>
<p>harassment cases in the anti-harassment committees and via a telephone helpline.

<p>There are also signs that the initiative may be changing the way in which women are 
</p>
<p>perceived within the factories. Since taking on the additional responsibility of 
</p>
<p>participating in anti-harassment committees, women have become a more vocal 
</p>
<p>presence on the factory floor. Whereas there were no women in supervisory 
</p>
<p>positions in some of the factories at the beginning of the project, increasingly 
</p>
<p>women have been promoted to supervisory roles.

<p><b> IV. New partnerships in 2014 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>44. During the year, the Trust Fund strategically focused on expanding and 
</p>
<p>diversifying its range of donors to ensure the sustainability, reliability and growth of 
</p>
<p>its financial envelope. By fully harnessing the potential of new partnerships with the 
</p>
<p>corporate sector and with an immediate focus on fashion and the arts, the Trust Fund 
</p>
<p>was able to raise its visibility, extend its outreach and begin to build an individual 
</p>
<p>giving portfolio. In September, in partnership with the Trust Fund, Yuwei Designs, a 
</p>
<p>jewellery company based in the United States of America, launched an exclusive 
</p>
<p>jewellery collection to raise awareness of the strategies pioneered by Trust Fund 
</p>
<p>grantees to end violence against women and girls.  
</p>
<p>45. In November, in partnership with Music for Life International and the  
</p>
<p>UN-Women Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, the Trust Fund hosted a 
</p>
<p>benefit concert in India as part of the Scheherazade Initiative, a global concert 
</p>
<p>project that brings together leaders in the artistic, musical, corporate and diplomatic 
</p>
<p>communities to raise funds for and increase public awareness of violence aga inst 
</p>
<p>women and girls. The Delhi concert featured the Trust Fund grantee Breakthrough 
</p>
<p>and included distinguished artists from the New York Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.  
</p>
<p>46. On 25 November, the Trust Fund launched a partnership with Soko, an ethical 
</p>
<p>fashion brand. This partnership will provide employment and training for 
</p>
<p>marginalized women artisans in Kenya to create a unique pair of bracelets. Every 
</p>
<p>bracelet sold will help empower an underprivileged artisan community 
</p>
<p>economically and, at the same time, support Trust Fund programmes to prevent and 
</p>
<p>respond to violence against women around the world. We Are {The Collective}, a 
</p>
<p>communications and marketing partnership based in London, conceptualized and 
</p>
<p>developed the global microsite for the Soko bracelet campaign and galvanized 
</p>
<p>support from the fashion sector in the United Kingdom.  
</p>
<p>47. The Trust Fund also launched a partnership with FASH UNITED, a California -
</p>
<p>based non-governmental organization, to promote the Trust Fund &#8217;s initiatives 
</p>
<p>through the fashion and entertainment sectors.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>48. In 2014, the Trust Fund received 2,098 applications from 147 countries. Most 
</p>
<p>applications were from civil society organizations and the total funding requested 
</p>
<p>was more than $788 million. The Trust Fund awarded $8.3 million in 25 grants 
</p>
<p>covering 23 countries and territories. Twenty-two civil society organizations, two 
</p>
<p>Governments and the United Nations country team in Fiji received grants that all 
</p>
<p>together are expected to reach over 730,000 primary beneficiaries by the end of 
</p>
<p>2018. In terms of grant value, 28 per cent of the funds allocated went to </p>

</p>
<p>America and the Caribbean; 11 per cent to programmes in the Arab States and North 
</p>
<p>Africa; and 9 per cent to cross-regional programmes. Grants amounting to some  
</p>
<p>8 per cent of the total ($700,000) were awarded to eight small organizations (those 
</p>
<p>requesting less than $100,000) as part of the Trust Fund&#8217;s new strategy to increase 
</p>
<p>funding to smaller grass-roots organizations. 
</p>
<p>49. Six new Trust Fund-supported programmes in the Gambia, Togo, the State of 
</p>
<p>Palestine, Nepal, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan will address harmful practices. These 
</p>
<p>covered a range of issues from legal initiatives to ban female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation/cutting in the Gambia to community-based initiatives to end widowhood 
</p>
<p>rituals in Togo that put women at increased risk of HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p>50. New grantee programmes will also provide practical support to women and 
</p>
<p>girls experiencing violence. For example, in Tajikistan, the civil society 
</p>
<p>organization Najoti Kudakon will use community-based interventions to improve 
</p>
<p>access to services for rural women living in mountainous areas. The programme will 
</p>
<p>establish women&#8217;s support groups in underserved communities and enhance the only 
</p>
<p>existing safe house offering comprehensive services in the region.  
</p>
<p>51. Seven new grantees in Albania, Colombia, Egypt, Guatemala, Serbia, Thailand 
</p>
<p>and Zimbabwe will work to address and prevent violence against women who face 
</p>
<p>discrimination and exclusion. For example, in Colombia, the Organizaci&#243;n Nacional 
</p>
<p>de Ind&#237;genas de Colombia (Indigenous Peoples National Organization) will 
</p>
<p>document and research violence against indigenous women, raise awareness among 
</p>
<p>the community and authorities, train indigenous women as rights advocates and 
</p>
<p>provide psychocultural, social, legal and psychological support to indigenous 
</p>
<p>women survivors of violence and their families.  
</p>
<p>52. Two new programmes will address violence against lesbian, bisexual and 
</p>
<p>transgender women. For example, in Thailand, the Rainbow Sky Association of 
</p>
<p>Thailand will implement a proven Community Life Competence model to empower 
</p>
<p>communities in four provinces to address issues of human rights, violence, stigma 
</p>
<p>and discrimination against lesbian and transgender women.  
</p>
<p>53. Five new programmes will bolster the implementation of laws and policies to 
</p>
<p>address violence against women. Among them is the grantee in El Salvador, the 
</p>
<p>Asamblea de Cooperaci&#243;n por la Paz (Cooperation for Peace Assembly), which will 
</p>
<p>work to improve the coordination and institutional response of relevant stakeholders 
</p>
<p>at the national and municipal levels and help local women&#8217;s and youth organizations 
</p>
<p>to develop their oversight and advocacy skills. The intervention will also seek to 
</p>
<p>strengthen existing national data-collection mechanisms, improve police response 
</p>
<p>and increase awareness of violence against women in schools and communities.  
</p>
<p>54. The Trust Fund will continue to support programmes in conflict, post -conflict 
</p>
<p>and transitional settings. Among the new grantees focusing on this issue is the Story 
</p>
<p>Kitchen, a women&#8217;s organization in Nepal, which will work towards ensuring access 
</p>
<p>to justice for women survivors of violence in conflict. In an innovative approach, 
</p>
<p>the programme will pair women conflict survivors with women human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders to reach more survivors through local radio networks, as part of efforts to 
</p>
<p>break the culture of silence around conflict-related violence against women. </p>

</p>
<p>approaches for addressing violence against women. In Liberia, for example, the 
</p>
<p>Episcopal Relief and Development, a faith-based organization, will catalyse 
</p>
<p>Christian, interfaith and Muslim organizations to become agents of change, create 
</p>
<p>awareness of violence against women and girls in their communities and transform 
</p>
<p>beliefs and attitudes that legitimize and condone violence.  
</p>
<p>56. New grantees will also strengthen the capacities of journalists and the media to 
</p>
<p>raise awareness of the scale of violence against women and girls. In the State of 
</p>
<p>Palestine, the Community Media Centre will shed light on the pervasiveness of 
</p>
<p>violence against women in Gaza and advocate for the creation of policies and 
</p>
<p>procedures to protect women from violence.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>57. The year 2015 is a significant one for the Trust Fund and for global initiatives 
</p>
<p>to prevent and end violence against women and girls. Almost 20 years after its 
</p>
<p>creation, the Trust Fund will respond to the evolving context provided by the  
</p>
<p>post-2015 development agenda in setting a new course for the coming years that is 
</p>
<p>true to its founding vision and agreed commitments. As one of the structural causes

<p>of gender inequality, violence against women and girls is interrelated with all 
</p>
<p>critical areas that are holding women and girls back &#8212; in the public or private 
</p>
<p>sphere &#8212; and therefore must be addressed as such. To that end the Trust Fund will 
</p>
<p>centre its efforts within this framework of intersectionality and the existing 
</p>
<p>obligations of States under international and national law and focus on 
</p>
<p>implementation at the national and local level. 
</p>
<p>58. The Trust Fund&#8217;s strategy for 2015-2020 will focus on three core areas of 
</p>
<p>work. Grant giving remains key and the Trust Fund will work to increase its grant 
</p>
<p>giving portfolio in 2015 to $18 million, specifically targeting giving by the private 
</p>
<p>sector and individual giving, as well as voluntary contributions by Member States.  
</p>
<p>59. The Trust Fund will aim to make an important contribution to evidence -based 
</p>
<p>programming on violence against women and girls, by developing a knowledge 
</p>
<p>management infrastructure that enables the unique body of knowledge and 
</p>
<p>experience built up by Trust Fund grantees to be shared and to grow.  
</p>
<p>60. The Trust Fund will also focus on reversing the worldwide chronic 
</p>
<p>underfunding of initiatives to address violence against women and girls by 
</p>
<p>providing leadership in global advocacy and calling for a significant increase in 
</p>
<p>global giving to this issue. The communications vehicle for this call will be the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Trust Fund&#8217;s global resource mobilization campaign which will be 
</p>
<p>launched in March at the fifty-ninth session of the Commission on the Status of 
</p>
<p>Women.
