<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The present document is the sixth and last annual report submitted to the Human 
Rights Council and its predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights, by the current 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms while countering terrorism. 
</p>
<p> In chapter II of the report, the Special Rapporteur lists his key activities from 1 
August to 10 December 2010. In the main report, contained in chapter III, he presents a 
compilation of best practice in countering terrorism. The compilation is the outcome of an 
analysis undertaken by the Special Rapporteur on the basis of his work conducted over 
almost six years and involving various forms of interaction with multiple stakeholders. In 
particular, he has taken into account the written submissions received from Governments 
by 30 November 2010. The full submissions are reproduced in an addendum 
(A/HRC/16/51/Add.4). 
</p>
<p> The outcome of the process is the identification of 10 areas of best practice. A best 
practice is distilled from existing and emerging practices in a broad range of States 
throughout the world. The compilation also draws upon international treaties, resolutions 
adopted by international organizations and the jurisprudence of international and regional 
courts. 
</p>
<p> The substance of the selected 10 areas of best practice is explained in the 
commentary, presented separately for each practice.  
</p>
<p> The concept of &#8220;best practice&#8221; refers to legal and institutional frameworks that serve 
to promote and protect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in all 
aspects of counter-terrorism. Best practice refers not only to what is required by 
</p>

<p>international law, including human rights law, but also includes principles beyond these 
legally binding obligations. The identification of a best practice is based on three criteria: 
(a) a credible claim that the practice is an existing or emerging practice, and/or one that is 
required by, or has been recommended by or within, international organizations, 
international treaties or the jurisprudence of international, regional or domestic courts; (b) 
the practice relates to and promotes the effective combating of terrorism; and (c) the 
practice complies with human rights and/or promotes the enjoyment of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms.  
</p>
<p> The aim of the compilation is to identify concrete legal issues and, based on existing 
and advocated approaches, including recognition of their positive and negative aspects, 
from this propose 10 concrete models for wider adoption and implementation by Member 
States.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to Council 
resolution 15/15. In the report, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism lists his activities from 
1 August to 10 December 2010 and focuses thematically on 10 areas of best practice in 
countering terrorism.  
</p>
<p>2. With regard to upcoming country missions, the Special Rapporteur awaits dates or 
invitations for visits to Algeria, Chile, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, the Russian 
Federation and Thailand, and for a follow-up visit to Egypt. The Special Rapporteur has 
sent visit requests also to Burkina Faso and Nigeria, both partnering countries for the 
Integrated Assistance for Countering Terrorism  initiative of the Counter-terrorism 
Implementation Task Force. Such fact-finding missions would also allow the Special 
Rapporteur to contribute to the identification of gaps in the implementation of pillar IV of 
the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.1 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>3. On 9 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur participated in the 2010 review of the 
Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy at the International Peace Institute in New York, where 
he was a panellist in a discussion organized by the Working Group on Protecting Human 
Rights while Countering Terrorism of the Counter-terrorism Implementation Task Force. 
</p>
<p>4. From 10 to 13 September, the Special Rapporteur conducted on-site consultations on 
the law and practice of Iceland in countering terrorism. He met with representatives of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice and the national police, as well as with 
two judges of the Reykjavik District Court. The Special Rapporteur also visited the 
country&#8217;s largest prison, Litla-Hraun, and conducted confidential interviews with Icelandic 
and foreign prisoners. 
</p>
<p>5. On 16 and 17 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur convened the fifth expert 
panel meeting in support of his mandate at the European University Institute in Florence, 
Italy, to discuss thematic issues related to his mandate. The event was co-funded by the 
&#197;bo Akademi University Institute for Human Rights through its project to support the 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>6. From 25 to 28 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur was in New York to present his 
report (A/65/258) to the Third Committee of the General Assembly. The report focused on 
the question of compliance with human rights by the United Nations when countering 
terrorism. The Special Rapporteur had formal meetings with the Counter-Terrorism 
Committee and the Al Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council. He 
met with the Deputy Permanent Representative of Mexico to the United Nations, the 
Deputy Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate,  
representatives of the Centre on Global Counterterrorism Cooperation and the Assistant 
Director-General for Communication and Information of the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization. He attended a reception at the General Consulate of 
Finland and participated in a panel discussion on the Security Council and the rule of law, 
co-organized by the Permanent Mission of Austria to the United Nations and the Rule of

<p>Law Coordination and Resource Group. He also met with a number of non-governmental 
organizations and held a press conference. 
</p>
<p>7. On 27 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur attended the trial against Ahmed 
Khalfan Ghailani before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York relating to the terrorist attacks against the embassies of the United States of America 
in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam of 7 August 1998. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Ten areas of best practice in countering terrorism</b>2<b> 
</b></p>
<p>8. In the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, reaffirmed most recently 
by the General Assembly<b> </b>in its resolution 64/297, the States Members of the United 
Nations recognize that terrorist acts are aimed at the destruction of human rights, 
fundamental freedoms and democracy.3 Measures to combat terrorism may also prejudice 
the enjoyment of &#8211; or may violate &#8211; human rights and the rule of law. Recognizing that 
compliance with human rights is necessary to address the long-term conditions conducive 
to the spread of terrorism, and that effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection 
of human rights are complementary and mutually reinforcing goals, the Special Rapporteur 
identifies 10 areas of best practice in countering terrorism. The compilation is the outcome 
of analysis undertaken by the Special Rapporteur on the basis of his work during almost six 
years and involving various forms of interaction with multiple stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>9. The present document is the sixth and last annual report submitted to the Human 
Rights Council and its predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights, by the current 
Special Rapporteur. When establishing and then extending the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism, the Commission and the Council requested the Special 
Rapporteur to identify, exchange and promote best practices on measures to counter 
terrorism that respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.4 In his thematic and 
country-specific reports, the Special Rapporteur has accordingly sought to identify elements 
of best practice where appropriate.5 Drawing on his experience of almost six years, and 
including reference to existing and emerging practices in a broad range of States throughout 
the world, and upon international treaties, resolutions of international organizations and the 
jurisprudence of international and regional courts, the Special Rapporteur takes this 
opportunity to identify and promote 10 areas of best practice in countering terrorism. 
</p>
<p>10. In this context, &#8220;best practice&#8221; refers to legal and institutional frameworks that serve 
to promote and protect human rights and the rule of law in all aspects of counter-terrorism. 
Best practice refers not only to what is required by international law, including human 
rights law, but also includes principles that go beyond these legally binding obligations. 
The identification of best practice is based upon three criteria: (a) a credible claim that the 
practice is an existing or emerging practice, and/or one that is required by, or has been 
recommended by or within, international organizations, international treaties or the 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>members of his informal panel of experts for their assistance in the preparation of the present 
compilation.

(S/PRST/2010/19), second paragraph.

resolution 6/28, para. 2 (<i>d</i>). 
</p>
<p> 5 See, for example, A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, para. 43, A/63/233, para. 45, A/HRC/10/3, and A/HRC/13/37, 
paras. 8-57. </p>


<p>jurisprudence of international, regional or domestic courts; (b) the practice relates to and 
promotes the effective combating of terrorism; and (c) the practice complies with human 
rights and/or promotes the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>11. The compilation includes examples of elements of best practice from numerous 
national laws and institutional models. It is, however, important to note that the citation of 
specific provisions from national laws or institutional models does not imply a general 
endorsement of these laws and institutions as best practice in protecting human rights in the 
context of counter-terrorism. The aim of the compilation is to identify concrete legal issues 
and &#8211; on the basis of existing and advocated approaches, including recognition of their 
positive and negative aspects &#8211; from this propose 10 concrete models for wider adoption 
and implementation by Member States. The compilation is non-exhaustive in the sense that 
there are many other issues where compliance with human rights could be addressed and a 
best practice identified. In advocating the 10 selected best practices in the report, the 
Special Rapporteur is not suggesting that all Member States should take a uniform 
approach. Rather, he believes that the 10 best practices should be adopted and implemented 
in a form that takes into account the fundamental principles of each State&#8217;s legal system.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Consistency of counter-terrorism law with human rights, humanitarian 
law and refugee law 
</b></p>
<p>12. Together with the responsibility of States to protect those within their jurisdiction 
from acts of terrorism, States have an obligation to comply with international law, including 
human rights law, refugee law and humanitarian law.6 These legal obligations stem from 
customary international law, applicable to all States,7 and international treaties, applicable 
to States parties.8 Compliance with all human rights9 while countering terrorism represents 
a best practice because not only is this a legal obligation of States, but it is also an 
indispensible part of a successful medium- and long-term strategy to combat terrorism. The 
Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy therefore identifies respect for human rights for all and 
the rule of law as one of its four pillars and as the fundamental basis of the fight against 
terrorism (thus applicable to all aspects of the Strategy).10 In pillar I, the Strategy also 
recognizes that compliance with human rights is necessary in order to address the long-term 
conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, which include lack of rule of law and 
violations of human rights, ethnic, national and religious discrimination, political exclusion, 
socio-economic marginalization and lack of good governance.11 While making it clear that 
none of these conditions can excuse or justify terrorism, the Strategy represents a clear 
affirmation by all States Members of the United Nations that effective counter-terrorism 
measures and the protection of human rights are not conflicting, but rather complementary

dialogue and broadening understanding among civilisations &#8220;in an effort to prevent the indiscriminate

and extremism, and will contribute to strengthening the international fight against terrorism...&#8221;. </p>

<p>and mutually reinforcing goals.12 This also reflects the flexibility of human rights law. 
Through the careful application of human rights law it is possible to respond effectively to 
the challenges involved in the countering of terrorism while  complying with human 
rights.13 There is no need in this process for a balancing between human rights and security, 
as the proper balance can and must be found within human rights law itself. Law is the 
balance, not a weight to be measured. 
</p>
<p>13. To achieve complementarity and mutual reinforcement, the Special Rapporteur 
identifies 10 areas of best practice applicable to Member States&#8217; legislative framework to 
combat terrorism. The first concerns consistency between counter-terrorism law &#8211; whether 
as separate pieces of legislation or as part of &#8220;ordinary&#8221; laws, such as the inclusion of 
terrorism offences within the criminal code of a country &#8211; and human rights and refugee 
law, as well as, when applicable, humanitarian law. Consistency is essential for both 
existing and future laws. In the case of proposed counter-terrorism law, many States include 
mechanisms for identifying whether proposed legislation, including on counter-terrorism, 
complies with human rights law.14 Because of the potentially profound implications of 
counter-terrorism legislation, it is also important that Governments seek to ensure the 
broadest possible political and popular support for counter-terrorism laws through an open 
and transparent process.15 In the event of incompatibility of extant counter-terrorism 
legislation with human rights law, including international human rights, the existence of 
mechanisms empowering the judiciary to strike down inconsistent legislation or to adopt an 
interpretation of the legislation that is consistent with human rights is essential.16 The 
effectiveness of such mechanisms will rely on the existence and maintenance of a 
competent, independent, impartial and transparent judiciary.17 
</p>
<p>14. To these ends, the Special Rapporteur formulates the template provisions below 
concerning the enactment, amendment and interpretation of counter-terrorism laws: 
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 1. Model provisions on consistency of counter-terrorism law with human 
rights and refugee law, and humanitarian law 
</b></p>

<p> 1. Proposals for new legislation or amendments to existing laws shall include a 
written statement bringing to the attention of the Legislature any provision in the proposal 
that appears to be inconsistent with the purposes and provisions of norms of international 
human rights and refugee law that are binding upon the State. 
</p>
<p> 2. The Legislature shall, through a specialized body or otherwise, review and 
ensure that any law approved by it conforms to the norms of international human rights and 
refugee law that are binding upon the State. 
</p>
<p> 3. The judiciary shall be entrusted with ensuring that laws do not breach norms 
of international human rights and refugee law that are binding upon the State. In 
discharging this duty, the courts shall apply the techniques available to them under the 
Constitution, such as: 
</p>
<p> (a) Adopting an interpretation of the law that is consistent with the 
purposes and provisions of norms of international human rights and refugee law that 
are binding upon the State; 
</p>
<p> (b) Declaring that part of the law is without legal effect; 
</p>
<p> (c) Declaring that the inconsistent law is to be of no force or effect, either 
with immediate effect or after a period of time that allows the Government to take 
remedial steps. 
</p>
<p> 4. If the State is involved, as a party, in an ongoing armed conflict, the above 
provisions shall apply also to securing compliance with principles and provisions of 
international humanitarian law, without prejudice to the obligation to comply with 
international human rights and refugee law. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Consistency of counter-terrorism practice with human rights, 
humanitarian law and refugee law 
</b></p>
<p>15. Besides ensuring that counter-terrorism law is consistent with human rights, the 
conduct of agencies involved in the countering of terrorism must be in compliance with 
human rights and refugee law, and applicable principles and provisions of international 
humanitarian law. Where the law relating to terrorism confers discretionary powers upon 
public agencies, adequate safeguards, including judicial review, must exist for the purpose 
of ensuring that discretionary powers are not exercised arbitrarily or unreasonably.18 
Checks might also be implemented through internal and external supervision of agencies 
and public servants, as well as through the adoption and comprehensive implementation of 
codes of conduct.19 The counter-terrorism laws of some States expressly recognize the 
application of the principle of legality, the rule of law and human rights to the countering of 
terrorism, which should be seen as an essential check on the implementation in practice of 
the obligation to comply with human rights while countering terrorism.20 While the

on Human Rights Compliance, op.cit., condition 3.3; and questionnaire responses submitted by by 
Australia, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Canada, Finland, Greece, Monaco, Norway and 
Switzerland.

do not expressly mention these principles in the context of countering terrorism, but provide for more

</b></p>
<p>privatization of counter-terrorist functions, such as security measures at checkpoints, should 
be avoided, such privatization, where it occurs, should include the same level of 
accountability as for conduct by State agents.21  
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur therefore formulates the template provision below 
concerning the consistency of State and private counter-terrorist conduct with human rights 
law: 
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 2. Model provision on consistency of counter-terrorism practices with human 
rights and refugee law, and humanitarian law  
</b></p>
<p> In the application and exercise of all functions under the law relating to terrorism, it 
is unlawful for any person to act in any way that is incompatible with the purposes and 
provisions of international human rights and refugee law that are binding upon the State. In 
this regard: 
</p>
<p> 1. The exercise of functions and powers shall be based on clear provisions of 
law that exhaustively enumerate the powers in question. 
</p>
<p> 2. The exercise of such functions and powers may never violate peremptory or 
non-derogable norms of international law, nor impair the essence of any human right. 
</p>
<p> 3. Where the exercise of functions and powers involves a restriction upon a 
human right that is capable of limitation, any such restriction should be to the least intrusive 
means possible and shall: 
</p>
<p> (a) Be necessary in a democratic society to pursue a defined legitimate 
aim, as permitted by international law; and 
</p>
<p> (b) Be proportionate to the benefit obtained in achieving the legitimate 
aim in question. 
</p>
<p> 4. If the State is involved, as a party, in an ongoing armed conflict, the above 
provisions shall apply also to securing compliance with principles and provisions of 
international humanitarian law, without prejudice to the obligation to comply with 
international human rights and refugee law. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Normal operation and regular review of counter-terrorism law and 
practice 
</b></p>
<p>17. To the greatest extent possible, counter-terrorism law and practice must be 
consistent with the principle of normalcy. Counter-terrorism measures should, to the 
broadest possible extent, be entrusted to civilian authorities whose functions relate to 
combating crime and whose performance of counter-terrorism functions is pursuant to 
ordinary powers.22 This also applies to the prosecution and trial of terrorist offences, which

Providers, signed 9 November 2010. 
</p>
<p> 22 Questionnaire responses submitted by Australia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bolivia (Plurinational State 
 </p>


<p>must generally take place before ordinary courts.23 If compelling reasons require the 
establishment for certain authorities of specific powers necessary to combat terrorism, 
(a) such powers should be contained in stand-alone legislation capable of being recognized 
as a unique exception to customary legal constraint;24 (b) the provisions under which such 
powers are established should be subject to sunset clauses and regular review (see 
paragraphs 19 and 20 below); and (c) the use of such powers for any purpose other than the 
combating of terrorism, as properly defined pursuant to practice 7 below, must be 
prohibited.25 
</p>
<p>18. International and regional human rights instruments allow for the temporary 
derogation from the full application of certain rights and freedoms in a very limited set of 
exceptional circumstances.26 This possibility is restricted to those human rights that are 
capable of derogation, and where such measures are officially proclaimed and specified.27 
Derogating measures (a) are limited to truly exceptional situations where a genuine threat to 
the life of the nation exists, which in certain cases may be caused by terrorism;28 (b) must 
be strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, so as to be necessary and 
proportionate, and not capable of being addressed by non-derogating means (including 
measures that impose limitations upon rights and freedoms pursuant to rights-specific treaty 
provisions that fall short of derogation);29 (c) are consistent with other international 
obligations, including refugee law, international humanitarian law and customary 
international law on human rights;30 and (d) do not involve discrimination solely on the 
ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin.31 Restoration of a state of 
normalcy, where full respect for the provisions of human rights treaties is again secured, 
must be the predominant objective of States that have adopted derogating measures.32

<p>(a) annual governmental review of and reporting on the exercise of powers under counter-
terrorism laws; (b) annual independent review of the overall operation of counter-terrorism 
laws; and (c) periodic parliamentary review. To be effective, it is important that 
independent review mechanisms be based on statutory terms of appointment, linked to the 
work of relevant parliamentary committees and accompanied by adequate resourcing.34 
Review mechanisms should enable public consultation and should be accompanied by 
publicly available reports. 
</p>
<p>20. Regular review and the use of sunset clauses are best practices helping to ensure that 
special powers relating to the countering of terrorism are effective and continue to be 
required, and to help avoid the &#8220;normalization&#8221; or de facto permanent existence of 
extraordinary measures.35 Periodic parliamentary review and sunset clauses also enable the 
Legislature to consider whether the exercise of powers under counter-terrorism laws has 
been proportionate and thus whether, if they continue, further constraints on the exercise of 
such powers should be introduced, and/or whether the overall operation of counter-
terrorism laws calls for their modification or discontinuance. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur accordingly formulates the template provisions below as 
areas of best practice in the fight against terrorism: 
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 3. Model provisions on the principles of normalcy and specificity  
</b></p>
<p> 1. To the broadest possible extent, measures against terrorism shall be taken by 
the civilian authorities entrusted with the functions related to the combating of crime, and in 
the exercise of their ordinary powers. 
</p>
<p> 2. Unless a state of emergency has been officially declared because terrorism 
genuinely threatens the life of the nation and requires the adoption of measures that cannot 
be undertaken through restrictions already permitted under international human rights law, 
terrorism does not trigger emergency powers. 
</p>
<p> 3. Where the law includes particular provisions that, for a compelling reason, 
are considered necessary in combating terrorism and entrust certain authorities with specific 
powers for that reason, the use of such powers for any purpose other than the combating of 
terrorism, as properly defined pursuant to practice 7, is prohibited. 
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 4. Model provisions on the review of the operation of counter-terrorism law 
and practice 
</b></p>
<p> 1.  Where specific counter-terrorism powers have been created pursuant to 
practice 3 (3), they shall lapse 12 months after their entry into force, unless the Legislature 
reviews and renews them before that date.  
</p>
<p> 2. The Executive shall appoint a person or body to act as independent reviewer 
of the application and operation of the law relating to terrorism. The person so appointed 
shall, at least every 12 months, carry out a review of the operation of the law relating to 
terrorism and report the findings of such review to the Executive and the Legislature. The 
report shall contain an opinion on: 
</p>

Terrorism Act 2000, sect. 126, and Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, sect. 14(3). See also 
questionnaire responses submitted by Belgium, Finland, Georgia, Greece, Lithuania, Malaysia, 
Mauritius, Norway, Poland, Portugal and the Republic of Moldova.

<p> (a) The implications of any proposed or recent amendments or additions 
to the law relating to terrorism, including an opinion on whether these are 
compatible with international human rights and refugee law that is binding upon the 
State, as well as, when applicable, principles and provisions of international 
humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> (b) Whether the application in practice of the law relating to terrorism, 
during the period of review, has been compatible with international human rights 
and refugee law that is binding upon the State, as well as, when applicable, 
principles and provisions of international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Effective remedies for violations of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>22. It is vital that those whose rights have been violated by counter-terrorism law and 
practice have free access to seek effective remedies, including in respect of privatized 
counter-terrorist functions.36 It is widely acknowledged that any individual who believes 
that his or her rights have been infringed must be able to seek redress, and should be able to 
do so by bringing a complaint to a court or oversight institution, such as an ombudsman, 
human rights commission or national human rights institution.37 Remedial provisions 
should be framed in sufficiently broad terms so as to enable effective remedies to be 
provided according to the requirements of each particular case, including, for example, 
release from arbitrary detention, compensation and the exclusion of evidence obtained in 
violation of human rights. To be effective, remedies should be tailored to ensure that they 
are both appropriate and just. Although a single remedy might not entirely satisfy this, the 
aggregate of several remedies may do so.38 
</p>
<p>23. As a minimum safeguard for the provision of effective remedies, the Special 
Rapporteur formulates the template provision below as a best practice in the fight against 
terrorism:<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Practice 5. Model remedies provision  
</b></p>
<p> Any person whose human rights have been violated in the exercise of counter-
terrorism powers or the application of counter-terrorism law has a right to a speedy, 
effective and enforceable remedy. Courts shall have the ultimate responsibility to ensure 
that this right is effective. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Victims of terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>24. Addressing the rights of the victims of terrorism represents a best practice not just 
because it assists the victims of terrorism to rebuild their lives, but can also help to reduce 
tensions in society that might themselves result in conditions conducive to recruitment to 
terrorism. States are recognizing the need for victims of terrorism to be provided with legal 
status and with protection of their human rights at all times, including their rights to health,

<p>legal assistance, justice, truth and adequate, effective and prompt reparation.39 Some 
countries allow for the proceeds of sale of terrorist property forfeited to the State to be used 
to compensate victims of terrorism.40 Supporting the victims of terrorism who have suffered 
serious violations of their basic rights includes the provision of material, legal and 
psychological assistance.41 Bringing the perpetrators of terrorist acts to justice is also vitally 
important.42 With the aim of building bridges between adversely affected groups, 
compensation to victims of counter-terrorism measures, as a potential remedy under 
practice 5, should be provided equally and through the same institutions and programmes as 
compensation to victims of terrorism. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur formulates the template provisions below as a best practice 
in the fight against terrorism: 
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 6. Model provisions on reparations and assistance to victims 
</b></p>
<p> 1. Damage to natural or legal persons and their property resulting from an act of 
terrorism or acts committed in the name of countering terrorism shall be compensated 
through funds from the State budget, in accordance with international human rights law. 
</p>
<p> 2. Natural persons who have suffered physical or other damage or who have 
suffered violations of their human rights as a result of an act of terrorism or acts committed 
in the name of countering terrorism shall be provided with additional legal, medical, 
psychological and other assistance required for their social rehabilitation through funds 
from the State budget. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Definition of terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>26. Counter-terrorism laws, policies and practices must be limited to the countering of 
terrorism, as properly defined. The approach taken by most States is to link terrorist 
offences to a stand-alone definition of &#8220;terrorism&#8221;, a &#8220;terrorist act&#8221;, &#8220;terrorist activity&#8221; or 
similar terms. Such definitions are very often also linked to the listing of proscribed 
organizations (either in conjunction with, or as a supplement to, the Consolidated List of 
the United Nations); powers of arrest, questioning and investigation; alterations in the rules 
concerning detention and trial; and administrative measures, such as deportation procedures 
and the forfeiture of property. The adoption of overly broad definitions of terrorism 
therefore carries the potential for deliberate misuse of the term &#8211; including as a response to 
claims and social movements of indigenous peoples &#8211; as well as unintended human rights 
</p>
<p>  
 39 See General Assembly resolutions 60/288, annex, pillar I, and 64/168, para. 6 (<i>n</i>); and the statement 
</p>
<p>by the President of the Security Council of 27 September 2010 (S/PRST/2010/19), tenth paragraph, 
para. 10. Some States have adopted specific provisions on the rights of victims of terrorism: 
Azerbaijan, Law on the Struggle against Terrorism 1999 (as amended in 2005), art. 13; Georgia, Law 
on Combating Terrorism 2007, art. 15. See also the questionnaire responses submitted by Colombia, 
Ethiopia, Greece, Mexico, Morocco, the Republic of Moldova and Spain. Other States rely on more 
generally applicable provisions concerning victims of crime: see questionnaire responses submitted 
by Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, Finland, Hungary, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, 
Portugal, Qatar, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and 
the United Kingdom.

<p>abuses.43 Failure to restrict counter-terrorism laws and implementing measures to the 
countering of conduct which is truly terrorist in nature also pose the risk that, where such 
laws and measures restrict the enjoyment of rights and freedoms, they will offend the 
principles of necessity and proportionality that govern the permissibility of any restriction 
on human rights.44 
</p>
<p>27. In the absence of a universally agreed upon, comprehensive and concise definition 
of terrorism, counter-terrorism laws and policies must be limited to the countering of 
offences that correspond to the characteristics of conduct to be suppressed in the fight 
against international terrorism, as identified by the in Security Council in its resolution 
1566 (2004), paragraph 3.45 While the international community is concerned with 
international terrorism, individual States affected by purely domestic forms of terrorism 
may also legitimately include in their terrorism definitions conduct that corresponds to all 
elements of a serious crime as defined by the national law, when combined with the other 
cumulative characteristics of resolution 1566 (2004).46 Properly defined, &#8220;terrorism&#8221; and 
associated offences are also accessible, formulated with precision, non-discriminatory and 
non-retroactive.47 Besides the characteristics identified in resolution 1566 (2004), 
definitions of terrorism often also refer to the motivation of the actors to advance a 
political, religious or ideological cause.48 While acts of terrorism are under no 
circumstances justifiable,49 and although this is not a conceptual requirement of a definition 
of terrorism, reference to these motivations can assist in further narrowing the scope of 
application of the definition of terrorism. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur takes the view that a definition of terrorism that goes 
beyond the following would be problematic from a human rights perspective, and therefore 
formulates the definition of terrorism below as a best practice in the fight against terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 7. Model definition of terrorism  
</b></p>
<p> Terrorism means an action or attempted action where: 
</p>
<p> 1. The action: 
</p>
<p> (a) Constituted the intentional taking of hostages; or 
</p>
<p> (b) Is intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to one or more 
members of the general population or segments of it; or 
</p>
<p> (c) Involved lethal or serious physical violence against one or more 
members of the general population or segments of it;

</p>
<p>Assembly resolution 49/60), para. 1; and Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001), para. 3 (<i>g</i>), and 
1566 (2004), para. 3.<b> </b></p>


<p>- <b>15 
</b></p>
<p> 2. The action is done or attempted with the intention of: 
</p>
<p> (a) Provoking a state of terror in the general public or a segment of it; or 
</p>
<p> (b) Compelling a Government or international organization to do or 
abstain from doing something; 
</p>
<p> and 
</p>
<p> (3) The action corresponds to: 
</p>
<p> (a) The definition of a serious offence in national law, enacted for the 
purpose of complying with international conventions and protocols relating to 
terrorism or with resolutions of the Security Council relating to terrorism; or  
</p>
<p> (b) All elements of a serious crime defined by national law. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Offense of incitement to terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Security Council called for the prohibition of incitement to terrorism in its 
resolution 1624 (2005) paragraph 1 (<i>a</i>). Some States have taken the view that this does not 
require the establishment of a separate offence of incitement to terrorism, because 
incitement is in some countries a party offence and, as such, the incitement to any offence, 
including terrorism offences, already amounts to an offence. There can be practical 
difficulties with this approach;50 the Special Rapporteur notes that article 5 of the Council 
of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism requires States parties to criminalize 
the public provocation to commit acts of terrorism as a specific offence. This is consistent 
with a proactive approach to the countering of terrorist acts and the prevention of 
radicalization.51 It also allows States to ensure that terrorist offences are punishable by 
custodial sentences heavier than those imposable under national law for similar offences 
committed without a terrorist intent (that is, offences not undertaken for the purpose of 
provoking a state of terror or of compelling a Government or international organization to 
do or abstain from doing something).52 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur has previously commended as a best practice the definition 
of incitement to terrorism in article 5 of the Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism.53 
This definition forms the basis of the model offence in practice 8 below; however, in 
reaction to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Leroy v France</i>, and 
noting that article 12(1) of the Convention requires that the implementation of article 5 
respect human rights obligations, particularly the right to freedom of expression, the 
Special Rapporteur has introduced a slight modification to that definition to refer to conduct 
that causes an objective danger of a terrorist offence being committed whether or not 
&#8220;expressly&#8221; advocating a terrorist offence (rather than the Convention reference to 
&#8220;directly&#8221; advocating such an offence).54 This may cover the situation of using coded

<p>language, but does not reduce the requirement to prove both a subjective intention to incite 
as well as an objective danger that a terrorist act will be committed. 
</p>
<p>31. Thus, in the implementation of article 5 of the Convention on the Prevention of 
Terrorism, the offence of incitement to terrorism (a) must be limited to the incitement to 
conduct that is truly terrorist in nature, as properly defined pursuant to practice 7 above; (b) 
must restrict the freedom of expression no more than is necessary for the protection of 
national security, public order and safety or public health or morals;55 (c) must be 
prescribed by law in precise language, including by avoiding reference to vague terms such 
as &#8220;glorifying&#8221; or &#8220;promoting&#8221; terrorism;56 (d) must include an actual (objective) risk that 
the act incited will be committed;57 (e) should expressly refer to two elements of intent, 
namely intent to communicate a message and intent that this message incite the commission 
of a terrorist act;58 and (f) should preserve the application of legal defences or principles 
leading to the exclusion of criminal liability by referring to &#8220;unlawful&#8221; incitement to 
terrorism.59 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur formulates the model offence of incitement to terrorism 
below as a best practice in the fight against terrorism: 
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 8. Model offence of incitement to terrorism  
</b></p>
<p> It is an offence to intentionally and unlawfully distribute or otherwise make 
available a message to the public with the intent to incite the commission of a terrorist 
offence, where such conduct, whether or not expressly advocating terrorist offences, causes 
a danger that one or more such offences may be committed. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Listing of terrorist entities 
</b></p>
<p>33. States take different approaches to the designation of, and criminalization of conduct 
linked to, terrorist groups. Many countries include a mechanism by which entities that are 
listed in the Consolidated List of the United Nations are also automatically listed by the 
domestic law of the country.60 The Special Rapporteur has on several occasions expressed 
the view that, as long as there is no independent review of listings at the level of the United 
Nations, there must be access to domestic judicial review of any domestic implementing 
measures pertaining to persons on the Consolidated List.61 Even with the enhanced 
procedures for listing at the level of the United Nations, and the appointment of an 
Ombudsperson, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned about procedural inadequacies

<p>of the listing and delisting process for the Consolidated List.62 Taking the view that the 
imposition by the Security Council of sanctions on individuals and entities under the 
current system exceeds the powers conferred on the Council under Chapter VII of the 
Charter of the United Nations, the Special Rapporteur has called for the replacement of the 
current terrorist listing regime under resolution 1267 (1999) with a system whereby the 
United Nations and the Security Council would continue to be involved through, inter alia, 
assistance and advice, while the actual listing of individuals would be done by Member 
States, accompanied by adequate procedural guarantees.63 
</p>
<p>34. Some countries also provide mechanisms for the listing of additional groups as 
terrorist entities. In a number of these countries, this possibility is correctly restricted to 
individuals or entities that have as one of their purposes or activities the facilitating or 
carrying out of terrorist acts,64 as properly defined, and is accompanied by the following 
safeguards: (a) the need to establish, on reasonable grounds, that the entity has knowingly 
carried out or participated in or facilitated a terrorist act; (b) procedures allowing the entity 
to apply for removal from such a list, together with rights of appeal or judicial review and 
an ability to make a fresh application for removal in the event of a material change of 
circumstances or the emergence of new evidence relevant to the listing; (c) periodic review 
of the list to determine whether reasonable grounds remain for entities to be listed; and (d) 
mechanisms allowing claims of mistaken identity to be dealt with speedily and making 
compensation available for persons wrongly affected.65 An individual or entity subject to 
designation as terrorist, whether as a result of listing on the Consolidated List of the United 
Nations or through a domestic procedure for similar listing, must be informed of that fact 
and of the measures taken as a consequence of listing, and is entitled to know the case 
against him, her or it, and be able to be heard within a reasonable time by the relevant 
decision-making body.66 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur identifies the elements below of a best practice concerning 
the listing of terrorist entities: 
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 9. Core elements of best practice in the listing of terrorist entities  
</b></p>
<p> Irrespective of the continued existence of the practice of the Security Council to list 
individuals or entities as terrorist, the implementation of any sanctions against individuals 
or entities listed as terrorist shall comply with the following minimum safeguards: 
</p>
<p> 1. Sanctions against the individual or entity are based on reasonable grounds to 
believe that the individual or entity has knowingly carried out, participated in or facilitated 
a terrorist act (as properly defined pursuant to practice 7 above); 
</p>
<p> 2. The listed individual or entity is promptly informed of the listing and its 
factual grounds, the consequences of such listing and the matters in items 3 to 6 below; 
</p>
<p> 3. The listed individual or entity has the right to apply for de-listing or non-
implementation of the sanctions, and has a right to court review of the decision resulting

<p><b> I. Arrest and interrogation of terrorist suspects 
</b></p>
<p>36. The arrest, detention, interrogation and subsequent treatment of terrorist suspects 
may involve, and has in the past involved, the violation of several human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. One of the most insidious forms of violation in counter-terrorism 
operations has been the use of secret or unacknowledged detention,67 which is prohibited 
under international law by human rights and humanitarian law norms that may not be 
derogated from under any circumstances.68 Persons arrested or detained must be given the 
benefit of legal assistance of their choosing, and informed of that right.69 Only for genuine 
reasons of national security may the person&#8217;s choice of lawyer be restricted and, in any 
case, there may never be interference with the right to independent, experienced, competent 
and effective counsel.70 
</p>
<p>37. The prohibition against torture or any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment is absolute and non-derogable and applies to the treatment of any person within 
the power or effective control of a State, even when not situated within the territory of the 
State.71 In no circumstances whatsoever is such treatment justified, and States must take 
measures to effectively prevent, detect and, if detected, prosecute those responsible for all 
instances of such treatment.72 Measures should include, but not be limited to, the permanent 
video recording of all interrogation rooms by means that cannot be switched off or erased. 
Information obtained through torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, wherever that has occurred, may never be used in any proceedings.73 
</p>
<p>38. States must remain vigilant against all practices that erode the absolute prohibition 
against torture in the context of counter-terrorism measures, including by ensuring that non-
nationals arrested as terrorist suspects enjoy the right of <i>non-refoulement</i> and are not

<p><b> IV. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>39. <b>In the present compilation of 10 areas of best practice in countering terrorism, 
the Special Rapporteur has sought primarily to identify legislative models that he 
considers appropriate for the effective countering of terrorism in full compliance with 
human rights. Beyond such models, best practices could also be identified in other 
forms, such as training programmes, the allocation of resources and, above all, the 
adoption of national counter-terrorism strategies. Such strategies need to go beyond 
good laws and require a comprehensive approach, rooted in human rights and 
addressing also conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, in line with the 
Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted by the General Assembly.</b>

<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Ten areas of best practice in countering terrorism 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism advocates the following 10 best practices 
in countering terrorism as concrete models for wider adoption and implementation by 
Member States.  
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 1. Model provisions on consistency of counter-terrorism law with human 
rights and refugee law, and humanitarian law  
</b></p>
<p>All legislation relating to the combating of terrorism is subject to the following guarantees 
and procedures: 
</p>
<p> 1. Proposals for new legislation or amendments to existing laws, shall include a 
written statement bringing to the attention of the Legislature any provision in the proposal 
that appears to be inconsistent with the purposes and provisions of norms of international 
human rights and refugee law that are binding upon the State. 
</p>
<p> 2.  The Legislature shall, through a specialized body or otherwise, review and 
ensure that any law approved by it conforms to the norms of international human rights and 
refugee law that are binding upon the State. 
</p>
<p> 3. The judiciary shall be entrusted with ensuring that laws do not breach norms 
of international human rights and refugee law that are binding upon the State. In 
discharging this duty, the courts shall apply the techniques available to them under the 
Constitution, such as: 
</p>
<p> (a) Adopting an interpretation of the law that is consistent with the 
purposes and provisions of norms of international human rights and refugee law that 
are binding upon the State; 
</p>
<p> (b) Declaring that part of the law is without legal effect; 
</p>
<p> (c) Declaring that the inconsistent law is to be of no force or effect, either 
with immediate effect or after a period of time that allows the Government to take 
remedial steps. 
</p>
<p> 4. If the State is involved, as a party, in an ongoing armed conflict, the above 
provision shall apply also to securing compliance with principles and provisions of 
international humanitarian law, without prejudice to the obligation to comply with 
international human rights and refugee law. 
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 2. Model provision on consistency of counter-terrorism practices with human 
rights and refugee law, and humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p> In the application and exercise of all functions under the law relating to terrorism, it 
is unlawful for any person to act in any way that is incompatible with the purposes and 
provisions of international human rights and refugee law that are binding upon the State. In 
this regard: 
</p>
<p> 1. The exercise of functions and powers shall be based on clear provisions of 
the law that exhaustively enumerate the powers in question. </p>


<p>- <b>21 
</b></p>
<p> 2. The exercise of such functions and powers may never violate peremptory or 
non-derogable norms of international law, nor impair the essence of any human right. 
</p>
<p> 3. Where the exercise of functions and powers involves a restriction upon a 
human right that is capable of limitation, any such restriction should be to the least intrusive 
means possible and shall: 
</p>
<p> (a) Be necessary in a democratic society to pursue a defined legitimate 
aim, as permitted by international law; and 
</p>
<p> (b) Be proportionate to the benefit obtained in achieving the legitimate 
aim in question. 
</p>
<p> (4)  If the State is involved, as a party, in an ongoing armed conflict, the above 
provisions shall apply also to securing compliance with principles and provisions of 
international humanitarian law, without prejudice to the obligation to comply with 
international human rights and refugee law.  
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 3. Model provisions on the principles of normalcy and specificity  
</b></p>
<p> 1. To the broadest possible extent, measures against terrorism shall be taken by 
the civilian authorities entrusted with the functions related to the combating of crime, and in 
the exercise of their ordinary powers. 
</p>
<p> 2.  Unless a state of emergency has been officially declared because terrorism 
genuinely threatens the life of the nation and requires the adoption of measures that cannot 
be undertaken through restrictions already permitted under international human rights law, 
terrorism does not trigger emergency powers. 
</p>
<p> 3.  Where the law includes particular provisions that, for a compelling reason, 
are considered necessary in combating terrorism and entrust certain authorities with specific 
powers for that reason, the use of such powers for any purpose other than the combating of 
terrorism, as properly defined pursuant to practice 7, is prohibited. 
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 4. Model provisions on the review of the operation of counter-terrorism law 
and practice 
</b></p>
<p> 1. Where specific counter-terrorism powers have been created pursuant to 
practice 3 (3), they shall lapse 12 months after their entry into force, unless the Legislature 
reviews and renews them before that date.  
</p>
<p> 2. The Executive shall appoint a person or body to act as independent reviewer 
of the application and operation of the law relating to terrorism. The person so appointed 
shall, at least every 12 months, carry out a review of the operation of the law relating to 
terrorism and report the findings of such review to the Executive and the Legislature. The 
report shall contain an opinion on: 
</p>
<p> (a) The implications of any proposed or recent amendments or additions 
to the law relating to terrorism, including an opinion on whether these are 
compatible with international human rights and refugee law that is binding upon the 
State, as well as, when applicable, principles and provisions of international 
humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> (b) Whether the application in practice of the law relating to terrorism, 
during the period of review, has been compatible with international human rights 
and refugee law that is binding upon the State, as well as, when applicable, 
principles and provisions of international humanitarian law. </p>


<p><b>  Practice 5. Model remedies provision  
</b></p>
<p> Any person whose human rights have been violated in the exercise of counter-
terrorism powers or the application of counter-terrorism law has a right to a speedy, 
effective and enforceable remedy. Courts shall have the ultimate responsibility to ensure 
that this right is effective. 
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 6. Model provisions on reparations and assistance to victims 
</b></p>
<p> 1. Damage to natural or legal persons and their property resulting from an act of 
terrorism or acts committed in the name of countering terrorism shall be compensated 
through funds from the State budget, in accordance with international human rights law. 
</p>
<p> 2. Natural persons who have suffered physical or other damage, or who have 
suffered violations of their human rights as a result of an act of terrorism or acts committed 
in the name of countering terrorism shall be provided with additional legal, medical, 
psychological and other assistance required for their social rehabilitation through funds 
from the State budget. 
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 7. Model definition of terrorism  
</b></p>
<p> Terrorism means an action or attempted action where: 
</p>
<p>1. The action: 
</p>
<p> (a) Constituted the intentional taking of hostages; or 
</p>
<p> (b) Is intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to one or 
more members of the general population or segments of it; or 
</p>
<p> (c) Involved lethal or serious physical violence against one or 
more members of the general population or segments of it; 
</p>
<p>and 
</p>
<p>2. the action is done or attempted with the intention of: 
</p>
<p> (a) Provoking a state of terror in the general public or a segment of 
it; or 
</p>
<p> (b) Compelling a Government or international organization to do 
or abstain from doing something; 
</p>
<p>and 
</p>
<p>3. The action corresponds to: 
</p>
<p> (a) the definition of a serious offence in national law, enacted for 
the purpose of complying with international conventions and protocols 
relating to terrorism or with resolutions of the Security Council relating to 
terrorism; or  
</p>
<p> (b) All elements of a serious crime defined by national law. 
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 8. Model offence of incitement to terrorism  
</b></p>
<p> It is an offence to intentionally and unlawfully distribute, or otherwise make 
available, a message to the public with the intent to incite the commission of a terrorist 
offence, where such conduct, whether or not expressly advocating terrorist offences, causes 
a danger that one or more such offences may be committed. </p>


<p>- <b>23 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Practice 9. Core elements of best practice in the listing of terrorist entities 
</b></p>
<p> Irrespective of the continued existence of the practice of the Security Council to list 
individuals or entities as terrorist, the implementation of any sanctions against individuals 
or entities listed as terrorist shall comply with the following minimum safeguards: 
</p>
<p> 1. Sanctions against the individual or entity are based on reasonable grounds to 
believe that the individual or entity has knowingly carried out, participated in or facilitated 
a terrorist act (as properly defined pursuant to practice 7 above); 
</p>
<p> 2. The listed individual or entity is promptly informed of the listing and its 
factual grounds, the consequences of such listing, and the matters in items 3 to 6 below; 
</p>
<p> 3. The listed individual or entity has the right to apply for de-listing or non-
implementation of the sanctions, and has a right to court review of the decision resulting 
from such application, with due process rights applying to such review including disclosure 
of the case against him, her or it, and such rules concerning the burden of proof that are 
commensurate with the severity of the sanctions; 
</p>
<p> 4. The listed individual or entity has the right to make a fresh application for de-
listing or lifting of sanctions in the event of a material change of circumstances or the 
emergence of new evidence relevant to the listing;  
</p>
<p> 5. The listing of an individual or entity, and the sanctions resulting from it, 
lapse automatically after 12 months, unless renewed through a determination that meets the 
requirements of items 1 to 3 above; and  
</p>
<p> 6. Compensation is available for persons and entities wrongly affected, 
including third parties. 
</p>
<p><b>  Practice 10. Core elements of best practice in arrest and interrogation of terrorist 
suspects  
</b></p>
<p> 1.  Any form of secret or unacknowledged detention is prohibited.  
</p>
<p> 2. Every person has the right to contact a lawyer of his or her choice from the 
moment of arrest or detention. The scope of such choice may be restricted for genuine 
reasons of national security. 
</p>
<p> 3. Any form of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment is prohibited. Compliance with this prohibition shall be effectively monitored. 
</p>
<p> 4. Information obtained through torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, anywhere in the world, shall not be used in any proceedings, and 
shall never be solicited or condoned.  
</p>
<p> 5. Anyone arrested as a terrorist suspect who would face a real risk of torture or 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment shall enjoy the right of <i>non-
refoulement</i>, and may not be extradited, expelled or otherwise formally or informally 
removed to a country or area if the foreseeable consequence of that measure is the person&#8217;s 
exposure to such a risk.
