Certification of Interim Filings 
Venture Issuer Basic Certificate
I, Brian Hinchcliffe, Chief Executive Officer of Belvedere Resources Ltd., certify the following:
Review: I have reviewed the interim financial report and interim MD&A (together, the “interim 
filings”) of Belvedere Resources Ltd. (the “issuer”) for the interim period ended June 30, 2016.
No misrepresentations: Based on my knowledge, having exercised reasonable diligence, the 
interim filings do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material 
fact required to be stated or that is necessary to make a statement not misleading in light of the 
circumstances under which it was made, with respect to the period covered by the interim filings.
Fair presentation: Based on my knowledge, having exercised reasonable diligence, the interim 
financial report together with the other financial information included in the interim filings fairly 
present in all material respects the financial condition, financial performance and cash flows of 
the issuer, as of the date of and for the periods presented in the interim filings.
NOTE TO READER
In contrast to the certificate required for non-venture issuers under National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in 
Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings (NI 52-109), this Venture Issuer Basic Certificate does not include representations relating to 
the establishment and maintenance of disclosure controls and procedures (DC&P) and internal control over financial reporting 
(ICFR), as defined in NI 52-109. In particular, the certifying officers filing this certificate are not making any representations 
relating to the establishment and maintenance of 
 
i)
controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the 
issuer in its annual filings, interim filings or other reports filed or submitted under securities legislation is recorded, 
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities legislation; and
a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with the issuer’s GAAP.
The issuer’s certifying officers are responsible for ensuring that processes are in place to provide them with sufficient knowledge 
to support the representations they are making in this certificate.  Investors should be aware that inherent limitations on the ability 
of certifying officers of a venture issuer to design and implement on a cost effective basis DC&P and ICFR as defined in NI 52-
109 may result in additional risks to the quality, reliability, transparency and timeliness of interim and annual filings and other 
reports provided under securities legislation.
