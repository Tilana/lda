<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. The United Nations Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of 
Human Rights, established by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1987/83, 
receives voluntary contributions from Governments, organizations and individuals. The 
objective of the Fund is to provide financial support for international cooperation aimed at 
building up and strengthening national and regional institutions and infrastructures that will 
have long-term impact on improved implementation of international human rights 
standards. 
</p>
<p>2. The Board of Trustees has been operational since 1993 and its members are 
appointed by the Secretary-General for a three-year renewable term. The mandate of the 
Board is to assist the Secretary-General in streamlining and rationalizing the working 
methods and procedures of the technical cooperation programme. It meets twice a year and 
reports on its work to the Secretary-General and the Human Rights Council. Current 
members are Sozar Subari (Georgia), Fatima Mbaye (Mauritania), Mariclaire Acosta 
Urquidi (Mexico), Christopher Sidoti (Australia) and Lin Lim (Malaysia). Ms. Lim was 
appointed to the Board in January 2014, replacing Deepika Udagama (Sri Lanka), who 
ended her term on 31 December 2013. The Board elected Mr. Sidoti as chairperson from 30 
April 2013 until 30 June 2014, when he will be replaced by Mariclaire Acosta Urquidi, who 
was elected chairperson by the Board at its thirty-ninth session, in Mexico City. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Mandate 
</b></p>
<p>3. Throughout the period under review, the Board of Trustees continued to advise the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on policy 
orientation and strategic vision on technical cooperation at a programme level. This 
refocused approach, which is framed within the broad definition of technical cooperation, 
was agreed upon by the Board of Trustees and presented to Member States in the annual 
report of the Secretary-General submitted to the Human Rights Council in 2011.1 
</p>
<p>4. The OHCHR planning process for the period 2014-2017 provided several 
opportunities for the Board Members to offer this advice to OHCHR by contributing to the 
definition of OHCHR thematic strategies. The Board members participated in the OHCHR 
regional consultations in Asia, the Americas, Europe and Central Asia, and Africa. They 
held discussions and provided advice on ways to strengthen the technical cooperation and 
advisory services programmes while pursuing the implementation of the Office&#8217;s four-year 
programme. 
</p>
<p>5. In view of the relevance and complementarities of the Voluntary Fund for Technical 
Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights and the Voluntary Fund for Financial and 
Technical Assistance in the Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review, the 
Secretary-General requested the Board of Trustees to oversee the both Funds. This decision 
was based on the importance of ensuring consistency in the operations of the Funds, given 
that both support States in fulfilling their international obligations by means of technical 
assistance and cooperation. During its thirty-eight session, in November 2013, the Board 
commenced its new functions with regard to the Voluntary Fund for Financial and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 A/HRC/16/66. </p>


<p>Technical Assistance in the Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review. OHCHR is 
tasked with submitting to the Human Rights Council an annual written update on the 
operations of the Fund (A/HRC/26/54). 
</p><p>6. The present report covers the thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth sessions of the Board in 
its capacity relating to the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human 
Rights. At those sessions, the Board continued to explore various components of the 
Human Rights Programme on Technical Cooperation funded by the that Fund, with a view 
to providing policy guidance and advice on the technical cooperation activities carried out 
by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities and results of the Voluntary Fund for Technical 
Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights and the Board of 
Trustees 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Thirty-eighth session 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field 
of Human Rights held its thirty-eighth session in Geneva, from 11 to 14 November 2013. 
The session was chaired by Christopher Sidoti, who had been elected Chairperson of the 
Board of Trustees at its thirty-seventh session. All members of the Board attended the 
session. 
</p>
<p>8. The main objectives of the session were to take stock of and to contribute to the final 
stages of the preparation of the OHCHR Management Plan for the period 2014-2017, and to 
discuss with OHCHR geographic and thematic sections the relevant aspects of the technical 
cooperation programme pertinent to each of the thematic strategies; to familiarize the Board 
with the mechanisms in place through the OHCHR Performance Monitoring System to 
monitor and report on technical cooperation results under each of the thematic strategies, 
focus areas and type of field presences receiving support from the Fund during the 
programing cycle; to discuss efforts at the field level to continue to strengthen gender 
integration and women&#8217;s rights focus in technical cooperation programmes; and to review 
the financial information and projected allocations for 2014 by the Fund. During the 
session, the Board received also an update on the main developments at the Human Rights 
Council in the area of technical cooperation. 
</p>
<p>9. The Board was briefed and discussed with the Universal Periodic Review Section 
the mechanisms in place and the ongoing projects under the Voluntary Fund for Financial 
and Technical Assistance in the Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review. This 
was the first time since it assumed its new function with regard to this Fund that the Board 
had an opportunity to share views and receive direct briefings on regional and country 
experiences on the use of the Fund. The Board learned about the OHCHR approach to 
universal periodic review follow-up, as well as on the support provided to a number of 
States in all regions under the Fund in 2013. The Board stressed the importance of ensuring 
the sustainability of the impact of funded projects and the need to identify adequate avenues 
for the active engagement of civil society, in particular non-governmental organizations and 
national human rights institutions, in review follow-up efforts by States. The details of its 
activities overseeing the management of the Fund can be found in the annual OHCHR 
reports on the Fund.  
</p>
<p>10. Technical cooperation in the context of the strategic planning process for the period 
2014-2017 was also the subject of discussion during the session. The Board members met 
with the OHCHR Policy, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Service, as well as with </p>


<p>each of the OHCHR thematic teams in charge of sharpening the focus of the Office on a set 
of critical human rights challenges for the new four-year programming cycle. Together, the 
Board and its interlocutors analysed the technical cooperation components of each of the 
Office&#8217;s six thematic priorities. The Members of the Board, who had participated in various 
stages of the preparatory process, including through the series of regional consultations, 
expressed appreciation for the continued efforts of OHCHR to promote technical 
cooperation at the outset of its strategic planning and as an integral part of all its 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>11. The Board noted and endorsed in particular the significant progress made through 
this exercise in recognizing that strengthening democratic society is a long-lasting 
investment for development. It welcomed the new thematic strategy of &#8220;widening the 
democratic space&#8221; and its sharp focus on strengthening and building national human rights 
capacities as a critical means to the prevention of human rights violation and conflicts, 
which ultimately has been proved critical to sustainable economic development. It also 
endorsed the attention to national human rights institutions in both this new thematic 
priority and specifically addressed throughout all the priorities. It considered that this would 
certainly require vigorous impetus and support to the implementation of the programmes on 
the ground. The Board noted with appreciation the specific focus on some critical human 
rights issues and concerns where OHCHR had managed to develop substantive expertise 
over the past biennium, such as the particular situation of individuals and groups facing 
discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and the persons 
defending them. The Board was encouraged to observe that its contributions throughout the 
strategic planning process had been taken into account and served to support the 
finalization of the new management plan.  
</p>
<p>12. The Board was updated on the implementation of the programmes funded by the 
Voluntary Fund in the framework of the OHCHR management plan, and in particular on 
results at the end of the 2012-2013 biennium across all regions, as well as the partnerships 
on the ground with Governments, civil society and United Nations partners, including 
United Nations country teams. 
</p>
<p>13. The Board was briefed in particular by field presences on the actions taken at the 
field level to integrate women&#8217;s rights and gender equality in technical cooperation 
programmes and activities. Teleconference discussions with the Regional Gender Advisers 
in the OHCHR Regional Office for Central America in Panama, the OHCHR Regional 
Office for the Middle East in Beirut and the OHCHR Regional Office for West Africa in 
Dakar showed how the gender dimensions of technical cooperation programmes at the field 
level could be adequately addressed and benefit from closer geographic and available 
regional expertise. The Board found particularly notable the regional expertise in the 
Americas in the area of gender-based killings (femicide), in particular the development of 
protocols for their investigation and the innovative ways of providing support to other field 
presences and States in the region to develop similar protocols, particularly those receiving 
support from the Voluntary Fund. The Board found equally encouraging the strategies in 
place by the Gender Adviser in Beirut in providing countries in the region and the United 
Nations country team with expertise in the area of women&#8217;s participation and legal grounds 
for gender equality. Lastly, the Board welcomed the initiatives taken by the Regional 
Adviser in Dakar to advise Governments on nationality laws and issues with regard to 
women&#8217;s political participation. 
</p>
<p>14. One of the challenges that the Board has traditionally observed while analysing 
technical cooperation programmes is ensuring synergies and cross-sharing experiences 
between the programmes and projects in the area of technical cooperation, receiving 
support from the various United Nation trust funds. During the session, the Board discussed 
and identified areas for collaboration with the work of other trust funds managed by the </p>


<p>Office, in particular the Special Fund established by the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture aimed at supporting financially implementation of 
recommendations by the Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture. 
</p>
<p>15. The Board also met with the Deputy High Commissioner and briefed her on its latest 
visits to field presences and the role that the Board envisages vis-a-vis its new capacity as 
Board of Trustees for the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance in the 
Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Thirty-ninth session 
</b></p>
<p>16. The thirty-seventh session of the Board of Trustees was held in Mexico from 17 to 
21 February 2014, pursuant to the Board&#8217;s practice of holding one of its two meetings each 
year in countries where OHCHR has a field presence funded by the Voluntary Fund for 
Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights. This was the third time that a session 
of the Board was organized outside Geneva.  
</p>
<p>17. In 2014, the Board has been keen to visit, for the first time, an OHCHR presence in 
Latin America, to witness first-hand the commonalities and differences in approach and to 
learn from the experience of the Office in the Americas. The Office in Mexico is fully 
funded by the Voluntary Fund. The main purpose of the visit, as in the case of previous 
sessions and visits to the field, was to continue to gather in situ observations of value-added 
areas and areas requiring strengthening for the Office as a whole in the design and 
implementation of its technical cooperation programmes. 
</p>
<p>18. The Board discussed technical cooperation activities by the OHCHR presence in 
Mexico during meetings with different national and State-level authorities, United Nations 
partners, the national human rights commission and civil society organizations in the 
country. This included visits to selected projects at the State level in Coahuila (Saltillo) and 
in Nuevo Leon (Monterrey) , where the Board received briefings on the specific situation of 
human rights to be addressed by the technical advice and services provided by OHCHR, in 
particular with State authorities, the judiciary and civil society organizations. 
</p><p>19. During the visit, the Board discussed the support provided in various areas, 
including technical and advisory services on the follow-up to recommendations from all 
human rights mechanisms and on the establishment of the Mechanism of Protection for 
Journalists and Human Rights Defenders with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the 
Ministry of the Interior. Particular focus was attached to the development of a human rights 
plan of action at the national level that could serve as an overarching tool to continue to 
guide efforts to develop the plans and strengthen existing ones when needed at the State 
level. The Board was able to understand the process of development of the plan of action 
for Nuevo Leon during its visit to Coahuila. With regard to institution-building efforts in 
the context of the Mechanism of Protection for Journalists and Human Rights Defenders, 
the Board was of the view that efforts should be constantly reassessed to ensure that the 
existence of the Mechanism was part of broader efforts to eradicate violence and human 
rights abuses and violations against human rights defenders and journalists and to address 
these issues effectively with a methodology that provides the expertise, practicality and 
continuity required for this aim. 
</p>
<p>20. The Board had an opportunity to discuss with Congress representatives the support 
from the Office on legislative developments regarding the landmark constitutional reform 
of 2011, which granted constitutional status to international human rights treaties, military 
jurisdiction, enforced disappearances, freedom of expression, and the withdrawing of 
reservations to main human rights instruments, among others. The Board also learned 
during the meeting with the President of the Supreme Court about the support given by the </p>


<p>Office in the development of indicators and the &#8220;Reforma DH&#8221; programme supporting 
better understanding among judges, lawyers and prosecutors of the implications of the 
constitutional reform of 2011. Concerns were also discussed regarding the <i>arraigo</i> figure 
being evoked as the basis in allegations of human rights violations and the importance of 
continuing to explore with the Office ways to overcome these challenges in full compliance 
with international standards.  
</p>
<p>21. In Mexico City, and in Saltillo and Monterrey as well, the Board discussed with civil 
society representatives efforts and technical support being received from the Office to 
strengthen capacities to address human rights concerns regarding the situation of human 
rights defenders, disappearances, violence against women and the rights of indigenous 
peoples, as well as the situation of migrants. With regard to assistance and support to 
victims, the Board stressed that the challenge was still to ensure that technical assistance 
supported current efforts to assist victims effectively while seeking justice and reparation. 
</p><p>22. The Board was also briefed on the various thematic priorities of the Office in 
Mexico during the programming cycle for the period 2014-2017. The Board found that 
OHCHR priorities were in line with what national stakeholders expected, and that the 
Office continued to be seen, more than 10 years since its establishment, as a critical and 
reliable partner for all partners interviewed. The Board considers that, while the relevance 
of the current programme is on track vis-&#224;-vis the human rights context in the country, the 
Office would benefit from strengthening its efforts together with relevant State institutions 
at both the federal and State levels to continue to translate into concrete capacity-building 
actions the specific needs regarding the effective application of the principle of free, prior 
and informed consent in relation to land, natural resources and territories for indigenous 
peoples, and the situation of migrants and of victims of human rights violations in their 
access to justice and reparation, in particular for victims of enforced disappearance.  
23. The Board is of the view that field visits continue to be strategically critical for its 
work and mandate. To date, the Board has managed to visit in-situ programmes by two 
types of field presences, namely, country or stand-alone offices and human rights advisers. 
It proposes to explore a visit to a human rights component of a peace mission as a priority 
for a field visit in 2015. As demonstrated recently in Mexico, in-country discussions are 
particularly helpful in identifying in concrete terms the priority areas for further technical 
cooperation work, challenges and best practices by the Office and for the Board to be able 
to fulfil its policy advisory role. 
</p>
<p>24. The Board took the opportunity of its last day in Mexico to hold an internal meeting 
to continue discussions on its future programme. During the meeting, the Board formally 
welcomed the new elected member, Lin Lim, to replace Deepika Udagama. Mariclaire 
Acosta Urquidi was elected the new chairperson of the Board, to succeed Mr. Sidoti from 1 
July 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Technical cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Main findings, challenges identified and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>25. Through the sessions in Geneva, the visits to the OHCHR field presences and the 
active engagement of the Board members in the strategic planning exercise for the 
programming cycle 2014-2017, the Board has gathered a broad overview of the technical 
cooperation programme of the Office and has continued to ensure that the High 
Commissioner has access to the experience and expertise of its members, expanding the 
opportunities for strategic and policy advice in support of the technical cooperation 
provided by OHCHR field presences.  </p>


<p>26. On the basis of its findings and experience, the Board is able to provide advice on 
challenges and opportunities experienced by OHCHR field presences in the area of 
technical cooperation, on good practices in the implementation of technical cooperation 
locally, and more generally on the broad lines for the design and implementation of 
technical cooperation work as an integral part of the programme of the Office.  
</p>
<p>27. The Board considers therefore that a number of components for effective technical 
cooperation by OHCHR have become evident. These elements were broadly presented to 
the Human Rights Council at its twenty-third session. First, effective technical cooperation 
is based on the universality and indivisibility of all human rights and includes both the 
protection and the promotion of human rights. Second, effective technical cooperation 
focuses on building and strengthening national frameworks and institutions for the 
promotion and protection of human rights. Third, effective technical cooperation reflects 
national development objectives to ensure the highest levels of ownership and 
sustainability, as well as to respond to genuine national interest, commitments and efforts in 
the promotion and protection of human rights. Fourth, technical cooperation is formulated 
and implemented with the broadest possible participation of all elements of national 
societies, and is also linked with regional and subregional human rights mechanisms. Fifth, 
technical cooperation is linked to the follow-up on implementation of the recommendations 
and concluding observations made by international human rights mechanisms. Sixth, 
technical cooperation is mainstreamed through all United Nations agencies and operations 
in each country and region. Seventh, effective technical cooperation requires linking it with 
existing thematic priorities of the Office and maintaining it as an integral part of the overall 
OHCHR programme.  
</p>
<p>28. The Board, through its reports and presentations to the Human Rights Council, has 
already elaborated on the importance of anchoring technical cooperation on the universality 
and indivisibility of all human rights, including its protection and promotion aspects. The 
Board would like to continue as a programme of work for the coming years its elaboration 
of the main elements of the above-mentioned seven components, as it considers that this 
could be beneficial to support the Office in the implementation of the technical cooperation 
aspects of its new four-year programme for the period 2014-2017. In the present report, the 
Board underscores the critical importance of building and strengthening national 
frameworks and institutions in the field of human rights through technical cooperation and 
advisory services with the support of OHCHR, as well as the importance of partnerships 
with United Nations entities on the ground.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Technical cooperation, and building and strengthening national 
frameworks and institutions  
</b></p>
<p>29. The first of the components of effective technical cooperation described above is its 
basis in the universality and indivisibility of all human rights, and includes both the 
protection and the promotion of human rights. This is the key objective of technical 
cooperation: better promotion and protection of human rights. The second component, 
building and strengthening national frameworks and institutions for the promotion and 
protection of human rights, is the strategy and methodology for achieving the key objective. 
</p><p>30. The term &#8220;national frameworks and institutions&#8221; is an inclusive term that 
incorporates the whole range of mechanisms available to States to fulfil their international 
human rights obligations. It includes the rule of law, legal and political accountability, 
democratically elected parliaments, independent courts and independent national human 
rights institutions, national development institutions, just to mention a few. The strategy 
employed by effective technical cooperation is directed towards the strengthening of these </p>


<p>mechanisms. The reason for this is found in the nature of OHCHR and of its technical 
cooperation programme through its field services. 
</p>
<p>31. The strategy of each field presence, regardless of its nature, must therefore be to 
ensure that national frameworks and institutions are built in a sustainable manner that will 
provide the best possible promotion and protection of human rights and that these 
institutions are able to continue their functions once the technical support provided comes 
to an end, a reality in view of the limitations of resources and the increasing demands from 
all regions of the world. 
</p>
<p>32. Some of these institutions and frameworks are critical for good governance 
generally, and not only for the promotion and protection of human rights. An independent 
legal system operating under the rule of law, with qualified judges, due process, transparent 
decision-making, ascertainable laws and procedures and appropriate judicial avenues for 
appeal and review of decisions, is essential for the promotion and protection of human 
rights and also for the proper governance of the State. So too is a political system with a 
freely elected Government and legislature, with universal franchise and freedom for full 
participation. Technical cooperation appropriately addresses the strengthening of these 
systems. 
</p>
<p>33. Other institutions and frameworks are more specifically directed towards human 
rights. National human rights institutions are among the most important of these. Technical 
cooperation needs to be focused explicitly on the establishment and strengthening of 
national human rights institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles. It needs to 
engage them collaboratively, as closely as possible. Where a State does not have a national 
human rights institution in compliance with the Paris Principles, the OHCHR field presence 
should encourage its establishment, as the Human Rights Council and the General 
Assembly have constantly reiterated in their resolutions. Where a State has a national 
human rights institution that is not in full compliance with the Paris Principles or that is 
weak or less effective than it needs to be, the OHCHR field presence should work closely 
with the institution, the Government and Parliament to strengthen the institution&#8217;s capacity. 
Under no circumstances should the work of an OHCHR field presence replace or duplicate 
the work of a national human rights institution.  
</p>
<p>34. National human rights action plans are a framework specifically aimed at better 
promotion and protection of human rights. Assisting the development and implementation 
of an effective national human rights action plan should be a core part of technical 
cooperation. Many States have adopted such action plans, since they were encouraged to do 
so by the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action in 1993. However, many of these 
plans have been inadequate, while many have not been implemented fully or in some cases 
not at all. OHCHR has become well experienced in working with States to develop good 
national human rights action plans and subsequently to implement them. Field presences 
can assist this process by providing international expertise where required and building 
local capacity.  
</p>
<p>35. National human rights institutions and national human rights action plans are a good 
means by which the benefits of the work of an OHCHR field presence can become long 
lasting. They are products of technical cooperation that address the promotion and 
protection of human rights on a long-term basis, that reflect the national context and the 
needs and priorities of the individual State, and that can be domestically sustainable and 
implementable. 
</p>
<p>36. Whatever specific approaches are taken, however, the priority strategy for effective 
technical cooperation must be building and strengthening national institutions and 
frameworks. Only in this way can the international community that has directly or 
indirectly provided the technical cooperation ensure that it has a long-term benefit. Only in </p>


<p>this way can the individual State that has sought international assistance acquire the 
capacity to ensure itself its full compliance with its international human rights obligations. 
The Board is of the view that newly established thematic priority on widening the 
democratic space provides a solid framework to support States in these endeavours, and 
hopes that it would attract necessary resources to be adequately implemented.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Synergy and partnerships with other United Nations entities  
</b></p>
<p>37. Synergies and partnerships among United Nations agencies and programmes in the 
area of technical cooperation in the field of human rights is one of the focus areas of 
attention of the Board during its sessions, in particular during its visits to OHCHR 
presences in countries.  
</p>
<p>38. Through discussions with United Nations Resident Coordinators and United Nations 
agencies and programmes, the Board has had the opportunity to study the extent to which 
the programme, priority focus and activities of a particular office are also in line with or 
respond to the main human rights issues and the demands from a variety of country 
partners, and how they relate and are linked to the United Nations development framework, 
other programming tools and joint United Nations development efforts on the ground.  
</p><p>39. In Mexico, as in the case of previous visits, the Board met with the United Nations 
Resident Coordinator and representatives from the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and the 
International Organization for Migration. During the discussions, the role of the Office in 
ensuring human rights mainstreaming across the work of the United Nations country teams 
was particularly stressed, as was the capacity of the Office to provide timely and 
substantive advice on relevant human rights normative issues. The Office was found to be a 
reliable and critical partner in joint capacity-building and advisory services, provided by the 
United Nations at the request of the Government.  
</p>
<p>40. The Board has observed that, in countries where the presence of the Office is 
particularly well established through acceptable human resources and expertise as well as 
the capacity to adequately and independently monitor the human rights complexities on the 
ground, the technical cooperation programmes developed at the request and in close 
cooperation with relevant state entities and other United Nations partners are often robust 
and provide visible and measurable results. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Measuring results in technical cooperation and the response of the 
Office of the High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p>41. Measuring impact at the country level and monitoring programme implementation 
are becoming less challenging for OHCHR, as all its presences and all Headquarters 
structures move on to using the online performance monitoring system, which was designed 
to plan, monitor and report on results for all of OHCHR programming. At November 2013, 
all OHCHR field presences (including all those presences receiving support from the 
Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation) had submitted all their planning documents 
(annual and for the programming cycle for the period 2014-2017), as well as their end-of-
cycle reports (2012-2013) through the system. Board members were highly encouraged by 
the impressive results that the increased and systematic use of the system was already 
achieving, even at the early stages.  
</p>
<p>42. During the sessions in Geneva and in the field visits, the Board observed how the 
system, which interlinks planning, monitoring, the production of reports and sharing 
experiences, represents a paramount tool facilitating enormously and in a very professional 
manner the definition and selection of the Office&#8217;s results, as well as their measurement. </p>


<p>During the field visits conducted over the past two years, the Board has been able to test the 
usefulness of the system in facilitating monitoring of the implementation and performance 
of technical cooperation projects, adjusting them when needed in real time to changing 
situations, as well as the results of the latest improvements in the system. 
</p>
<p>43. The Board commends OHCHR for its efforts during the period under review to 
continue investing in the system. The upgrades implemented since the previous briefing to 
the Board, including the financial module, as well as the efforts to ensure full use of the 
system by Headquarters structures also, were assessed very favourably by the Board. The 
system is proving a critical contribution for OHCHR to be a fully results-based 
organization, transparent and accountable to all stakeholders. The Board encourages the 
United Nations Secretariat to consider the OHCHR tool as a good practice to be taken into 
consideration when developing results-based management systems. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Field reference manual and other guidance tools on technical 
cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>44. As one of the vehicles of OHCHR to fulfil the mandate of the High Commissioner, 
technical cooperation is an effective means for overcoming in-country knowledge and 
capacity gaps, and for supporting efforts made by the country to address those gaps. By 
strengthening its capacity to share experiences and to pay attention to systematically 
documenting good practices and lessons learned, the Office is increasing its ability to raise 
its profile in supporting States through technical cooperation, as well as being able to 
facilitate experience-sharing between States, an increasing demand received by the Board 
during its recent visits to the field. The Board was briefed during its sessions, both in 
Geneva and in Mexico, on recent efforts to strengthen knowledge management tools in the 
area of technical cooperation. 
</p>
<p>45. OHCHR continued to advance towards the finalization of an OHCHR field reference 
manual on technical cooperation, aimed at providing guidance to its field presences and 
staff on the approach of OHCHR to technical cooperation and to ensure access, in a single 
document, to OHCHR policies, practices and procedures relating to technical cooperation. 
OHCHR is currently revising its contents and making the necessary adjustments in view of 
the new programming cycle 2014-2017, the upgrades in the performance monitoring 
system and other relevant internal tools. 
</p>
<p>46. The Board particularly welcomed the efforts of the Office to strengthen the tools for 
access to information, policies and guidance and sharing of experiences by human rights 
advisers to United Nations Resident Coordinators and United Nations country teams. 
Human rights advisers have proven to be an effective means to ensure the integration of 
human rights into the programmes and activities of the United Nations teams on the ground 
and to strengthen their human rights capacities. Through this in-country support, the United 
Nations certainly increases its capacity to ensure optimization of the use of resources on the 
ground for increased coordinated work in the area of human rights, including on technical 
cooperation and advisory services efforts with the States interested and concerned. 
OHCHR, in close cooperation with the Development Operations Coordination Office, has 
developed an internal Internet-based tool that is easily accessible to all human rights 
advisers, and includes a sharing point that allows them to learn and share experiences, ideas 
and approaches being used across regions. The Board had the opportunity to observe how 
human rights advisers receiving financial support from the Voluntary Fund for Technical 
Cooperation in 2013 were making active use of this tool.  
</p>
<p>47. The Board encourages OHCHR to continue to develop this type of initiative for all 
types of field presences receiving support from the Voluntary Fund for Technical </p>


<p>Cooperation, as well as to complete and to keep the manual on technical cooperation 
regularly updated. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Status of funding and donors 
</b>48. The Board was updated at its meetings in November 2013 and February 2014 on the 
overall financial status of OHCHR and its donors, the 2013 financial situation of the 
Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights and its functioning 
in the overall funding system, including interlinkages with other extrabudgetary resources, 
as well as the funding projections and proposed work plan for the Fund for 2014. 
Expenditures under the Fund had again been increasing throughout 2013 without being 
matched by financial contributions, a situation that the Board had already brought to the 
attention of the Human Rights Council in recent reports.  
</p>
<p>49. In 2013, the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation continued to provide 
resources ($20.3 million) for technical cooperation to build strong human rights 
frameworks at the national level in 34 regions, countries and territories. This included 
support for 16 human rights advisers (in Chad, Ecuador, Honduras, Kenya, Madagascar, 
Maldives, the Niger, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian 
Federation, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste, South Caucasus (Georgia) and Ukraine), 11 
human rights components of peace missions (in Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Darfur (Sudan), Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Liberia, Libya, Sierra Leone, Somalia 
and South Sudan) and six country/stand-alone offices (in Bolivia (Plurinational State of), 
Kosovo,2 Mauritania, Mexico, State of Palestine and Togo). In 2013, the Fund received $7 
million in earmarked contributions. OHCHR therefore allocated $11.9 million from 
unearmarked resources to cover the expenditures made under the Fund. Details of 
contributions and programmes are provided in the annual report of OHCHR for 2013. 
</p>
<p>50. The activities conducted under the Fund have resulted in efforts made at the country 
level to incorporate international human rights standards into national laws, policies and 
practices; the establishment of more sustainable national capacities to adhere to these 
standards; strengthened administration of justice; greater emphasis on the development of 
human rights education programmes and increased capacities with regard to gender equality 
and women&#8217;s rights; the establishment of responsive national human rights institutions; the 
strengthening of the human rights capacity of United Nations Resident Coordinators and 
United Nations country teams through the deployment of human rights advisers; and the 
development of national plans of action for the promotion and protection of human rights 
and on the use of human rights indicators. Detailed information on income and expenditure 
under the Voluntary Fund is annexed to the present report. 
</p>
<p>51. In its sessions and meetings with OHCHR and Member States, the Board underlined 
the importance of ensuring continuous contributions to the Fund, and reiterates its view that 
an increase in unearmarked funds will allow OHCHR to be more flexible in implementing 
identified priorities.<b>
