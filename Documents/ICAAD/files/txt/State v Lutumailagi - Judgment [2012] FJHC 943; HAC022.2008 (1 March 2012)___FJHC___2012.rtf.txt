6.      
The accused was charged under Section 199 and 200 of the Penal Code. Prosecution should prove all elements beyond reasonable doubt.

7.      
After the voir dire was before my brother Judge the statement made by the accused to the Police at the cautioned interview was allowed.

8.      
The Prosecution had produced the caution interview statement and proved the truthfulness of the same through independent evidence.

9.      
Considering the nature of the evidence before this court I am convinced that the Prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.

10.     
I find the verdict of the assessors were not perverse. It was opened to them to reach such a conclusion on the evidence. I accept their verdict.

11.     
Considering all I find the Accused guilty as charged.
