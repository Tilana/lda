</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 6/19. Religious and cultural rights in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also</i> article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which 
</p>
<p>stipulates that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in that 
</p>
<p>Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, 
</p>
<p>religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other 
</p>
<p>status, and that no distinction should be made on the basis of the political, 
</p>
<p>jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person 
</p>
<p>belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other 
</p>
<p>limitation of sovereignty, 
</p>
<p><i> Aware</i> of the responsibility of the international community to promote human 
</p>
<p>rights and ensure respect for international law,  
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> the particularity of Occupied East Jerusalem in its rich religious 
</p>
<p>and cultural heritage, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>relevant Security Council resolutions on Occupied East Jerusalem,  
</p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the 
</p>
<p>Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, to the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,  
</p>
<p><i> Deeply</i> <i>concerned </i>at the Israeli actions undermining the sanctity and 
</p>
<p>inviolability of religious sites in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem,  </p>

<p><i> Deeply</i> <i>concerned also </i>at the Israeli policy of closures and the severe 
</p>
<p>restrictions, including curfews and the permit regime, that continue to be imposed on 
</p>
<p>the movement of Palestinians and their free access to their holy sites, including Al 
</p>
<p>Aqsa Mosque,  
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Stresses </i>that all policies and measures taken by Israel, the occupying 
</p>
<p>Power, to limit access of Palestinians to their holy sites, particularly in Occupied East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem, on the basis of national origin, religion, birth, sex or any other status are in 
</p>
<p>violation of the provisions of the above-mentioned instruments and resolutions and 
</p>
<p>therefore must cease immediately; 
</p>
<p> 2.<i> Calls upon </i>Israel, the occupying Power, to respect the religious and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights enumerated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to allow Palestinian 
</p>
<p>worshippers unfettered access to their religious sites; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the 
</p>
<p>Council at its next session on the implementation of the present resolution.
