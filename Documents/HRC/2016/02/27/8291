<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction and objectives of the visit 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur undertook an official visit to Mauritius from 1 to 11 May 
2011, during which she met with stakeholders in various districts of Mauritius and in 
Rodrigues. She thanks the Government for its collaboration in organizing meetings with 
relevant Government officials, and for its cooperation and frank dialogue before, during 
and after the visit. 
</p>
<p>2. In Port-Louis, the Special Rapporteur met with the Prime Minister, the Minister of 
Gender Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare, and with representatives of the 
following Ministries: Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and International Trade; Gender 
Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare (Child Development Unit (CDU), Family 
Support Bureau); Education and Human Resources; Finance and Economic Development, 
Tourism and Leisure, Health and Quality of Life, and Social Security, National Solidarity 
and Reform Institutions. She also met with the Ombudsperson for Children and her team, 
the Attorney General, the Parliamentary Counsel, the Director of Public Prosecutions, 
members of the judiciary (district court and intermediate court), the police (Family 
Protection Unit), the National Human Rights Commission, the National Adoption Council, 
the National Children&#8217;s Council, the National Computer Board and the National 
Empowerment Foundation, and with representatives of the National Corporate Social 
Responsibility Committee. In Rodrigues, she met with the Commissioner for Child 
Development, representatives of the police, and the sole officer of the CDU<i>. </i> 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also met with representatives of non-governmental 
organizations (national and international), and visited programmes and care centres for 
children in vulnerable situations. She met with international financial and technical 
partners, and warmly thanks the United Nations Resident Coordinator&#8217;s team for its 
</p>
<p>assistance and guidance. 
</p>
<p>4. The objectives of the visit were, on the one hand, to explore the incidence of sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography, and on the other, to examine initiatives 
and measures undertaken in the areas of prevention, protection, care and assistance, 
rehabilitation, reintegration and reparation, as well as prosecution of abusers/exploiters. The 
Special Rapporteur paid particular attention to examining root causes of these phenomena 
and risk factors, as well as to the situation of children particularly vulnerable to these 
practices (girls, children living and/or working in the street; children not registered at birth; 
children without a family; migrant children; child workers; and children living in poverty or 
in rural regions). 
</p>
<p>5. During the visit, the Government approved the ratification of the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur also provided guidance to the 
Government on how best to implement the Optional Protocol at the domestic level. 
</p>
<p>6. Throughout the visit, the Special Rapporteur solicited the views of all stakeholders 
regarding the situation of the rights of the child in the country, on measures which have 
yielded some success, as well as on those which needed to be strengthened, with a view to 
making targeted conclusions and recommendations to be followed up effectively by all 
stakeholders concerned.  
</p>
<p><b> II. National context  
</b></p>
<p>7. Mauritius is composed of several islandsandat 1 July 2010, it had a population of 
1,281,214; of this total, 37,480 live in the island of Rodrigues.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>8. Mauritius was colonized successively by the Dutch, the French and finally the 
English. The country became independent on 12 March 1968.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Constitution does not mention an official language for the country. 
Nevertheless, English is used by the administration, while French is used in business and 
Creole is the native language of over 90 per cent of the population. The political system is a 
parliamentary democracy. Since, 2003, Rodrigues has assumed partial autonomy, with the 
establishment of the Rodrigues Regional Assembly; the Commissions cover various 
portfolios.  
</p>
<p>10. In its 2009-2011 Country Programme for Mauritius document, the United Nations 
Development Programme noted that, over the last decades, Mauritius had achieved 
spectacular economic success. With an annual growth rate of around 5 per cent in recent 
years, the country has diversified its economic activities, particularly in agriculture, 
manufacturing, tourism, and financial and business services. The country has also 
maintained its elaborate social welfare system. Nevertheless, pockets of poverty remain 
prevalent in specific regions, including Rodrigues. Women make up 61 per cent of the 
unemployed.  
</p>
<p>11. At the time of the visit, Mauritius was undergoing a process of transition and 
development with respect to numerous policy areas, including with respect to the reduction 
of poverty, evidenced by the creation in 2010 of the new Ministry for Social Integration and 
Economic Empowerment, and to child protection. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Situation analysis 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Scope of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>12. As in many other countries, the true scope of the sale of children, child prostitution 
and child pornography in Mauritius is difficult to measure. Such crimes are underreported, 
due to a lack of awareness of laws among children, families and communities; fear of 
retaliation, stigma or social exclusion; cultural resistance; and the clandestine nature of 
these offences. Another obstacle is the lack of national centralized information systems that 
use a clear and harmonized methodology for gathering and processing data. Thus, the actual 
extent of these offences in the country is not yet known 
</p>
<p>13. The most recent study on commercial sexual exploitation of children dates back to 
2003; this national survey was commissioned by the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights, Child 
Development and Family Welfare and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), and 
was carried out by the University of Mauritius. The recommendations of the report were 
considered as a basis for the 2003-2004 national action plan addressing the commercial 
sexual exploitation of children. At the time of the study, according to the survey&#8217;s 
estimates, there were as many as 2,600 child victims of commercial sexual exploitation in 
Mauritius (and 3,900 adult sex workers&#8212;a ratio of four children to six adults).  
</p>
<p>14. While a more recent study has not been conducted, virtually all interlocutors during 
the visit were of the view that the problem of child prostitution, be it occasional or on a 
more regular basis, is growing. 
</p>
<p>15. The CDU registered two cases of child prostitution in 2010. According to the 
Director for Public Prosecutions, in 2010, five cases of &#8213;causing a child to be sexually 
abused (to engage in prostitution)&#8214; and one case of &#8213;procuring, enticing and exploiting 
prostitutes&#8214; were sent to prosecution. The Drop-in Centre (see para. 78 below) registered 
four cases of child prostitution from January 2010 to December 2010, and one from January 
to March 2011. Interlocutors noted that child prostitution is increasing in some poorer </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>neighbourhoods, but that proving the phenomenon is extremely difficult. Cases may be 
reported to the police, but they rarely go further due to difficulties in gathering evidence. 
</p>
<p>16. In 2010, according to the Director for Public Prosecutions, there were three 
convictions related to &#8213;causing a child to be sexually abused&#8214;, with a total of nine accused 
persons. The sentences ranged from conditional discharge to two years&#8217; imprisonment plus 
a fine. According to data provided by the police, between 2005 and 2010 a total of 32 cases 
of commercial sexual exploitation had been established, and 77 people had been arrested in 
respect thereof.  
</p>
<p>17. There is currently one case of child pornography pending in the courts. Statistics 
regarding cases of the sale of children are unavailable. Most interlocutors stated that the 
phenomenon of organized international trafficking networks for the sexual exploitation of 
children is not really present in Mauritius. However, the Director for Public Prosecutions 
emphasized that this did not mean that there were no such cases; rather, his office insisted 
on the need for increased capacities to detect and identify such cases. Similarly, the Special 
Rapporteur received no official reports of child sex tourism, though some interlocutors 
were of the view that cases exist but are not being reported. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur notes discrepancies in the official statistics provided, and in 
some cases, no data is available at all. There also discrepancies in assessments made by 
stakeholders regarding the scope of all forms of sexual exploitation of children. Such 
discrepancies can be explained by the nature of these practices: cases are underreported, 
there are difficulties in gathering information, differences in qualifying crimes, challenges 
in identifying victims and perpetrators, social perceptions and stigma linked to these acts, 
weak monitoring and reporting mechanisms, and limited knowledge of laws and rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Root causes and risk factors  
</b></p>
<p>19. As across the globe, the root causes of the sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography are multiple and interlinked. Broken families, social norms, migrating 
parents who sometimes leave children behind, sexual taboos and insufficient sexual 
education (leading to the hypersexualisation of children at a very early age), drug and 
alcohol addiction, school drop out, poverty and unemployment are among the factors that 
render certain children vulnerable to child prostitution and child pornography. Children 
living and/or working in the streets, disabled children in institutions, children not registered 
at birth, children addicted to drugs and/or alcohol, teenage mothers and children living in 
poverty are among the most vulnerable to these practices. At the other end, the highly 
profitable sex industry, increasing consumerism and the demand for services that are 
exploitative of children are among the other root causes of these phenomena.  
</p>
<p>20. During the visit of the Special Rapporteur, the Office of the Ombudsperson for 
Children reported that the school drop-out rate is at 35 per cent. Rates of teenage pregnancy 
have also increased dramatically. The most common form of violence against children in 
Mauritius is intra-familial abuse. The main difficulties facing children in Rodrigues include 
high drop out rates, intrafamilial abuse, failing parents and parental alcoholism, as well as 
teenage pregnancy, in part due to insufficient and inadequate sexual education. Between 
2003 and 2009, 3,800 cases were reported to CDU in Mauritius. The number jumped to 
6,021 cases reported in 2010 alone, and in the first two months of 2011, 549 cases had 
already been reported. The nature of these cases is diverse, including neglect, abuse, sexual 
promiscuity, violence and prostitution. CDU reports that approximately 493 children are 
currently placed in residential care institutions. 
</p>
<p>21. Rodrigues suffers also from a high rate of unemployment, which has a significant 
impact on the family. Reportedly, parents leave Rodrigues to go to Mauritius, in an attempt </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>to find better jobs, leaving their children behind in the care of grandparents or other family 
members. Another concern is that children do not believe that school will bring any added 
value to their lives: the lack of viable job opportunities after high school graduation 
reportedly leads youth to drop out of high school.  
</p>
<p>22. The phenomenon of child prostitution mostly affects children who have been 
sexually, physically and emotionally abused; children from broken families, and with 
parents suffering from alcoholism and drug abuse; dropouts; and children living in poverty. 
According to the national survey, for those children for whom both parents were alive, 
almost half the parents do not live together. Furthermore, the study noted that nearly 95 per 
cent of the child victims had been to school, but that only 18.8 per cent were going to 
school at the time of the survey, indicating a high drop-out rate. A total of 62.6 per cent of 
the children had a family member or close relation working as sex worker, usually their 
own mothers. The link between sexual abuse and sexual exploitation was also cited by 
several interlocutors. 
</p>
<p>23. Sex education has been included in the school curriculum in Mauritius. However, in 
the absence of truly effective sex education programmes, the proliferation of images and 
videos available through information and communication technologies may serve as the 
basis for children&#8217;s first ideas about sexuality and sexual behavior, increasing their risk of 
early sexualization, mimicking behavior, or becoming victims of this behaviour. 
</p>
<p>24. Most stakeholders insisted on the need for an in-depth study to be undertaken on the 
root causes and risk factors of sale and sexual exploitation of children in Mauritius. 
Existing official statistics are outdated, and new trends have emerged. Such a study would 
not only allow policymakers to understand the phenomena more completely and target 
interventions, but would also identify new trends that could inform prevention strategies.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Measures to combat and prevent the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International and regional human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>25. Mauritius ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990. It has also 
ratified the Optional Protocols thereto: the Optional Protocol on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict in 2009, and the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography in 2011. During her visit the Special Rapporteur 
reminded the Government that its consolidated third, fourth and fifth periodic report to the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child has been overdue since March 2011. 
</p>
<p>26. Mauritius is also party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and the Optional Protocol thereto, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and the Optional Protocol thereto, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Optional Protocol thereto, and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (signature only of the Optional 
Protocol thereto).  
</p>
<p>27. Mauritius has ratified International Labour Organization Conventions No. 138 
(1973) concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment and No. 182 (1999) 
concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of 
Child Labour. It has also ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking 
in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>against Transnational Organized Crime and the Hague Convention on Protection of 
Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption. 
</p>
<p>28. Mauritius is a Member State of the African Union, and has ratified the African 
Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights as well as the African Charter on the Rights and 
Welfare of the Child.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Domestic legal and regulatory framework  
</b></p>
<p>29. The Child Protection Act 1994 is the principal domestic legal instrument governing 
child protection. The Act was amended in 1998, 2005 and 2008.  
</p>
<p>30. Mauritius is currently preparing a consolidated children&#8217;s bill, further to the 
recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2006 (CRC/C/MUS/CO/2, 
para. 11), which is intended to harmonize existing legislation on the rights of the child, and 
to ensure full domestic harmonization with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The 
Parliamentary Counsel informed the Special Rapporteur that the consolidated children&#8217;s bill would then effectively replace the Child Protection Act, as well as include relevant cross-
references to the Civil Code and the Criminal Code.  
</p>
<p>31. The Child Protection Act defines a &#8213;child&#8214; as &#8213;any unmarried child under the age of 
18&#8214;. Under section 14, paragraph 2, of the Act, a child is deemed to be &#8213;sexually abused&#8214; 
where he has taken part, whether as a willing or unwilling participant or observer, in any 
act which is sexual in nature for the purposes of (a) another person&#8217;s gratification; (b) any 
</p>
<p>activity of pornographic, obscene or indecent nature; or (c) any other kind of exploitation 
by any person. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Sale of children  
</b></p>
<p>32. Subsection 13(A), paragraph (4)(a), of the Child Protection Act provides that any 
person who takes part in any transaction the object or one of the objects of which is to 
transfer or confer, wholly or partly, temporarily or permanently, the possession, custody or 
control of a child in return for any valuable consideration shall, on conviction, be liable to 
penal servitude for a term not exceeding 30 years.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the definition is currently under the subsection 
&#8213;Child trafficking&#8214;, since the concepts of &#8213;sale&#8214; and &#8213;trafficking&#8214; should be kept distinct.  
</p>
<p>34. Regulating the process of adoption is one of the legal means to prevent the sale of 
children. Pursuant to the Combating Trafficking in Persons Act 2009, &#8213;trafficking&#8214; includes 
the adoption of a person facilitated or secured through illegal means, for the purpose of 
exploitation. 
</p>
<p>35. Furthermore, section 64 of the National Adoption Council Act 1987 prohibits the 
making or receiving of payment or reward for and in consideration of the adoption of a 
child. The prohibition applies to the prospective adoptive parent, to whomever gives his 
consent for the adoption; and to whomever transfers the care and control of child with a 
view to his adoption. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Child prostitution  
</b></p>
<p>36. Section 14, paragraph 1, of the Child Protection Act provides that any person who 
causes, incites or allows any child (a) to be sexually abused by him or by another person; 
(b) to have access to a brothel; or (c) to engage in prostitution, shall commit an offence.  
</p>
<p>37. Section 253 of the Criminal Code prohibits &#8213;procuring, enticing and exploiting a 
prostitute&#8214;. In the case of a child being procured, enticed or exploited, motives or gain are </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>irrelevant. Any person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on conviction to a 
term of imprisonment of not more than twenty years<b> </b>together with a fine not exceeding 
200,000 rupees. Section 90 of the Criminal Code Supplementary Act 1998 provides that 
where a person related to premises used as a brothel permits a minor to use the premises, he 
shall be liable on conviction to be sentenced to a to a fine not exceeding 200,000 rupees 
together with imprisonment for a term not less than 2 years and not exceeding 10 years.. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>38. Section 15, paragraph 1, of the Child Protection Act prohibits the taking, 
distribution, showing, possession with intention to distribute or to show, of any indecent 
photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child. It is also prohibited to publish or cause to be 
published any advertisement likely to be understood as conveying that the advertiser 
distributes or shows such indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph, or intends to do so. 
The definition of a photograph includes data stored on a computer disc or by other 
electronic means which is capable of conversion into a photograph. 
</p>
<p>39. Section 15, paragraph 3, of the Child Protection Act provides that where (a) the 
impression conveyed by the pseudo-photograph is that the person shown is a child; or (b) 
the predominant impression conveyed is that the person shown is a child, notwithstanding 
that some of the physical characteristics shown are those of an adult, the pseudo-
photograph shall be treated for all purposes of the Act as showing a child. The penalty is a 
fine not exceeding 100,000 rupees and to penal servitude for a term not exceeding 20 years. 
</p>
<p>40. Under section 46 of the Information and Communication Technologies Act 2001, it 
is an offence to use information and communication services (including telecommunication 
services) for the transmission or reception of a message which is grossly offensive, or of an 
indecent, obscene or menacing character. The penalty upon conviction is a fine not 
exceeding 1,000,000 rupees and imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. A child 
online safety bill is currently in the draft stage. 
</p>
<p>41. The Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Act 2003 provides for preservation orders, 
production orders and deletion orders. Pursuant to section 13, a judge may issue an order 
compelling any service provider to submit subscriber information in relation to such 
services in that service provider&#8217;s possession or control for the purposes of a criminal 
investigation. Furthermore, article 11, paragraph 3 (a), of the Combating of Trafficking in 
Persons Act (2009) provides that every Internet service provider operating in Mauritius is 
obligated to report to the police any site on its server that contains information in 
contravention of subsection 2 (b), which makes it an offence for any person to knowingly 
advertise, publish, print, broadcast, distribute or cause the advertisement, publication, 
broadcast, or distribution of, information that suggests or alludes to trafficking by any 
means. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Juvenile justice and protection of victims/witnesses 
</b></p>
<p>42. Pursuant to the Courts Act, proceedings involving persons under the age of 18 may 
be held in camera (sect. 161A). Furthermore, section 161B provides that the Court may 
allow a complainant in a sexual offence case to appear before it, and depose, through such 
live video or live television link system as may be approved. However, the Special 
Rapporteur was discouraged to learn that, despite this provision, live video or live 
television link systems have not been set up in courtrooms across the country. She also 
regrets the absence of child-friendly spaces within courtrooms. There are currently no 
provisions for legal assistance for children either as victims or as accused, the need for 
which the Director for Public Prosecutions described as urgent.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>43. Section 18 of the Juvenile Offenders&#8217; Act provides for the possibility of removing a 
juvenile to and detaining him or her in the Rehabilitation Youth Centre, where a parent or 
guardian of that juvenile represents on oath that he is unable to control the juvenile and 
desires him to be sent to such a centre, and undertakes to pay the expenses of the 
maintenance of the juvenile until he attains the age of 18 or for a shorter period. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Pending processes 
</b></p>
<p>44. Mauritius is undergoing a review of its legal framework (including civil and penal 
legislation) relating to preventing and prohibiting the phenomena of the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this process, and stresses that the legal framework 
should include specific provisions related to prohibition, prosecution, protection, care, 
assistance and prevention, accompanied by binding measures and mechanisms of 
implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Institutional framework  
</b></p>
<p>46. The main governmental ministry tasked with child protection is the Ministry of 
Gender Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare, consisting of four units: Gender; 
Planning and Research; Family Welfare; and Child Development.  
</p>
<p>47. CDU is the principal unit charged with child protection. Its objectives are to provide, 
inter alia, protection services for victims of violence, abuse and neglect; hotline services; 
alternative care to abused children (including temporary removal to shelters for children in 
distress, foster care, and as a last resort, placement in a charitable institution); and 
informative, educational and communications campaigns on child rights/development. 
</p>
<p>48. Other governmental agencies intervene in matters related to the protection of 
children. The Ministry of Social Security, National Solidarity and Reform Institutions 
operates two kinds of centres for children in conflict with the law: Rehabilitation Youth 
Centres (for boys and girls) and Probation Centres (one for boys, one for girls).1 However, 
according to information received, child victims of commercial sexual exploitation as well 
as children at risk are sometimes placed in these centres. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>49. Educational social workers from the Ministry of Education and Human Resources 
are posted to the four educational zones of the Ministry to respond to requests relating to 
school children at risk, by conducting home visits and referring cases as appropriate. They 
are often contacted by the Office of the Ombudsperson for Children if the latter identifies 
children at risk of violence within a school. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>50. The newly created Ministry for Social Integration and Economic Empowerment 
focuses on the eradication of poverty, and houses the National Empowerment Foundation 
and the Corporate Social Responsibility programme. It is also in the process of setting up 
child day-care institutions in vulnerable areas around the island. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>51. The police has specialized units relevant to child protection: the Police Family 
Protection Unit, the Brigade pour la protection des mineurs, the Child Protection Unit 
(seconded from CDU), the Crime Prevention Unit and the Information Technology Unit, 
which deals with cybercrime. The Minors&#8217; Brigade operates an emergency response 
service, which patrols the streets in certain hot zones and undertakes crackdowns with a 
</p>
<p>  
 1  See paragraphs 75-79 below for more information on these centres. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>view to protecting children from predators. These zones include bus terminals, commercial 
arcades, and video game houses. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Ministry of Health and Quality of Life operates five main hospitals and a 
network of primary health-care centres across the country, providing consultations, HIV 
testing, counselling, vaccinations, monitoring and services for pregnant women. The 
Special Rapporteur noted with concern the absence of child-friendly spaces within these 
centres. Representatives of the Ministry expressed their wish to have dedicated sessions for 
unmarried pregnant teenagers. Medical social workers at the centres cooperate with CDU 
by referring and reporting on cases of child abuse and neglect. The Ministry also runs the 
National Agency for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Substance Abusers, and informed 
the Special Rapporteur about the possible establishment of a children&#8217;s hospital. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>53. The National Children&#8217;s Council is a para-governmental entity created in 1990 
following the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It operates as the 
executive arm of the child protection mechanism and is independent. It focuses on 
prevention programmes, including collaborating with the &#201;cole des Parents initiative 
(schools for parents), community child watch and district child protection committees (see 
para. 64 below) and runs Children&#8217;s Clubs for children between 3 and 18 years of age in 22 
areas across the country.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Office of the Director for Public Prosecutions is an independent entity 
consisting of approximately 35 lawyers who initiate and undertake criminal procedures and 
prosecutions. Since children do not currently have access to their own lawyers, in some 
cases the Office of the Director for Public Prosecutions fills this role or may appoint a 
lawyer for the child victim(s), as is the case in the ongoing online child pornography 
prosecution.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur also met with judges from the District Court and from the 
Intermediate Court. The District Court covers cases relating to children in conflict with the 
law, including children &#8213;beyond control&#8214;, which, the Special Rapporteur learned, often 
</p>
<p>include cases of children involved in prostitution; it also covers cases relating to abandoned 
children. The District Court issues emergency protection orders, and has the authority to 
place children in probation homes, or in the Rehabilitation Youth Centre, after listening to 
the parents and referring to the report prepared by the police and the probation office. 
Conferences are also held with the children themselves.  
</p>
<p>56. The National Adoption Council processes cases of international adoption, by non-
citizens, of Mauritian children who have not attained 18 years of age. According to the 
National Adoption Council, there are between 15 and 18 international adoptions per year. 
The average age of adopted children is six to nine months. A process is currently ongoing 
to enable the Council to operate as a &#8213;central authority&#8214; within the meaning of the Hague 
</p>
<p>Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption. 
Currently, an application is made to the Council for the adoption of a child; upon receipt of 
the application the Council makes an inquiry, and pronounces itself on the application 
within 60 days. Where it is satisfied that possibilities for placement of the child within 
Mauritius have been given due consideration and that the demand will be in the best 
interests of the child, the Council authorizes an application for adoption to be made to the 
Supreme Court.2 
</p>
<p>57. National adoptions are currently not regulated by the National Adoption Council, 
but the Council informed the Special Rapporteur that the National Adoption Council Act 
will be amended to regulate national adoptions. Currently, the prospective adoptive parents 
</p>
<p>  
 2 National Adoption Council Act, section 6. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>must search for and identify an adoptable child themselves, often on the basis of a list of 
charitable institutions provided by the Council, and an order is made by a judge in 
chambers.  
</p>
<p>58. The Office of the Ombudsperson for Children was established in 2003, pursuant to 
the Ombudsperson for Children Act. The Special Rapporteur notes that the establishment of 
this Office is a good practice in terms of compliance with the principles relating to the 
status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris 
Principles) and Committee on the Rights of the Child general comment No. 2 (2002) on the 
role of independent national human rights institutions in the promotion and protection of 
the rights of the child. 
</p>
<p><b>  Inter-institutional coordination 
</b></p>
<p>59. Stakeholders cited examples of frequent inter-institutional coordination. For 
example, the National Computer Board is collaborating with the Ministry of Gender 
Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare and the Ombudsperson to prepare the 
Child Safety Online Action Plan. The Special Rapporteur learned of a protocol of 
collaboration between numerous Ministries for the promotion of children&#8217;s rights and 
protection of children against child abuse, including commercial sexual exploitation. The 
protocol outlines the tasks of each Ministry, and provides guidance on responses to cases or 
detected cases of violence against children, including when to report or refer cases, and to 
whom. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>60. A high-powered committee was also set up under the chairpersonship of the 
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Rights, Child 
Development and Family Welfare. It includes representatives from the Prime Minister&#8217;s 
Office and other key governmental ministries, the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and the 
National Children&#8217;s Council. Its objective is to refine the roles and responsibilities of each 
</p>
<p>party in order to give effect to collective action in dealing with cases relating to children.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>61. Nevertheless, all stakeholders highlighted ongoing difficulties of coordination and 
cooperation among different governmental agencies as well as with civil society 
representatives, including a lack of understanding of the respective responsibilities of each 
stakeholder regarding responses to cases, underpinned by the lack of a strategic framework 
for the protection of the rights of the child. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. National policies, strategies and programmes 
</b></p>
<p>62. In May 2003, the Government adopted the National Children&#8217;s Policy, pursuant to 
the commitment it undertook at the special session of the General Assembly on Children in 
May 2002. In the policy the Government noted a number of areas of concern, including an 
increase in the incidence of commercial sexual exploitation of children, an increasing 
number of street children and an increase in the number of broken families. The 
Government followed up with a plan of action in March 2004, to translate the National 
Children&#8217;s Policy into strategies, programmes and projects for implementation.  
</p>
<p>63. The Government adopted the National Plan of Action on the Protection of Children 
against Sexual Abuse, including Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (2003-2004); 
however this has not been renewed since. The Government also adopted the Child Safety 
Online Action Plan (2009) and the National Sexual Health and Reproductive Plan (2009-
2015). 
</p>
<p>64. CDU has created a number of programmes with a view to fulfilling its mandate. A 
Child Mentoring Programme has been in preparation since 2008. While the Programme is 
not yet functional, the Special Rapporteur welcomes its objectives and the rationale behind </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>it. The Programme is geared towards children between the ages of 10 to 16 who suffer from 
behavioural problems, and will match them with trained adult mentors, so as to bring about 
positive changes in the lives of the mentees. The Unit has also established the National 
Parental Empowerment Programme, as well as 20 <i>&#233;coles des parents</i> across the island. No 
such parental education programmes have yet been set up in Rodrigues, despite urgent 
requests from interlocutors. The Community Child Protection Programme includes 
community childwatch committees, as well as area, district and national child protection 
committees. Community child watch committees are set up in 20 high-risk areas to act as a 
surveillance mechanism to identify children vulnerable to abuse and at risk, and to report 
any suspected case to the Ministry of Gender Equality, Child Development and Family 
Welfare so that action may be taken. 
</p>
<p>65. As these programmes are currently in the process of being developed and in some 
cases, implemented, the Special Rapporteur cannot assess their impact in assisting child 
victims of sexual exploitation and other forms of violence. She looks forward to receiving 
information on their development, implementation and evaluation. 
</p>
<p>66. Following her visit, the Special Rapporteur was encouraged to learn that the 
Government is currently developing a comprehensive national child protection strategy. It 
aims to redefine the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders, including CDU, in 
order for the latter to be alleviated of some of the duties it currently undertakes and to 
concentrate on the coordination of child protection services. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Specific programmes and services 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Identification, protection, care and assistance for child victims and witnesses  
</b></p>
<p>67. Providing effective protection for child victims of prostitution and pornography 
requires an interdisciplinary and holistic approach that can follow the child from the 
moment of detection/identification, to care and assistance programmes which may include a 
shelter or work within the community and medical, legal and psychosocial care, to 
rehabilitation, reintegration and follow-up. The Special Rapporteur observes the absence of 
a clear mechanism in the country where responsibilities are delineated, and with adequately 
resourced and trained staff to work with child victims of sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Detection/identification and referral 
</i></p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the establishment by law of child-sensitive 
complaints and reporting mechanisms that are well publicized and, for the most part, 
available to children and adults, including adults acting on behalf of children. Several actors 
operate as such mechanisms, namely CDU officials, both within the Ministry and out-
posted at Family Support Bureaus; health professionals; and the Office of the 
Ombudsperson for Children. CDU runs a hotline and responds to calls of allegations of 
child abuse and neglect. An encouraging practice is the hotline (800 2378) operated by the 
National Computer Board for reporting cases of abuse on the Internet. 
</p>
<p>69. Family Service Bureaus, under the aegis of the Ministry of Gender Equality, Child 
Development and Family Welfare, are set up across the country, and are composed of 
family welfare protection officers and one psychologist from CDU, two care workers 
(involved in mainly administrative tasks), two seconded police officers, and a family unit 
(which provides family counselling). They receive calls and walk-ins relating to alleged 
cases of harm to children. Family welfare protection officers sometimes go on site to visit 
the family and speak with the child; they prepare a report and, where necessary, apply to 
the court for an emergency protection order under the Child Protection Act (see paras. 75-
76 below).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Ministry of Health and Quality of Life has been preparing draft guidelines, 
which at the time of the visit were almost finalized, on how to detect and refer cases of 
child abuse within the hospital. The Ministry reported that it will brief all relevant actors, 
including doctors and nurses, on how to refer cases to medical social workers for effective 
follow-up and referral, as appropriate, to CDU. 
</p>
<p>71. However, the Special Rapporteur is particularly alarmed that children involved in 
prostitution can be considered as children &#8213;beyond control&#8214; of their parents. As such, they 
</p>
<p>can be placed in probation centres upon court order, further to reports prepared by the 
Probation and After-care Service. During her visit to a probation centre, the Special 
Rapporteur was concerned that some children had been placed there due to precocious 
sexual behavior. Police officers admitted that one major challenge they face is how to 
effectively identify child victims of sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>72. CDU officers described significant difficulties encountered in their work: extremely 
long hours; the quantity of cases referred to them meant that effective follow-up was 
impossible; insufficient training and specialization of staff; and difficulties in coordinating 
with other governmental ministries. A significant amount of their time involves responding 
to emergencies, leaving little time and resources for prevention, rehabilitation, reintegration 
and follow-up. Currently, only nine family welfare and protection officers service the entire 
island, and there is only one such officer for Rodrigues. CDU has become known as the 
reference point for cases involving children, meaning that they receive numerous calls and 
complaints that are not all cases of child victims or children at risk of becoming victims of 
abuse or exploitation.  
</p>
<p>73. The Office of the Ombudsperson for Children notes the absence of a cross-cutting 
child-friendly approach within the main institutions working with children, including 
increased measures to protect the confidentiality and privacy of child victims in police 
stations. Furthermore, stakeholders pointed to the limited effectiveness of child-friendly 
complaints and reporting mechanisms. One promising practice is the ability to contact the 
Ombudsperson for Children directly by text message. 
</p>
<p>74. In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur notes significant difficulties in the 
detection of child victims of sale, prostitution and pornography, and how victims are treated 
in the system. She expresses concern about overlapping duties between relevant actors, and 
unclear definition of roles and responsibilities.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Care and assistance programmes and services 
</i></p>
<p>75. Under section 4 of the Child Protection Act, a district magistrate may issue an 
&#8213;emergency protection order&#8214; where she or he is satisfied by information on oath that the 
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Child Development has reasonable cause to believe 
that a child is &#8213;suffering or likely to suffer significant harm&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>76. An emergency protection order allows CDU to, inter alia, enter any premises 
specified in the order and search for the child; remove or return the child, or prevent the 
child&#8217;s removal from, any place of safety; and request police or medical assistance. An 
emergency protection order has a duration of 14 days. Furthermore, where the Permanent 
Secretary has reasonable grounds to believe that a child is ill-treated, neglected, abandoned, 
destitute or otherwise exposed to harm, a court may make an interim order for that child to 
be placed in a &#8213;place of safety&#8214;3 for a period of 14 days, which can be extended for a 
</p>
<p>  
 3 A &#8213;place of safety&#8214; is defined in the Child Protection Act as any place designated by the Minister to 
</p>
<p>whom responsibility for the subject of child development and family welfare is assigned, and 
includes, inter alia, a foster home and a hospital.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>further period of 14 days, until the final determination of the application. A court can also 
issue a &#8213;committal order&#8214; by placing a child in a place of safety until the age of 18 or for a 
shorter period. &#8213;Places of safety&#8214; are run either by the Government or by civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations, and receive children referred by CDU officials or the police.  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur visited La Colombe shelter at Pointe aux Sables, which is 
run by the National Children&#8217;s Council under the aegis of the Ministry of Gender Equality, 
Child Development and Family Welfare. While it is equipped to accommodate 60 children, 
at the time of the visit, 150 children were staying at the shelter. CDU refers children to this 
shelter. The Special Rapporteur was alarmed by the wide range of profiles of children 
staying at the shelter, including physically and/or sexually abused children, abandoned 
children, and children living and/or working in the streets. The age range was from 3 
months to 17 years. She emphasized that effective, specialized care and assistance cannot 
be delivered when such a broad range of children, with such a broad range of needs, are 
placed together. Authorities report that additional shelters are being built: Cap Malheureux 
for 32 boys, Floreal for 20 babies and Belle Rose for 20 girls. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur also visited the Drop-in Centre at Bell Village. Since 
opening in 2003, it has been managed by the Mauritius Family Welfare and Planning 
Association. While the centre was originally established to address the needs of child 
victims of sexual exploitation, it has become a counselling and information centre for 
pregnant teenagers, such cases accounting for 50 to 60 per cent of registered cases. Staff 
mentioned insufficient human and financial resources and the insufficient amount of 
specialized training received to address cases of victims of sexual exploitation, abuse and 
neglect. Furthermore, the staff regrets its inability to offer viable methods of reintegration 
and rehabilitation for child victims. Civil society organizations run centres to receive child 
victims of a wide variety of forms of violence. 
</p>
<p>79. Despite various training programmes, there is still a need to strengthen and expand 
adapted and sustainable training for professionals, particularly those working with child 
victims and witnesses, such as teachers, police, judges, prosecutors, and medical and social 
workers. Police in Rodrigues raised the need for more training on child sexual tourism and 
cybercrime. There is a need to strengthen transnational cooperative efforts that facilitate the 
sharing of information and technical expertise, since the development of information 
technologies, trafficking networks, tourism, migration and the sale and exploitation of 
children know no borders. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Child witnesses and treatment within the justice system 
</i></p>
<p>80. The Director of Public Prosecutions shared some challenges faced in prosecuting 
cases related to child abuse, including sexual exploitation. Victims rarely come forward due 
to the taboo surrounding the issue. If the perpetrator is a family member, the issue tends to 
be settled out of court. Thus, the need for increased use of video testimony was raised, in 
order to permit the victim to feel safer in reporting and testifying about a case; the first case 
of recourse to such testimony is the ongoing case of online child pornography against a 
schoolmaster. The Special Rapporteur also regrets the absence of child-friendly spaces in 
courtrooms. Another challenge relates to procedural delays in the justice system. In 
response, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has instituted a &#8213;fast-track&#8214; 
system for victims of sexual abuse. Furthermore, several interlocutors highlighted the fact 
that children are rarely granted legal representation. The authorities indicated that CDU is 
creating a pool of legal resource persons to provide such legal representation. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Follow-up  
</i></p>
<p>81. All stakeholders mentioned the lack of follow-up once children are released from the 
various child-care institutions or centres. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by her </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>visit to the sole non-governmental organization (NGO) that runs a programme for girls 
above 18 who are placed there once released from a centre or an institution. It is considered 
a &#8213;halfway house&#8214;, providing psychological counselling as well as career and life 
orientation services.  
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur is alarmed at the number of children currently placed in 
institutional care where adequate norms and standards for care and assistance are lacking. 
Existing centres or points of contact lack the specialized services necessary to receive, treat, 
accompany and adequately address child victims of prostitution. Rather, the authorities tend 
to revert to placement in institutional care due to a lack of viable and effective alternatives 
for care and assistance for child victims of sexual exploitation. Furthermore, virtually all 
stakeholders admitted that they have neither the adequate time nor the resources to 
undertake effective rehabilitation and reintegration programmes for children in their care. 
The Special Rapporteur notes that while certain services exist, they are not provided 
according to a multidisciplinary and holistic approach. Bearing in mind the serious 
physical, psychological and emotional consequences of crime and victimization for victims 
and witnesses, services should include financial aid, free legal assistance, counselling, 
health and medical care, and educational services, as well as psychosocial recovery, 
rehabilitation and reintegration services. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Preventive measures 
</b></p>
<p>83. The Government has instituted numerous activities aimed at preventing the sexual 
exploitation and abuse of children, and at tackling root causes. The police runs information, 
education and communication campaigns in the schools, including annual workshops on 
child sexual abuse, aimed at informing children about relevant laws and the risks of 
dropping out of school and empowering children, and organizes awareness-raising activities 
for parents. CDU runs awareness-raising campaigns and provides trainings for its staff 
working on the issue of child sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>84. Considerable efforts are also being undertaken in child online safety. The National 
Computer Board, particularly the Mauritian Computer Emergency Response Team, runs 
activities in the &#8213;Safer Internet Day&#8214; framework to sensitize children on child pornography, 
risks related to social networking, gaming and sexting. It has published guidelines on its 
cybersecurity portal for children and parents and organizes awareness-raising sessions in 
schools. Cyber Caravans go to community centres and youth clubs and talk to children 
about Internet safety. The Ministry of Education and Human Resources also runs 
sensitization campaigns on child online safety. 
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur was particularly encouraged by the work of the National 
Empowerment Foundation. The initiative provides single mothers with social housing, 
allowances and benefits such as family support, and offers drug therapy programmes for 
adults. More particularly, the National Empowerment Foundation&#8217;s Child and Family 
</p>
<p>Development Programme, established in April 2011, targets the needs of children aged 0 to 
18 in areas designated under the Eradication of Absolute Poverty programme. Activities 
include building day-care centres; providing school materials, training for day-care workers 
and social workers, and after-school care programmes; cooperating with NGOs that work 
with children living and/or working in the street on a pilot project for street educators; and 
developing a family planning programme for young mothers and pregnant teenagers. 
However, interlocutors emphasized the need to increase employment opportunities, 
particularly in Rodrigues. 
</p>
<p>86. According to the police, one major challenge is tackling demand for services that are 
exploitative of children, as no programmes or policies currently address the issue of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>demand. In 2008, the Ministry of Tourism and Leisure prepared a brochure to raise 
awareness about child sex tourism. 
</p>
<p>87. Another worrying situation is the lack of effective sex education in schools, and the 
taboo of the subject within homes and the community. The current situation creates 
confusion and lack of understanding about sexuality, situations of precocious sexuality, 
particularly for pre-teenage children, and an environment where children do not feel safe or 
secure discussing issues related to sexuality with their families and within their 
communities. While the Ministry of Education and Human Resources claims that there are 
sexual education programmes in the schools, reportedly, in practice, these are inadequate 
and are not sufficiently targeted to the real issues faced by teenagers and pre-teenagers 
when it comes to their sexual practices. As a result, stakeholders report that rates of teenage 
pregnancy are on the increase, as is precocious sexual activity. The latter is deemed to be 
&#8213;deviant&#8214; behavior, which parents cannot &#8213;control&#8214;. The Ministry of Education and Human 
Resources, in collaboration with all stakeholders, is reportedly seeking to strengthen the sex 
education programme for secondary schools and upper primary classes, and is producing a 
DVD on sex education for primary schools. The Ministry of Health and Quality of Life will 
carry out a global school-based survey on the sexual behavior of pupils at Form II, III and 
IV levels. 
</p>
<p>88. Stakeholders also raised the urgent need for mental health care, which remains 
insufficient if not absent in certain parts of the country, particularly in Rodrigues.  
</p>
<p>89. Limited birth registration was also cited as an obstacle. The Special Rapporteur 
reiterates the importance of establishing a national adoption legal framework and the 
follow-up support for teenage single mothers, with a view to preventing the sale of children 
for the purpose of adoption.  
</p>
<p>90. In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur observes that more can be done to 
create an effective protective environment for children against all forms of violence, abuse 
and exploitation, by involving all relevant partners, including community and religious 
leaders and the private sector. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  G. Child participation  
</b></p>
<p>91. The National Children&#8217;s Committee was, at the time of the visit, in the process of 
being established, within the framework of the National Children&#8217;s Council. Children 
participate in community clubs and associations and within student councils. School 
Rectors are required to consult students for the effective running of the school. While 
children receive information on their rights, the Special Rapporteur noted the need for 
reinforced and systematized participation of children in policies and programmes affecting 
them. For instance, peer-to-peer education on commercial sexual exploitation of children 
can be a valuable tool for promoting and protecting the rights of children.  
</p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur recalls that child participation consists of the right of each 
child to express her or his views and to have these views taken into consideration in all 
matters that directly or indirectly concern her or his life, with the objective of influencing 
decision-making and achieving change, pursuant to article 12 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. Children are not only victims or vulnerable to being victims, but can 
and should actively take part in finding solutions; they must be empowered to fight for their 
own protection and that of their peers.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b> H. Cooperation with the private sector 
</b></p>
<p>93. The Special Rapporteur was particularly encouraged by the Corporate Social 
Responsibility programme, run by the National Empowerment Foundation. The programme 
requires any for-profit company registered in Mauritius to contribute 2 per cent of its book 
profit after income tax in order to set up a fund to finance corporate social responsibility 
activities. Funds can be used to finance programmes by, inter alia, approved NGOs. One of 
the areas of intervention for such activities is socio-economic development, which includes 
gender and human rights. Issues falling in that area include those relating to youth and 
children, such as awareness/prevention of sexual abuse and support for children victims of 
sexual abuse, support for street children, sex education and youth empowerment. 
</p>
<p>94. Some interlocutors expressed concerns about the lack of transparency of corporate 
social responsibility procedures relating to accrediting NGOs and disbursing funds. 
Corporate social responsibility guidelines and criteria for funding projects are currently 
being reviewed with a view to making them more accessible. Stakeholders also stated that 
the follow-up of implemented projects was weak. Others felt that the capacities of NGOs to 
design and implement effective projects to be funded by such funds required strengthening. 
For instance, submitted projects were often duplicative.  
</p>
<p>95. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur did observe, albeit to a limited extent, 
involvement and partnerships with other private sector actors, such as travel and tourism 
agencies, Internet service providers, telecommunication companies, banks, trade unions in 
the transportation sector, and the media. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Monitoring  
</b></p>
<p>96. The Ombudsperson for Children is appointed by the President for a term of four 
years, renewable once. Its functions include: making proposals on legislation, policies and 
practices regarding services for, or the rights of, children; advising the Minister of Gender 
Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare on residential placement facilities and 
shelters established for the benefit of children; and advising institutions responsible for 
providing children with care and other services on the protection of the rights of children.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>97. Notably, the Ombudsperson has the power: to initiate an investigation whenever she 
considers that there is, has been or is likely to be, a violation of the rights of a child; to 
investigate cases relating to the situation of children in the family, in schools and in all 
other institutions, as well as cases of abandoned children or street children; and to 
investigate complaints made by a child, or any other person, in relation to the rights of any 
child. For the purposes of any investigation, the Ombudsperson may enter premises where a 
child is present in order to study its suitability for a child or where there is reasonable 
ground to believe that the moral and physical safety of a child may be in danger. Following 
an investigation, the Ombudsperson is to act as mediator to resolve any dispute; make a 
report to such authority as the Ombudsperson considers appropriate; and make proposals to 
the Minister. However, the Ombudsperson is not mandated to remove a child from a home 
or institution: only CDU officials have that capacity.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>98. Another noteworthy activity of the Ombudsperson is the organization of 
multidisciplinary case conferences, which gather professionals from different sectors to 
explore a case from their respective fields, and to design a care plan for the child 
concerned. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>99. The current Ombudsperson will end her term in December 2011 after having served 
for eight years. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to being informed once the new 
Ombudsperson is appointed. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>100. However, there remains a need to establish rigorous monitoring mechanisms to 
follow up and evaluate national child protection policies, strategies and programmes. 
Monitoring should include a review of steps taken, progress achieved and possible 
impediments faced in the implementation of political commitments that have been 
undertaken and subjected to periodic reporting to Parliament and the general public.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> J. International and regional cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>101. The Special Rapporteur met with a number of technical partners present in 
Mauritius. To varying degrees they are involved in technical cooperation activities, 
including trainings on commercial sexual exploitation of children and trafficking, and 
grants for civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p>102. The Special Rapporteur heard repeated calls from governmental and non-
governmental stakeholders for a special advisor who could provide the Government with 
technical assistance in designing a holistic, multidisciplinary child protection strategy, with 
clear and identifiable roles, accountability, monitoring and follow-up mechanisms. 
Stakeholders support the initiative that such technical assistance be provided under the 
aegis of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in the country. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts of UNDP and UNICEF in examining 
the possibility of a more long-term technical partnership between the Government and 
UNICEF and how UNDP and the Government might facilitate a resumption by UNICEF of 
its role in the country.   
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The Special Rapporteur recognizes that the Government has established a set 
of laws, policies and institutions, and mobilized considerable financial resources, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>enhance the protection of children from sale, prostitution and pornography, and child 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights more generally, with a specific focus on equity and poverty reduction. However, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government is struggling to have an efficient sustained impact on the lives of 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerable children, namely due to poor inter-institutional coordination, weak policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>coherence and ineffective multisectoral approaches. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>She welcomes the current process underpinned by a clear political commitment 
to overcome these challenges, as well as the shift away from the fragmented child 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection responses towards the adoption of a rights-based and comprehensive 
</b></p>
<p><b>national child protection strategy. This national child protection strategy is aimed at 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishing a coordinated set of social norms, laws, policies, regulations and services, 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacities, and monitoring and oversight activities across all social sectors</b>&#8212;<b>especially 
</b></p>
<p><b>social welfare, education, health, security, and justice</b>&#8212;<b>to prevent and respond to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexual exploitation of children and other child protection-related issues and risks.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>In the spirit of cooperation and partnership, the Special Rapporteur makes the 
following recommendations to the Government, aimed at consolidating and 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthening ongoing efforts. She is sure that every effort will be made to implement 
</b></p>
<p><b>them and stands ready to offer her full cooperation and assistance in this regard. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to pursue its efforts to 
ensure the full implementation of the Child Protection Strategy in 2011-2012, with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>technical support of United Nations agencies and mechanisms. She recommends that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government consolidate and strengthen ongoing efforts in the design and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of this Strategy, by integrating the following principles and 
</b></p>
<p><b>components in compliance with international standards and norms. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>To be functional and effective, the Strategy must:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) </b>Focus on the child and the promotion of the child&#8217;s best interests as the 
</p>
<p><b>primary consideration; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Be governed by comprehensive laws that are compliant with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards and by national policies and regulations (establishing 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandates, responsibilities, standards and systems of supervision to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Include both formal and informal mechanisms, such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>traditional/custom-based authority and community-based organizations, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>formalize their mandate in law and through government regulations;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure that child-sensitive services are available at all levels, regulated 
</b></p>
<p><b>by quality standards (knowledgeable, well-trained staff, adequately resourced) and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessible to all children without discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Integrate ch</b>ildren&#8217;s views and experiences, through effective child 
</p>
<p><b>participation and inclusion;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) </b>Ensure that all providers of children&#8217;s and family services (public sector, 
</p>
<p><b>civil society organizations) are accountable, through effective regulation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitoring at all levels of child protection standards. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>To increase the effectiveness of the Strategy, the Government must strengthen 
its various components (see figure).

</p>
<p>109. <b>To this end, the Special Rapporteur makes the following recommendations.</b> 
</p>
<p>110.<b> The Government should finalize the process of reviewing the legal framework 
prohibiting, preventing and responding to all forms of sale and sexual exploitation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>children, and ensure the effective implementation of the framework through:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The harmonization of national legal (civil and penal) and regulatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>frameworks with ratified international instruments, accompanied by binding 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures and mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The widespread dissemination of information regarding legislation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedural rights, in a user-friendly and adapted way;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The adequate training of judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police officers, 
</b></p>
<p><b>teachers, social workers, and medical and other professionals regarding the rights, 
</b></p>
<p><b>needs and best interests of the child.  
</b></p>
<p>111.<b> The Government should ensure reliable and regular information on both the 
prevalence and knowledge of the phenomena of the sale of children, child prostitution 
</b></p>
<p><b>and child pornography, by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Establishing a standardized and centralized information-gathering 
</b></p>
<p><b>system to collect data disaggregated by sex, age, type of violation and measures taken, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and harmonizing methods of gathering and processing data;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Undertaking qualitative and quantitative surveys and research 
</b></p>
<p><b>regarding both the prevalence and the understanding of these phenomena; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Taking into account the views of children in the processes of data 
</b></p>
<p><b>collection and conducting of research, provided that appropriate safeguards are in 
</b></p>
<p><b>place. 
</b></p>
<p>112.<b> The Government should establish effective coordination and accountability 
mechanisms within the institutional framework, through effective regulation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitoring.  
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The Government should strengthen capacity-building and training 
programmes of key formal and informal structures (such as ministries, agencies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>partners, communities and NGOs) by including information on:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Relevant international human rights norms, standards and principles, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Optional Protocol 
</b></p>
<p><b>thereto on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Signs and symptoms indicating violence and exploitation of children, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the impact, physical and psychological consequences and effects and trauma of 
</b></p>
<p><b>crimes against children;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Sensitivity to age-related, cross-cultural, linguistic, religious, social and 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender issues, and on sensitivity to the particular issues faced by child victims to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure they are treated with respect and care;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Crisis assessment skills and techniques, including with regard to making 
</b></p>
<p><b>referrals and the preservation of confidentiality;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Interviewing and assessment techniques that minimize the possibility of 
</b></p>
<p><b>additional hardship, and other skills to deal with child victims in a sensitive and 
</b></p>
<p><b>constructive manner;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Measures and techniques to assist child victims and witnesses in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice process. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>114.<b> The Government should strengthen child-sensitive complaints, reporting and 
counselling mechanisms by ensuring that they: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Are accessible to all children under the jurisdiction of the State, without 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination of any kind, while being age appropriate and gender sensitive and 
</b></p>
<p><b>granting special protection to children at risk;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) A</b>re guided by the best interests of the child and informed by children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>experiences and perspectives;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Maintain strict confidentiality during proceedings and related processes 
</b></p>
<p><b>and respect the right of the child to privacy;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Guarantee the safety of children, through measures to prevent, inter 
</b></p>

<p><b>(e) Are regularly and systematically monitored to determine if they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>operating in a child-friendly manner, including through safeguarded consultation 
</b></p>
<p><b>with children who have accessed the mechanisms in question. 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>Regarding the identification, care, assistance and follow-up of child victims and 
witness protection, the Government should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Implement precise and adaptable protocols with the participation of all 
</b></p>
<p><b>actors involved in child protection. These protocols should clarify the steps that need 
</b></p>
<p><b>to be taken (from early detection to the full recovery and social integration of 
</b></p>
<p><b>children), and the role and responsibilities of each actor, thereby allowing better 
</b></p>
<p><b>coordination and information sharing;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Strengthen child-friendly justice to provide special and prompt 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection and assistance to child victims and witnesses that is appropriate to their 
</b></p>
<p><b>age, level of maturity and unique needs to prevent further hardship and trauma; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Favour family- or community-based environments, including foster 
</b></p>
<p><b>families and other caregivers and incorporating family support and counselling, over 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutional or residential care; strengthen the provision of appropriate psychosocial 
</b></p>
<p><b>support and mental health services for children; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure that in cases where victims seek compensation for damages from 
</b></p>
<p><b>those legally responsible for a violation, reparation mechanisms take into account the 
</b></p>
<p><b>long-term reintegration, psychosocial and physical issues that are potentially faced by 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure that effective mechanisms incorporate regular follow-up of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>child until full recovery is achieved; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Ensure safe and child-friendly alternative or residential care that can 
</b></p>
<p><b>accommodate the basic needs of child victims, by establishing minimum standards for 
</b></p>
<p><b>alternative and residential care. Centres must be staffed by trained professionals 
</b></p>
<p><b>guided by child-rights standards and ethical principles, supporting the health, self-
</b></p>
<p><b>respect and dignity of the child and in particular promoting the complete physical and 
</b></p>
<p><b>psychological recovery and social integration of all child victims. All registered centres 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be required to provide monthly reports on the children and the details of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>care and transfer. 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>Regarding prevention and child rights promotion, the Government should:   
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure that socio-economic services for children at risk and their 
</b></p>
<p><b>families are available and accessible;   </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure immediate free registration of all children born on the territory, 
</b></p>
<p><b>with special attention paid to unregistered children, children at risk and those in 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized situations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Promote sustainable education and awareness-raising campaigns in 
</b></p>
<p><b>schools and communities, including rural and remote communities, making use of all 
</b></p>
<p><b>forms of media, information and communication technologies, including social 
</b></p>
<p><b>networking tools;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Promote child-protective social norms, involving community leaders to 
</b></p>
<p><b>guide communities in protecting children against all forms of violence, abuse and 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Make available in schools sex education programmes that provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>information on healthy sexual development, safe sex and reproduction, and that 
</b></p>
<p><b>emphasize gender equality, self-respect, empowerment and respect for others;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Provide funding and shared research on the national and transnational 
</b></p>
<p><b>demand for services that exploit children, and analyse the specific context of harmful 
</b></p>
<p><b>and discriminatory social norms (practices, behaviours, attitudes) to inform laws and 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies. 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government systematize child 
participation and ensure that the relevant mechanisms operate in compliance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>internationally recognized standards, with a view to taking into account the opinions 
</b></p>
<p><b>and views of children in all matters that directly or indirectly affect them (including 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategies, laws, programmes, monitoring activities). To this end, the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>should:   
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure the availability of and access to well-publicized information in 
</b></p>
<p><b>local languages and different formats (for children with disabilities) that is suitable for 
</b></p>
<p><b>children of diverse ages and stages of maturity, including the very young;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Empower children to fight for their own protection and that of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>peers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Support child-led initiatives and organizations.  
</b></p>
<p>118.<b> Regarding monitoring and evaluation, the Government should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Strengthen the resources dedicated to the Office of the Ombudsperson 
</b></p>
<p><b>for Children and ensure the appointment of the successor once the current term 
</b></p>
<p><b>expires; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Establish national indicators and mechanisms to ensure rigorous 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitoring and assessment/evaluation. 
</b></p>
<p>119.<b> Regarding corporate social responsibility, the Government should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Develop and strengthen partnerships with the private sector, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly tourism agencies, travel agencies, Internet service providers, 
</b></p>
<p><b>telecommunication companies, banks, trade unions in the transportation sector, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>media;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Adopt corporate social responsibility instruments, such as codes of

<p><b>A/HRC/19/63/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Strengthen the training of the media with regard to the ethical treatment

<p>120.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government enhance 
international and regional cooperation through, inter alia, the exchange of 
</b></p>
<p><b>information and expertise and the sharing and harmonization of practices and tools, 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>121.<b> Lastly, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government continue to
