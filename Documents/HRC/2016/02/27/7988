<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 7/8 and 16/5, the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders conducted an official visit to Ireland from 19 to 
23 November 2012, at the invitation of the Government. The purpose of her visit was to 
assess the situation of human rights defenders in Ireland in the light of the Declaration on 
the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and 
Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (also known as 
the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders), adopted by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 53/144. An examination of the legal framework in the country, institutional 
policies and mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights were of 
particular importance to this assessment. 
</p>
<p>2. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with the President of Ireland, Michael 
D. Higgins; the Joint Parliament (<i>Oireachtas</i>) Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and 
other members of Parliament; the Chief Justice; and the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
She also met with the Minister for Justice and Equality, representatives of the Human 
Rights Unit, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, including with its NGO Standing 
Committee, and Irish Aid. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur met with the Acting Chief 
Executive of the Irish Human Rights Commission and a former Commissioner, as well as 
with the Ombudsman Commission of the Police (<i>Garda S&#237;och&#225;na</i>). She also met with the 
Head of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In 
addition, the Special Rapporteur received a written submission from Shell E&amp;P Ireland.  
</p>
<p>3. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur also held meetings with a wide range of 
defenders and activists representing civil society in Ireland. She is particularly grateful to 
the valuable support provided by the non-governmental organizations Front Line Defenders 
and the Free Legal Aid Centre during the visit.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Ireland for its invitation and its 
outstanding cooperation throughout her visit. She also thanks everyone who took the time 
to meet with her and shared their valuable and important experiences. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>5. The visit was the first ever conducted by a mandate holder on the situation of human 
rights defenders to a member State of the European Union. Ireland has endured a difficult 
period since the economic crisis hit the country in 2008 and its subsequent severe recession. 
This has led to drastic cuts in public expenditure affecting all sectors of society, including 
civil society and defenders.  
</p>
<p>6. The environment in which defenders operate in Ireland generally facilitates the 
defence and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Special Rapporteur 
notes, however, that Ireland has not been very active in disseminating information about the 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders at the domestic level or in raising awareness about 
the specific profile and role of defenders in society, particularly of those working for the 
rights of marginalized communities, such as Travellers and asylum seekers. During the 
visit, the Special Rapporteur also noted that the very term &#8220;defender&#8221; was not always well 
understood, even among public officials. She further noted that there was no national plan 
of action on human rights in Ireland. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.3

</p>
<p><b> III. Legal framework for the promotion and protection of human 
rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International level 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Incorporation of international law  
</b></p>
<p>7. Article 29.5.1 of the Constitution states that every international agreement to which 
the Irish State becomes a party, other than technical or administrative agreements, must 
come before the House of Representatives (<i>D&#225;il &#201;ireann</i>). The automatic incorporation of 
international treaties and conventions into domestic law is prevented under article 29.6 of 
the Constitution. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that this absence of direct 
applicability may hinder the State&#8217;s compliance with obligations contained in international 
agreements to which it is a State party. She also notes the lack of an accountability 
mechanism to oversee the implementation of such international agreements. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. United Nations treaties  
</b></p>
<p>8. As at February 2013, Ireland was a State party to the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights and the First and Second Optional Protocols thereto, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and the Optional Protocol thereto on the involvement of children in armed conflict, 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Optional Protocol thereto, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Ireland ratified the Rome Statute in 2002.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the withdrawal by Ireland in December 2011 of 
its reservation to article 19.2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
which allowed the State to maintain a monopoly on broadcasting and to operate a licensing 
system for broadcasting enterprises. The Special Rapporteur is also pleased to note that, in 
November 2011, Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention against Corruption.  
</p>
<p>10. Ireland has signed but not yet ratified the International Convention for the Protection 
of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. 
</p>
<p>11. Ireland is not yet a State party to the European Convention on the Legal Status of 
Migrant Workers, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Convention on the 
Participation of Foreigners in Public Life at Local Level. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to ratify the United Nations 
treaties that it has signed but not yet ratified, and to sign and ratify the others to which is 
not a party. She believes that the ratification process is particularly important in light of the 
State&#8217;s recent election to the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Council of Europe and European Union  
</b></p>
<p>13. Ireland ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental freedoms in 1953. As a member State of the European Union since 1973, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Ireland is bound by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In 
December 2003, the European Convention on Human Rights Act entered into force, 
thereby making the European Convention part of Irish law, as stipulated by the 
Constitution. Ireland has ratified most of the human rights treaties of the Council of Europe, 
including the Revised Social Charter and its collective complaints procedure. In 2007, 
Ireland signed the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human 
Beings and the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and 
Sexual Abuse.  
</p>
<p><b> B. National level 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Constitution 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Constitution of Ireland (<i>Bunreacht na h &#201;ireann</i>) was adopted by referendum 
on 1 July 1937 and is the basic law of the State. It sets out the form of Government and 
defines the powers of the President (<i>Uachtar&#225;n</i>), the Parliament (<i>Oireachtas</i>), the 
Government and the Courts. The Constitution may be amended only by a referendum, and 
all laws passed by the Parliament must abide by it. Under article 34, the High Court and the 
Supreme Court have the power to assess and determine the constitutionality of any law. In 
the event that a court concludes that a particular law is unconstitutional, that law ceases to 
have any legal effect.  
</p>
<p>15. The Constitution recognizes a broad range of human rights. Articles 40 to 44 outline 
fundamental rights, including equality before the law (art. 40.1), the right to life (arts. 
40.3.2 and 3), personal liberty (art. 40.4), freedom of expression (art. 40.6.1 (i)), freedom of 
assembly (art. 40.6.1 (ii)), freedom of association (art. 40.6.1 (iii), the right to education 
(art. 42), freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion (art. 44).  
</p>
<p>16. In interpreting the provisions of the Constitution, the courts have identified a 
number of rights that, although not expressly referred to in the text of the Constitution, are 
nonetheless provided for by it. These include the right to bodily integrity, freedom from 
torture and from inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the right to legal counsel, 
the right to legal representation in certain criminal cases, and the right to fair procedure.  
</p>
<p>17. A constitutional convention tasked with revising the Constitution over a period of 12 
months was established in June 2012. The inaugural meeting was held on 1 December 2012 
and the working sessions were expected to commence in January 2013. Among the issues 
the convention will consider include the insertion of a provision for same-sex marriage; an 
amendment to articles 41.1 and 41.2 on the role of women in the home, and the insertion of 
a clause recognizing the participation of women in public life; and the removal of the 
offence of blasphemy from article 40.6.1 (i). While the recommendations made by the 
convention will not be binding, the Government may enact proposed reforms, which, if 
passed by Parliament, would be put to a public referendum. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes this Government initiative and encourages the inclusion and participation of civil 
society actors, including human rights defenders, in the process of constitutional reform.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Laws relating to freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Constitution 
</i></p>
<p>18. Article 40.6 (i) guarantees the right of citizens &#8220;to express freely their convictions 
and opinions&#8221;. It also refers to the press, defined as &#8220;organs of public opinion, such as the 
radio, the press, the cinema&#8221;, and recognizes &#8220;their rightful liberty of expression, including 
criticism of Government policy&#8221;. However, it forbids their use &#8220;to undermine public order 
or morality or the authority of the State&#8221;. Article 40.6 (i) also establishes the offence of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>blasphemy, which is defined as &#8220;the publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious, or 
</p>
<p>indecent matter&#8221;. The offence of blasphemy is also present in criminal legislation by way of 
</p>
<p>the Defamation Act (2009). 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Defamation Act (2009) 
</i></p>
<p>19. The Defamation Act was passed in 2009 and came into force in 2010, repealing the 
Defamation Act of 1961. Under section 36 of the Act, the &#8220;publication or utterance of 
blasphemous matter&#8221; is a criminal offence, which may result in a maximum fine of 
&#8364;25,000. On conviction, the court may issue a warrant for the material to be seized.  
</p>
<p>20. Article 36, paragraph 2 of the Defamation Act defines blasphemy material as 
&#8220;grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby 
causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion&#8221;. According to 
section 4 of the same provision, &#8220;religion&#8221; excludes profit-making organizations or those 
organizations that engage in &#8220;oppressive psychological manipulation&#8221;. Under section 3 of 
article 36, defence from criminal liability is permitted in cases of work of &#8220;genuine literary, 
artistic, political, scientific or academic value&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>21. While noting that no prosecution has been brought to date under section 36 of the 
Defamation Act, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern at the vagueness of the 
definition of blasphemy and its possible implications on the fundamental right to freedom 
of opinion and expression, which could lead to self-censorship among defenders.  
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that any restrictions on the right to freedom of 
expression must be limited only to those permissible under article 19 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.1 In this connection, she is pleased to note that the 
constitutional convention was tasked with considering the need for the removal of the 
offence of blasphemy from article 40.6.1 (i) of the Constitution, which would also facilitate 
its removal from the Defamation Act.  
</p>
<p>23. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur received information about the reported use 
of litigation and the threat of legal action to intimidate journalists. In this connection, she 
underlines the importance of the role of the Press Ombudsman and the Press Council, 
established to safeguard and promote professional and ethical standards in Irish printed 
media, and which can resolve complaints about the accuracy and fairness of coverage.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Laws relating to the freedom of assembly 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Constitution 
</i></p>
<p>24. Article 40.6.1 (ii) guarantees the right to peaceful assembly subject to the protection 
of &#8220;public order and morality&#8221;. Assemblies that are considered &#8220;to cause a breach of the 
peace&#8221; or are &#8220;a danger or nuisance to the general public&#8221; may be controlled and prevented. 
</p>
<p>Assemblies held in the vicinity of either House of the <i>Oireachtas</i> may also be controlled 
and prevented.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act (1994) 
</i></p>
<p>25. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act of 1994, commonly referred to as the Public 
Order Act, sets out offences relating to public order and provides for sanctions, including 
prison sentences ranging from three months to three years and fines of up to &#8364;1,200. Part II 
</p>
<p>of the Act criminalizes &#8220;disorderly conduct&#8221;, &#8220;threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in 
</p>
<p>  
 1 E/CN.4/2000/63/Add.2, paras. 83-85. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>a public place&#8221;, the &#8220;distribution or display [&#8230;] of material which is threatening, abusive, 
insulting or obscene&#8221;, &#8220;failure to comply with the direction of a member of Garda S&#237;och&#225;na 
(police)&#8221;, &#8220;wilful obstruction&#8221; of persons or vehicles, &#8220;entering a building [&#8230;] with intent 
to commit an offence&#8221;, and &#8220;affray&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>26. While permission or authorization from the police is not required to hold an 
assembly, part III of the Public Order Act allows the <i>Garda S&#237;och&#225;na</i> to monitor and 
restrict access to large assemblies &#8220;in the interests of safety or for the purpose of preserving 
order&#8221;. These powers must, however, comply with privacy and data protection laws.2 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Laws relating to freedom of association 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Constitution 
</i></p>
<p>27. Article 40.6.1 (iii) of the Constitution guarantees the right to form associations and 
unions, subject to the possible enactment of laws for the regulation and control of 
associations and unions &#8220;in the public interest&#8221;. Article 40.6 also specifies that such laws 
</p>
<p>may not contain any political, religious or class discrimination.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Charities Act (2009) 
</i></p>
<p>28. The Charities Act, providing for the regulation and supervision of the charitable 
sector, was passed in 2009. The Act makes it mandatory for every charity to be registered 
and for updated information about charities, including missions, activities, governance and 
finances, to be made publically available. Key provisions of the Act include a definition of 
charitable purposes; the creation of a new Charities Regulatory Authority; the creation of a 
Register of Charities, in which all operating charities must register within six months and 
that will be publically accessible; the submission of annual activity reports by charities to 
the new Authority; updating the law relating to fundraising; the creation of a Charity 
Appeals Tribunal; and the provision of consultative panels to assist the Authority in its 
work and to ensure effective consultation with stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that section 3, paragraph 11 of the Act 
fails to recognize the promotion of human rights as &#8220;a purpose that is beneficial to the 
community&#8221;, therefore, effectively excluding organizations that work on the protection and 
</p>
<p>promotion of human rights from being able to register as charities.  
</p>
<p>30. Moreover, to date, the Charities Act has not been fully implemented; it was reported 
that this would happen in stages. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, as a result of 
the progressive implementation of the Act and the consequent absence of a comprehensive 
regulatory authority of the charitable sector, many organizations operating on a not-for-
profit basis are forced to register as companies limited by guarantee in order to satisfy 
funding requirements. This has reportedly resulted in the organizations being unable to 
benefit from charitable status, including being eligible for tax exemption and being 
considered a legitimate charity for fundraising purposes.

</p>
<p><b> IV. Institutional framework for the promotion and protection of 
human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legislative branch 
</b></p>
<p>31. Ireland is a parliamentary democracy. The President (<i>Uachtar&#225;n</i>) is Head of State 
and does not have executive functions. The Parliament (<i>Oireachtas</i>) comprises the 
President and two Houses: the directly elected House of Representatives (<i>D&#225;il &#201;ireann</i>) and 
the Senate (<i>Seanad &#201;ireann</i>), made up of representatives of several groups or institutions.  
</p>
<p>32. On the nomination of the House of Representatives, the President appoints the Prime 
Minister (<i>Taoiseach</i>) and, on the advice of the Prime Minister and with the prior approval 
of the House of Representatives, the President appoints members of the Government. There 
may be up to 15 members of Government. Government policy and administration may be 
examined in both houses, but under the Constitution, the Government is responsible to the 
President alone. Ireland also has a system of local government, based on 34 directly elected 
city- and county-level councils with functions relating to such matters as planning, housing 
and the provision of certain local services.  
</p>
<p>33. All draft legislation passed by the Parliament is examined by the Office of the 
Attorney General to ensure that it is compliant with the Constitution.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Executive branch 
</b></p>
<p>34. At the institutional level, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to meet the Human 
Rights Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and to learn about its work. 
Moreover, she was particularly pleased to find out about the existence of the NGO Standing 
Committee, which provides a formal framework for a regular exchange of views between 
the Unit and Department and representatives from the community of non-governmental 
organizations, including defenders and activists. She believes that this is an excellent 
initiative that should be replicated.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Judicial branch 
</b></p>
<p>35. Judges are appointed by the President on the nomination of the Government. The 
courts are structured on four levels: the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court 
and the Supreme Court. The latter two are referred to as the Superior Courts and may rule 
on constitutional matters. The Court of Criminal Appeal and the Special Criminal Court are 
also part of the judiciary in Ireland.  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Criminal Court was established in 1972 under the Offences against the 
State Act (1939) to deal with offences relating to terrorism and other offences listed as 
scheduled offences. Non-scheduled offences may also be forwarded to the Court&#8217;s 
jurisdiction if the Director of Public Prosecution certifies that the ordinary courts are 
inadequate. The Court sits with three judges, without a jury, and the judges reach a verdict 
by majority vote. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the recommendation made by the 
Human Rights Committee that the State should monitor the need for the Special Criminal 
Court carefully with a view to its abolition.3 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>37. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur learned about the recent establishment of 
the Interim Judicial Council, seen as a preliminary step towards the creation of a statutory 
body that would be tasked with providing a complaints mechanism against judges and with 
deciding on disciplinary actions. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the establishment 
of the Judicial (professional) Association in November 2011.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Police  
</b></p>
<p>38. The national police service of Ireland is the <i>Garda S&#237;och&#225;na</i>. The most recent act 
governing the body is the Garda S&#237;och&#225;na Act (2005), and its internal management is 
subject to regulations of the Ministry of Justice and Equality.  
</p>
<p>39. The Garda S&#237;och&#225;na Ombudsman Commission is an independent statutory body that 
investigates complaints concerning the conduct of members of the police, and is answerable 
to the Parliament. An independent person within the Commission deals with matters of 
concern reported by individual officer (whistle-blowers).  
</p>
<p>40. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the existence of the Ombudsman 
Commission to ensure the accountability and independent oversight of the police, she 
expresses concern at the serious constraints faced by the body, including financial and 
resource limitations, and the reported limited public awareness of its activities and 
responsibilities. While she takes note of the powers of the Commission to conduct public 
interest investigations into the behaviour of the police in accordance with section 102(4) of 
the Garda S&#237;och&#225;na Act (2005), she remains concerned at the Commission&#8217;s excessive 
dependence on the Ministry of Justice and Equality when it comes to opening investigations 
relating to the practices, policies and procedures of the police, which requires permission 
from the Minister, as laid out in section 106 of the mentioned Act. The Special Rapporteur 
recommends that this provision be removed from the Garda S&#237;och&#225;na Act (2005) in order to 
grant the Commission independent investigative powers.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Irish Human Rights Commission was established under statute in 2000 in 
accordance with the Good Friday Agreement (1998) as an independent national human 
rights institution with key public functions in accordance with the Paris Principles. 
Regarded internationally as a model national human rights institution, the Commission 
gained &#8220;A&#8221; status in 2004 and 2008 with the International Coordinating Committee. The 
Commission is currently administered by the Department of Justice and Equality.  
</p>
<p>42. In September 2011, the Government announced its intention to merge the Irish 
Human Rights Commission with the Equality Authority, an independent body to be set up 
under the Employment Equality Act (1998), to form the new Irish Human Rights and 
Equality Commission. In June 2012, the Minister for Justice and Equality published the 
Scheme of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill 2012, which was 
examined by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.4  
</p>
<p>43. With regard to the scheme of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill 
2012, the Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that it was reviewed by Parliament, which 
received written submissions and held two public hearings. She also welcomes the 
consultation by the Government on the draft legislation with the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>

<p>Commission Bill, July 2012, available from www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/. </p>

</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and was pleased to learn that provisions in 
the Bill provide for enhanced powers and functions of the new Commission, including the 
power of inquiry.  
</p>
<p>44. Since July 2012, an Acting Chief Executive and an Advisory Committee of the 
future Human Rights and Equality Commission have been put in place. During the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, she was assured that an interim body would be appointed early in 2013 
to ensure the full operation of the Commission. The Special Rapporteur stressed the need 
that the Commission&#8217;s mandate be broad and that adequate resources be allocated to it to 
ensure its independence and effective functioning. She also encouraged the swift 
introduction of draft legislation.  
</p>
<p>45. With regard to the scope of the mandate of the new Commission, while the Special 
Rapporteur is pleased to note the broad definition of human rights contained in head 3, she 
is concerned at the somewhat narrow definition enshrined in head 30, which requires that 
such rights be &#8220;conferred on or guaranteed by the Constitution&#8221; or have &#8220;the force of law in 
the State or by a provision of any such agreement, treaty or convention which has been 
given such a force&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>46. In connection with the above, and taking into account the fact that the automatic 
incorporation of international treaties into domestic law is hampered under article 29.6 of 
the Constitution together with the fact that Ireland is neither a signatory of nor party to all 
international human rights treaties, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the narrower 
definition of human rights contained in head 30 could potentially reduce the scope of the 
Commission&#8217;s mandates. She recommends that the heads of bill have only one definition of 
human rights, and that the one contained in head 3 be the one applicable to the new 
Commission.  
</p>
<p>47. With regard to the autonomy and independence of the Commission, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that, in 2008, during the process of re-accreditation, the Sub-Committee 
on Accreditation of the International Coordinating Committee highlighted a concern 
regarding the selection and appointment of the Commissioner and the need to provide for 
direct accountability to Parliament. Certain treaty bodies have also expressed their concern 
in this regard, referring to an administrative link to a Government department5 and to 
disproportionate budget cuts6 affecting the institution, and have called on the body to have 
direct accountability to Parliament.7 She took note of the establishment of a selection panel 
for the members of the Commission, which will be independent of the Government and will 
report to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  
</p>
<p>48. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the increased links of the Human 
Rights and Equality Commission with Parliament established by the heads of bill (heads 12, 
14, 20 and 27), she notes that heads 17, 19, 21, 26 and 27 seem to strengthen the connection 
of the institution to the Ministry of Justice and Equality by, inter alia, limiting what 
information the Director may convey to the Public Accounts Committee (head 19) and 
requiring ministerial consent for the appointments of the Director of the Commission and 
its staff (head 26). The Special Rapporteur underlines the importance for a national 
institution to be able to recruit its own staff, and she also recommends that no secondment 
from civil service be allowed.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur also brings to the attention of relevant authorities a concern 
expressed by various stakeholders during her visit relating to the cumulative budget cuts

<p>suffered by the Commission since 2008. She was informed that the Commission has been 
subject to a reduction by 40 per cent in funding since 2007. Together with an embargo on 
recruitment, this has resulted in significant constraints for the institution.  
</p>
<p>50. While the Special Rapporteur notes that the heads of bill provide for the 
appointment of Advisory Committees (head 16), she regrets that there is no specific 
provision regarding the engagement of the new institution with civil society actors. She 
strongly recommends that the Government consider including a specific reference to the 
importance of the interaction between the Commission and civil society actors, including 
human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Support for human rights defenders through external policy 
</b></p>
<p>51. Through its external policy, Ireland has assumed a leading role in initiatives under 
the European Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders to contribute to the protection 
of defenders and activists at risk in other countries, including through the provision of 
temporary visas at the national level. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government of 
Ireland for its efforts to assist defenders at risk in third countries. 
</p>
<p>52. On the initiative of Ireland, the above-mentioned Guidelines were adopted in 2004 
and updated in 2008 in order to streamline the actions of member States of the European 
Union in favour of human rights defenders. They provide concrete proposals, especially to 
European Union diplomatic missions, on monitoring the situation of defenders. Support for 
United Nations human rights mechanisms and coordination with other regional instruments 
is another important aspect of the Guidelines, as is the need to use development policy and 
aid programmes to protect defenders. 
</p>
<p>53. While the Guidelines are an important tool and represent a significant commitment 
by the European Union, both internal evaluations8 and external assessments have shown 
gaps, particularly at the implementation and coordination levels. For a number of years, 
efforts have made to develop local strategies for the implementation of the Guidelines and 
to set up local human rights groups in order to assure greater coordination. The Special 
Rapporteur stresses the importance of integrating the implementation of the Guidelines into 
the broader framework of European Union human rights policy, which includes other 
important human rights guidelines and policy instruments. 
</p>
<p>54. Ireland has been particularly proactive in promoting the Guidelines on Human 
Rights Defenders and has taken a number of initiatives worth underlining, including, those 
described below. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Humanitarian visa scheme 
</b></p>
<p>55. Since 2006, Ireland has managed a dedicated humanitarian visa scheme for human 
rights defenders. The aim of the scheme is to provide a fast-track approach to processing 
visa applications, thereby allowing defenders facing temporary security issues to travel to 
Ireland for short periods of time for respite. Given the specific profile of such cases, a high 
degree of confidentiality is maintained around the scheme and individual cases.  
</p>
<p>56. An application must be submitted through the Embassy or consular representation of 
Ireland in the applicant&#8217;s country of usual residence. If there is no representation in the

<p>country concerned, the application is made to the appropriate representation in a 
neighbouring country. The programme is administered in conjunction with the non-
governmental organization Front Line Defenders, and has provided relief to various 
defenders in recent years. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government of Ireland for 
the effort put into the scheme, and encourages its replication by those member States of the 
European Union that have not yet already done so.  
</p>
<p>57. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that, in 2010, Ireland developed 
complementary guidelines for its embassies and diplomatic missions on human rights 
defenders. The guidelines describe practical steps that diplomatic missions can take to 
support human rights defenders and to seek to ensure that embassies properly monitor the 
situation of defenders abroad.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Implementation of the European Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur commends the efforts made by the Government of Ireland to 
continue to contribute to the protection of defenders abroad, and encourages the Irish 
authorities to bring these issues forward, in particular in the first six months of 2013, when 
Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union. She sees this as an excellent 
opportunity to make additional efforts to enhance the implementation of the European 
Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders. 
</p>
<p>59. In the above connection, the Special Rapporteur suggests that a system of 
benchmarks and simple indicators be developed, jointly with human rights defenders, to 
assess the implementation of the Guidelines. The assessment system should be gender-
sensitive and allow for the sharing of good practices among European Union delegations.  
</p>
<p>60. Structural indicators could include, inter alia, the number of local strategies 
developed, the number of diplomatic missions that have volunteered for a post as European 
Union liaison officer for human rights defenders, or the number of diplomatic missions who 
make the Guidelines easily available on their websites. </p>
<p>61. Outcome indicators could include the number of individual cases raised bilaterally. 
The number of fast-track visas provided under a humanitarian visa scheme could also be 
included. With regard to public support and visibility for the work of defenders, indicators 
could include the number of public statements on defenders at risk, the number of 
initiatives taken in individual cases in regional and international forums (such as the Human 
Rights Council and the General Assembly), the number of visits to the place of work of 
defenders, and the number of events (such as conferences and seminars) to which defenders 
are invited. The number of visits to defenders in detention and the number of trials 
observed by diplomats could also be included.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Development policy and the protection of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to note that Irish development policy has a 
long-standing history of mainstreaming human rights through its development cooperation 
and aid programmes, including by fostering civil society action and supporting the 
protection of human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>63. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur became acquainted with the ongoing review 
of the White Paper on Irish Aid. Irish Aid is the Government programme of development 
assistance that delivered &#8364;639 million for poverty reduction in 2012, and has traditionally 
provided important support for human rights defenders. The overall reductions in public 
expenditure resulting from the difficult economic situation in Ireland, however, led to a cut 
of 30 per cent in the State&#8217;s aid budget between 2008 and 2011. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>64. The review of the White Paper on Irish Aid was announced in June 2011 and is 
being led by the Minister of State for Trade and Development. The Special Rapporteur 
commends the broad consultations held in connection with the review of the White Paper 
with key stakeholders, including the general public, civil society, partner countries, the 
private sector and the Parliament. The Special Rapporteur hopes that the review of the 
White Paper will continue to maintain a clear focus on human rights and on the protection 
of defenders. 
</p>
<p>65. The role of donors in protecting and fostering civil society in recipient countries has 
become essential, while development aid has shown proved to be an effective tool in 
fostering an enabling environment for defenders. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
would like to add her voice to those who underline the importance of ensuring coherence 
between international human rights principles and frameworks for development aid.9 In 
particular, she highlights the need to consider the recommendations made by United 
Nations human rights mechanisms, including the universal periodic review, the special 
procedures and the treaty bodies, when assessing aid performance at the country level. She 
also underlines the importance of the coherence and sustainability of donors&#8217; reactions to 
human rights violations, as well as of that of funding being made available to support the 
capacity and safety of human rights defenders as part of development aid.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Situation of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>66. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur observed that, because of their legitimate 
work upholding human rights, certain categories of human rights defenders face specific 
challenges in Ireland. These categories include environmental rights defenders, defenders 
and activists working on sexual and reproductive rights, defenders working on the rights of 
Travellers, asylum seekers and refugees claiming the rights of their community, and 
whistle-blowers and others reporting acts of wrongdoing.  
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur also became aware of other challenges affecting human 
rights defenders that relate, inter alia, to the lack of an independent complaints mechanism 
in prisons, the high costs associated with public interest litigation, the drastic reduction in 
public funding available for advocacy work, and accessibility to public policy-related 
information.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Environmental rights activists 
</b></p>
<p>68. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur expressed her concern at the situation of 
and challenges faced by defenders and activists defending the right to the enjoyment of a 
safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, particularly those peacefully protesting 
against the Corrib Gas project in County Mayo.  
</p>
<p>69. Natural gas was found in North Mayo in 1996, and Shell E&amp;P Ireland, in partnership 
with Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and Vermilion Energy, took over the 
development of the Corrib Gas project in 2002. The project has been controversial for 
various reasons, including safety concerns relating to the type of pipeline (an onshore, high-
pressure pipeline) and the route chosen, as well as environmental concerns for the 
ecological impact of the project on a sensitive area that includes special areas of 
conservation. Since 2002, a number of risk assessments and reviews of the impact of the

</p>
<p>Corrib Gas project have been undertaken by Shell, the public authorities, local residents and 
non-governmental organizations.10  
</p>
<p>70. Since its inception, the Corrib Gas project has faced opposition from various groups 
of local community residents, who claim that their rights to life and the enjoyment of a safe, 
clean, healthy and sustainable environment are being seriously compromised by the project. 
During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with various groups of local residents and was 
able to confirm the frustration that exists among those who are standing up for their rights, 
who feel powerless, isolated and have lost their confidence in public institutions. These 
community residents are loosely organized, without a clear leadership structure, and have 
adopted different non-violent ways to express their opposition to the project.  
</p>
<p>71. While opposition to the project has been mostly peaceful, the Special Rapporteur 
noted with concern that there have also been reports of violent criminal acts committed in 
the context of the protests, including damage against Shell property. The Special 
Rapporteur would like to emphasize that those responsible for committing such acts cannot 
be considered human rights defenders, and that perpetrators should be held accountable for 
their actions and brought to justice. 
</p>
<p>72. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur received credible reports and evidence, 
including video footage, indicating the existence of a pattern of intimidation, harassment, 
surveillance and criminalization of those peacefully opposing the Corrib Gas project. 
Protests have ranged from lawful demonstrations to non-violent non-compliance and 
passive resistance on both public and private grounds. The information received seemed to 
indicate that the policing of the protests had been, in some instances, disproportionate. 
Moreover, there have also been serious concerns about the lawfulness of certain actions by 
the private security firm employed by Shell.  
</p>
<p>73. In 2006 and 2007, incidents reported include protesters being thrown off roads and 
into ditches by police officers when they were trying to block roads. In 2008 and 2009, 
various incidents reportedly included the unlawful detention by the police of a boat 
belonging to a local fisherman, who was allegedly trying to protect his crab pots from the 
pipe laying vessels, and the physical assault by the police and private security staff of a 
protestor staging a sit-in under a truck. While the Special Rapporteur takes note that the 
explicit no-arrest policy by the police has been used as a way to reduce tension, she 
received information indicating that this may have led to the excessive and disproportionate 
use of force against protestors.  
</p>
<p>74. More recent reports include serious allegations of police misconduct and verbal 
abuse against protesters, such as an incident on 31 March 2011, when several police 
officers were inadvertently recorded (by a video camera confiscated from two female 
protestors) while threatening to rape one of the women protestors in their custody. The 
Garda S&#237;och&#225;na Ombudsman Commission conducted an investigation into the allegations 
and, in July 2011, issued a report thereon. As a result of the investigation, disciplinary 
action was taken and one of the police officers was found to be in breach of discipline and 
was admonished for his behaviour and on future conduct.  
</p>
<p>75. In the above connection, the Special Rapporteur expresses her concern at allegations 
received pointing to shortcomings in official investigations, particularly those relating to 
the use of excessive force and abusive behaviour by the police. The Corrib Gas dispute has

<p>been the single largest source of complaints to the Garda S&#237;och&#225;na Ombudsman 
Commission. In 2007, in accordance with section 106, part 4 of the Garda Sioch&#225;na Act 
(2005), the Commission sought to conduct a &#8220;practice, policy and procedure&#8221; investigation 
into public order aspects of the dispute, and requested the consent of the Minister for 
Justice. Regrettably, consent was denied on the grounds that the Commission did not have 
enough experience at the time with complaints in terms of volume and seriousness to allow 
for patterns to be identified. As stated above, the Special Rapporteur considers that this 
section of the Garda Sioch&#225;na Act should be repealed and the Commission should seek 
again to conduct a &#8220;practice, policy and procedure&#8221; investigation into the public order 
aspects of the dispute in the light of its proven experience with complaints in recent years.  
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the Corrib Gas dispute has created a 
challenging environment for the police and local authorities, given the length of the dispute 
and the fact that those involved come from the same community. She is also mindful of the 
fact that the rights to freedom of expression and to peaceful assembly may be subject to 
certain legal and necessary restrictions. She takes note of the establishment of the Strategic 
Human Rights Advisory Committee by the police in 2005 and of the information received 
regarding the specific training of the police on handling protests and on the use of force. 
The Special Rapporteur trusts that the efforts will continue, thus providing adequate 
training and guidance to the police and other relevant personnel, especially with regard to 
the policing of protests and crowd control.  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur also took note of the reported consistent use of charges 
against protestors under articles 8 (failure to comply with directions of the police) and 9 
(wilful obstruction) of the Public Order Act. This, together with the reported practice of 
withdrawal or dismissal of cases and the regular sanction of suspended sentences after court 
appearances could, in her opinion, undermine the right to protest and deprive defendants of 
the opportunity to respond to the legal charges made against them.  
</p>
<p>78. In addition, the Special Rapporteur received reports of acts of surveillance of public 
roads, private houses and private movements of local residents by private security agents 
employed by Shell. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the possible impact of such 
practices on the right to privacy of local residents, and recommends that surveillance 
methods be employed only in a lawful and proportionate manner, and that their purpose be 
communicated to local residents.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Defenders and activists working on sexual and reproductive rights 
</b></p>
<p>79. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur received information about the situation of 
and challenges faced by defenders working on sexual and reproductive rights, particularly 
those providing women with information on legal abortion. Ireland has one of the most 
restrictive laws in Europe regarding the termination of pregnancy whereby abortion is a 
criminal offence, except when the pregnant woman&#8217;s life is at risk, including because of the 
risk of suicide, and where women may be punished with life-term prison sentences.  
</p>
<p>80. In 1983, article 40.3.3 of the Constitution was amended to acknowledge &#8220;the right to 
life of the unborn&#8221;, regarding it as equal to the right to life of the pregnant woman. The 
term &#8220;unborn&#8221; was not defined. Procuring or assisting in an abortion is a criminal offence 
under the Offenses against the State Act (1861), and is punishable by up to life 
imprisonment. There have been no prosecutions under the Act in recent times, at least since 
1975 and the establishment of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>81. In 1995, the Regulation of Information (Services outside the State for the 
Termination of Pregnancies) Act11 was enacted. The Information Act allows for the 
provision of information on abortion services abroad, subject to strict restrictions that pose 
a number of important challenges to the work of defenders, practitioners and advocates 
working on sexual and reproductive health rights, which are described below. 
</p>
<p>82. In 1992, with the judgement in <i>Attorney General v X</i>, the Supreme Court provided 
guidance on the interpretation of the existing right to abortion under article 40.3.3 of the 
Constitution, and determined that abortion in Ireland was legal when a real and substantial 
risk to life &#8211; as opposed to the health &#8211; of the pregnant women, including the risk of 
suicide, had been established,.  
</p>
<p>83. In 2010, the European Court of Human Rights, in the case of <i>A, B and C v Ireland</i>, 
found that Ireland had failed to respect the applicant&#8217;s private life, contrary to article 8 of 
the European Convention on Human Rights, given that no accessible or effective procedure 
had been available to enable her to establish whether she qualified for a lawful termination 
of pregnancy in accordance with Irish law, and requested a more effective procedure 
regarding requirements to be met to qualify for the legal termination of a pregnancy.  
</p>
<p>84. The decisions described in paragraphs 82 and 83 above are still to be implemented, 
which explains why currently no legislation or regulatory framework exists to define 
whether a woman is entitled to have access to legal abortion. In June 2011, the Government 
submitted a plan of action to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe with 
measures on how to implement the judgement, including the establishment of an Expert 
Group to recommend the options available. In November 2012, the report of the Expert 
Group on the Judgement in <i>A, B and C v. Ireland</i> was made public.  
</p>
<p>85. According to the Information Act, information on abortion services should only be 
given in the context of one-to-one counselling (sect. 3.1 (a)). The Act also stipulates that 
any information on abortion provided by advisory agencies, doctors and counsellors must 
be &#8220;truthful and objective&#8221;, must &#8220;not advocate or promote&#8221; abortion and should be 
provided together with information on all courses of action open to a women in relation to 
her particular circumstances (sect. 5(b, iii)). Agencies, doctors and counsellors are also 
prohibited from making arrangements on behalf of their clients for an abortion abroad (sect. 
8, 1).  
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the important challenges that certain 
provisions contained in the Information Act pose for reproductive health providers and 
defenders working on these issues. When a woman seeks information on abortion, it may 
only be provided in the context of a face-to-face counselling session; information cannot be 
given online or over the telephone. This provision can pose significant barriers for 
counsellors and potentially restrict women&#8217;s access to information on sexual and 
reproductive rights, particularly on access to the health services available abroad. 
Moreover, the provision can restrict the ability of defenders to make contact with some 
women who may not be able to attend a face-to-face counselling session, including women 
who live in isolated or rural areas, young women, women in State care and/or migrant 
women. The inability of counsellors to make appointments on behalf of their clients further 
restricts the support they can offer to women seeking this type of service abroad. 
</p>
<p>87. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur is concerned at reports and evidence received 
during her visit indicating the existence of a smear campaign and stigmatization of 
defenders and activists working on abortion issues. More specifically, she received 
information about a smear campaign in printed media, reportedly in October and November 
</p>
<p>

</b></p>
<p>2012, when a well-known reproductive health provider in the country was targeted in 
various newspaper articles and accused of putting the lives of women at risk and 
contravening the law. The Health Service Executive has reportedly launched an 
investigation into the accusations made against a number of reproductive health providers. 
As the Special Rapporteur stressed in a previous report,12 the stigmatization of defenders 
may lead to the selective enforcement of existing laws and regulations, reinforce existing 
stigma and culminate in the criminalization of their legitimate activities.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Defenders working for the rights of Travellers 
</b></p>
<p>88. The challenges faced by those defenders working on the rights of the Traveller 
community, including Roma Travellers, were brought to the attention of the Special 
Rapporteur during her visit. These defenders are generally members of the Traveller 
community who advocate for the basic rights of the community, including the right to 
adequate housing that is culturally acceptable; the right to education and health, particularly 
of their children; and the right to effective participation in public and political life.  
</p>
<p>89. While Travellers are explicitly named as a group protected from discrimination 
under the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2012, and the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 
2011, they are not recognized as a distinct ethnic minority. This, combined with the overall 
situation of social exclusion and disadvantage of the community, makes the work of the 
defenders extremely challenging. The Special Rapporteur recalls the recommendations of 
the Human Rights Committee,13 the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination14 and the Council of Europe regarding the recognition of Travellers as an 
ethnic minority. 
</p>
<p>90. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur received information that organizations 
representing Travellers had been excluded from relevant integration policies and 
institutions. According to the information received, the community was not involved in the 
preparation of the National Traveller Roma Integration Strategy. The Special Rapporteur 
also learned that the implementation of programmes and strategies concerning the 
community had been excessively slow. She also received information about a context of 
overall budget cuts and uncertainty around funding affecting both organizations working 
for the rights of Travellers as well as relevant public institutions, such as the Equality 
Authority.  
</p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur also noted with concern the reported hostile and distant 
attitude towards Travellers in Irish society, including sometimes among civil servants, 
which can lead to the stigmatization of those advocating for their rights and limits their 
ability to conduct their work effectively. The situation is particularly sever for women 
Travellers who are also human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Whistle-blowers and others reporting wrongdoing 
</b></p>
<p>92. Those who disclose information of public interest about wrongdoing or illegal 
activities (whistle-blowers), particularly concerning issues of corruption of public officials, 
face a high risk of retaliation. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur received information 
about the challenges faced by this type of defenders in Ireland in both the public and the 
</p>

 13  CCPR/C/IRL/CO/3, para. 23.

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>private sectors. Articles 32 and 33 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption 
underscore the need to protect the rights of whistle-blowers and witnesses of corruption.  
</p>
<p>93. Since 1999, there have been various attempts by the State to enact comprehensive 
legislation to protect whistle-blowers. To date, such initiatives have been unsuccessful, 
resulting in a largely inadequate patchwork of safeguards to protect persons reporting 
abuses in certain professional sectors. According to the information received, no legislative 
or policy provisions currently protect disclosure to the media, elected representatives and 
civil society organizations. Moreover, the existing confidentiality provisions seem 
insufficient.  
</p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that the Prevention of Corruption 
(Amendment) Act (2010) makes acts of retaliation against anyone reporting an offence in 
good faith a criminal offence, and contains legal safeguards in the form of civil law 
remedies for employees who report corruption offences. The Act does not, however, cover 
workers in the banking or business sectors.  
</p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the General Scheme of Protected 
Disclosure in the Public Interest Bill of 2012, which was introduced by the Government 
precisely to address the lack of an overarching legal protection framework. Nevertheless, 
the Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the bill does not cover self-employed 
professionals or volunteer workers and that the definitions provided for in the text do not 
include the term &#8220;good faith&#8221;. In addition, several provisions seem problematic, particularly 
regarding the fact that protection is not afforded to those who wish to make an anonymous 
disclosure (head 11) and that the confidentiality of those who choose to make a disclosure 
does not seem fully ensured (head 16).  
</p>
<p><b> E. Asylum seekers and refugees working for the rights of their community 
</b></p>
<p>96. Ireland has traditionally been an open and welcoming country for those at risk in 
other parts of the world, and began receiving refugees in the mid-1990s. Asylum seekers in 
Ireland face significant challenges, some of which affect a number of them who might be 
regarded as human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>97. The absence of a single determination procedure causes excessive delays in granting 
effective protection for those who need it most. In addition, the rate of recognition is one of 
the lowest in Europe, and there is room for improving the quality of decision-making in the 
status determination process. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to 
learn that the Government is working closely with UNCHR through the Quality Initiative to 
enhance various aspects of the determination process.  
</p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur was, however, concerned to receive reliable information 
indicating that asylum seekers using direct public provision services, which include 
reception and accommodation, sometimes fear retaliation, for instance in the form of 
unannounced transfers, if they attempt to claim their rights, or those of their fellow asylum 
seekers, to privacy, an adequate standard of living and adequate standards of physical and 
mental health. She encourages the authorities to take all the measures necessary to ensure 
that refugees working for the rights of their community in Ireland are able to claim their 
rights without facing obstacles of any sort.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Other challenges for human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>99. Overcrowding in prisons is a serious problem that has been highlighted by various 
national and international organizations, as well as by intergovernmental bodies, including </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/47/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>the Human Rights Committee, the Committee against Torture, the Human Rights Council 
and the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment.  
</p>
<p>100. Cell conditions, sanitation and the practice of &#8220;slopping out&#8221;15 have received 
international condemnation and been qualified as amounting to cruel, inhuman and 
degrading treatment or punishment. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur takes note of 
the efforts made by the Government to improve considerably the situation in certain 
detention centres in the past two years, and welcomes the Government&#8217;s commitment to 
end &#8220;slopping out&#8221; by 2014.  
</p>
<p>101. The Special Rapporteur nonetheless noted with concern during her visit the lack of 
an independent and effective complaints mechanism for those in detention centres. She 
received information about instances of intimidation of prisoners who wish to make a 
complaint, particularly at the St. Patrick&#8217;s Institution for Young Offenders. While she takes 
note that, as of 1 November 2012, serious complaints by prisoners are subject to 
independent investigation beyond the internal complaints procedure under the Inspector of 
Prisons, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that a fully independent complaints 
mechanism would be more effective and help to ensure that complainants are protected 
against acts of retaliation.  
</p>
<p>102. The Special Rapporteur was also informed about challenges faced by those 
defenders who work assisting children held at St. Patrick&#8217;s, in particular in their access to 
children owing to special detention regimes.  
</p>
<p>103. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur also received information about the 
challenges faced by defenders and legal advocates working in class or public interest 
litigation, often relating to human rights issues, which cannot easily be undertaken owing to 
the high costs associated. In the current framework, plaintiffs pursuing such cases risk 
having to pay the costs of the case if they lose at trial (which could easily amount to a sum 
of six figures). This could have a chilling effect on those who might wish to challenge the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>104. The Legal Services Bill of 2011, introduced to increase competition in the legal 
sector, includes a provision stating that whoever wins the suit will have their costs covered 
by the opposing side. This provision could be amended to include a protective cost order in 
cases of public interest so that either side could apply to the court at the beginning of a case 
to have the costs either capped or waived.  
</p>
<p>105. The Special Rapporteur also received information about the difficulties of those 
defenders doing human rights advocacy work in order to procure public funding, which 
seems more focused on service delivery activities than advocacy.  
</p>
<p>106. The attention of the Special Rapporteur was also drawn to the fact that policy-related 
information is not readily available, given that the websites of public institutions are not 
easy to navigate and there are important gaps in access to public documents.

<p>morning. </p>

<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>107.<b> The Special Rapporteur considers that human rights defenders in Ireland work 
in a conducive and enabling environment that, in general, meets international 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards. Although a greater effort could be made to raise awareness about the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration on Human Rights Defenders at the national level, the Government and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other authorities have shown an open and supportive attitude towards the defence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>promotion of human rights. The Special Rapporteur nevertheless notes that the term 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;defender&#8221; is not always well understood amo<b>ng public officials. 
</b></p>
<p>108.<b> The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the situation of the national human 
rights institution as a result of the planned merger with the Equality Authority. She 
</b></p>
<p><b>hopes that the draft legislation will be enacted shortly in order to establish a strong, 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent and adequately resourced institution capable of a credible and impartial 
</b></p>
<p>scrutiny of the State&#8217;s human rights activities.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>109.<b> The Special Rapporteur is particularly pleased to have learned more about the 
proactive role played by Ireland in the promotion of the European Union Guidelines 
</b></p>
<p><b>on Human Rights Defenders and the important initiatives taken to protect human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights defenders in foreign policy and development aid. Ireland has a number of good 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices in this regard that could serve as an inspiration for other countries.  
</b></p>
<p>110.<b> In general, the Special Rapporteur considers that, in Ireland, human rights 
defenders do not face risks in doing their work. Nevertheless, she believes that special 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention should be paid to the specific challenges faced by certain categories of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights defenders and activists. In this connection, she makes the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations below in a spirit of constructive dialogue with the authorities and
