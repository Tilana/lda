Regret action.

The court notes that the maximum penalty for burglary 13 years and 10 years for theft. 

For the 1st Count the court starts with a sentence of 6 years for the offence. The reason this court is starting on the higher scale is that you have a similar record of shop breaking and entering and larceny and for which you were placed on probation for 12 months in 2008. You have already been given a chance. You do not wish to rehabilitate and turn your life around. You have within 2 years committed a similar offence. The Court notes that this offence is prevalent and there is a need to protect the businesses and tell criminals that they will be given stern sentences, not just pittance for offences where they burgle and steal another's property. Word must go out that burglary and stealing will not be lightly dealt with by the judiciary. 

For the aggravating factors which include; the fact that this happened at night. the court increases the sentence by 12 months. 

The Court cannot allow you any discount for your character as you have 2 previous convictions. The Courts need to protect the business community from people like you. The Court notes that apart from $215 and the recharge cards the rest of the items were recovered. The Court notes the short time you spent in custody. 

The court notes your mitigation and the early guilty plea and the time you have spent in remand for this the court allows 12 months discount. 

You are sentenced to 6 years imprisonment for the 1st Count. 

For the 2nd Count the court starts with a sentence of 6 years for offence. For the aggravating factors which include; non-recovery of the money and the recharge cards. the court increases the sentence by 12 months.
