<p><i>Summary 
</i> In its resolution 12/12, the Human Rights Council invited the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene a seminar on the importance of 
archives as a means to guarantee the right to the truth and to report on the outcome of the 
seminar to the Council at its seventeenth session. The seminar took place on 24 and 25 
February 2011, and the present report is submitted in accordance with the Council&#8217;s 
request. 
</p>
<p> The discussion during the seminar was focused around four themes: (a) the 
preservation of archives and the right to the truth; (b) using archives in criminal 
accountability processes; (c) using archives in non-judicial truth seeking processes; and (d) 
the placement of archives of repressive rule. 
</p>
<p> The report outlines the importance of archives to the ability of victims to realize their 
right to the truth, to judicial accountability and non-judicial truth-seeking processes, and for 
reparations. It records the views of participants regarding the duties of States to protect and 
preserve information concerning human rights violations, including that from truth 
commissions, courts and tribunals, NGOs, and regional and intergovernmental organizations, 
and the obligations on States to ensure the preservation of archives and to enact laws to 
govern the management and access to archives. The report further notes possible initiatives 
for the preservation and management of archives during transitional periods.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. On 24 to 25 February 2011, a seminar on experiences of archives as a means to 
guarantee the right to the truth was held pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 
12/12 on the right to the truth, in which the Council invited the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;convene&#8230; a seminar, taking into account 
different experiences on the importance of the creation, organization and management of 
public systems of archives as a means to guarantee the right to the truth, with a view to 
study the need for guidelines on this issue&#8221; and to &#8220;report on the outcome of the 
consultation&#8221; to the Council at its seventeenth session.   
</p>
<p>2. The seminar brought together national experts from relevant fields and from various 
countries, including human rights experts and professional archivists with expertise in the 
management of archives of former repressive regimes (see the annex to the present 
document for the list of experts and practitioners participating in the seminar).  
</p>
<p>3. The objective of the seminar was to map and assess national experiences with regard 
to the creation, organization and management of archives as a means to guarantee the right 
to the truth. In line with the Updated Set of principles for the protection and promotion of 
human rights through action to combat impunity (Updated principles), the debate and 
exchange of views among the experts and practitioners was framed around four themes: the 
preservation of archives and the right to the truth, the use of archives in criminal 
accountability processes, the use of archives in non-judicial truth-seeking mechanisms, and 
the placement and management of archives of repressive regimes.    
</p>
<p><b> II. General considerations on archives and the right to the truth 
</b></p>
<p>4. Historically, the right to the truth was linked to cases of missing and disappeared 
persons. This right has been steadily evolving and has extended to other gross violations of 
human rights such as extrajudicial executions and torture. Several international treaties and 
instruments and national laws, as well as national, regional and international jurisprudence 
and numerous resolutions of intergovernmental bodies at the universal and regional levels, 
recognize the right to the truth about gross violations of human rights and serious violations 
of international humanitarian law.   
</p>
<p>5. States use a variety of approaches to address past large-scale violations of 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law. These include 
prosecutions of perpetrators, institutional reforms to reduce the possibility that repression 
will recur, truth-seeking activities such as truth commissions and exhumation projects, and 
reparations initiatives. Every one of these mechanisms relies on archives. Archives are 
crucial to the exercise of individual rights such as the rehabilitation of people convicted on 
political grounds, the right of families to know where their missing relatives are, and the 
right of political prisoners to amnesty. Archives also enable every nation to exercise its 
right to an undistorted written record, and the right of each people to know the truth about 
its past. 
</p>
<p>6. There is increasing recognition of the central role played by archives in combating 
impunity for past violations and in guaranteeing the right to the truth. The Updated 
principles underline that archives are an important guarantee of the right to know and 
require States to &#8220;ensure the preservation of, and access to, archives concerning violations 
of human rights and humanitarian law&#8221; (principle 5). The seminar provided a forum in 
which selected national experiences could be assessed with regard to the importance of the </p>


<p>creation, organization and management of archives as a means to guarantee the right to the 
truth. 
</p>
<p>7. As an introduction to the discussion, it was noted that both governmental and non-
governmental archives are relevant to the right to truth, the right to justice, the right to 
reparations, and guarantees of non-recurrence, as provided for in the Updated principles. 
Governments emerging from a period of repression often have an archival deficit. There 
may be acceptable laws on archives but no means of enforcing them and an archival 
institution may have no power and no knowledge of or experience with international 
standard practices. However, the records of the repressive regimes require strong 
professional management. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Preservation of and access to archives for the right to the 
truth 
</b></p>
<p>8. The seminar participants discussed the importance and challenges of the 
preservation of and access to archives, referring first to initiatives undertaken by the 
International Council on Archives (ICA) that have been carried out since 1993, including 
the publication of an ICA/United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) report on the management of the archives of security services of former 
repressive regimes. Both the Updated principles and the ICA/UNESCO report demand that 
States adopt measures for the preservation of archives that contain information important 
for human rights. In various countries of Eastern Europe, the records of the State security 
services were utilized for the purposes of lustration. Records should not be destroyed or 
updated until such a time after the end of the repressive regime when their importance can 
be reviewed in accordance with archival principles.  
</p>
<p>9. Regarding who will preserve the records during a transitional period, the Updated 
principles state that in a transition, measures should be taken to place each archive centre 
under the responsibility of a specially designated office (principle 18). In countries where 
national archives are weak or the public does not have confidence in them, it may be 
necessary to establish transitional records centres, where the entire archives of a repressive 
entity are preserved and there is accountability for the continuous chain of custody of those 
archives. However, the permanent solution should be custody by the national archives. In 
Guatemala, for example, the police archives are in the custody of a special archival unit that 
reports to the national archives. In the initial transition phase there is relatively high 
capacity for mobilization of political and financial resources for the transitional archives 
centres, but over time there can be loss of support. In addition, if the transitional centres are 
not professionally managed by archivists, the chain of custody of the records can be lost 
and this can lead to the loss of acceptability of the records as evidence by courts and the 
loss of credibility in the eyes of the public.  
</p>
<p>10. During a State&#8217;s transition process, rules on access to archives must be clarified. 
Archives play an important role in the prosecution of perpetrators, and both prosecutors and 
human rights defenders must have access to them. Archives were used in Argentina, 
Guatemala and Spain for prosecutions, while in Chile and other countries archives were 
important for truth commissions. Access is also needed for persons seeking rehabilitation. 
In Latvia, for example, information in the national archives was used to restore the names 
and personal information on large numbers of people. However, legislation and regulations 
to facilitate access to archives are lacking or inadequate in many countries.  
</p>
<p>11. States need access to archives in other countries to prosecute human rights violators. 
A non-governmental organization (NGO) in the United States of America has used the 
federal Freedom of Information Act to obtain copies of records for truth commissions in El </p>


<p>Salvador, Guatemala and Peru and for prosecutions in Chile, Peru, and Spain. To enable the 
use of these records, the archives must be protected in third countries, the existence of the 
archives must be known, and inventories of the archives must exist. Institutions in 
Argentina, Chile and Uruguay are developing inventories of documents important for 
human rights. The increasing use of the Internet is also helping people to become aware of 
archives and use them in an optimum way. 
</p>
<p>12. The seminar participants, in that respect, discussed the issue of gaining access to 
information. It was noted with regard, in particular, to military and police records, that the 
existence of freedom of information laws does not guarantee access to such records. One 
solution suggested was, for example, the use of a group of experts to create an inventory of 
what records exist. It was also suggested that a court could appoint a &#8220;special master&#8221; to 
examine records to determine what exists and to create basic finding aids. 
</p>
<p>13. The fragility of the processes of preservation and access to archives in post-conflict 
States was also mentioned. In some Latin American countries a change of Government has 
resulted in problems with access to archives. In Guatemala, civil society needs to support 
an institutional process for access to police and military records that will persist even if the 
Government changes. There are also challenges in that country associated with the process 
of declassifying military records, which is being undertaken by a committee of Peace 
Archives staff members, civilians and armed forces personnel. The military selected only 
11,000 documents for review by the committee.  
</p>
<p>14. Concerning the appropriate time period after which Government records should be 
declassified and available, it was noted, as an example, that the European Commission 
recommends a 30-year period as the maximum for keeping records classified. While there 
should be a clear date for declassification, one standard cannot be applied to all countries. 
For example, in transitional situations, it is important to access records of the past regime 
very rapidly, particularly if they document any type of human rights violation.  
</p>
<p>15. With regard to non-governmental records that must be preserved, those of NGOs, 
political parties directly linked to repressive regimes, and persons and groups who were in 
exile were emphasized. The records of regional and international intergovernmental 
organizations which have become particularly important in the post-World War II period 
deserve the same attention and were identified as records that must also be preserved.  
</p>
<p>16. One suggestion was made regarding the establishment of an international database 
of documents important for human rights prosecutions which could be created and made 
available to prosecutors, with a clear recognition of the complexity of inter-State use of 
documents due to the use of different rules of evidence in different States.  
</p>
<p>17. With regard to the issue of the protection of archives through transfer to third 
countries, it was suggested that there is a possibility of placing records in an institution that 
is not affiliated with the State or with an international institution if there is a lack of public 
confidence in State archives. One example is that of Chile, where private archives are 
centralized in the documentation centre. Other examples are the records of the Guatemala 
and El Salvador truth commissions housed in the United Nations archives in New York 
pursuant to agreements with the Governments. Internationally, there is a continuing need to 
find a space to safeguard archives in two situations: first, when a conflict is taking place or 
appears imminent, and records may be destroyed; second, where records will likely be 
destroyed by environmental problems, such as mould, vermin or natural disasters.   
</p>
<p>18. In relation to the question about the reliability of the information in archives, 
particularly those of the police, and the due process guarantees for the persons named in 
them, such as during lustration processes, a distinction between the authenticity of a 
document and the veracity of a document has to be made, given that State security services 
documents are filled with information that could be false, but they are authentic documents. </p>


<p>The files relating to security services personnel need to be verified, and, in the context of 
lustration, judges should verify the records. The Updated principles provide, in that regard, 
that a person who believes that the archives include false information about him or her must 
be able to challenge the validity of this information, and a corrective statement must be 
preserved by the archives and made available any time the original file is used (principle 
17).  
</p>
<p>19. The issue of ethics training for archives staff was also raised by the experts. It was 
stated that during a transitional process, ethics training for archives staff might be required 
to ensure preservation and access. Archives often inherit staff members who are used to a 
different context for their work and who will need to look at archival processes in a new 
way, taking into account the need to protect records relating to human rights violations and 
to serve the public. In that regard, guidelines for private entities with an interest in archives 
and who do not usually know how to handle them professionally would be helpful to ensure 
the protection of and access to archives during transitions.    
</p>
<p><b> IV. Using archives to hold perpetrators accountable through 
criminal prosecutions 
</b></p>
<p>20. The use of archives for prosecutions of persons allegedly responsible for human 
rights violations was one of the themes discussed during the seminar. A relevant example 
from Guatemala was presented regarding the functioning of the General Archives of 
Central America, the Historic Archives of the National Police and the Peace Archives, 
which cooperate to support prosecutions. The Historic Archives of the National Police 
(established in 2005) has made digital copies of more than 11.5 million records. In a recent 
successful prosecution of a case of enforced disappearance, the prosecutor used more than 
600 documents from those archives. The Peace Archives (established in 2008) is making 
digital copies of documents related to the armed conflict that it obtains from various 
Government organizations and that can be made public. The police archives, the Peace 
Archives and the public prosecutor are discussing a formal agreement on the process of 
access to the archives. 
</p>
<p>21. Examples of the use of archives in the former Yugoslavia were also discussed, 
drawn in particular from the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former 
Yugoslavia which, for instance, obtained documents from Serbian institutions for use as 
evidence. Now the Tribunal records form important archives on human rights violations, 
and the items that have been used in public prosecutions are available through the 
Tribunal&#8217;s Internet site. A second example was drawn from the Humanitarian Law Centre, 
which has taken over 10,000 witness statements, and scanned them as well as an additional 
20,000 documents and photos, all of which are now in a searchable database.  
</p>
<p>22. It was stated that preserving the archives of the International Criminal Tribunal for 
the Former Yugoslavia and ensuring that they were accessible throughout the region of the 
former Yugoslavia was a key component of the Tribunal&#8217;s legacy strategy. A number of 
steps have been already taken to make the judicial records accessible, including the 
establishment of an outreach office; the creation of a public website, the Court Records 
database and the Appeals Chamber Case Law Research Tool; translations of material into 
Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian and Albanian; the creation of digital copies of audio-visual 
records of proceedings; and an amendment of a procedural rule to allow regional 
prosecutors to petition for access to information at the Tribunal. The Tribunal trains persons 
in using Tribunal documents. Following Security Council resolution 1966 (2010), the 
Tribunal developed the Information Centre Project aimed at ensuring the future security of 
and access to the Tribunal&#8217;s records, and it is consulting with countries of the former 
Yugoslavia on the possible establishment of information centres in the region. </p>


<p>23. The participants discussed access to records by defence counsel. Military and police 
defendants might have access to military and security files, several participants reported.  
</p>
<p>24. Another relevant example from the Argentinean NGO Memoria Abierta was shared, 
with respect to documenting human rights violations for use in criminal processes, 
including taking oral testimony from survivors and using blueprints of destroyed buildings, 
witness statements, and reconstructions based on memory to demonstrate that buildings 
used as secret detention centres did exist, even if now demolished. Memoria Abierta assists 
attorneys in using its database and the archives.  
</p>
<p>25. The participants discussed the challenges associated with using military or police 
archives to achieve accountability. One of the challenges identified in the seminar was the 
access to documents from security forces, even in a democratic State. While there might be 
justified restrictions on access to information, in some instances access was restricted 
because of the improper classification of acts as criminal. It was equally stated that when 
access was not granted, other sources could be used for prosecutions, such as military 
hospital documents and pension fund records, for example.   
</p>
<p>26. Regarding what should constitute a good archives law, the ICA model law was 
suggested as containing relevant elements that should be included.  
</p>
<p>27. On the use of archives in vetting processes, the example of the 1992 Ad Hoc 
Commission in El Salvador was presented. This Commission had a mandate to review all 
officials of the armed forces in relation to their involvement in violations and their 
commitment to peace. Another example was drawn from the law governing the Ministry for 
State Security (Stasi) archives, which specifies that agents or collaborators can access their 
own file in order to give them a chance to respond. This is particularly important when the 
names of agents or collaborators are disclosed because of the possibility that the 
collaboration took place under torture or coercion.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Using archives in non-judicial truth-seeking mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>28. Challenges associated with the use and preservation of the archives of the truth 
commission in Timor-Leste were presented. There were no archives in Timor-Leste when 
the commission started its work. It also faced technical issues, such as lack of equipment, 
inadequate climate control, and power failures that led to the loss of databases. The political 
instability in 2006 illustrated the need for security. The Parliament is considering 
establishing an institute of memory, which would include the records of the truth 
commission and its follow-up activities. A number of other archival initiatives have been 
launched, and 11 State and NGO archives now exist. Documents relating to human rights 
violations in 1999 are held by both the Prosecutor in Timor-Leste and the United Nations, 
and evidence collected by the Timor-Leste/Indonesia Truth and Friendship Commission is 
held in the Timor-Leste consulate in Bali, Indonesia. A number of suggestions on how to 
address the challenges facing archives in Timor-Leste were made, including promoting the 
importance of archives, coordinating work between existing archives, training, and 
developing legislation on archives. Additionally, the development of archives should be 
part of the agenda of United Nations field operations. 
</p>
<p>29. With regard to the work of the National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation, 
the National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture and reparations initiatives 
in Chile, it was noted that the archives established by human rights groups during the 
dictatorship formed the primary documentation available to the truth and reconciliation 
commission. The National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture was not 
given access to the records of the previous commissions. In 2007, Chile created the 
Museum of Memory and Human Rights to preserve the heritage of human rights bodies and </p>


<p>to disseminate information to combat impunity. When materials are donated, the museum 
agrees with the donors on the conditions of access; most donors agree to make the materials 
available to the public. The museum also has a digital library, a database for the archives, 
and a reference service for the public. The museum is interested in obtaining information 
from other countries, such as Paraguay and Argentina, with closely linked histories.   
</p>
<p>30. Examples regarding public access to the records of the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission in South Africa were also shared. When the South African truth commission 
was planned, there was little understanding of the role and value of archives. This has had a 
major effect on the subsequent problems with archiving the Commission&#8217;s records. The 
temporal, geographical and material scope of the Commission&#8217;s archives is limited, 
reflecting the narrow scope of the Commission&#8217;s mandate and its focus on individuals 
rather than institutions. The large-scale destruction of records by the apartheid State also 
limited the Commission&#8217;s work. The Commission has recommended that an independent 
research team undertake a comprehensive analysis of the remaining records of the 
intelligence service, but this has not occurred. The Commission&#8217;s own records suffered 
losses due to inadequate internal controls, particularly over electronic records, the 
requirement to return some State documents to the originating agencies, and the 
inappropriate designation of some records as personal property. The national archives hold 
the Commission&#8217;s records. Access is possible only through the use of the country&#8217;s freedom 
of information legislation, often a difficult and expensive process. Review and release to 
the public of the documents in the Commission&#8217;s archives involves various Government 
departments. 
</p>
<p>31. The South African History Archive and the University of the Witwatersrand have 
undertaken initiatives to promote access to the Commission&#8217;s records. A number of factors 
that should be taken into account in managing the Commission&#8217;s records were emphasized, 
such as the human and financial resources available, the archival expertise required, the 
importance of NGO records and the role of the records of private bodies in documenting 
human rights violations, the complexities in dealing with State archives in the conflict and 
post-conflict context, and the importance of recognizing educational, linguistic and 
technological inequalities in accessing and using archives. 
</p>
<p>32. With regard to the issue of holding the records of truth commissions in an institution 
outside the national archives during transition, it was stated that, for example, the follow-on 
body to the Timor-Leste commission was not confident that, in the absence of specific 
legislation, the national archives would be able to handle the records of the truth 
commission. In Chile it had been necessary to house documents from individuals and 
NGOs in the Museum of Memory and Human Rights, a separate entity with a mandate to 
ensure access to the public and cooperate with the national archives, because the public 
needed to trust the way their documents will be used and made public.  
</p>
<p>33. In Argentina, the records of the truth commission were ultimately transferred to the 
new secretariat for human rights that manages a national archive for memory. Access to the 
archives requires a showing of &#8220;legitimate interest&#8221;. This requirement for legal interest also 
applies to access to records in the Serbian court archives; one must demonstrate that one 
has a legal interest in the requested documentation. This situation calls for a clear definition 
of what is a legitimate legal interest.    
</p>
<p>34. On a question about whether commissions were able to access records of private 
entities, such as NGOs and churches, it was stated that in Chile the information compiled 
by the Catholic church had been used by the reparations commission. In South Africa a 
number of NGOs and churches had made their archives available to the truth commission.  
</p>
<p>35. With regard to the question about how public policy is developed on preserving the 
memory of historic events, the experience of countries in preserving and recording historic </p>


<p>memory, and how States get cooperation to preserve that memory, the example of the 
Council of Europe&#8217;s important recommendations addressing education and guidelines to 
prevent historical revisionism was highlighted. 
</p>
<p>36. The importance for truth commissions to have access to archives in other countries 
was also highlighted. A special problem with records in other countries is that the families 
of missing persons and other individuals affected do not know where the archives are 
located and thus from whom to request access. The same applies to Timor-Leste with the 
records located in Indonesia, and the connected issues of cooperation between the truth 
commission and the Indonesian military authorities. There have also been difficulties in 
obtaining documents from elsewhere outside Timor-Leste.  
</p>
<p>37. It was observed that media archives, especially those of State media, are important 
to truth-seeking and judicial processes, but that it is important to be aware that for various 
reasons, access to this material is difficult and using it requires specialized staff, which a 
commission may lack. 
</p>
<p>38. Turning to the question of the use of archives in reparations programmes, it was 
noted that in Chile there was no separate procedure that used archives to prove that 
reparations were justified. According to the law on reparations, if a person&#8217;s name was 
included in the list of victims in the truth commission report, the person was eligible for 
reparations. With regard to Spain, standards were established in 1979 for reparations and 
there was extensive use of public archives. For example, reparation for a political prisoner 
was based on the time spent in prison, so prison records were useful. Other sources were 
also used, such as the records of the Court of Accounts, which documented the 
expenditures on political prisoners in detention.  
</p>
<p>39. In Guatemala&#8217;s reparations programme, the truth commission report is important to 
validate a claim, as are city hall and municipal registers that provide birth and residence 
information. Victims may now also get information from police or other archives to support 
their reparations claim, and these archives are also accessible by families who need 
information to prove that a disappeared person did exist. In Timor-Leste the truth 
commission did not classify victims, so the proposed law on reparations provides for a 
registration programme that, because of lack of records, will have to depend on statements 
by local government officials and NGOs to verify a claim. 
</p>
<p>40. Attention was called to the importance of archives to memorialization efforts. 
Archives, especially legal documents and testimony and the reports of the truth 
commissions, enable, for example, the identification of certain places of torture and their 
cultural and historical importance. In Chile, for instance, there are approximately 200 
memorials regarding such places, and the Museum of Memory and Human Rights has 
compiled testimony and background documentation on them for the purpose of raising 
awareness.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Placement of archives of repressive rule 
</b></p>
<p>41. With regard to the requirements of an archival system, the experts argued that 
whether permanent or temporary legislation is enacted, the archival system that is 
established must be based on national legislation and international standards and must have 
the necessary human and technical resources. The rule of law requires a good 
administrative policy that will ensure appropriate management and proper protection of 
both public and private documents, and access to those documents. A central archives 
administration must manage government records from the moment they come into being 
until they are either destroyed or preserved indefinitely. The central archives administration 
may report to the Head of Government or to a ministry or another appropriate governmental </p>


<p>entity. It will need sub-units to develop plans, both administrative and archival. The 
archives administration also requires advisory bodies that include representatives from a 
broad range of civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p>42. The archival systems must establish where the records will be kept and for how 
long. When they are created, the records need to be easily available. The archives may later 
be moved to an intermediate archives, where the records are available to the originating 
office if needed. Later still, they can be moved to the central historical archives. This flow 
of records and information must be logical and understandable to both government and the 
public. The length of time that the records will remain at each stage and whether at the end 
they will be retained or destroyed also needs to be clearly set out by the governing policy or 
by a body established to make such decisions.   
</p>
<p>43. Despite the need of an inventory of public and private archives, private archives, 
experts said, may be outside the scope of the national archives law; private owners of 
important parts of the national heritage should be required by law to preserve and maintain 
their materials, which would include not exporting them without permission. It is important 
to have clear guidelines and a designated unit or person responsible for oversight.   
</p>
<p>44. An overview to archives and the right to truth in Argentina was presented in that 
regard. There has been major progress in Argentina, including in locating archives that have 
helped bring perpetrators to trial. These archives now form part of the nation&#8217;s memory. In 
cases of gross violations of human rights, the State must actively seek the truth about the 
past.  
</p>
<p>45. The records of the truth commission in Argentina are now part of the national 
archives of historical memory managed by the human rights secretariat. The State has made 
good use of archives in investigations of disappeared persons. For example, the partial 
archives of the fingerprint files of the Buenos Aires Police was used to help identify bodies 
and verify that these people had been victims of death squads. In 2010, the State adopted 
access rules for information held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and efforts are being 
made to find information in the records of Argentina&#8217;s embassies abroad. The Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office signed an agreement with the Ministry of Defence allowing the Public 
Prosecutor to look at all archives that could be useful in prosecuting human rights 
violations.

<p>46. Memoria Abierta holds its own archives, archives from other NGOs and private 
materials donated to it or copies thereof. In addition, archives of human rights organizations 
were built during the dictatorship, and they offer two particularly important kinds of 
information: documentation of habeas corpus appeals made by families about disappeared 
relatives and letters given to families in response to their claims. Memoria Abierta also 
creates documentation through oral interviews, of which 700 have been completed and 
made available online. It created an inventory of archives in Argentina in 2004, which has 
expanded to cover 45 archives in six countries. It is publicly accessible and searchable on 
the Memoria Abierta website. The website also has a body of documents that are easily 
accessible for prosecutors, including copies of documents from the trials of military leaders.

<p>47. The seminar participants discussed the challenges associated with obtaining access 
to the records of the military. According to the experts, such access is important both in 
relation to human rights violations but also for the revision of the country&#8217;s history. An 
example of the establishment of military archives outside the national archives system, but 
based on similar archival principles, was presented. The military archivists are civilians but 
the director is a military officer, who can overrule the professional judgments of the staff. A 
number of problems have arisen with specific access requests, and there is no timeline for 
the declassification of military records. Views were expressed that military archives needed </p>


<p>to be included in the general archival policy of the State, under the same rules as the 
civilian archives.  
</p>
<p>48. In terms of what would be the components of a public policy that would guarantee 
control, access, oversight and preservation of archives, experts at the seminar said that that 
issue could not be in the hands of just one public entity because archival services could not 
secure enough government funds for a large central public archives. Instead a national 
system of archives should be established. The ICA draft statement of  principles of access 
to archives was mentioned in that regard. The statement of principles covers access to 
government and NGO records and personal papers in archives. One principle in the draft 
states that there is a right of access to archives for human rights research even if the 
archives are closed for other research purposes.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Concluding observations 
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>Archives contain essential evidence for criminal accountability and non-judicial 
truth-seeking processes. This evidence is found in the archives of both governmental 
and non-governmental institutions and in all physical formats, from paper to 
audiovisual and digital. The Updated Set of principles for the protection and 
promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity require States to take 
&#8220;effective action&#8221; to protect records that provide evidence of gross violations of 
human rights. This duty is not confined to the records of State bodies. States must 
have an archival policy that ensures that all archives pertaining to human rights held 
by all types of institutions are preserved and protected. A State must establish a 
national archival system, including both the archives of the State and the archives of 
private institutions and individuals that hold important parts of the national 
patrimony. The State must enact an archives law that declares that the nation&#8217;s 
documentary heritage is to be retained and preserved, establishes the framework for 
managing State records from their creation to destruction or preservation in an 
historical archive, provides the mandate of the archival authority and sets out the 
rules for its operations, and establishes clear criteria for access to archives. 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>In transitional periods, if the State archives is not trusted or does not yet have 
the necessary capacities to manage sensitive and complex records, it may be necessary 
to establish intermediate archives to manage the sensitive records of State bodies of 
the repressive regime. In these instances, the archival functions of the intermediate 
archives would be the same as those of the State historical archives. However, it would 
operate in a different context within a different organizational structure, albeit still 
under the supervision of the State. Ultimately, the records of the intermediate archives 
would be transferred to the national archival system. 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>Records of truth commissions and special courts and tribunals must be 
preserved. Records of truth commissions are often needed after the commission 
completes its mandate, whether for prosecution, reparations or other State action. In 
these cases, the need for access to the commission&#8217;s records does not diminish with the 
closing of the commission.  
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>The archives held by human rights groups are crucial resources for truth 
commissions and judicial processes. The archival profession should help NGOs 
develop greater capacity to manage their records. The International Council on 
Archives has produced many standards and statements of best practice, including a 
guide for managing the records of NGOs. Human rights groups and victims may lack 
confidence in State entities, including State archives, and therefore may prefer to 
deposit their permanently valuable private records in non-State archives. The </b></p>


<p><b>archives of regional organizations, intergovernmental bodies and third countries are 
important for addressing human rights violations. These archives must cooperate with 
victims and their families, human rights investigators and judicial authorities that 
request their help, and provide both information about their holdings and access to 
the relevant materials. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>During transitional periods, both governmental and non-governmental archival 
institutions must have good physical security. They must have sufficient financial and 
trained personnel resources to preserve the archives and make them available. They 
must have clearly stated access rules that cover all archival holdings. The archives 
staff must understand and be sensitive to user needs, realizing that the needs of 
victims and families are different from the needs of journalists and that these differ 
again from those of persons who must defend themselves against legal charges. People 
may be victims in one role and perpetrators in another, which must be considered 
when providing reference services. A proactive outreach programme is essential. 
People need to know what archives exist and what services are available to them. This 
is particularly true because many of the persons seeking information for human rights 
purposes have no prior experience with archives. Administrative impediments must 
not be put in the way of service. </b></p>
