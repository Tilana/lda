<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. 2014 marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child, which provided significant opportunities to mobilize enhanced support 
</p>
<p>for children&#8217;s protection from violence. During the year, three important processes gained 
</p>
<p>special relevance for children and countries across regions. 
</p>
<p>2. First, the commemorative events held around the world confirmed that the values 
</p>
<p>and principles of the Convention remain a crucial reference for shaping national laws and 
</p>
<p>policies, and generating positive change in attitudes and behaviours towards children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>protection. The anniversary of the Convention helped to generate valuable information 
</p>
<p>campaigns to raise awareness of the long-lasting impact of violence on children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>development and well-being, deepening understanding of how and why children are 
</p>
<p>affected by violence. The anniversary also helped to set in motion concerted efforts to enact 
</p>
<p>and enforce legislation, implement comprehensive policy agendas, gather data and 
</p>
<p>consolidate institutions to safeguard children&#8217;s care and protection.  
</p>
<p>3. Second, the international community has made progress in shaping the global 
</p>
<p>development agenda beyond 2015, aiming at a future free from poverty and violence. As 
</p>
<p>the Secretary-General highlights in his report &#8220;The Road to dignity by 2030: Ending 
</p>
<p>Poverty, Transforming All Lives and Protecting the Planet&#8221;,1 &#8220;we are on the threshold of 
</p>
<p>the most important year of development since the founding of the United Nations itself &#8230; 
</p>
<p>With this extraordinary process and the unprecedented leadership that it has witnessed, we 
</p>
<p>have an historic opportunity and duty to act, boldly, vigorously and expeditiously, to turn 
</p>
<p>reality into a life of dignity for all, leaving no one behind&#8221; (para. 161). The best way to 
</p>
<p>avoid leaving children behind is to put them first.  
</p>
<p>4. Third, the present report pays special attention to the rapid development of 
</p>
<p>information and communication technologies and their impact on the way children learn, 
</p>
<p>communicate, play and more generally, relate to the world. Alongside the role technology 
</p>
<p>can play in supporting children&#8217;s development and protection, the report highlights 
</p>
<p>potential risks for children&#8217;s well-being and freedom from violence.  
</p>
<p>5. The report also addresses emerging concerns,2 focusing on the risk of violence for 
</p>
<p>girls involved with the criminal justice system as victims and witnesses, and when deprived 
</p>
<p>of liberty.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child 
</b></p>
<p>6. The anniversary of the Convention provided a timely opportunity to take stock of the 
</p>
<p>significant achievements made towards the realization of children&#8217;s rights. It became a 
</p>
<p>strategic opportunity to reflect on the persisting challenges that compromise children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>development and well-being. 
</p>
<p>7. The right of children to freedom from violence lies at the heart of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>Thanks to the process of implementing the Convention and the United Nations Study on 
</p>
<p>Violence Against Children, children&#8217;s protection from violence has evolved from a largely 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>

<p>hidden and neglected topic into a growing global concern. Over the past year, that process 
</p>
<p>has been further strengthened at the international, regional and national levels.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Further mainstreaming violence against children in the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>agenda 
</b></p>
<p>8. In 2014, violence against children gained increased visibility within the United 
</p>
<p>Nations system. The consultations on the post-2015 development agenda were a decisive 
</p>
<p>dimension of that process, and important United Nations studies issued during the year 
</p>
<p>helped to further expose the prevalence and seriousness of incidents of violence against 
</p>
<p>children. 
</p>
<p>9. As highlighted by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) report &#8220;Hidden in 
</p>
<p>Plain Sight&#8221;,3 the World Health Organization Global status report on violence prevention 
</p>
<p>2014,4 the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Global Study on Homicide 20135 and 
</p>
<p>its Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2014,6 the risk of violence remains widespread 
</p>
<p>and deeply concerning. Almost a billion children between the ages of 2 and 14 are subject 
</p>
<p>to physical punishment by their caregivers; 84 million girls are victims of emotional, 
</p>
<p>physical, emotional or sexual violence at the hands of their husbands or partners; 8 per cent 
</p>
<p>of global homicides affect children under the age of 15; and child trafficking continues to 
</p>
<p>increase, in some regions reaching more than 60 per cent of detected victims, most of 
</p>
<p>whom are girls. 
</p>
<p>10. Clearly, the urgency of safeguarding children from violence has not diminished and 
</p>
<p>the evidence emerging from those reports offers a sound basis to frame States&#8217; actions and 
</p>
<p>accelerate progress in implementation efforts.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Enhancing the normative foundation: United Nations Model Strategies 
</b></p>
<p><b>and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>Children in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice 
</b></p>
<p>11. Significant progress has been made towards universal ratification of the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
</p>
<p>prostitution and child pornography which, by the end of 2014, was in force in 169 
</p>
<p>countries. Similarly, there has been an incremental adherence to the Optional Protocol to 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure, following its 
</p>
<p>entry into force in April 2014. The Special Representative will continue to support those 
</p>
<p>efforts and promote the wide dissemination of child-friendly versions of both protocols,7 
</p>
<p>which are already available in ten languages.  
</p>
<p>12. In December 2014, the General Assembly adopted new standards to protect children 
</p>
<p>from violence &#8212; the United Nations Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Violence against Children in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal 
</p>
<p>Justice (A/C.3/69/L.5). 
</p>
<p>13. The Model Strategies bring together international norms and standards on children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights and criminal justice. They provide valuable guidance to Member States to enhance 
</p>

<p>progress in crime prevention and in law reform, policy development and practical 
</p>
<p>implementation. 
</p>
<p>14. The Model Strategies address crucial challenges for children&#8217;s protection from 
</p>
<p>violence in the criminal justice system. Misperceptions and widespread prejudice towards 
</p>
<p>marginalized groups of children continue to fuel incidents of violence and re-victimization. 
</p>
<p>Those children are frequently perceived as responsible for serious crimes and high rates of 
</p>
<p>criminality, and deserving of harsh sanctions and lengthy periods of detention. Yet 
</p>
<p>available data indicate that children are not predominant in crimes statistics and in the 
</p>
<p>majority of cases where they may have infringed the criminal law, it is for minor offences 
</p>
<p>and petty crimes. 
</p>
<p>15. Gender discrimination and stereotyped gender roles increase the risk of violence 
</p>
<p>against girls, including rape, forced marriage and crimes in the name of honour. Those 
</p>
<p>misperceptions may lead to punitive approaches in legislation, policy and implementation.  
</p>
<p>16. In some communities, superstitious beliefs towards vulnerable children may lead to 
</p>
<p>accusations of witchcraft and in turn to serious acts of violence, torture and also murder of 
</p>
<p>those children. As a result of fear and social pressure, incidents of violence are often met 
</p>
<p>with impunity. 
</p>
<p>17. To overcome those challenges, the Model Strategies call for a legal ban on all forms 
</p>
<p>of violence against children, including as a form of discipline, control or sentencing, and for 
</p>
<p>the removal from legislation of any justification condoning or allowing violence. 
</p>
<p>18. Legislation should equally align the minimum age of criminal responsibility with 
</p>
<p>international standards, and decriminalize status offences and survival behaviours. To 
</p>
<p>ensure that deprivation of liberty is used only as a measure of last resort, legal provisions 
</p>
<p>need to foresee a range of appropriate non-custodial measures for diverting children away 
</p>
<p>from the criminal justice system, such as restorative justice, warning, probation and 
</p>
<p>community-based programmes. 
</p>
<p>19. The Model Strategies call for high-quality basic social services for children, and for 
</p>
<p>programmes that address the root causes of social exclusion and inequity. States need 
</p>
<p>strong child protection systems and effective institutional cooperation between all relevant 
</p>
<p>sectors, including child welfare, health, education, social protection, law enforcement and 
</p>
<p>criminal justice agencies. 
</p>
<p>20. The Model Strategies also call for data and research on the incidence and impact of 
</p>
<p>violence on children, as well as on the risk factors, attitudes and social norms that underlie 
</p>
<p>it. Broad public awareness and social mobilization campaigns are also needed, with the 
</p>
<p>involvement of the media, professional associations, community leaders and faith-based 
</p>
<p>organizations. 
</p>
<p>21. Professionals in the criminal justice system may also share misperceptions and 
</p>
<p>societal attitudes, and they often lack training on children&#8217;s rights and ways of securing 
</p>
<p>their protection from violence. All professionals working with children in the formal and 
</p>
<p>informal justice systems should acquire the knowledge and skills to safeguard children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights and keep children safe. 
</p>
<p>22. Children are at risk of violence at all stages of the criminal justice process and in 
</p>
<p>many cases, incidents remain unreported and are not investigated. Child victims may 
</p>
<p>conceal their cases, fearing reprisals or lacking trust in the justice system. The Model 
</p>
<p>Strategies therefore call for strong accountability and enforcement mechanisms to prevent 
</p>
<p>violence, investigate abuses and fight impunity, including through unannounced visits of 
</p>
<p>independent child rights institutions to places of detention.  </p>


<p>23. The Model Strategies provide a crucial tool to promote progress in violence 
</p>
<p>prevention and elimination. However, their success is dependent on the extent to which 
</p>
<p>they are acknowledged and used to make a real difference in the lives of children.  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Representative remains strongly committed to promoting the 
</p>
<p>dissemination and implementation of the Model Strategies across regions. The Pan-
</p>
<p>American Child and Adolescent Congress,8 organized in December 2014 in Brazil, offered 
</p>
<p>one such opportunity to promote their implementation through the Organization of 
</p>
<p>American States.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Consolidating progress at the regional and national levels 
</b></p>
<p>25. Protecting children from violence is a priority on the political agendas of regional 
</p>
<p>organizations and institutions &#8212; in the Arab region, Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas, 
</p>
<p>strong political commitments have been solemnly made, and detailed agendas for action put 
</p>
<p>in place to guide Member States in implementation. Across regions, there is promising 
</p>
<p>change in the promotion of an integrated approach to violence prevention and response; the 
</p>
<p>enactment of a legal ban on violence against children; the consolidation of data systems and 
</p>
<p>research to assess the magnitude of the phenomenon and identify children at high risk; and, 
</p>
<p>no less importantly, wide alliances and social mobilization processes are helping to 
</p>
<p>overcome deeply rooted attitudes and social norms that condone violence against children.  
</p>
<p>26. In order to increase implementation, the Special Representative has promoted 
</p>
<p>periodic high-level regional meetings, and five comprehensive regional studies have been 
</p>
<p>conducted to capture change and re-energize action. The studies were necessary in order to 
</p>
<p>monitor how much change is taking place and assess the difference it is making, and to 
</p>
<p>target action to prevent children from being left behind.9 
</p>
<p>27. Dialogue between regions has also gained ground with the Cross-Regional Round 
</p>
<p>Tables hosted annually by the Special Representative. The most recent meeting, held in 
</p>
<p>June 2014 in Jamaica, provided an effective platform to promote the sharing of experiences 
</p>
<p>and agree on joint action to prevent and eliminate violence from early childhood through 
</p>
<p>law, policy, research, adequate resources and changes in attitudes and behaviour.10
 
</p>
<p>28. In 2015, the annual round table will be organized jointly with the Council of Europe, 
</p>
<p>in Strasbourg, and will primarily address children&#8217;s protection from sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>29. At the national level, important developments have taken place. A growing number 
</p>
<p>of countries have adopted a national time-bound agenda to address all forms of violence 
</p>
<p>against children, in some cases supported by detailed implementation action plans.  
</p>
<p>30. Significant legislative reforms have been undertaken to prohibit violence in all its 
</p>
<p>forms, including within the family. At the end of 2014, some 45 countries had 
</p>
<p>comprehensive legal bans, triple the number in place in 2006. In order to support 
</p>
<p>implementation, many States have promoted information and social mobilization 
</p>
<p>campaigns, capacity-building initiatives for professionals working with and for children, 
</p>
<p>and initiatives to promote positive parenting and non-violent discipline. That has led to a 
</p>
<p>decrease in the acceptance of the use of violence, and a greater tendency to report incidents 
</p>
<p>of violence.

<p>31. Lack of data and research remain pressing challenges, but promising progress has 
</p>
<p>taken place in that area with the development of national data surveys on violence against 
</p>
<p>children in a number of countries in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. Those efforts helped to 
</p>
<p>inform the design and implementation of multisectoral policy and programme responses, 
</p>
<p>the promotion of training initiatives and the issuance of guidance for professionals. In 
</p>
<p>support of that process, in October 2014, the Special Representative joined the Government 
</p>
<p>of Cambodia in launching its national household survey, the first to be completed in the 
</p>
<p>East Asia and Pacific region. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Enhancing c</b>hildren&#8217;s protection from violence <b>in the 
post-2015 development agenda 
</b></p>
<p>32. Ensuring that the protection of children from violence remains at the centre of the 
</p>
<p>post-2015 development agenda has been a high priority for the Special Representative, as 
</p>
<p>has including in the process those who are most affected: children and young people 
</p>
<p>themselves.  
</p>
<p>33. In order to capture the wealth of children&#8217;s opinions, the Special Representative 
</p>
<p>undertook, in close cooperation with civil society partners, a review of a wide range of 
</p>
<p>reports and contributions to the post-2015 agenda debate, including many national 
</p>
<p>consultations held around the world. The review informed the Special Representative&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>report &#8220;Why children&#8217;s protection from violence must be at the heart of the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda: A review of consultations with children on the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda&#8221;.11 
</p>
<p>34. The report shows that children are eager to have a voice on the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda. The message from the more than eight hundred thousand children 
</p>
<p>involved in the numerous consultations is clear and unambiguous: &#8220;violence is a major 
</p>
<p>obstacle to child development and it urgently needs to be brought to an end!&#8221;  
</p>
<p>35. In their recommendations, children highlighted three major issues. Firstly, they 
</p>
<p>expressed deep concern at the high levels of violence affecting their lives &#8212; in schools, the 
</p>
<p>community, the workplace and the home. Girls underscored the particularly high risk of 
</p>
<p>sexual violence, and boys the special risk of severe forms of physical abuse, crime-related 
</p>
<p>violence and homicide. Children called for their effective protection from violence in all 
</p>
<p>contexts and at all times. They ranked protection from violence as their second highest 
</p>
<p>priority, immediately after education. For them, education is crucial to develop children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>talents and skills and to promote healthy lifestyles, and it is important in preventing 
</p>
<p>violence and discrimination, countering intolerance, and enhancing dialogue and critical 
</p>
<p>thinking. As they noted, receiving an inclusive and high-quality education helps prevent 
</p>
<p>fear and abuse, as well as violence-related school dropout, early pregnancy, child marriage 
</p>
<p>and child labour. 
</p>
<p>36. Secondly, children acknowledged that some manifestations of violence have 
</p>
<p>heightened incidence in different regions of the world, where some groups of children are at 
</p>
<p>special risk of violence. In Africa, children with disabilities were considered particularly 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to violence and discrimination in schools. In many cases, early pregnancy and 
</p>
<p>harmful practices, such as child marriage and female genital mutilation, were special 
</p>
<p>concerns. In Asia, trafficking, child labour and violence associated with drugs and alcohol 
</p>
<p>abuse were particularly emphasized. In Latin America and the Caribbean, domestic and 
</p>
<p>family violence ranked the highest, followed by sexual abuse, corporal punishment, armed 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 11 See http://srsg.violenceagainstchildren.org/page/1153. </p>


<p>violence and homicide. Structural violence associated with marginalization, social 
</p>
<p>exclusion and lack of opportunities was a constant concern echoed by the children, and 
</p>
<p>indigenous children and those of African descent were recognized as being particularly at 
</p>
<p>risk of violence in schools and on the streets. In Europe, violence in schools, domestic 
</p>
<p>violence, early pregnancy and child marriage ranked high amongst children&#8217;s concerns, 
</p>
<p>while children belonging to ethnic minorities, including the Roma community, were 
</p>
<p>considered at particular risk of violence, discrimination and exclusion. 
</p>
<p>37. The third message strongly conveyed by children was that violence constitutes not 
</p>
<p>only a crucial priority that the post-2015 development agenda should specifically address, 
</p>
<p>but also a cross-cutting concern that other development goals need to take into 
</p>
<p>consideration. Thus, while placing special emphasis on the role of education in preventing 
</p>
<p>and addressing violence, they highlighted the fact that violence is widespread in schools, 
</p>
<p>compromising child development and well-being. Violence prevention was a dimension 
</p>
<p>that, in their view, public health systems should consider. Violence was equally felt to 
</p>
<p>undermine gender equality and empowerment, and social practices and beliefs compromise 
</p>
<p>girls&#8217; confidence and ability to report incidents of violence, at times leading to school 
</p>
<p>dropout. Moreover, children recognized that violence and poverty are closely related and 
</p>
<p>both can lead to high risks of poor child health, failing school performance, social exclusion 
</p>
<p>and welfare dependency. 
</p>
<p>38. As the report powerfully illustrates, children are seriously engaged in the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development process and have a clear vision for the future: they want to enjoy a safe and 
</p>
<p>healthy life, free from all forms of violence.  
</p>
<p>39. Those important dimensions need to be preserved in the finalization and 
</p>
<p>implementation of the sustainable development goals. Indeed, freedom from violence is 
</p>
<p>indispensable to sustainable development, to a future in which children can grow up 
</p>
<p>healthy, well-nourished, resilient, well-educated, culturally sensitive and effectively 
</p>
<p>protected from neglect, abuse and exploitation.  
</p>
<p>40. The views expressed by children find an echo in the outcome document that the 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals submitted to 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly.12 In fact, particular emphasis is placed on violence against children 
</p>
<p>in the document, both as a target under goal 16 on peaceful and inclusive societies, and as a 
</p>
<p>cross-cutting dimension of other goals, including education, gender equality and 
</p>
<p>empowerment and decent work. 
</p>
<p>41. Violence against girls and boys is also a concern echoed by the Secretary-General in 
</p>
<p>his report mentioned in paragraph 3 above.  
</p>
<p>42. As the international community moves forward in the shaping of the global post- 
</p>
<p>2015 development agenda, Member States&#8217; decisive voices and influence are needed to 
</p>
<p>promote an agenda that bridges development and children&#8217;s rights concerns, and is guided 
</p>
<p>by the best interests of the child. 
</p>
<p>43. To leverage progress in the years to come, three important steps remain critical: 
</p>
<p> (a) Firstly, to mobilize the voice and commitment of leaders in all areas to 
</p>
<p>advocate for the elimination of violence against children to be preserved as a distinct target, 
</p>
<p>as well as a cross-cutting concern in other goals related to education, health, gender 
</p>
<p>equality and decent work. Political support and secure resources are indispensable to 
</p>
<p>achieve that aim.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12 See http://srsg.violenceagainstchildren.org/document/a-68-l61_1166. </p>


<p> (b) Second, building upon the significant efforts promoted within and beyond the 
</p>
<p>United Nations system, it is critical to invest in sound data on violence against children, and 
</p>
<p>agree on a set of indicators and monitoring tools to track progress in that area and to 
</p>
<p>promote global accountability mechanisms at the local, national and international levels. 
</p>
<p> (c) Third, to continue to include in the process those who are most affected: 
</p>
<p>children and young people. They need to be given genuine opportunities and platforms to 
</p>
<p>help shape the road ahead as true partners and agents of change. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Information and communication technologies and violence 
against children 
</b></p>
<p>44. In 1989, when the Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted, the Internet 
</p>
<p>was still in its infancy. It was during that same year that the World Wide Web was 
</p>
<p>developed.  
</p>
<p>45. Twenty-five years on, the rights of the child remain at the heart of our concerns. At 
</p>
<p>the same time, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have evolved rapidly, 
</p>
<p>bridging physical distances, opening up new ways of communicating, learning, delivering 
</p>
<p>services and doing business.  
</p>
<p>46. Children have not been exempt from those developments: mobile phones, computers 
</p>
<p>and access to the Internet are very present in children&#8217;s daily lives. ICTs offer children new 
</p>
<p>and exciting means of enhancing knowledge and skills and experiencing creative research 
</p>
<p>and cultural activities, as well as engaging in play, socialization and entertainment.  
</p>
<p>47. However, there are also risks associated with ICTs. Children can be exposed to 
</p>
<p>harmful information or abusive material, groomed by potential predators, and subject to 
</p>
<p>exploitation and abuse, including through the production and distribution of child abuse 
</p>
<p>images or live web streaming. In some cases, including cyber-bullying, children&#8217;s own 
</p>
<p>conduct online may harm others and represent a risk to themselves.  
</p>
<p>48. Concern about the role of ICTs in generating violence against children has been 
</p>
<p>growing in recent years. In 2006, the United Nations Study on Violence Against Children 
</p>
<p>acknowledged that &#8220;the Internet and other developments of communication technologies &#8230; 
</p>
<p>appear to be associated with an increased risk of sexual exploitation of children, as well as 
</p>
<p>other forms of violence&#8221; (A/61/299, para. 77). The third World Congress against Sexual 
</p>
<p>Exploitation of Children and Adolescents, held in 2008 in Brazil, reaffirmed that concern.  
</p>
<p>49. The topic was also highlighted in countries&#8217; responses to the global survey on 
</p>
<p>violence against children, published in 2013 by the Special Representative.13 Governments 
</p>
<p>stressed the importance of adapting laws, policies and practices to the evolving challenges 
</p>
<p>generated by fast-developing technology, and expressed the need for research, data and 
</p>
<p>international cooperation forums in which common concerns could be addressed, 
</p>
<p>experiences shared and solutions found.  
</p>
<p>50. In response to those concerns, in October 2014 the Special Representative published 
</p>
<p>a thematic report on the topic,14 which was informed by an expert consultation and 
</p>
<p>available research, and built upon consultations held with children and adolescents. It calls 
</p>
<p>for an inclusive, safe and empowering digital agenda that strikes the right balance between

<p>Children&#8221;. Available from http://srsg.violenceagainstchildren.org/page/1154. </p>


<p>ensuring that children benefit from the potential offered by ICTs while enjoying safety and 
</p>
<p>effective online protection.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Children and the digital world: maximizing opportunities 
</b></p>
<p><b>and minimizing risks 
</b></p>
<p>51. Across regions, more and more children use information and communication 
</p>
<p>technologies, starting at an increasingly young age. Children navigate online for hours, 
</p>
<p>often without adult guidance or supervision. Although that enhances children&#8217;s digital 
</p>
<p>literacy, it may also expose them to online risks. 
</p>
<p>52. ICTs and access to the Internet open avenues for children&#8217;s empowerment, learning, 
</p>
<p>communication, social interaction and entertainment. Increasingly research is showing the 
</p>
<p>importance of digital technology as a learning tool, and its contribution to children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>linguistic, cognitive and social development. For the youngest children, the use of 
</p>
<p>touchscreen devices in kindergarten is associated with vocabulary development and 
</p>
<p>academic achievement. 
</p>
<p>53. ICTs also enable children, and indeed adults, to learn about human rights and ways 
</p>
<p>of securing their protection. ICTs are increasingly the means children choose to seek advice 
</p>
<p>from child helplines, approach a children&#8217;s ombuds, report incidents of violence, ask for 
</p>
<p>help and assistance, or promote child rights advocacy through websites, blogs and social 
</p>
<p>networks.  
</p>
<p>54. Alongside their unique potential, ICTs are associated with many risks that are 
</p>
<p>sometimes difficult to detect and address, including for families and caregivers. Openness 
</p>
<p>and accessibility are fundamental aspects of the Internet, but therein also lie some of the 
</p>
<p>greatest threats to children&#8217;s safety and protection from violence.  
</p>
<p>55. Harmful material and information, including violent, sexually explicit or hateful 
</p>
<p>content, are readily available and may spread quickly, potentially reaching millions in a 
</p>
<p>fraction of a second and remaining in cyberspace for a lifetime. Violence, abuse and 
</p>
<p>exploitation can easily take place in spaces that are not under adult supervision, and parents 
</p>
<p>and caregivers may struggle to keep up with technological developments to monitor 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s online activity, especially in countries where digital literacy is low.  
</p>
<p>56. Today&#8217;s children tend to shift easily between &#8220;real&#8221; and &#8220;virtual&#8221; worlds and regard 
</p>
<p>the online/offline distinction as increasingly less relevant. ICTs are contributing to the 
</p>
<p>breakdown of traditional boundaries of privacy, creating situations in which children 
</p>
<p>engage in &#8220;chats&#8221; in apparently private settings while in fact potentially exposing 
</p>
<p>themselves to a wide and unknown audience. Sharing personal information, and not 
</p>
<p>recognizing online dangers or warning signals, may lead to multiple risks for children.  
</p>
<p>57. The more children engage in online activities, the more they enhance their digital 
</p>
<p>literacy, gain skills and resilience, and become self-confident and curious. Yet the more 
</p>
<p>skills they possess, the more online opportunities they explore which puts them at greater 
</p>
<p>danger of being confronted with associated risks. Gaining online skills and resilience can, 
</p>
<p>however, also reduce the harm that children experience, and help them to cope better with 
</p>
<p>potential online threats.  
</p>
<p>58. Most children do not report being bothered or upset going online, and most risks are 
</p>
<p>encountered by a minority of children. However, when harm arises, the impact on the child 
</p>
<p>can be devastating, leading to depression and generating fear, eating and sleeping disorders, 
</p>
<p>aggression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and a sense of shame and guilt. That is exacerbated 
</p>
<p>when multiple forms of abuse and exploitation take place simultaneously or are committed 
</p>
<p>against the same victim over time. </p>


<p>59. For example, ICTs have facilitated the production, distribution and possession of 
</p>
<p>child abuse images and materials. Between 1997 and 2006, the number of such images on 
</p>
<p>the Internet increased by 1,500 per cent.15 The children depicted are increasingly young: 
</p>
<p>more than 80 per cent are 10 or under, and even toddlers are targeted.16
 
</p>
<p>60. Online risks encountered by children may take place in many contexts and be 
</p>
<p>expressed in different ways, including violent content, harmful material, child abuse 
</p>
<p>images, online grooming, cyberbullying, self-exposure, obsessive online behaviour or 
</p>
<p>excessive use of the Internet. 
</p>
<p>61. However similar to any other form of violence, online abuse is not inevitable. It can 
</p>
<p>be prevented and addressed effectively. As children often stress, technology is not bad, it 
</p>
<p>depends on the use one makes of it.  
</p>
<p>62. Online safety and a sense of online responsibility are becoming increasingly 
</p>
<p>important for young people. As those participating in the thematic report stressed, &#8220;We are 
</p>
<p>a click away from producing positive situations and avoiding bad ones &#8230; The way in 
</p>
<p>which we connect using technologies is a personal choice, and we undertake to do this 
</p>
<p>without causing harm to others&#8221;.17  
</p>
<p><b> B. Factors associated with online violence against children  
</b></p>
<p>63. Understanding the way children embrace ICTs is key to the development of 
</p>
<p>strategies to maximize opportunities and minimize risks of violence against children. A 
</p>
<p>number of important studies show that factors such as age, gender, education, geography, 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic background and vulnerability influence the way children engage with ICTs, 
</p>
<p>benefit from their potential and are more easily exposed to potential risks. 
</p>
<p><b>  Age and gender 
</b></p>
<p>64. Age has a significant influence on how children operate online. Children are 
</p>
<p>beginning to interact with ICTs and use the Internet at an increasingly young age. The 
</p>
<p>relative simplicity of mobile devices, such as touchscreen tablets and smartphones, is 
</p>
<p>making digital entertainment and Internet content available and easily used by children, 
</p>
<p>including in their very early years. At the same time, younger children may be particularly 
</p>
<p>vulnerable as they lack appropriate technical expertise or ability to identify risks. 
</p>
<p>65. According to the EU Kids Online initiative,18 in Europe there has been a substantial 
</p>
<p>increase in Internet use by children under the age of 9. Video-sharing sites are one of the 
</p>
<p>first sites they visit and are popular, as are playing games, searching for information, doing 
</p>
<p>homework and socializing with friends.  
</p>
<p>66. Younger children are particularly concerned about risks related to the online content 
</p>
<p>they may encounter. As they get older, they become more concerned by contact and 
</p>
<p>conduct risks linked to the use of social networking sites.19 Adolescents may face unusually

<p>high risks of exposure to harmful material and cyberbullying.20 A considerable proportion 
</p>
<p>of the victims of online sexual abuse are children under the age of 12. 
</p>
<p>67. Gender differences also influence how children use ICTs and perceive and respond 
</p>
<p>to online risks. In Europe, boys appear more bothered by online violence than girls, while 
</p>
<p>girls are more concerned with contact-related risks.21 Teenage girls are slightly more likely 
</p>
<p>to receive nasty or hurtful messages online than teenage boys. 
</p>
<p>68. There are also indications that boys enjoy more and better quality access to the 
</p>
<p>Internet than girls.22 That pattern is likely to exist in other regions, especially in contexts 
</p>
<p>where girls may experience discrimination in society. At the same time, ICTs may also 
</p>
<p>provide important tools for those girls to obtain information, participate in social and 
</p>
<p>cultural life, and overcome isolation in their communities.23 
</p>
<p><b>  Vulnerability 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Internet has the potential to compound and magnify existing vulnerabilities of 
</p>
<p>children at risk, and to add to the challenges they face in the offline world. For 
</p>
<p>marginalized children, including those experiencing social exclusion, those out of school, 
</p>
<p>with disabilities, belonging to minorities or affected by migration, who may have no access 
</p>
<p>to the Internet at home or in school, who may lack guidance and advice from caregivers and 
</p>
<p>who explore the cyberspace on their own, the opportunity to become an empowered digital 
</p>
<p>citizen is seriously limited. Those children will be less likely to enjoy the benefits offered 
</p>
<p>by the online environment or to receive information regarding online safety than their 
</p>
<p>peers, and more likely to face bullying, harassment or exploitation online.  
</p>
<p>70. Social isolation affects the nature of a child&#8217;s online behaviour and the amount of 
</p>
<p>their online activity, as well as their propensity to seek help when problems arise.24 The 
</p>
<p>likelihood of reporting concerns to the authorities is lower when young people lack 
</p>
<p>confidence in the police, or where police officers are perceived to lack the knowledge and 
</p>
<p>skills necessary to act in a child-sensitive manner and to effectively address crimes 
</p>
<p>associated with new technologies. 
</p>
<p>71. Yet ICTs and the Internet have enormous potential to overcome many of the 
</p>
<p>challenges vulnerable children face in the offline world, especially through social networks 
</p>
<p>which offer valuable means to reduce the social isolation and discrimination they may 
</p>
<p>encounter.  
</p>
<p><b>  Geographical considerations 
</b></p>
<p>72. While the Internet helps to overcome spatial barriers, geography influences the 
</p>
<p>experience of children online. The number of Internet users globally has reached 3 billion, 
</p>
<p>but 90 per cent of the 4 billion people not yet using the Internet live in the developing 
</p>
<p>world. As a result of that digital divide, the opportunity for children to become empowered 
</p>
<p>digital citizens is conditioned by their place of residence, and higher prices for Internet 
</p>
<p>access in less developed areas only exacerbate the divide.

<p>73. Widespread poverty and weak State structures compromise children&#8217;s social and 
</p>
<p>legal protection and enhance the vulnerability of potential victims. In poorer countries, 
</p>
<p>children who have access to the Internet without adult guidance and supervision, for 
</p>
<p>instance in cybercafes, may be particularly vulnerable to online solicitation and their 
</p>
<p>economic situation may pressure them into accepting risky propositions. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>parental knowledge and awareness of the online risks children face may be lacking, limiting 
</p>
<p>further the support and protection those children receive. The generational divide has 
</p>
<p>become increasingly apparent in poorer urban areas and rural neighbourhoods, in low- and 
</p>
<p>middle-income countries. 
</p>
<p>74. Geographic and socioeconomic considerations also determine the availability of 
</p>
<p>technology, which in turn has an impact on children&#8217;s online experience and vulnerability. 
</p>
<p>75. In industrialized countries and advanced East Asian economies, much of children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Internet access is from home.25 Increasingly, children access the Internet from their own 
</p>
<p>rooms or from mobile devices, which further limits parental supervision and guidance. 
</p>
<p>76. In developing countries, children and young people are more likely to access the 
</p>
<p>Internet at school, on mobile phones or from Internet cafes. Where such cafes are 
</p>
<p>unregulated or inadequately supervised, there is a greater risk that children will encounter 
</p>
<p>inappropriate online material or fall victim to offline solicitation or abuse by customers, 
</p>
<p>staff or owners. In a survey conducted by Plan International in Brazil, children indicated 
</p>
<p>that risks in badly managed &#8220;lan houses&#8221; (Internet cafes) include drug dealing and contact 
</p>
<p>with unknown adults.26  
</p>
<p>77. Risks tend to increase with the growing availability of sophisticated mobile phones 
</p>
<p>with Internet connectivity, which enable online activities to be conducted on smartphones 
</p>
<p>rather than via computers in fixed locations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Towards a safe, inclusive and empowering digital agenda for children 
</b></p>
<p>78. The challenge of creating a safe, inclusive and empowering online environment for 
</p>
<p>children lies in responses that strike the appropriate balance between ensuring that children 
</p>
<p>benefit from the potential offered by ICTs, and securing their rights, including the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom from violence. It is crucial to ensure an optimal balance between children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>curiosity, creativity, sense of innovation and freedom to learn, and their effective protection 
</p>
<p>from harm. It is essential to enhance children&#8217;s confidence, resilience and empowerment to 
</p>
<p>cope with potential risks. International human rights standards provide a sound framework 
</p>
<p>to guide effective action in that field. 
</p>
<p><b>  </b>Children&#8217;s rights online<b> 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocols thereto, 
</p>
<p>notably the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
</p>
<p>pornography, provide important guidance for the realization of children&#8217;s rights online.  
</p>
<p>80. Offline and online, States are required to ensure that all measures, including 
</p>
<p>legislative, policy and educational initiatives, are guided by the best interests of the child; 
</p>
<p>respect and support children&#8217;s growing autonomy and agency; protect children from 
</p>
<p>violence and safeguard them from the risk of discrimination, including when associated 
</p>
<p>with a gender, social and economic digital divide. Those principles lay the foundation for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 25 &#8220;Releasing children&#8217;s potential and minimizing risks&#8221;, p. 41. 
</p>
<p> 26 Ibid., p. 41. </p>


<p>children&#8217;s online empowerment; promote children&#8217;s learning and freedom of expression; 
</p>
<p>support them in accessing, receiving and imparting information; and secure their protection 
</p>
<p>from harmful materials and information, from unlawful interference with their privacy or 
</p>
<p>correspondence, and from situations in which their image, honour and reputation may be at 
</p>
<p>risk. 
</p>
<p>81. Framed by those standards, children can capitalize on the potential offered by ICTs 
</p>
<p>to access information on the promotion and protection of their rights, and seek support and 
</p>
<p>redress when exposed to violence, abuse and exploitation. For many children, quality 
</p>
<p>access to the Internet is perceived as a fundamental human right. 
</p>
<p>82. The past years have been marked by the adoption of international standards to 
</p>
<p>combat cybercrime, including the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
</p>
<p>Organized Crime and the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, as well as to 
</p>
<p>protect children from online abuse. The Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of 
</p>
<p>Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse addresses risks associated with 
</p>
<p>technological developments, and is the first such instrument to identify as an offence the 
</p>
<p>solicitation of children for sexual purposes through ICTs, often known as &#8220;grooming&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b>  </b>A multifaceted agenda is needed to unleash children&#8217;s potential and minimize online 
</p>
<p><b>risks 
</b></p>
<p>83. Children&#8217;s online empowerment and protection calls for concerted prevention 
</p>
<p>efforts, effective detection, reporting and prosecution of offences, and assistance to victims, 
</p>
<p>including their recovery and reintegration. National authorities, families, schools, academia, 
</p>
<p>civil society and the corporate sector are key actors in that process, and children&#8217;s active 
</p>
<p>contribution to their own protection needs to be placed at the heart of those endeavours. 
</p>
<p>84. To consolidate progress in that fast-changing area, it is crucial to pursue a 
</p>
<p>multifaceted, safe, inclusive and empowering digital agenda that capitalizes on the 
</p>
<p>opportunities offered by ICTs, is effective in detecting and addressing online abuse, and, 
</p>
<p>most importantly, that releases children&#8217;s potential and enhances their skills to explore the 
</p>
<p>online world with confidence and in safety.  
</p>
<p>85. The digital agenda should include the following key dimensions. 
</p>
<p><i>  Empowering children 
</i></p>
<p>86. The Internet has opened up a digital divide among children, both between those who 
</p>
<p>have ready and easy access to the Internet at home, school and elsewhere, and those who do 
</p>
<p>not, and between those who are confident and proficient users and those who are not.  
</p>
<p>87. Children and young people want to be able to navigate the online world in safety 
</p>
<p>and, as they often stress, they call for solutions that to go beyond simply avoiding online 
</p>
<p>threats. That is reflected in many initiatives, including a manifesto developed by teenagers 
</p>
<p>from Latin America, along with a regional online awareness-raising campaign to promote 
</p>
<p>safer Internet use.27  
</p>
<p>88. It is critical to raise children&#8217;s awareness of online risks and provide guidance on 
</p>
<p>ways of addressing them when they occur. However, children need, and want, to develop 
</p>
<p>their capacities as digital citizens and to learn solid values and life skills, including a strong 
</p>
<p>sense of responsibility, respect and concern for others. Rather than curtailing children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 27 See http://rednatic.org/project/manifiesto-de-jovenes-latinoamericanos-por-un-uso-seguro-y-
</p>
<p>responsable-de-las-tic/. </p>


<p>natural curiosity and sense of innovation, initiatives should tap into their resourcefulness 
</p>
<p>and enhance their resilience.  
</p>
<p>89. Guided by children&#8217;s evolving capacities, it is equally important to support a 
</p>
<p>positive, caring, digitally-informed and protective family environment, with access to 
</p>
<p>relevant child-friendly information and services, including on how to report online abuse.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Strategies to enhance children&#8217;s resilience online include:28 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Open communication with children, both at home and at 
</p>
<p>school, about issues concerning the online environment; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Opportunities for children to learn how to use online coping 
</p>
<p>strategies, such as deleting messages, blocking contacts and 
</p>
<p>reporting providers of inappropriate content, from an early 
</p>
<p>age; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Appropriate support for children to tackle their 
</p>
<p>psychological problems and build self-confidence, 
</p>
<p>especially for vulnerable children; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Parental Internet access and use, which both cultivates the 
</p>
<p>confidence of parents and caregivers and enhances their 
</p>
<p>ability to provide guidance to children;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Positive attitudes about online safety and proactive coping 
</p>
<p>strategies among peer groups; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Support for children&#8217;s Internet use and safety by schools 
</p>
<p>and teachers, both technical support and assistance in 
</p>
<p>developing problem-solving strategies; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Action by parents to address online risk, including 
</p>
<p>monitoring and mediation, rather than simply restricting 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s Internet use. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>  Supporting parents and caregivers 
</i></p>
<p>90. Technological advances have been so rapid that parents and caregivers often 
</p>
<p>struggle to keep up with developments, and to detect and respond to online risks.  
</p>
<p>91. Informed and engaged parents and caregivers who support and advise children on 
</p>
<p>their access to the Internet and their use of ICTs create opportunities for a safer online 
</p>
<p>experience. Taking time to surf cyberspace together, to guide and reassure their children, 
</p>
<p>and to provide age-appropriate rules about online conduct, are crucial dimensions of that 
</p>
<p>process.  
</p>
<p>92. Parents&#8217; and caregivers&#8217; own digital literacy is a key factor. They need support and 
</p>
<p>advice to reduce their anxiety and to gain an understanding of the online world and of how 
</p>
<p>children operate in that environment, the risks they might encounter, the harm that can 
</p>
<p>potentially ensue and, crucially, the most effective ways to cope and develop their 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s resilience.

<p> 28 Sonia Livingstone, Leslie Haddon, Anke G&#246;rzig and Kjartan &#211;lafsson, <i>Risks and safety on the 
</i></p>
<p><i>internet: The perspective of European children</i> (London, LSE: EU Kids Online, 2010). </p>


<p>93. The Guidelines for Parents, Guardians and Educators on Child Online Protection, 
</p>
<p>prepared by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU),29 offer useful guidance on 
</p>
<p>ways to ensure the safety and security of computers in the home and to establish rules on 
</p>
<p>ICT use through discussions with children. The guidelines recommend, for example, never 
</p>
<p>disclosing private information or arranging to meet someone children may have 
</p>
<p>encountered online, and highlighting the risks of posting photographs on the Internet. 
</p>
<p>Information is also included on filtering, blocking and monitoring programmes to help to 
</p>
<p>prevent access to information that is harmful to children. 
</p>
<p> Capitalizing on schools&#8217; potential </p>
<p>94. Schools have unique potential to promote non-violent behaviour and to support 
</p>
<p>changes in attitudes that condone violence. Through quality education, children can gain 
</p>
<p>the skills and abilities to surf cyberspace with confidence, avoid and address risks, and 
</p>
<p>become well-informed and responsible digital citizens. Digital literacy skills enhance 
</p>
<p>creativity, self-expression, interpersonal relations and the sense of empowerment to prevent 
</p>
<p>and address incidents of online violence. 
</p>
<p>95. Accessing ICTs and promoting digital literacy in schools can also leverage efforts 
</p>
<p>aimed at children&#8217;s social inclusion and narrow the digital divide affecting the most 
</p>
<p>vulnerable children, those who are otherwise less likely to enjoy the benefits of new 
</p>
<p>technologies or access information promoting safe Internet use. 
</p>
<p>96. Especially in remote areas, schools can also become a bridge between a child&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>home and community, an environment where students, parents and other community 
</p>
<p>members meet to gain digital literacy and confidence, and to benefit from ICT-based 
</p>
<p>training on life skills, social and economic empowerment and entrepreneurship. 
</p>
<p>97. That process is, however, largely dependent on the extent to which teachers 
</p>
<p>themselves understand the online environment and have the necessary skills and training to 
</p>
<p>advise, guide, empower and support children and young people, to identify early signals of 
</p>
<p>abuse, and to report and follow up on such cases in an ethical and child-sensitive manner. 
</p>
<p>That is an area in which more investment is needed. 
</p>
<p><i>  Joining efforts with civil society 
</i></p>
<p>98. Through information, capacity-building and research initiatives, operating helplines 
</p>
<p>and providing support to child victims, and through support to policy and legislative 
</p>
<p>reforms, civil society partners play a decisive role in national and international efforts that 
</p>
<p>seek to build a safe online environment for children. 
</p>
<p>99. In many countries, cooperation with civil society organizations has been critical to 
</p>
<p>widen online literacy and safety among children and their families, and to promote 
</p>
<p>responses to harm. It has also helped to capture children&#8217;s experiences, fears, expectations 
</p>
<p>and online behaviour through surveys conducted with young people. Those efforts have in 
</p>
<p>turn informed important advocacy and action by children themselves. 
</p>
<p>100. Civil society organizations have an extraordinary networking capacity and can 
</p>
<p>become strategic partners in initiatives led by governments and other stakeholders, at 
</p>
<p>national and international levels. Their expertise, programmes, data and advocacy materials 
</p>
<p>should be made more widely known in order to support others and benefit the maximum 
</p>
<p>number of children.

<p><i>  Consolidating partnerships with the corporate sector 
</i></p>
<p>101. The corporate sector can actively contribute to preventing violence, minimizing risks 
</p>
<p>and securing children&#8217;s online protection. That is particularly important given that their 
</p>
<p>services or products can be used to expose children to online abuse, including violent 
</p>
<p>content, grooming and sexual abuse, cyberbullying and sexting.  
</p>
<p>102. Internet service providers (ISPs), social media companies and manufacturers and 
</p>
<p>distributors of ICTs can all play a crucial role in safeguarding children&#8217;s online safety and 
</p>
<p>ending impunity. As an important content provider, the corporate sector also has a 
</p>
<p>responsibility to provide good quality and age-appropriate online content for children. 
</p>
<p>103. A number of recent international developments highlight the significance of the 
</p>
<p>corporate sector in that area. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has adopted 
</p>
<p>valuable general comments on the topic, explicitly recognizing the importance of 
</p>
<p>cooperation with the mass media and the ICT industry to devise, promote and enforce 
</p>
<p>global standards for child caregiving and protection;30 and stressing States parties&#8217; 
</p>
<p>obligations regarding the impact of the business sector on children&#8217;s rights, and companies&#8217; 
</p>
<p>liability when criminal acts of violence against children are committed though the 
</p>
<p>Internet.31 
</p>
<p>104. At the regional level, the Council of Europe Convention on Protection of Children 
</p>
<p>against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse encourages the participation of the private 
</p>
<p>sector in the development and implementation of States&#8217; policies to prevent online abuse, 
</p>
<p>and foresees corporate liability measures for offences established under the Convention. 
</p>
<p>105. The Children&#8217;s Rights and Business Principles, jointly developed by UNICEF, the 
</p>
<p>UN Global Compact and Save the Children, is the first comprehensive set of principles to 
</p>
<p>guide companies&#8217; actions in the workplace, the marketplace and the community to respect 
</p>
<p>and support children&#8217;s rights.32 The ITU Guidelines for Industry on Child Online 
</p>
<p>Protection, developed with UNICEF, identify ways for industry to integrate child rights into 
</p>
<p>policy and management; processes for handling child sexual abuse material, establishing 
</p>
<p>safe and age-appropriate online environments; and ways of promoting the positive use of 
</p>
<p>ICTs and online safety education for children, parents and teachers.33 
</p>
<p>106. Strategic platforms such as the Global Child Forum periodically gather leading 
</p>
<p>corporations to promote children&#8217;s rights and enhance online safety for children. The 
</p>
<p>potential of the corporate sector to contribute to child protection is equally illustrated by the 
</p>
<p>establishment in 2008 of the Mobile Alliance against Child Sexual Abuse Content, which 
</p>
<p>works to prevent the use of the mobile environment to consume or profit from child sexual 
</p>
<p>abuse content.34 
</p>
<p>107. Those are promising developments, but in such a fast-changing universe, it remains 
</p>
<p>essential to pursue the effective implementation, periodic evaluation and further 
</p>
<p>improvement of the frameworks already developed to prevent risks and enable children to 
</p>
<p>enjoy the full potential of ICTs with confidence and safety. In addition, more consistent 
</p>
<p>protection tools are needed to address child sexual abuse material and content that is 
</p>
<p>harmful to children, to provide guidance on child safety addressed to children and parents, 
</p>
<p>and to promote means to report abuse.

<p><i>  Capitalizing on St</i>ates&#8217; accountability to secure children&#8217;s online protection </p>
<p>108. Governments have a leading responsibility in the realization of children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>That includes violence prevention and children&#8217;s online protection through measures such 
</p>
<p>as those addressed in previous sections.  
</p>
<p>109. Capitalizing on implementation of the recommendations of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Study on Violence Against Children, the children&#8217;s digital agenda should be integrated as a 
</p>
<p>core component of any national comprehensive policy framework to prevent and address all 
</p>
<p>forms of violence against children. The agenda needs to be well-coordinated, adequately 
</p>
<p>funded and include clear time-bound goals and a transparent process to monitor and 
</p>
<p>evaluate progress. The agenda should be promoted with the involvement of all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, and informed by the views and experiences of children and young people 
</p>
<p>online, including those exposed to abuse. In a number of countries, such as Costa Rica (see 
</p>
<p>box below), child safety online has become a priority in the policy agenda. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In Costa Rica, where as many as 52 per cent of children and young 
</p>
<p>people under 18 were found to own a computer in 2011, decisive measures 
</p>
<p>have been taken to enhance children&#8217;s online protection. Costa Rican 
</p>
<p>legislation criminalizes the production, possession, and distribution of child 
</p>
<p>pornography, whether or not a computer is involved. 
</p>
<p>In December 2010, a National Commission on Online Safety was 
</p>
<p>established with a multidisciplinary, intersectoral structure and including 
</p>
<p>representatives of both public and private institutions. Its role is to devise 
</p>
<p>policies on the safe use of the Internet and ICTs and to develop the National 
</p>
<p>Plan of Online Safety. Specifically, the Commission: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Raises awareness amongst children, teenagers and their 
</p>
<p>families about the appropriate use of the Internet and digital 
</p>
<p>technologies; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Proposes measures to prevent access to inappropriate 
</p>
<p>content by children; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Promotes safe access to the Internet and digital 
</p>
<p>technologies; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Develops strategies to avoid inappropriate use of the 
</p>
<p>Internet or digital technologies in public and private 
</p>
<p>institutions; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Proposes legislation to strengthen the rights of individuals, 
</p>
<p>communities and institutions regarding access to the 
</p>
<p>Internet. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> <i>(i) National legislation 
</i></p>
<p>110. National legislation is a core component of the process. Legislation is indispensable 
</p>
<p>to enable children&#8217;s access to the Internet and ICTs and the enjoyment of digital literacy 
</p>
<p>without discrimination. It needs to include an explicit prohibition of all manifestations of 
</p>
<p>violence associated with the use of ICTs, secure children&#8217;s online protection and provide 
</p>
<p>for effective remedies, recovery and reintegration to address online harm, abuse or 
</p>
<p>exploitation. Moreover, it needs to establish child-sensitive counselling, reporting and 
</p>
<p>complaint mechanisms and procedures to address incidents of online abuse, and to fight 
</p>
<p>impunity. </p>


<p>111. Whenever possible, legislation should be &#8220;technology neutral&#8221;, so that its 
</p>
<p>applicability is not eroded by future technological developments. At the same time, it is 
</p>
<p>crucial that legislation address loopholes associated with emerging concerns, including new 
</p>
<p>forms of online abuse such as grooming, and develop criminal proceedings to facilitate 
</p>
<p>their investigation and prosecution.  
</p>
<p>112. The accountability of States is equally important to set a clear regulatory framework 
</p>
<p>for the activities of corporations and to support businesses to meet their responsibilities in 
</p>
<p>safeguarding children&#8217;s rights throughout their operations, both at home and abroad. The 
</p>
<p>many opportunities offered by regulation, self-regulation, incentives and public-private 
</p>
<p>partnerships should be further explored, including with a view to attracting new sectors of 
</p>
<p>activity, as well as small and medium-size companies. One example of such a regulatory 
</p>
<p>framework is the Philippines Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009 (see box below). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The Philippines Anti-Child Pornography Act lists prohibited and 
</p>
<p>unlawful acts, which include hiring, inducing, persuading or coercing a child 
</p>
<p>to perform in the creation or production of child pornography; producing, 
</p>
<p>manufacturing or directing child pornography; offering, publishing, selling, 
</p>
<p>distributing, broadcasting, promoting, importing or exporting child 
</p>
<p>pornography; and possessing child pornography with the intention to sell, 
</p>
<p>distribute or publish. 
</p>
<p>The law prohibits grooming of children for sexual purposes and 
</p>
<p>requires private sector actors, such as ISPs, private business establishments 
</p>
<p>and Internet content hosts, to assist in the fight against child pornography. 
</p>
<p>ISPs have the obligation to notify the Philippine National Police or the 
</p>
<p>National Bureau of Investigation within seven days upon discovery that their 
</p>
<p>servers or facilities are being used to commit child pornography offences. 
</p>
<p>They are obliged to preserve evidence for use in criminal proceedings. Upon 
</p>
<p>request by law enforcement authorities, they must give details of users who 
</p>
<p>access websites containing child pornography. ISPs must install programmes 
</p>
<p>or software designed to filter and block child pornography. Additionally, 
</p>
<p>owners and operators and owners or lessors of other business establishments 
</p>
<p>have the responsibility to report child pornography offences within seven 
</p>
<p>days of discovering that their premises are being used to commit such 
</p>
<p>offences. 
</p>
<p>Importantly, the Act requires appropriate protections for child victims 
</p>
<p>of pornography offences, which includes strict confidentiality in handling 
</p>
<p>evidence, protecting witnesses and assisting in recovery and reintegration. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>113. Law enforcement is essential both to prevent online violence and abuse and to 
</p>
<p>respond to it. However, that is a particularly challenging area, given that physical contact 
</p>
<p>need not occur in order for a crime to be committed. Moreover, much of the evidence 
</p>
<p>involved in those cases is in an ephemeral electronic format that may elude traditional 
</p>
<p>policing methods.  
</p>
<p>114. Police investigations in many countries are hampered by a lack of capacity to 
</p>
<p>conduct undercover operations, which are vital in investigating crimes such as grooming 
</p>
<p>and the production and distribution of child sexual abuse materials. 
</p>
<p>115. Those factors also present challenges to judges and prosecutors, who require 
</p>
<p>specialized training to handle digital evidence and assess its weight and value, as well as to 
</p>
<p>understand child abuse and exploitation cases associated with the use of new technologies. </p>


<p>Investigations are further complicated by the international dimension of much cybercrime, 
</p>
<p>which calls for cooperation among national law enforcement authorities.  
</p>
<p>116. Child victims are particularly vulnerable and require appropriate support to avoid the 
</p>
<p>risk of re-victimization and to benefit from effective rehabilitation. That calls for 
</p>
<p>coordination among different sectors, including police, justice, child welfare services, 
</p>
<p>education and other relevant authorities. In order to improve implementation of the law, 
</p>
<p>professionals working with and for children, including teachers and law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officials, should benefit from capacity-building initiatives to gain skills and expertise to 
</p>
<p>promote children&#8217;s digital literacy, alert children to online risks they may face, and identify 
</p>
<p>early signals of abuse and required steps to address them in an ethical and child-sensitive 
</p>
<p>manner. 
</p>
<p> <i>(ii) Data and research 
</i></p>
<p>117. In such a fast-changing area, data and research are crucially needed to inform law, 
</p>
<p>policy and action and to provide deeper understanding of children&#8217;s evolving skills, 
</p>
<p>practices and concerns. That includes involving children in the assessment of the relevance 
</p>
<p>of existing measures and awareness-raising materials.  
</p>
<p>118. Knowledge gaps also need to be addressed. So far, studies have focused more on 
</p>
<p>problems and concerns, and less on online opportunities and the long-term consequences of 
</p>
<p>risks. Few studies have been conducted in countries in middle- and low-income countries 
</p>
<p>and less is known about how very young children engage with ICTs. Given that it is in 
</p>
<p>those areas that change has been fastest and the need to minimize risks is particularly felt, it 
</p>
<p>is there that research should be promoted further. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Consolidating knowledge on emerging concerns: preventing 
violence and deprivation of liberty of girls involved with the 
criminal justice system 
</b></p>
<p>119. Over the past years, the boundaries between criminal and intimate violence have 
</p>
<p>become increasingly blurred, provoking fear, insecurity and harm in families and in society 
</p>
<p>at large.  
</p>
<p>120. Children are particularly vulnerable to those intertwined forms of violence, both as 
</p>
<p>victims and witnesses. While adolescent boys may be at risk of physical aggression and 
</p>
<p>homicide owing to their participation in street fighting, gang membership, possession of 
</p>
<p>arms and manipulation by organized crime networks, girls are more likely to endure 
</p>
<p>violence in the private sphere, in particular sexual violence, which is often associated with 
</p>
<p>shame, fear and distrust.35 
</p>
<p>121. According to UNICEF, one in three adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 worldwide have 
</p>
<p>been the victims of emotional, physical or sexual violence committed by their husbands or 
</p>
<p>partners at some point in their lives.36 Taking place behind closed doors, incidents of 
</p>
<p>violence are often associated with a culture of silence that inhibits girls from speaking out, 
</p>
<p>from seeking help, accessing justice and bringing perpetrators to justice. 
</p>
<p>122. As the international community reviews progress in the implementation over the 
</p>
<p>past twenty years of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, including the 
</p>
<p>protection of girls from discrimination and violence, it is crucial to prevent and address the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 35 See A/HRC/25/35, para. 17. 
</p>
<p> 36 UNICEF, &#8220;Hidden in Plain Sight&#8221;, p. 206. </p>


<p>challenges they face when involved with the criminal justice system, as victims and 
</p>
<p>witnesses of violence, and when deprived of their liberty. That is a concern the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative will continue to pursue. 
</p>
<p>123. In 1995, data from many countries showed that girls experienced discrimination 
</p>
<p>from the earliest stages of life, through their childhood and into adulthood.37 Owing to 
</p>
<p>violence, sexual abuse and exploitation, harmful attitudes and practices, such as female 
</p>
<p>genital mutilation, son preference and child marriage, many girls do not survive into 
</p>
<p>adulthood. They are neglected and their self-esteem undermined, with the risk of initiating a 
</p>
<p>lifelong downward spiral of deprivation and exclusion.38  
</p>
<p>124. The Beijing Declaration includes nine strategic objectives to promote the 
</p>
<p>elimination of all forms of discrimination, negative cultural attitudes and practices, and 
</p>
<p>violence against the girl child.39 Over the past two decades, significant progress has been 
</p>
<p>made to safeguard the rights of girls, including through strengthened legislation, policy and 
</p>
<p>national plans of actions. However, as noted in the Global Survey conducted by the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative&#8217;s office,40 and other important studies, violence against girls, and overall 
</p>
<p>against children and women, remains a global challenge. 
</p>
<p>125. Girls are often exposed to violence and discrimination owing to their gender, young 
</p>
<p>age and powerlessness. They endure the detrimental impact of physical, mental and sexual 
</p>
<p>violence in the home, at school, in the community, in institutional care and in justice 
</p>
<p>institutions. Child trafficking is a crime that is on the rise and the majority of victims are 
</p>
<p>girls.41 Despite the criminalization of female genital mutilation/cutting in many parts of the 
</p>
<p>world, every year 3 million girls are at risk of enduring that practice and around 14 million 
</p>
<p>girls are forcibly married, often with much older men, and exposed to high risks of sexual 
</p>
<p>abuse and other forms of violence.  
</p>
<p>126. In some communities, certain incidents of violence reflect harmful beliefs towards 
</p>
<p>particularly marginalized girls, including those with disabilities or albinism, who may be 
</p>
<p>accused of witchcraft. As a result, those girls endure stigmatization and are the victims of 
</p>
<p>serious acts of violence, neglect, abandonment, mutilation and murder.  
</p>
<p>127. Driven by fear and superstition, incidents of violence are seldom reported or 
</p>
<p>followed by investigation or prosecution. Girls may conceal them too, fearing further 
</p>
<p>harassment and reprisals. Overall there is a pervasive culture of impunity. 
</p>
<p>128. Girls may also be criminalized for status offences or on the grounds of &#8220;immoral 
</p>
<p>character&#8221; or &#8220;perverse conduct&#8221;. Those who are victims of trafficking may end up being 
</p>
<p>arrested and incarcerated as a result of their exploitation by prostitution rings. Girls may 
</p>
<p>also be forced by boyfriends and family members or manipulated by criminal groups to 
</p>
<p>commit offences, such as selling drugs.  
</p>
<p>129. In many parts of the world, there is a lack of alternative non-custodial measures and 
</p>
<p>community-based programmes tailored to girls&#8217; developmental needs. Restorative justice 
</p>
<p>approaches are rare and there is a lack of investment in programmes that promote girls&#8217; 
</p>
<p>health and education and long-lasting reintegration.  
</p>
<p>130. As a result, countless girls end up deprived of their liberty, far away from home and 
</p>
<p>family visits, and placed in units together with adult women. They may find themselves in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>harsh conditions, in overcrowded cells or in solitary confinement. They may be exposed to 
</p>
<p>sexual violence, harassment, invasive body searches and humiliating treatment by staff in 
</p>
<p>detention centres. In some countries, girls may face inhuman sentencing, including 
</p>
<p>flogging, stoning and capital punishment. 
</p>
<p>131. Either as victims, witnesses or alleged offenders, those girls are in desperate need of 
</p>
<p>care, treatment and protection, and gender-sensitive approaches to promote their social 
</p>
<p>reintegration. Sadly, many of them may be at risk of ill-treatment and re-victimization by 
</p>
<p>the justice system itself.  
</p>
<p>132. Those girls face overwhelming challenges at all stages, including significant barriers 
</p>
<p>to seeking justice. Many are unaware of their rights and even fewer have access to safe, 
</p>
<p>effective and child-sensitive counselling, reporting and complaints mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, perpetrators are often people they know and trust, or on whom they depend 
</p>
<p>for their survival and protection, raising additional challenges to reporting incidents and 
</p>
<p>preventing the risk of reprisals.  
</p>
<p>133. Seeking redress through the criminal justice system can also be very intimidating, as 
</p>
<p>girls fear that their credibility may be questioned, or that they may be blamed, rather than 
</p>
<p>protected as victims. In countries where discrimination and stigma against sexual violence 
</p>
<p>is high, it is particularly hard for girls to approach police stations or courts, for fear of 
</p>
<p>verbal intimidation and harassment, and of seeing their testimony dismissed.  
</p>
<p>134. In order to address those significant challenges, the international community has 
</p>
<p>developed international standards, including the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of 
</p>
<p>Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders (the Bangkok 
</p>
<p>Rules),42 the updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice,43 and the 
</p>
<p>recently adopted United Nations Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Violence against Children in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal 
</p>
<p>Justice.  
</p>
<p>135. It is crucial to narrow the gap between those standards and practice. In that process, 
</p>
<p>three dimensions have particular relevance.  
</p>
<p>136. Firstly, the enactment and enforcement of a sound legal framework to ban all forms 
</p>
<p>of violence against children, including when used as a form of discipline, control or 
</p>
<p>sentencing within the criminal justice system; to de-criminalize status offences, such as 
</p>
<p>running away from domestic violence and survival behaviours; and to remove any 
</p>
<p>justification that condones or allows violence, including on the grounds of culture, tradition, 
</p>
<p>honour or religion.  
</p>
<p>137. Secondly, the establishment of widely available and easily accessible, safe and 
</p>
<p>confidential mechanisms to support girls to overcome the fear of reporting cases of 
</p>
<p>violence. They need to be supported by child- and gender-sensitive standards to ensure the 
</p>
<p>effective participation of girls in relevant judicial and administrative proceedings, and to 
</p>
<p>safeguard their safety, privacy and dignity at all stages. 
</p>
<p>138. Thirdly, ending impunity and tolerance of violence against girls. That calls for 
</p>
<p>information and social mobilization initiatives to overcome social norms compromising 
</p>
<p>girls&#8217; protection from violence. It also requires strong accountability mechanisms in places 
</p>
<p>of detention and effective training of professionals in the formal and informal justice 
</p>
<p>system. Solid skills are indeed indispensable to address the complexities and sensitivities of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 42 See A/RES/65/229. 
</p>
<p> 43 See A/RES/65/228, annex. </p>


<p>violence against girls, to be effective in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of 
</p>
<p>cases, and to safeguard girls&#8217; safety and protection, including when girls are deprived of 
</p>
<p>their liberty. In that regard, it is important to promote special measures to protect girls&#8217; 
</p>
<p>dignity and physical integrity through the use of alternative screening methods to replace 
</p>
<p>strip and invasive body searches. 
</p>
<p>139. Recognizing the relevance of that area, the Special Representative welcomes the call 
</p>
<p>by the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly for a global study on children deprived 
</p>
<p>of their liberty, and remains fully committed to contributing to its development. The global 
</p>
<p>study will provide a strategic opportunity to prevent girls&#8217; deprivation of liberty, and 
</p>
<p>associated risks of stigmatization and violence; safeguard girls&#8217; rights as victims, witnesses 
</p>
<p>and alleged perpetrators; and promote their long-lasting recovery and reintegration. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Looking ahead 
</b></p>
<p>140. Over the past year, the Special Representative has pursued her global advocacy work 
</p>
<p>with strategic partners within and beyond the United Nations system, acting as a bridge-
</p>
<p>builder and a catalyst for action across regions, sectors and settings where violence against 
</p>
<p>children may occur, and promoting children&#8217;s protection from violence as a human rights 
</p>
<p>imperative. 
</p>
<p>141. The present report provides an overview of the strategic initiatives that the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative developed in order to make progress in the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations made in the United Nations Study on Violence Against Children. The 
</p>
<p>initiatives have contributed to further mainstream the elimination of violence against 
</p>
<p>children as a priority concern on the United Nations agenda, including in the shaping of the 
</p>
<p>post-2015 development agenda, and to promote standards to address violence against 
</p>
<p>children in the criminal justice system. Those efforts have also helped to consolidate cross-
</p>
<p>regional commitments to children&#8217;s protection from violence and further strengthen 
</p>
<p>advocacy, legal and policy action at the national level aimed at the prevention and 
</p>
<p>elimination of violence. 
</p>
<p>142. The Special Representative will continue to mobilize support to consolidate those 
</p>
<p>important efforts and in 2015, will place special emphasis on the following topics: ensuring 
</p>
<p>violence against children remains a distinct concern on the global development agenda; 
</p>
<p>reinforcing the protection of children from online sexual abuse; strengthening action for the 
</p>
<p>prevention of violence in early childhood; and promoting the protection of children and 
</p>
<p>adolescents affected by community and armed violence and organized crime. 
</p>
<p>143. Capitalizing on progress made so far, 2015 offers a strategic opportunity for the 
</p>
<p>international community to make a quantum leap in children&#8217;s protection from violence. 
</p>
<p>Children want to help build a world as big as their dreams. The Special Representative will 
</p>
<p>continue to promote collaboration with Member States and all other stakeholders to pursue 
</p>
<p>that goal.
