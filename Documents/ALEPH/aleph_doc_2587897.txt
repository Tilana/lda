commercially reasonable efforts to enable the other Party to review and comment on all
such press releases, presentations, public statements and filings prior to the release or
filing, respectively, thereof, and neither Denison nor Fission shall release, make or file any

Person  on  their  behalf  may  be  required  or  permitted  to  deduct  and  withhold  therefrom
under  any  provision  of  applicable  Laws  in  respect  of  Taxes.  To  the  extent  that  such
amounts  are  so  deducted,  withheld  and  remitted,  such  amounts  shall  be  treated  for  all
purposes  under  this  Agreement  as  having  been  paid  to  the  Person  to  whom  such
amounts would otherwise have been paid. The Parties and the Depositary shall also have
the right to withhold and sell, on their own account or through a broker, and on behalf of
any  aforementioned  Person  to  whom  a  withholding  obligation  applies,  or  require  such
Person to irrevocably direct the sale through a broker and irrevocably direct the broker to
pay  the  proceeds  of  such  sale  to  the  Parties  or  the  Depositary,  as  appropriate,  such
number of Consideration Shares issued to such Person pursuant to the Arrangement as
is  necessary  to  produce  sale  proceeds  (after  deducting  commissions  payable  to  the
broker and other costs and expenses) sufficient to fund any withholding obligations. None
of the Parties or the Depositary will be liable for any loss arising out of any sale.

(c) based  on  the  Parties’  understanding  of  the  Law,  before  approving  the  Arrangement,  the
Court  will  be  required  to  satisfy  itself  as  to  the  fairness  and  reasonableness  of  the
Arrangement to the Fission Shareholders and the holders of the Fission Options, subject to
the Arrangement;
Fission  will  ensure  that  each  Person  entitled  to  receive  Consideration  Shares  and  other

and each holder of the Fission Options will have the right to appear before the Court at the
hearing  of  the  Court  to  give  approval  of  the  Arrangement  so  long  as  they  enter  an
appearance within a reasonable time; and
(h)
the Final Order shall include a statement to substantially the following effect:
“This Order will serve as a basis of a claim to an exemption, pursuant to section 3(a)(10) of
the U.S. Securities Act, from the registration requirements otherwise imposed by that act,
regarding the distribution of securities of Denison pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement.”
2.16 United States Tax Matters
- 20 -
The Arrangement is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Sections
368(a)(1)(A)  and  368(a)(2)(D)  of  the  U.S.  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986  (the  “U.S.  Tax
Code”) and this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement are intended to be a “plan of
reorganization”  within  the  meaning  of  the  Treasury  Regulations  promulgated  under
Section 368 of the U.S. Tax Code for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the U.S. Tax
Code. Without limitation of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that the acquisition of
Fission Shares by Denison pursuant to the Arrangement, followed by the amalgamation of
Fission with Subco, having Subco designated as the surviving party of the amalgamation,
is  intended  to  constitute  a  single  integrated  transaction  resulting  in  a  reorganization
described  in  Sections  368(1)(A)  and  368(a)(2)(D)  of  the  U.S.  Tax  Code  and  any
corresponding  provision  of  applicable  state  law  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax  purposes.
Each  of  the  parties  hereto  shall  treat  the  Arrangement  as  a  reorganization  within  the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the U.S. Tax Code for all U.S. federal and applicable state
income tax purposes, and shall treat this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement as a
“plan  of  reorganization”  within  the  meaning  of  the  Treasury  Regulations  promulgated
under Section 368 of the U.S. Tax Code, and shall not take any position on any Tax Return
or  otherwise  take  any  Tax  reporting  position  inconsistent  with  such  treatment,  unless
otherwise required by a “determination” within the meaning of Section 1313 of the U.S.
Tax Code that such treatment is not correct. Each party hereto shall act in a manner that is
consistent with the parties’ intention that the Arrangement be treated as a reorganization
within  the  meaning  of  Section  368(a)  of  the  U.S.  Tax  Code  for  all  U.S.  federal  and
applicable state income tax purposes, and shall not take any action, or knowingly fail to
take any action, if such action or failure to act would reasonably be expected to prevent
the Arrangement from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of  the  U.S.  Tax  Code.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  neither  party  hereto  makes  any
representation,  warranty  or  covenant  to  any  other  party  or  to  any  Fission  Shareholder,
holder  of  Denison  Shares  or  other  holder  of  Fission  securities  or  Denison  securities
(including,  without  limitation,  stock  options,  warrants,  debt  instruments  or  other  similar
rights or instruments) regarding the U.S. tax treatment of the Arrangement, including, but
not limited to, whether the Arrangement will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the U.S. Tax Code or as a tax-deferred reorganization for purposes of
any United States state or local income tax law.
2.17 Canadian Income Tax Election
An  Eligible  Shareholder  whose  Fission  Shares  are  exchanged  for  Denison  Shares  and
cash  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  shall  be  entitled  to  make  an  income  tax  election
pursuant to Section 85 of the Tax Act (and any analogous provision of provincial income
tax law) (a “Section 85 Election”) with respect to the exchange by providing the necessary
information  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  set  out  in  a  tax  instruction  letter  on  or
before the date that is ninety (90) days after the Effective Date. Neither Fission, Denison
nor  any  successor  corporation  shall  be  responsible  for  the  proper  completion  of  any
election  form  nor,  except  for  the  obligation  to  sign  and  return  duly  completed  election
forms  which  are  received  within  ninety  (90)  days  of  the  Effective  Date,  for  any  taxes,
interest  or  penalties  resulting  from  the  failure  of  an  Eligible  Shareholder  to  properly
complete or file such election forms in the form and manner and within the time prescribed
by the Tax Act (or any applicable provincial legislation). In its sole discretion, Denison or
any successor corporation may choose to sign and return an election form received by it
more than ninety (90) days following the Effective Date, but will have no obligation to do
so.
2.18 Fission Options
Each Fission Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be exchanged
for  an  option  (each,  a  “Denison  Replacement  Option”)  to  purchase  from  Denison  the
number  of  Denison  Shares  equal  to  the  product  of  (A)  the  number  of  Fission  Shares
subject to the Fission Option immediately before the Effective Time, and (B) the Exchange
Ratio, provided that if the foregoing would result in the issuance of a fraction of a Denison
Share  on  any  particular  exercise  of  Denison  Replacement  Options,  then  the  number  of
Denison Shares otherwise issued shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of
Denison  Shares.  The  exercise  price  per  Denison  Share  subject  to  any  such  Denison
Replacement  Option  shall  be  an  amount  (rounded  to  the  nearest  fourth  decimal  place)
equal  to  the  quotient  of  (A)  the  exercise  price  per  Fission  Share  under  the  exchanged
Fission Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio
(provided that the aggregate exercise price payable on any particular exercise of Denison
Replacement Options shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent). It is intended that
the  provisions  of  subsection  7(1.4)  of  the  Tax  Act  apply  to  the  aforesaid  exchange  of
options. Accordingly, and notwithstanding the foregoing, if required, the exercise price of
a Denison Replacement Option will be adjusted such that the In-The-Money Amount of the
Denison Replacement Option immediately after the exchange does not exceed the In-The-
Money  Amount  of  the  Fission  Option  immediately  before  the  exchange.  All  terms  and
conditions of a Denison Replacement Option, including the term to expiry, conditions to
and  manner  of  exercising,  will  be  the  same  as  the  Fission  Option  for  which  it  was
exchanged,  and  shall  be  governed  by  the  terms  of  the  Fission  Option  Plan  and  any
document  evidencing  a  Fission  Option  shall  thereafter  evidence  and  be  deemed  to
evidence such Denison Replacement Option. All Fission Options that are held by a person
who  will  no  longer  be  employed  or  retained  by  Fission  or  Denison  following  the
completion  of  the  Arrangement  shall  become  fully  vested  upon  completion  of  the
Arrangement and remain in full force and effect until the later of December 31, 2015 and
the date upon which such Fission Options would expire or terminate in accordance with
its terms and the terms of the Fission Option Plan.
2.19 Fission Warrants
- 21 -
Each Fission Warrant shall be adjusted in accordance with the adjustment provisions in
the relevant warrant certificate or warrant indenture such that following the completion of
the  Arrangement,  each  holder  of  Fission  Warrants  shall  receive,  upon  exercise  thereof,
that number of Denison Shares determined in accordance with the Exchange Ratio and
the  anti-dilution  provisions  of  such  Fission  Warrants,  in  lieu  of  each  Fission  Share  to
which  it  was  otherwise  entitled  to  receive  upon  exercise.  Upon  any  valid  exercise  of  a
Fission  Warrant  after  the  Effective  Time,  Denison  shall  issue  the  necessary  number  of
Denison Shares.
2.20 Employees
Unless otherwise agreed among the Parties prior to the Effective Date, the employment of
all  employees  of  Fission  and  Denison  (the  “Continuing  Employees”),  other  than  those
identified  in  Schedule  2.20  of  the  Fission  Disclosure  Letter  or  in  Schedule  2.20  of  the
Denison Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, will be continued by Denison.
Certain Permitted Transactions prior to the Effective Date
2.21 Certain Permitted Transactions prior to the Effective Date
(a)
If requested by Denison, Fission will, prior to the Effective Date, convey its interest in the
Fission Material Property and/or any other assets, rights or properties of Fission to a newly-
formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Fission in exchange for shares of such subsidiary on a
tax-free rollover basis pursuant to Section 85 of the Tax Act, and will take any and all other
actions  in  order  to  give  effect  to  and  enable  the  completion  of  the  Arrangement  and  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and conditions contained herein.

and other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such conveyance actually paid
by Fission in respect of such transfer in the event the Arrangement is not completed.
(b) Fission acknowledges and agrees that Denison may, subject to the prior written approval of
Fission, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed enter
into one or more Permitted Transactions.

Denison shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Competition Act Approval
as  soon  as  practicably  possible  and,  following  the  receipt  of  the  Competition  Act
Approval,  keep  such  approvals  current  and  in  force  until  the  Effective  Date.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing:
(a) The Parties shall cooperate in the preparation of any filing, submission, presentation, and
response  to  requests  for  information  from  or  written  communications  to  a  Governmental
Entity  in  connection  with  obtaining  the  Competition  Act  Approval.  Notwithstanding  any
requirement  under  this  Section  2.22,  any  draft  or  final  filing,  submission,  presentation,
response  or  written  communication  that  must  be  supplied  by  one  Party  under  this
Section  2.22  that  such  Party  regards  to  contain  confidential  and  competitively-sensitive
information can be withheld from the other Party provided that both (i) the Party that must
supply the filing, submission, presentation, response or written communication provides to
such other Party a redacted version of the document removing the competitively sensitive
information, and (ii) the supplying Party provides an non-redacted copy of the document that
contains the competitively sensitive information to the other Party’s external legal counsel
on  the  basis  that  such  external  legal  counsel  shall  not  be  required  to  supply  the  non-
redacted copy to its client.
- 22 -
(b) Denison  shall  promptly,  and  in  any  event,  no  later  than  five  (5)  Business  Days  after  the
execution of this Agreement or such later date as the Parties may mutually agree in writing,
submit to the Commissioner of Competition a submission assessing the competitive impact
of  the  transaction  contemplated  herein  and  in  which  Denison  will  request  that  the
Commissioner  of  Competition  provide  Competition  Act  Approval  (the  “Competition  Act
Submission”). Before submitting the Competition Act Submission to the Commissioner of
Competition,  Denison  shall  provide  one  or  more  drafts  to  Fission  for  its  review  and
comments,  which  comments  Denison  shall  consider  in  good  faith,  and  Denison  shall  not
submit  the  Competition  Act  Submission  until  it  has  been  approved  by  Fission  and,  once
filed, Denison shall provide a copy of the filed Competition Act Submission to Fission.
(c) unless Denison and Fission agree that it is not necessary or advisable, Denison and Fission
shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the submission of the Competition Act Submission
or  such  later  date  as  the  Parties  may  mutually  agree  in  writing,  each  submit  to  the
Commissioner  of  Competition  the  prescribed  filing  pursuant  to  subsection  114(1)  of  the
Competition Act.

Competition  Act  Approval  (a  “Competition  Act  Supplementary  Submission”),  including
responding  to  all  inquiries  directed  at  Denison  from  a  Governmental  Entity  in  connection
with obtaining the Competition Act Approval (other than any notice or information submitted
by  Fission  pursuant  to  section  114  of  the  Competition  Act  or  any  inquiries  directed
specifically  to  Fission,  which  shall  be  the  responsibility  of  Fission).  Before  submitting  a
Competition  Act  Supplementary  Submission  to  a  Governmental  Entity,  Denison  shall
provide one or more drafts to Fission for its review and comments, which comments Denison
shall  consider  in  good  faith,  and  Denison  shall  not  submit  any  Competition  Act
Supplementary Submission to a Governmental Entity until it has been approved by Fission
and, once filed, Denison shall provide a copy of the filed Competition Act Supplementary
Submission to Fission. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Fission considers it
appropriate to prepare a Competition Act Supplementary Submission that Denison does not
agree to prepare, Fission shall have the principal responsibility to prepare such Competition
Act Supplementary Submission, provided that Fission shall provide one or more drafts to
Denison for its review and comments, which comments Fission shall consider in good faith,
and  Fission  shall  not  submit  any  Competition  Act  Supplementary  Submission  to  a
Governmental Entity until it has been approved by Denison and, once filed, Fission shall

the Board of a Party (in this Section, the “Solicited Party”) may consider, participate in

delivered a written Acquisition Proposal which was not solicited or encouraged by the

breach of this Section 7.2 by the Solicited Party and that its Board determines in good
faith  after  consultation  with  its  financial  advisor  and  outside  legal  counsel  that  such

obtains  a  confidentiality  and  standstill  agreement  from  the  Person  making  such
Acquisition Proposal that is substantively the same as the Confidentiality Agreement,
and  otherwise  on  terms  no  more  favourable  to  such  Person  than  the  Confidentiality

Confidentiality Agreement, provided, however that such confidentiality agreement shall
not preclude such Person from making a Superior Proposal and such agreement shall
not restrict or prohibit the Solicited Party from disclosing to the other Party any details
concerning the Acquisition Proposal or any Superior Proposal made by such Person.

promptly  provided  with  access  to  the  same  information  to  which  such  Person  was
provided.
(ii) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board of a Party from making a Change in
Recommendation or from making any disclosure to any of its securityholders prior to
the Effective Time if, in the good faith judgment of such Board, after consultation with
outside  legal  counsel,  failure  to  take  such  action  or  make  such  disclosure  would  be
inconsistent  with  the  exercise  of  its  fiduciary  duties  or  such  action  or  disclosure  is
otherwise  required  under  applicable  Law  (including  by  responding  to  an  Acquisition
Proposal  under  a  directors’  circular  or  otherwise  as  required  under  applicable
Securities Laws); provided that:
A.
B.
C.
no  Change  in  Recommendation  may  be  made  in  relation  to  an  Acquisition
Proposal unless a Party complies with Section 7.3.
subject to paragraph (i) above, prior to making a Change in Recommendation, a
Party shall give to the other Party not less than 48 hours’ notice of its intention to
make such Change in Recommendation;
- 36 -
where, having first given notice of its intention to do so pursuant to paragraphs
(i) or (ii) above, the Board of a Party makes a Change in Recommendation and
the  other  Party  does  not  exercise  its  right  of  termination  prior  to  the  relevant
shareholders Meeting, the Party shall hold its Meeting on the date for which such
meeting  is  scheduled  (subject  to  adjournment  in  accordance  with  this
Agreement);

such Party or any of its subsidiaries. Such notice shall include a description of the terms and
conditions of any proposal, inquiry or offer, the identity of the Person making such proposal,
inquiry or offer and provide such other details of the proposal, inquiry or offer as the other
Party  may  reasonably  request.  Each  Party  shall  keep  the  other  Party  fully  informed  on  a
prompt basis of the status, including any change to the material terms, of any such proposal,
inquiry or offer.
(d) Each Party shall ensure that its officers, directors and employees and its subsidiaries and
their  officers,  directors,  employees  and  any  financial  advisors  or  other  advisors  or
Representatives retained by it are aware of the provisions of this Section 7.2, and it shall be
responsible for any breach of this Section 7.2 by such officers, directors, financial advisors
or other advisors or Representatives.
7.3 Right to Accept a Superior Proposal
Right to Accept a Superior Proposal
If a Party has complied with Section 7.2 of this Agreement with respect thereto, such Party
(the “Terminating Party”) may accept, approve, recommend or enter into any agreement,
understanding or arrangement in respect of a Superior Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement, the execution of which shall not be subject to the conditions of this Section 7.3)
received prior to the date of approval of the Arrangement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by such Party’s shareholders and terminate this Agreement if, and only if:
(i)
the Terminating Party has provided the other Party with a copy of the Superior Proposal
document;
(ii)
the Terminating Party has provided the other Party with the information regarding such
Superior Proposal required under Subsection 7.2(c);
(iii)
(iv)
the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Terminating  Party  has  determined  in  good  faith  after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisors that it is necessary in
order for the Board of Directors to discharge properly its fiduciary duties to withdraw or
modify  its  approval  or  recommendation  of  this  Agreement  and  to  approve  or
recommend such Superior Proposal; and
five (5) Business Days (the “Superior Proposal Notice Period”) shall have elapsed
from  the  later  of  (A)  the  date  the  other  Party  received  written  notice  (a  “Superior
Proposal  Notice”)  advising  it  that  the  Terminating  Party’s  Board  of  Directors  has
resolved to accept, approve, recommend or enter into an agreement in respect of such
Superior Proposal subject only to this Section 7.3, and (B) the date such Party received
a copy of such Superior Proposal document.
(a)
- 37 -
In the event that the Terminating Party provides the other Party with a Superior Proposal
Notice  on  a  date  that  is  less  than  seven  (7)  Business  Days  prior  to  its  meeting  of
shareholders the Terminating Party shall, at the request of the other Party, adjourn such
meeting to a date that is not less than five (5) Business Days and not more than fifteen
(15) days after the date of the Superior Proposal Notice. If the circular has been sent to
shareholders of the Terminating Party prior to the expiry of the Superior Proposal Notice
Period and, during such period, the other Party requests in writing that the special meeting
of the Terminating Party shareholders proceed, unless otherwise ordered by a court, the
Terminating Party shall continue to take all reasonable steps necessary to hold its special
meeting  and  to  cause  the  Arrangement  and  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this
Agreement to be voted on at such meeting:
(b) During  the  Superior  Proposal  Notice  Period,  the  Terminating  Party  agrees  that  the  other
Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to offer in writing to amend the terms of this
Agreement. The Board of Directors of the Terminating Party will review any written proposal
to amend the terms of this Agreement in good faith in order to determine, in its discretion in
the exercise of its fiduciary duties, whether the amended proposal would, upon acceptance
by  the  Terminating  Party,  result  in  such  Superior  Proposal  ceasing  to  be  a  Superior
Proposal. If the Board of Directors of the Terminating Party so determines, the Terminating
Party  will  enter  into  an  amended  agreement  with  the  other  Party  reflecting  the  amended
proposal.  If  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Terminating  Party  does  not  so  determine,  the
Terminating  Party  may  accept,  approve,  recommend  or  enter  into  an  agreement,
understanding or arrangement in respect of such Superior Proposal, subject to compliance
with the Termination Payment provisions in Section 8.3 hereof.
(c) Each  Party  also  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  each  successive  material  modification  of
any  Acquisition  Proposal  shall  constitute  a  new  Acquisition  Proposal  for  purposes  of  the
requirement under Subsection 7.3(a)(iv) and will initiate an additional five (5) Business Day
notice period

shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement; (b), each of
Denison and Fission shall promptly notify the other Party of any significant developments
or  material  changes  relating  to  its  business,  operations,  assets  or  prospects,  promptly

now existing in favour of present and former officers and directors of Denison and Fission

and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six (6) years from the

EFFECT OF THE ARRANGEMENT
2.1 Arrangement Agreement
This Plan of Arrangement is made pursuant to, is subject to the provisions of, and forms a
part  of  the  Arrangement  Agreement,  except  in  respect  of  the  sequence  of  the  steps
comprising the Arrangement, which shall occur in the order set forth herein.
2.2 Binding Effect
This Plan of Arrangement will become effective at the Effective Time and shall be binding
upon Denison, Subco, Fission, the Fission Shareholders, the holders of Fission Options
and the holders of Fission Warrants.
ARTICLE 3
ARRANGEMENT
3.1 The Arrangement
Commencing at the Effective Time, each of the events set out below shall occur and be
deemed  to  occur  in  the  following  sequence,  in  each  case  effective  as  at  one  minute
intervals starting at the Effective Time, without any further authorization, act or formality of
or by Fission, Denison or any other person:
(a) At the Effective Time:
(i) each Fission Share held by a Dissenting Shareholder shall be deemed to be transferred
by the holder thereof, without any further act or formality on its part, free and clear of all
Liens, to Denison and Denison shall thereupon be obliged to pay the amount therefor
determined and payable in accordance with Article 5 hereof, and the name of such holder
shall  be  removed  from  the  central  securities  register  of  Fission  as  a  holder  of  Fission
Shares and Denison shall be recorded as the registered holder of the Fission Shares so
transferred and shall be deemed to be the legal owner of such Fission Shares;
(ii) each  outstanding  Fission  Share  (other  than  Fission  Shares  held  by  Denison  or  any
affiliate thereof or dealt with pursuant to subsection 3.1(a)(i) hereof) will, without further
act or formality by or on behalf of a holder of Fission Shares, be irrevocably assigned and
transferred by the holder thereof to Denison (free and clear of all Liens) in exchange for
1.26 Denison Shares (subject to adjustment of the Exchange Ratio) and $0.0001 in cash
for each Fission Share held, and
A.
the holders of such Fission Shares shall cease to be the holders thereof and to have
any  rights  as  holders  of  such  Fission  Shares  other  than  the  right  to  receive  1.26
Denison Shares (subject to adjustment of the Exchange Ratio) and $0.0001 in cash
per Fission Share in accordance with this Plan of Arrangement;
A-5
B.
such  holders’  name  shall  be  removed  from  the  register  of  the  Fission  Shares
maintained by or on behalf of Fission; and
C. Denison shall be deemed to be the transferee and the legal and beneficial holder of
such  Fission  Shares  (free  and  clear  of  all  Liens)  and  shall  be  entered  as  the
registered  holder  of  such  Fission  Shares  in  the  register  of  the  Fission  Shares
maintained by or on behalf of Fission.
(iii) each  Fission  Option  outstanding  immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Time  will  be
exchanged  for  an  option  (each,  a  “Denison  Replacement  Option”)  to  purchase  from
Denison the number of Denison Shares equal to the product of (A) the number of Fission
Shares subject to the Fission Option immediately before the Effective Time, and (B) the
Exchange Ratio, provided that if the foregoing would result in the issuance of a fraction of
a Denison Share on any particular exercise of Denison Replacement Options, then the
number of Denison Shares otherwise issued shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
number of Denison Shares. The exercise price per Denison Share subject to any such
Denison Replacement Option shall be an amount (rounded to the nearest fourth decimal
place)  equal  to  the  quotient  of  (A)  the  exercise  price  per  Fission  Share  under  the
exchanged  Fission  Option  immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Time  divided  by  (B)  the
Exchange  Ratio  (provided  that  the  aggregate  exercise  price  payable  on  any  particular
exercise  of  Denison  Replacement  Options  shall  be  rounded  up  to  the  nearest  whole
cent). It is intended that the provisions of subsection 7(1.4) of the Tax Act apply to the
aforesaid  exchange  of  options.  Accordingly,  and  notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if
required, the exercise price of a Denison Replacement Option will be adjusted such that
the  In-The-Money  Amount  of  the  Denison  Replacement  Option  immediately  after  the
exchange does not exceed the In-The-Money Amount of the Fission Option immediately
before  the  exchange.  All  terms  and  conditions  of  a  Denison  Replacement  Option,
including the term to expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising, will be the same as
the Fission Option for which it was exchanged, and shall be governed by the terms of the
Fission  Option  Plan  and  any  document  evidencing  a  Fission  Option  shall  thereafter
evidence and be deemed to evidence such Denison Replacement Option.
(iv) each Fission Share held by Denison shall be transferred to Subco in consideration of the
issue by Subco to Denison of one common share of Subco for each Fission Share so
transferred, and the amount added to the stated capital of the Subco common shares will
be equal to the paid up capital (as such term is defined in the Tax Act) of the Fission
Shares so transferred;
(v) the aggregate stated capital in respect of the Fission Shares shall be reduced to $1.00
without any repayment of capital in respect thereof;
(vi) Fission  will  file  an  election  with  the  CRA  to  cease  to  be  a  public  corporation  for  the
purposes of the Tax Act;
(vii)Fission  and  Subco  shall  amalgamate  to  form  one  corporate  entity  (“Amalco”)  with  the
same effect as if they had amalgamated under Section 181 of the CBCA, except that the
legal existence of Subco shall not cease and Subco shall survive;
(viii)without  limiting  the  generality  of  subsection  3.1(a)(vii),  the  separate  legal  existence  of
Fission shall cease without Fission being liquidated or wound up and Fission and Subco
shall continue as one company and the property of Fission shall become the property of
Subco;
(ix) from and after the Effective Date,:
A-6
A. Amalco will own and hold all property of Fission and Subco and, without limiting the
provisions  hereof,  all  rights  of  creditors  or  others  will  be  unimpaired  by  such
amalgamation,  and  all  liabilities  and  obligations  of  Fission  and  Subco,  whether
arising by contract or otherwise, may be enforced against Amalco to the same extent
as if such obligations had been incurred or contracted by it;
B. Amalco will continue to be liable for all of the liabilities and obligations of Fission
and Subco;
C. all  rights,  contracts,  permits  and  interests  of  Fission  and  Subco  will  continue  as
rights, contracts, permits and interests of Amalco as if Fission and Subco continued

assignment of the rights or obligations of either of Fission or Subco under any such
rights, contracts, permits and interests;
D. any existing cause of action, claim or liability to prosecution will be unaffected;
E.
a civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding pending by or against either
Subco or Fission may be continued by or against Amalco;
F.
a conviction against, or ruling, order or judgment in favour of or against either Fission
or Subco may be enforced by or against Amalco;
G. Denison shall receive on the amalgamation one Amalco common share in exchange
for each Subco common share previously held and all of the issued and outstanding
Fission Shares will be cancelled without any repayment of capital in respect thereof;
H.
the name of Amalco shall be “●”;
I.
the registered office of Amalco shall be located in the City of Toronto in the Province
of Ontario, and the address of the first registered office of Amalco shall be 199 Bay

J.
Amalco shall be authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares;
K.
L.
subject to the provisions of the CBCA, no share of Amalco may be transferred after
the Effective Time unless its transfer complies with the restriction on the transfer of
securities set out in clause (Q) below;
the stated capital of the common shares of Amalco will be an amount equal to the
paid-up capital, as that term is defined in the Tax Act, attributable to the common
shares of Subco immediately prior to the amalgamation;
M.
the board of directors of Amalco shall, until otherwise changed in accordance with
the CBCA, consist of a minimum number of one (1) director and a maximum number

or on the powers which Amalco may exercise;
P.
the by-laws of Amalco, until repealed, amended or altered, shall be the by-laws of

(ii) the approval of the holders of shares of Amalco carrying at least a majority of the

(x) the exchanges and cancellations provided for in this Section 3.1 will be deemed to occur
on the Effective Date, notwithstanding that certain of the procedures related thereto are
not completed until after the Effective Date.
3.2 Post Effective Time Procedures
(a) Subject to the provisions of Article 5 hereof, and upon return of a properly completed
Fission Share Letter of Transmittal by a registered Former Fission Shareholder together
with certificates representing Fission Shares and such other documents as the Depositary
may  require,  Former  Fission  Shareholders  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  delivery  of  the
certificates  representing  the  Denison  Shares  and  a  cheque  representing  the  net  cash
payment to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(a) hereof.
A-8
(b) An Eligible Shareholder whose Fission Shares are exchanged for the Consideration
pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  shall  be  entitled  to  make  a  joint  income  tax  election,
pursuant to Section 85 of the Tax Act (and any analogous provision of provincial income
tax law) (a “Section 85 Election”) with respect to the exchange. Eligible Shareholders will
be able to submit the necessary information electronically and a secure special purpose
website will be made available to the Eligible Shareholders to assist with this process. The
information to be provided by the Eligible Shareholder will include the number of shares
transferred, the transferred properties’ cost base, the applicable agreed amounts for the
purposes  of  such  election  and  other  information  necessary  to  complete  the  Section  85
Election.  Denison  shall,  within  90  days  after  receiving  the  electronic  submission,  and
subject to such submission being correct and complete and complying with requirements
imposed  under  the  Tax  Act  (or  applicable  provincial  income  tax  law),  sign  and  return  a
copy of a completed Section 85 Election to the Eligible Shareholder for filing with the CRA
(or  the  applicable  provincial  tax  authority).  Neither  Fission,  Denison  nor  any  successor
corporation shall be responsible for the proper completion of any joint election form nor,
except for the obligation to sign and return duly completed joint election forms which are
received within 90 days of the Effective Date, for any taxes, interest or penalties resulting
from the failure of an Eligible Shareholder to properly complete or file such joint election
forms  in  the  form  and  manner  and  within  the  time  prescribed  by  the  Tax  Act  (or  any
applicable  provincial  legislation).  In  its  sole  discretion,  Denison  or  any  successor
corporation may choose to sign and return a joint election form received by it more than
90 days following the Effective Date, but will have no obligation to do so.
(c) Upon receipt of a Fission Share Letter of Transmittal in which an Eligible Shareholder
has indicated that the Eligible Shareholder intends to make a Section 85 Election, Denison
will  promptly  make  available  through  a  special  purpose  website,  a  tax  instruction  letter
(and a tax instruction letter for the equivalent provincial elections, if applicable), together
with  the  relevant  tax  election  forms  (including  the  provincial  tax  election  forms,  if
applicable) to the Eligible Shareholder.
3.3 No Fractional Shares
In no event shall any holder of Fission Shares be entitled to a fractional Denison Share.
Where the aggregate number of Denison Shares to be issued to a person as consideration
under  or  as  a  result  of  this  Arrangement  would  result  in  a  fraction  of  a  Denison  Share
being issuable, the number of Denison Shares to be received by such securityholder shall
be rounded down to the nearest whole Denison Share and no person will be entitled to
any compensation in respect of a fractional Denison Share.
3.4 No Fractional Cash Consideration
Any cash consideration owing to a Former Fission Shareholder shall be rounded up to the
next whole cent.
3.5 U.S. Tax Treatment
The Arrangement is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Sections
368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(D) of the U.S. Tax Code. Each of the parties hereto shall treat the
Arrangement  as  a  reorganization  within  the  meaning  of  Section  368(a)  of  the  U.S.  Tax
Code for all U.S. federal and applicable state income tax purposes and shall not take any
position inconsistent with such treatment, unless otherwise required by a “determination”
within the meaning of Section 1313 of the U.S. Tax Code that such treatment is not correct.
ARTICLE 4
WARRANTS
4.1 Warrants
Each Fission Warrant shall be adjusted in accordance with the adjustment provisions in
the relevant warrant certificate or warrant indenture such that following the completion of
the  Arrangement,  each  holder  of  Fission  Warrants  shall  receive,  upon  exercise  thereof,
that number of Denison Shares determined in accordance with the Exchange Ratio and
the anti-dilution provisions of such Warrants, in lieu of each Fission Share to which it was
otherwise entitled to receive upon exercise.
4.2 Exercise of Warrants Post-Effective Time
A-9
Upon  any  valid  exercise  of  a  Warrant  after  the  Effective  Time,  Denison  shall  issue  the
number of Denison Shares necessary to settle such exercise, provided that Denison has
received the Warrant exercise price.
ARTICLE 5
DISSENT RIGHTS
5.1 Rights of Dissent
Pursuant to the Interim Order, each registered Fission Shareholder may exercise rights of
dissent (“Dissent Rights”) under Section 190 of the CBCA as modified by this Article 5 as
the  same  may  be  modified  by  the  Interim  Order  or  the  Final  Order  in  respect  of  the
Arrangement, provided that the written objection to the Fission Arrangement Resolution
contemplated by Section 190 of the CBCA must be sent to and received by Fission at least
two days before the Fission Meeting. Fission Shareholders who duly exercise such rights
of dissent and who:
(a)  are  ultimately  determined  to  be  entitled  to  be  paid  fair  value  from  Denison,  for  the
Dissenting Shares in respect of which they have exercised Dissent Rights, will be deemed
to  have  irrevocably  transferred  such  Dissenting  Shares  to  Denison  pursuant  to
Section 3.1(a)(i) in consideration of such fair value; or
(b)  are  ultimately  not  entitled,  for  any  reason,  to  be  paid  fair  value  for  the  Dissenting
Shares in respect of which they have exercised Dissent Rights, will be deemed to have
participated in the Arrangement on the same basis as a Fission Shareholder who has not
exercised Dissent Rights;
but in no case will Fission or Denison or any other person be required to recognize such
holders  as  holders  of  Fission  Shares  after  the  completion  of  the  steps  set  forth  in
Section 3.1(a), and each Dissenting Shareholder will cease to be entitled to the rights of a
Fission Shareholder in respect of the Fission Shares in relation to which such Dissenting
Shareholder has exercised Dissent Rights and the central securities register of Fission will
be  amended  to  reflect  that  such  former  holder  is  no  longer  the  holder  of  such  Fission
Shares as and from the completion of the steps in Section 3.1(a)
ARTICLE 6
CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENTS
6.1 Payment of Consideration
(a) Following the receipt of the Final Order and prior to the Effective Date, Denison shall
deliver or arrange to be delivered to the Depositary certificates representing the Denison
Shares required to be issued to Former Fission Shareholders and Denison shall deliver to
the Depositary the requisite cash required to be paid to Former Fission Shareholders, in
accordance with the provisions of Section 3.1(a) hereof, which certificates and cash shall
be held by the Depositary as agent and nominee for such Former Fission Shareholders for
distribution  to  such  Former  Fission  Shareholders  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
this Article 6 hereof.
(b) As soon as practicable following the later of the Effective Date and the surrender to the
Depositary  for  cancellation  of  a  certificate  that  immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Time
represented  outstanding  Fission  Shares  that  were  transferred  under  Section  3.1(a),
together  with  a  duly  completed  Fission  Share  Letter  of  Transmittal  and  such  additional
documents  and  instruments  as  the  Depositary  may  reasonably  require  and  such  other
documents and instruments as would have been required to effect such transfer under the
CBCA,  the Securities  Transfer  Act  (British  Columbia)  and  the  articles  of  Fission  after
giving effect to Section 3.1(a) the former holder of such Fission Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary shall deliver to such holder following the
Effective Time, or make available for pick up at its offices during normal business hours, a
certificate  representing  the  Denison  Shares  and  a  cheque  representing  the  net  cash
payment that such holder is entitled to receive in accordance with Section 3.1(a) hereof,
less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 6.4.
A-10
(c)  Subject  to  Section  6.3,  until  surrendered  as  contemplated  by  this  Section  6.1,  each
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Fission Shares will be
deemed after the time described in Sections 3.1(a) to represent only the right to receive
from the Depositary upon such surrender a certificate representing the Denison Shares
and a cash payment that the holder of such certificate is entitled to receive in accordance
with Section 3.1 hereof, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 6.4.
(d)  Fission  and  Denison  will  cause  the  Depositary,  as  soon  as  a  Former  Fission
Shareholder becomes entitled to the Consideration in accordance with Section 3.1(a), to:
(i)
forward or cause to be forwarded by first class mail (postage paid) to such former
holder at the address specified in the Fission Share Letter of Transmittal;
(ii)
if requested by such former holder in the Fission Share Letter of Transmittal make
available  at  the  offices  of  the  Depositary  specified  in  the  Fission  Share  Letter  of
Transmittal; or
(iii)
if the Fission Share Letter of Transmittal neither specifies an address as described in
Section 6.1(d)(i) nor contains a request as described in Section 6.1(d)(ii), forward or
cause to be forwarded by first class mail (postage paid) to such former holder at the
address  of  such  former  holder  as  shown  on  the  applicable  securities  register
maintained by or on behalf of Fission immediately prior to the Effective Time;
a  certificate  representing  the  Denison  Shares  and  a  cheque  representing  the  net  cash
payment payable to such Former Fission Shareholder in accordance with the provisions
hereof.
(e) No holder of Fission Shares, Fission Options or Fission Warrants, shall be entitled to
receive  any  consideration  or  entitlement  with  respect  to  such  Fission  Shares,  Fission
Options or Fission Warrants, other than any consideration or entitlement to which such
holder is entitled to receive in accordance with Section 3.1, this Section 6.1 and the other
terms of this Plan of Arrangement and, for greater certainty, no such holder will be entitled
to  receive  any  interest,  dividends,  premium  or  other  payment  in  connection  therewith,
other than any declared but unpaid dividends.
6.2 Loss of Certificates
In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
outstanding  Fission  Shares  that  were  acquired  by  Denison  or  Fission  pursuant  to
Section 3.1 has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the former holder of such Fission Shares, the Depositary will deliver to such person or
make  available  for  pick  up  at  its  offices  in  exchange  for  such  lost,  stolen  or  destroyed
certificate, a certificate representing the Denison Shares and a cheque representing the
cash consideration which the former holder of such Fission Shares is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof in accordance with such holder’s Fission Share Letter of
Transmittal. When authorizing such payment in relation to any lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the former holder of such Fission Shares will, as a condition precedent to the
delivery  of  such  Consideration,  give  a  bond  satisfactory  to  Fission,  Denison  and  the
Depositary  in  such  sum  as  Denison  may  direct  or  otherwise  indemnify  Fission  and
Denison in a manner satisfactory to Fission and Denison against any claim that may be
made against Fission or Denison with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.
6.3 Extinction of Rights
A-11
If  any  Former  Fission  Shareholder  fails  to  deliver  to  the  Depositary  the  certificates,
documents or instruments required to be delivered to the Depositary under Section 6.1 or
Section  6.2  in  order  for  such  Former  Fission  Shareholder  to  receive  the  Consideration
which such former holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1, on or before the
sixth  anniversary  of  the  Effective  Date,  on  the  sixth  anniversary  of  the  Effective  Date
(i)  such  former  holder  will  be  deemed  to  have  donated  and  forfeited  to  Denison  or  its
successors, any Consideration held by the Depositary in trust for such former holder to
which such former holder is entitled and (ii) any certificate representing Fission Shares
formerly  held  by  such  former  holder  will  cease  to  represent  a  claim  of  any  nature
whatsoever  and  will  be  deemed  to  have  been  surrendered  to  Denison  and  will  be
cancelled. None of Fission or Denison, or any of their respective successors, will be liable
to  any  person  in  respect  of  any  Consideration  (including  any  consideration  previously
held by the Depositary in trust for any such former holder) which is forfeited to Fission or
Denison or delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.
6.4 Withholding Rights
The Parties, the Depositary and any Person on their behalf shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold  from  any  consideration  payable  or  otherwise  deliverable  to  any  Person
hereunder  and  from  all  dividends,  interest  or  other  amounts  payable  to  any  Person
(including, for greater certainty and as applicable, any Fission Shareholder, any Person
entitled to a Fission Change of Control Payment or Retention Bonus Payment, and any
Dissenting  Shareholder)  such  amounts  as  any  of  the  Parties  or  the  Depositary  or  any
Person  on  their  behalf  may  be  required  or  permitted  to  deduct  and  withhold  therefrom
under  any  provision  of  applicable  Laws  in  respect  of  Taxes.  To  the  extent  that  such
amounts  are  so  deducted,  withheld  and  remitted,  such  amounts  shall  be  treated  for  all
purposes  under  this  Agreement  as  having  been  paid  to  the  Person  to  whom  such
amounts would otherwise have been paid. The Parties and the Depositary shall also have
the right to withhold and sell, on their own account or through a broker, and on behalf of
any  aforementioned  Person  to  whom  a  withholding  obligation  applies,  or  require  such
Person to irrevocably direct the sale through a broker and irrevocably direct the broker to
pay  the  proceeds  of  such  sale  to  the  Parties  or  the  Depositary,  as  appropriate,  such
number  of  Denison  Shares  issued  to  such  Person  pursuant  to  the  Arrangement  as  is
necessary to produce sale proceeds (after deducting commissions payable to the broker
and other costs and expenses) sufficient to fund any withholding obligations. None of the
Parties or the Depositary will be liable for any loss arising out of any sale.
6.5 No Liens
Any exchange or transfer of securities pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement shall be free
and clear of any Liens or other claims of third parties of any kind.
6.6 Paramountcy
From and after the Effective Time: (a) this Plan of Arrangement shall take precedence and
priority  over  any  and  all  Fission  Shares,  Fission  Warrants,  and  Fission  Options  issued
