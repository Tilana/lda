Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> paragraph 5 (g) of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
in which the Assembly decided that the Council should assume the role and responsibilities 
of the Commission on Human Rights relating to the work of the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as decided by the Assembly in its 
resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of all relevant resolutions on this issue adopted by the General 
Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note also</i> of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner 
(A/HRC/13/18), 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note further</i> of the reports of the Joint Inspection Unit on the follow-up to the 
management review of the Office of the High Commissioner (A/59/65-E/2004/48 and 
Add.1) and on the funding and staffing of the Office (JIU/REP/2007/8), 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> that an imbalance in the composition of the staff could diminish the 
effectiveness of the work of the Office of the High Commissioner if it is perceived to be 
culturally biased and unrepresentative of the United Nations as a whole, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><b>2</b> GE.10-12354 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing</i> its concern that, despite the repeated requests to correct the unbalanced 
geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains that one region accounts for 
more than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than 
the four remaining regional groups combined, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of continuing the ongoing efforts to address the 
imbalance regarding the regional representation of the staff of the Office of the High 
Commissioner, 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> that the paramount consideration for employing staff at every level is 
the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and taking into 
account Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, expressing its 
conviction that this objective is compatible with the principle of equitable geographical 
distribution, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the 
General Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses</i> its serious concern at the fact that, despite the measures taken by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the imbalance in 
the geographical representation of its composition continues to be prominent, and that a 
single region occupies more posts in both the professional and technical categories, as well 
as permanent and temporary categories, than the other four regions all together; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Welcomes</i> the statement made by the High Commissioner in her report that 
achieving geographical balance in the staff of her Office will remain one of her priorities, 
and requests the High Commissioner to continue to take all measures needed to redress the 
current imbalance in geographical distribution of the staff of the Office; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Notes</i> the increase in the past three years in the percentage of staff from 
regions identified as requiring better representation, and the various measures proposed and 
already taken to address the imbalance in geographical distribution of the staff, while 
noting with concern the small increase in 2009 and no change in the status of the prominent 
region, and stresses the need to implement additional measures to redress the prominent 
imbalance in a more expeditious way; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Takes note</i> of the progress achieved towards improved geographic diversity 
in the staff of the Office, and takes note also of the commitment of the High Commissioner 
to remain attentive to the need to maintain the emphasis on the broadest possible 
geographic diversity of her Office, as stated in the conclusion of her report; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to work on the broadest geographic 
diversity of her staff by enhancing the implementation of measures to achieve a better 
representation of countries and regions that are unrepresented or underrepresented, 
particularly from the developing world, while considering applying a zero-growth cap on 
the representation of countries and regions already overrepresented in the Office of the 
High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Welcomes</i> the efforts made towards the achievement of a gender balance in 
the composition of the staff and the decision to continue to pay special attention to this 
issue; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> future High Commissioners to continue to enhance the ongoing 
efforts made in the fulfilment of the goal of a geographical balance in the composition of 
the staff of the Office; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Underlines</i> the importance of continuing to promote geographical diversity in 
the recruitment of and promotion to high-level and Professional posts, including senior 
managers, as a principle of the staffing policies of the Office of the High Commissioner; </p>


<p>GE.10-12354 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p> 9. <i>Affirms</i> the vital importance of geographical balance in the composition of 
the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, taking into account the significance of 
national and regional specificities and various historic, cultural and religious backgrounds, 
as well as of different political, economic and legal systems, to the promotion and 
protection of the universality of human rights; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Recalls</i> the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General 
Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001, on human resources management, in which 
the Assembly reiterated its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to 
improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical 
distribution of staff in all departments, and also recalls the request that he submit to the 
Assembly proposals for a comprehensive review of the system of desirable ranges, with a 
view to establishing a more effective tool to ensure equitable geographic distribution in 
relation to the total number of staff of the Secretariat; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Encourages</i> the General Assembly to consider further measures for 
promoting desirable ranges of geographical balance in the staff of the Office of the High 
Commissioner representing national and regional specificities and various historic, cultural 
and religious backgrounds, as well as the diversity of political, economic and legal systems; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Welcomes</i> the significant increase in the human and financial resources 
allocated to the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner and the impact it should 
have on the geographic composition of the Office; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Recognizes</i> the importance of the follow-up to and implementation of 
General Assembly resolution 61/159 of 19 December 2006, and underlines the priority 
importance that the Assembly continue to provide support and guidance to the High 
Commissioner in the ongoing process of improvement of the geographical balance in the 
composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to submit a comprehensive and updated 
report to the Council at its sixteenth<b> </b>session, in accordance with its annual programme of 
work, following the structure and scope of her report and with a special focus on further 
measures taken to correct the imbalance in the geographical composition of the staff of the 
Office.
