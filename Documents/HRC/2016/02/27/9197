<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its second session from 5 to 19 
May 2008.  The review of France was held at the 13th meeting on 14 May 2008. The delegation of 
France was headed by Fran&#231;ois Zimeray, Ambassador for Human Rights. For the composition of 
the delegation, composed of 17 members, see annex below. At its 17th meeting held on 19 May 
2008, the Working Group adopted the present report on France.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 28 February 2008, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of France: Zambia, Italy and Malaysia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of  the annex to resolution 5/1,  the following documents 
were issued for the review of France: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/2/FRA/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR), in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/FRA/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR, in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/2/FRA/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to France through the 
troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  SUMMARY OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE REVIEW PROCESS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the 13th meeting, on 14 May 2008, Mr. Fran&#231;ois Zimeray, Ambassador for Human 
Rights and Head of Delegation, before introducing the national report expressed his thoughts and 
solidarity for the thousand of victims of the natural catastrophes that have dramatically hit the 
people of Myanmar and China. Referring to the national report, he then stated that it had been 
prepared through consultations between different parts of the administration and with civil society. 
Responding to a written question submitted in advance, Mr. Zimeray said that all main actors from 
civil society, trade unions as well as opinion and religious movements were given the opportunity to 
share their views on the human rights situation and to submit written contributions. Further, he 
informed that dialogue with the <i>Commission nationale consultative des droits de l&#8217;Homme 
</i>(CNCDH) had been ongoing. The Head of Delegation also explained the commitment of France to 
uphold human rights at the international level. He recalled, inter alia, the recent active engagement 
of his country in the establishment of the UPR mechanism and the nogotiations on the draft optional 
protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>6. At national level, Mr. Zimeray stated that in 2007 the human rights protection system was 
reinforced by the appointment of a State Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Human Rights as well as 
the <i>Haut-commissaire aux solidarit&#233;s</i> in charge of fighting poverty, and the establishment in 2000 
of the post of Ambassador for Human Rights. The French Constitution provides a central place for 
human rights and several independent administrative authorities have been created in order to 
protect the rights of citizens, such as for example, the <i>Commission nationale informatique et </i></p>

 <p> 
<i>libert&#233;s</i> (CNIL), the <i>Haute autorit&#233; de lutte contre les discriminations et pour l&#8217;&#233;galit&#233;</i> (HALDE), 
created in 2004, the <i>Commission nationale de d&#233;ontologie de la s&#233;curit&#233;</i> (CNDS), the <i>D&#233;fenseur 
des enfants</i> and the <i>Contr&#244;leur g&#233;n&#233;ral des lieux de privation de libert&#233;</i>, established in 2007. The 
CNCDH was once again accredited in 2007 by the International Coordination Committee for 
National Human Rights Institutions (ICC), in light of the Paris Principles. Its independence was 
reinforced and functions were improved further to a review of its statutes.  
</p>
<p>7. The Ambassador for Human Rights further stated that the national report focused on 
difficulties - and sometimes criticism &#8211; raised by international expert organs and civil society. He 
explained that freedom of religion and belief has been recognized in France since 1789 and that 
French laicism (<i>la&#239;cit&#233;</i>) is not exclusive of the freedom to believe. The French authorities maintain a 
dialogue with faith representatives, such as the <i>Conseil fran&#231;ais du culte musulman</i>. He stated that 
all forms of discrimination are contrary to French values and must be combated. In this regard, the 
Ministry of Justice also established anti-discrimination focal points within all high courts. 
Regarding Travellers (<i>Gens du voyage</i>), a consultative national commission has been established 
and includes representatives of the authorities and of Travellers (<i>Gens du voyage</i>), and measures 
have been taken with regard to residence, housing, access to work and right to education. He further 
explained that French legislation fully integrates equality between men and women. The 2004 
Equality Charter aims at mobilizing all public and private actors. Almost three quarters of its 
measures have been implemented but more still needs to be undertaken in order to ensure full 
parity.  
</p>
<p>8. The Ambassador for Human Rights further explained the importance placed on the respect 
for ethics and human rights by law enforcement personnel. He noted that the latter are trained in 
this regard and that public authorities exercise strict control and sanction breaches vigorously. In 
2006, 114 disciplinary sanctions and 76 judicial condemnations were pronounced for violence. A 
national commission for ethics within the security sector was established in 2000. Conditions of 
detention in France are not sufficiently satisfactory, notably due to the overcrowding of prisons, a 
fact that had been often highlighted by human rights treaty bodies, the European Committee for the 
Prevention of Torture and the CNCDH. He informed that measures have been taken to remedy the 
most critical situations. This should lead in 2012 to the creation of 22 new penitentiary 
establishments, and the closing of 16 old ones. In addition, active political measures have been 
taken in relation to new ways to execute sentences. All detainees will be able to directly access the 
<i>M&#233;diateur de la R&#233;publique</i> as of 2010. Detainees are currently able to challenge all administrative 
sanctions and decisions in front of a judge. Regarding the rights of asylum-seekers, the Head of 
Delegation explained that France remains deeply committed to its international obligations and 
constitutional order. He noted that France is the second country in Europe with regard to receiving 
asylum requests. Since 1 January 2004, significant changes have been introduced into French 
legislation. In this regard France takes into account persecutions by non-State actors, in conformity 
with the doctrine of UNHCHR. France strengthened the protections covered by the 1951 
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, by creating an additional protection covering persons 
that are at risk of inhuman and degrading treatment. The <i>Office Fran&#231;ais pour la Protection des 
R&#233;fugi&#233;s et des Apatrides</i> (OFPRA) is the sole institution which decides on asylum issues, with full 
independence and under the control of an independent jurisdiction (<i>Cour nationale du droit 
d&#8217;asile</i>). France further indicated that its country will in 2008 take many actions with regard to 
international human rights treaties (see details of under the chapter on voluntary commitments). 
Finally, the Head of Delegation stated that in the new world we entered, threatened by divisions, 
and in which some would like to see a clash of civilizations, France believes on the contrary in the 
alliance of civilizations, guaranteed by the universal respect of rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review</b> 
</p>
<p>9. During the ensuing interactive dialogue, 40 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations commended France on the quality of its presentation and the national report, including 
related consultations with civil society.  They also noted France's history in promoting and 
protecting human rights, including the <i>1789 Declaration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen</i>, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the General Assembly in Paris in 1948, and 
France&#8217;s recent role and contribution in the negotiations and adoption of the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>10.  Morocco noted with satisfaction the important role played by the CNCDH in the promotion 
and protection of human rights and encouraged the setting up of such institutions, in accordance 
with the Paris Principles. Morocco asked for more information about the projected establishment of 
a European Pact for immigration. Morocco also asked for statistics regarding the access to 
employment of migrants or persons with immigrant heritage. Morocco also asked about France&#8217;s 
intentions to provide additional measures to prevent and sanction intolerance. 
</p>
<p>11.  Chile noted that despite improvements in recent years, the participation of women in 
Parliament is still far from the ideal of equal democracy and asked about the kinds of measures 
which could improve their representation in public life and establish cultural equality. It enquired 
about measure taken by France to implement the circular of 19 April 2006 on domestic violence 
and whether France has any intent to establish a law on violence against women. Chile also asked 
whether there are any measures to guarantee that an asylum-seeker whose claim is rejected will not 
be sent to a country where rights might be violated 
</p>
<p>12. With reference to the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, who had found 
that the law on religious symbols has had an important impact on the Muslim community, Egypt 
enquired about the assessment of the Government in this regard and about the measures envisaged 
to resolve this problem. Noting that France has always been devoted to the integration of the 
various communities on its territory, Egypt stated that socio-economic inequalities have continued 
over the decades and recommended that programmes and specific measures be adopted to ensure 
the protection of economic, social and cultural rights of all components of society. Egypt also 
recommended accession to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW). Egypt mentioned a court decision 
concerning the publication of cartoons against Islam in 2005, which raised questions of 
compatibility with the jurisprudence developed by the European Court of Human Rights. Since 
Islam is the second religion in France, and since it is essential to protect all religious communities 
on an equal basis, Egypt recommended that a law banning incitement to religious and racial hatred 
be adopted. Furthermore, Egypt recommended that France consider its commitment in line with 
paragraph 101 of the Durban Declaration when addressing questions with respect to legislation and 
studies on colonialism and the slave trade, in particular with respect to overseas territories. 
</p>
<p>13. Azerbaijan welcomed the establishment of the post of Ambassador of Human Rights and 
HALDE, as well as the attention attached to increase the representation of women in society. It 
noted that in France, seven million people live below the poverty line. Azerbaijan called upon<b> 
</b>France to strengthen the fight against racism and xenophobia, in particular against Islamophobia 
and anti-Semitism. Integrating ethnic and religious minorities into society is another urgent issue. 
Furthermore, Azerbaijan stated that measures must be taken<b> </b>to better guarantee the protection of 
migrants and that signing and ratifying the ICRMW would be a major step into this direction. 
Azerbaijan asked what achievements have been made in fighting poverty, what measures have been </p>

 <p> 
taken to resolve the problem of prison overcrowding, and whether measures are being envisaged to 
prevent or reduce the consequences of nuclear tests for the population living in overseas territories.  
</p>
<p>14. Albania welcomed France&#8217;s role in the creation of the Human Rights Council and its 
contribution to the negotiation and adoption of the International Convention on the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and recommended that France complete the domestic 
process in order to ratify it as soon as possible. It noted the reasons provided by France regarding 
the reasons it cannot consider acceding to the ICRMW. In this regard, Albania stated that holding 
the presidency of the European Union later in 2008 will offer an opportunity for France to take the 
initiative with a view to ratifying the convention on the issue at the regional level. 
</p>
<p>15. Cameroon noted with interest the attention France attaches to combating racism and 
xenophobia and all forms of discrimination and the important legislative apparatus in this area; the 
concern to find appropriate solutions to the problem of overpopulation in prisons and securing 
police operations; equality of gender; and clandestine migration. Cameroon asked whether the 
multiplication of institutions in charge of human rights issues leads to problems of coordination and 
whether the reservations to treaties and conventions ratified by France do not considerably reduce 
their implementation at the national level. 
</p>
<p>16. Mexico commended France on its initiative to promote a European Pact on Migration<b> </b>and 
recommended that in the elaboration of this initiative, central attention be given to the consideration 
of human rights to ensure that its implementation is guaranteed for all migrants regardless of their 
status. Mexico recognized France&#8217;s commitment in regard to international criminal justice and 
recommended the withdrawal of the declaration under article 124 of the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court. Mexico enquired about an independent study which refers to the 
compatibility of French legislation with international human rights standards regarding the rights 
and protection of migrants, including migrant workers, and suggested the elaboration of an 
independent study addressing the concerns expressed in the subparagraph 1 of paragraph 13 of the 
national report. Mexico endorsed the concerns expressed by the Special Rapporteur on the 
protection of human rights while countering terrorism contained in its communication dated 26 
April 2006 regarding the extension of the criminal definition of terrorism, the period of detention of 
suspects and the period of getting access to a lawyer and recommended to France to respond to the 
aforementioned communication. 
</p>
<p>17. Switzerland raised three issues: violence against women, conditions of detention and fight 
against recidivism. On violence against women, Switzerland asked for more information regarding 
measures which may be taken to reduce domestic violence. Is this type of offence automatically 
prosecuted or only following a complaint? Switzerland recommended that France introduce 
automatic prosecution for all acts of domestic violence, if this is not done already. Switzerland 
further recommended that France take into account the concerns of the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women regarding the absence of an agency in charge of gathering information on 
violence against women, particularly regarding homicides in the context of domestic violence. 
Switzerland expressed concerns about conditions of detention, particularly overpopulation, and 
asked for more information on measures planned to remedy this issue. Switzerland asked whether it 
was possible to provide a date for the appointment of a <i>Contr&#244;leur des lieux privatifs de libert&#233;</i>. It 
then asked for more details on the new legislation on stricter penalties for recidivists, particularly 
minors, and enquired about consequences of such a law on a system that appears to already have 
reached the limit of its capacities. Switzerland recommended that<b> </b>France pursue efforts to foster 
social integration and reinsertion of recidivist minors. It welcomed France&#8217;s efforts to combat 
torture and requested a copy of France&#8217;s manual on detecting signs of torture.<b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p><p>18. The Netherlands requested further information concerning the representation of minorities 
in elected positions. With reference to concerns expressed by the Committee against Torture 
(CAT), the Netherlands stated that there is an urgency to change the poor prison conditions, 
including overcrowding of prisons and the long periods of pre-trial detention, and asked what 
deadlines France considers for meeting international standards in prisons and implementing the 
recommendations. The Netherlands recommended that France report back to the Human Rights 
Council about further concrete measures taken with regard to the improvement of prison conditions 
according to international standards and that the recommendations of the different treaty bodies in 
this regard be implemented as soon as possible. With reference to the recommendation of CAT to 
consider the introduction of a procedure on article 3 of the Convention, the Netherlands 
recommended that France make effective efforts to respect its international obligations not to 
forcibly return any individual to a country where he or she may be at risk of serious human rights 
violations, including torture or other ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>19. China noted that in recent years, positive efforts have been made to improve legislation and 
positive steps taken to protect human rights. In this regard, China referred to various agencies that 
protect human rights. China recalled the recommendation made in 2008 by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) that France ensure that women enjoy 
equality for pay and employment, and help disabled women to find jobs, and asked whether it is 
planned to implement this recommendation.  Finally, it asked what France is planning to do 
regarding the National Plan of Action on Human Rights and what the content of the plan will be.  
</p>
<p>20.  Noting the legislative measures taken for the rights of women and children and concerning 
the fight against all forms of discrimination and intolerance, Cuba expressed hope that this legal 
structure will be found in effective policies to strengthen the concepts of inclusion, equality and 
non-discrimination and will apply in an equal manner to all members of the multicultural and 
diverse French society. In reference to the national report, in which France stressed the importance 
of legislation combating all forms of discrimination, and to France&#8217;s reservations to article 4 of the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), Cuba 
asked how the Government reconciles the right to freedom of expression and the prohibition of any 
propaganda organization, which is based on the concept of racial superiority or which claims to 
justify or promote racial hatred or discrimination. Cuba asked how the Government guarantees 
respect for the rights of migrant workers, particularly those in illegal situations and recommended 
that France consider the possibility of withdrawing its reservations to article 4 of ICERD and to 
continue its efforts to protect the rights of all migrants, regardless of their situation and status. 
</p>
<p>21.  Canada noted the concerns expressed by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination (CERD) regarding the increase in racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic incidents and 
its calls to take preventive measures to put an end to racist incidents involving law enforcement 
authorities and other public officials. Canada also referred to the concerns of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regarding the rejection of the rights of minorities due to 
incompatibility with the French Constitution. Canada recommended that France review its position 
on the recognition of the rights of minorities and that it begin collecting data on the socio-economic 
status, disaggregated by ethnic identity, confession and gender, in order to identify social problems 
affecting ethnic and religious minorities<b>. </b>Canada noted that France prohibits wearing the veil, be it 
religious or not, in its public schools while tolerating wearing crucifixes. Canada is of the view that 
wearing the veil is part of freedom of religion and recommended that France remove its prohibition 
on wearing the hijab in public schools. Finally, Canada drew attention to CAT and CEDAW 
observations to the effect that France&#8217;s reports do not contain any information on the 
implementation of the respective conventions in its overseas territories and departments.  </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>22. In his response to questions following the dialogue, the Head of Delegation informed the 
meeting about the European Pact on Migration and France&#8217;s priorities for its future Presidency of 
the European Union. He reiterated that his Government&#8217;s priorities in this context are to improve 
the monitoring of borders, to organize legal migration and the removal of irregular migrants in 
coordination with countries of origin, and to harmonize the European asylum policy. France has 
already signed six conventions with countries of origin such as with Tunisia and Senegal and these 
conventions have already opened up professions for migrants coming to France. 
</p>
<p>23. Regarding the status of women, particularly victims of domestic violence and concerning 
gender equality, the representative of France referred to a two-fold approach, through legislation on 
one hand and through changing mentalities, mindsets or behaviour on the other hand. As regards 
the latter aspect, France acknowledged the importance of providing training for police and law 
enforcement officers to help them better deal with victims of violence, the need to have specialized 
investigators and psychologists, and underlined the existence of a toll-free phone line for victims. 
Today, an estimated 330,000 women consider themselves victims of domestic violence; this has an 
important economic cost. In 2004, 2006 and 2007 new laws have been adopted allowing for the 
removal of the violent spouse from the family home. According to a specific circular, no act of 
violence should remain without a response. In 2007, 83 per cent of cases led to a penal response, 
which constitutes a clear decrease in the number of cases in which lawsuits are dropped. Social 
responses are also provided and women who are victims are given priority access to public housing. 
France has organized a high profile awareness campaign to combat stereotypes through 
advertisements on television. 
</p>
<p>24. On issues related to gender and immigration, the agency for immigration has made 
improvements with regard to facilitating immigrants&#8217; access to law and has produced a guidebook 
on gender equality with a special focus on genital mutilation and forced marriages. To avoid forced 
marriages, France recently established the same legal age for marriage for both sexes.  France also 
recognized that there were still disparities in salaries between men and women, referring to a 19 per 
cent average gap for the same work.  France has set clear objectives with an &#8220;Equality&#8221; label: 
disparities have to be overcome within five years. The Government will negotiate sector by sector 
with trade unions, with the agency for employment and all other stakeholders at all levels. By the 
end of 2009, companies which have not established a plan to redress inequalities between men and 
women will be fined. Regarding women&#8217;s representation in politics, the country is moving towards 
parity. There is a new legal requirement that all political parties must present equal numbers of men 
and women on their electoral lists, including in local elections; the non-respect of this requirement 
leads to paying a fine, according to the 2007 law. On the situation in prisons, France has a major 
reform plan and will close down obsolete prisons, since over half of them were built before 1945. 
22 prisons will be built and 6,000 new beds added. Next year, a new facility will be opened every 
month. Sentencing will also be reformed with new ways to execute sentences, a new approach to 
the mission of reintegration that is devoted to prisons, the extended use of the possibility of partial 
releases and the development of an electronic bracelet programme. In response to questions about 
juvenile detention, additional specialized establishments will be built and developed. At present the 
already existing ones prioritize education.  
</p>
<p>25. On the question of disabilities, the representative of France stated that discrimination still 
exists. Nearly 10 per cent of the French population suffers from disability and laws provide for 
financial compensation, benefits and disability pensions. As regards access to employment, there is 
a strict requirement that persons with disabilities represent at least 6 per cent of the workforce, both 
in the public and private sectors.   </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>26. France informed that it will establish an institution to coordinate the various existing bodies 
dealing with human rights issues.  
</p>
<p>27. On racism and xenophobia, France reminded that racism is a severely punished crime in 
France.. Incitement to racial hatred is punished. Referring to the cartoon case, France underlined the 
need to reconcile a high level of anti-racism with a high degree of respect for the right to freedom 
of expression, which is not an easy task. France punishes severely, with prison sentences, all 
incitements to racial hatred, be they related to Islamophobia or anti-Semitism, but tolerates genuine 
criticism and derision not intended to incite racial hatred. France stressed that there was no law on 
the religious veil in France; the law addresses the issue of distinctive religious symbols in public 
places, and mentions open religious symbols of any religion. In accordance with France&#8217;s 
conception of laicism (<i>la&#239;cit&#233;</i>), public places, including schools, should not be places of 
confrontation, where debates that exist at the domestic or international level would be reflected, but 
places where tolerance is taught. On terrorism and human rights, France has two imperatives to 
reconcile: ensuring the security of citizens and preserving, in the fight against terrorism, a very high 
level of respect for human rights. Those accused of terrorism have the same rights as any other 
person charged with criminal offences but specific procedural measures can apply, such as the 
period of custody, for example, which can be extended to six days, but only in the case of an 
imminent risk of a terrorist attack or if imperatively required by international cooperation. Since the 
adoption of the law, this has only applied in one case.  
</p>
<p>28. While expressing appreciation for the recent visit of the independent expert on minority 
issues, Austria stated that addressing certain specific needs of individuals belonging to minorities, 
as indentified by the independent expert during her visit, in particular in the field of employment, 
education and access to housing, would not be in contradiction to the traditional position of France 
concerning the recognition of the concept of minorities as regarding group rights.<b> </b>Austria 
recommended that the Government consider how best the specific needs of individuals belonging to 
minorities could be addressed in order to ensure their equal enjoyment of all human rights, as 
provided for in the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>29. Colombia stated that in order to be effective in the promotion and protection of human 
rights, it is important to have independent, objective and impartial mechanisms and effective 
monitoring of security forces. Colombia noted with particular interest France&#8217;s experience with the 
setting up of the <i>Commission nationale de d&#233;ontologie de la s&#233;curit&#233;</i> (CNDS) and the commission 
to monitor places of detention and custody facilities. Colombia requested more information on the 
establishment of these two commissions, the relationship between them and the result of their work 
to date.  
</p>
<p>30. Noting concerns expressed by CAT and the Human Rights Committee, as stated in 
paragraph 21 of the OHCHR compilation report, in view of the discretionary prosecution for 
alleged acts of torture or ill-treatment by police officers, Germany asked whether France shares the 
view of the Committee that this may result in virtual impunity and what measures France takes to 
ensure full compatibility with its obligations under article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights  (ICCPR). Germany also referred to concerns voiced by several treaty bodies 
and the independent expert on minority issues regarding the French concept of minority rights and 
the related practice, and asked for more information on how France is addressing these concerns. 
</p>
<p>31. The Czech Republic asked what measures have been adopted to ensure effective 
implementation of article 3 of the Convention against Torture in cases of persons from countries 
considered safe countries of origin or countries with the alternative of internal asylum, and if the 
possibility of risk of torture in these cases is being assessed on a case-by-case basis. It </p>

 <p> 
recommended that France adopt further measures to ensure granting possible requests of the 
Committee against Torture for interim measures in individual cases aimed at preventing the breach 
of provisions of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
or Punishment.<b> </b>It asked France to elaborate on measures adopted in reply to concerns expressed by 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child, CERD and UNHCR regarding the length of procedures 
for family reunification of recognized refugees and recommended that these procedures be executed 
with utmost speed to ensure the protection of family life of the persons concerned.  
</p>
<p>32. Regarding the 2004 legislation which forbids employees and students of  public schools to 
wear conspicuous religious symbols and the ruling of the European Court on Human Rights that the 
law banning religious symbols in schools did not violate the freedom of religion, the United States 
of America enquired about the impact of this law on religiously observant children and teachers, 
asked how many children have been expelled or teachers fired from school since 2004, and 
enquired about steps the Government has taken to integrate these children into society.   
</p>
<p>33. Argentina referred to the ceremony for the signature of the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance which took place in Paris, and noted 
France&#8217;s written commitment to submit the text of the Convention to Parliament in the near future.  
</p>
<p>34. Senegal noted the implementation of concrete initiatives to combat poverty and encouraged 
the Government to continue examining the possibility of ratifying ICRMW. Senegal expressed its 
wish that France continue its long-term combat to promote and protect all human rights and to assist 
other countries to follow the example of France, which is its responsibility and its vocation.  
</p>
<p>35. Brazil noted that France has signed but not yet ratified the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture, as well as the law establishing the <i>Contr&#244;leur g&#233;n&#233;ral des lieux de 
privation de libert&#233;</i> which will allow visits at any time of  any place where persons are deprived of 
liberty. It asked how France envisages the process of appointing this <i>Contr&#244;leur</i> in order to 
guarantee independence and transparency and ensure prompt, impartial and thorough investigation 
of cases of ill-treatment of detainees, and what measures will be taken to support the <i>Contr&#244;leur</i> in 
his/her  functions in accordance with article 18 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture. Finally, Brazil asked how France assesses the law banning conspicuous religious symbols 
in public schools and its impact on religious pluralism and human rights promotion and protection.  
</p>
<p>36. Qatar requested further information on the efforts, guarantees and measures taken to ensure 
equality and non-discrimination. It also enquired about the experience in promoting and protecting 
human rights while combating terrorism and requested more information on how France has been 
able to strike a balance between the freedom of speech and opinion and the protection of religions 
against defamation. 
</p>
<p>37. India noted the concerns of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief about 
Law 2004-228, and asked for more information regarding France&#8217;s experience in the 
implementation of this law since 2004. It also referred to the independent expert on minority issues 
who noted that France has traditionally not accepted the concept of minority rights and recognition 
of minority groups. India recommended that France actively consider reviewing its position on 
minorities by recognizing and protecting them as minority groups. Pursuant to the recommendation 
of the independent expert on minority issues, India recommended that France actively consider 
undertaking more aggressive strategies to increase the number of people with immigrant heritage in 
the public service, particularly the police, civil service and the judiciary, in order to better reflect 
the broad diversity within France. </p>

 <p> 
38. Bangladesh encouraged France to pay greater attention to the concerns expressed by several 
treaty bodies on the persistence of discriminatory practices, the situation of immigrant women, the 
conditions in detention centres, the treatment of refugees and asylum-seekers, and the behaviour of 
law enforcement agents in dealing with immigrants and minorities. Highlighting that France is 
home to one of the largest immigrant communities, Bangladesh stated that France visibly chooses 
assimilation over integration in engaging immigrants in society, which has negatively affected the 
social values and cultural life of some communities. For example, the prohibition of the Hijab in 
schools did not promote religious freedom, cultural diversity or improve the relationship between 
Muslims with other communities but rather instilled religious intolerance and racial hatred. 
Bangladesh recommended that the Government review the law which prohibits the wearing of 
clothing denoting religious affiliation in schools.<b> </b>While<b> </b>appreciating the measures already taken to 
deal with the increase of trafficking in persons, Bangladesh highlighted that full success depends on 
a concerted effort of all three levels, source, transit and destination, and that the issue of demand at 
the destination, particularly regarding exploitation of women and girls in the sex industry in France, 
must be addressed.  
</p>
<p>39. Mauritania welcomed the appointment in 2007 of the Secretary of State for  Foreign Affairs 
and Human Rights and of the <i>Haut-commissaire aux solidarit&#233;s actives</i>. Mauritania asked for more 
information on the two framework conventions signed on 14 December 2007 to strengthen the 
campaign against discrimination. 
</p>
<p>40. Indonesia requested more information on measures taken regarding the improvement of 
detention facilities and conditions for asylum-seekers, as well as to address the biased treatment of 
immigrants, especially women seeking family reunification. Indonesia enquired about steps taken in 
respect of the recommendations of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe 
that France step up its efforts to combat racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia and that it enforce 
existing legislation more effectively to punish the perpetrators of such acts. With reference to the 
Islamic Human Rights Commission, according to which out of 220,000 cases of discrimination 
which occurred in France in 2006, only 43 were prosecuted, Indonesia asked about progress made 
in this regard and recommended that the Government finalize all outstanding cases of 
discrimination that have occurred since 2006. Citing Amnesty International, Indonesia stated that 
there have been cases of torture, ill-treatment and excessive use of force by law enforcement 
officials, which, together with the discretionary powers of the prosecution, have resulted in many 
ineffective prosecutions. It stated that the setting up of an independent commission is 
recommendable in order to monitor and identify cases of torture and ill-treatment perpetrated by 
law enforcement officials. Indonesia also referred to the Global Initiative to End All Corporal 
Punishment of Children, according to which in France corporal punishment is still lawful in the 
home, and to reports of cases of violence against women, and enquired about plans to improve the 
legislation.  
</p>
<p>41. Sweden noted the poor conditions in places of detention, including overcrowding and ill-
treatment, according to independent reports, recognized efforts made by France to improve them 
and asked whether additional measures are taken to reduce the time frame for such a process. If not, 
Sweden recommended that such measures be considered.   
</p>
<p>42. Concerning minorities, France stressed the gap that exists between law and reality, i.e. how 
the society reacts and how the members of the minorities feel as regards discrimination. The law in 
France does not recognize minorities per se; what the law recognizes are the individual rights of the 
members of the minority groups. It protects individuals belonging to minority groups as other 
persons, prohibits any discrimination, and punishes any infringement to their rights, in the most 
vigorous manner. In addition, France has put in place policies targeting special areas where there is </p>

 <p> 
a need for specific urban planning and policy. France respects diversity at all levels, in politics and 
in society. France has implemented innovative approaches to strengthen diversity, e.g. by 
encouraging access to the highest schools and universities for persons from underprivileged areas, 
or through  an action plan for access to the civil service. The <i>Conseil Sup&#233;rieur de l&#8217;Audiovisuel</i>, 
which is an independent body, has undertaken measures to ensure that the media reflects the 
diversity that prevails in the French society. The promotion of diversity is also reflected in the 
teaching of  regional languages in France. 
</p>
<p>43. The <i>Commission nationale de d&#233;ontologie de la s&#233;curit&#233; </i>is an independent body that can be 
seized by members of Parliament, can call for inquiries and reports once a year to the President. 
France also reiterated the important role of the <i>Contr&#244;leur g&#233;n&#233;ral des lieux de d&#233;tention</i> whose 
mandate is broad and whose independence is protected by the law. France is currently selecting a 
candidate to fill the post and has allocated a budget of 2.5 million euros and 20 staff members to 
this new institution. Regarding concerns raised with regard to impunity forlaw enforcement 
officials, a victim can directly seize the judge who is then obliged to open an inquiry. Victims who 
complain about excessive administrative sanctions applied in prisons can access a lawyer 
remunerated by the State. This type of cases has considerably decreased. Regarding the list of safe 
countries in asylum procedures, the representative of France assured that this list is constantly 
updated. French citizenship is not required to reside in France and 8 per cent of the population who 
lives and works in France are not French. Referring again to the law on religious symbols and its 
impact, France specified that  out of 48 cases, only two persons could not be provided with 
schooling. More than two years after its adoption, ICRMW, France recalled that it has difficulties 
due to the fact that this convention does not distinguish between regular and irregular migration and 
that in any case it applies most of the provisions contained in the convention. France also recalled 
that this issue has to be dealt with at the European level as, since the Amsterdam Treaty, it falls 
within the competence of the European Union.  
</p>
<p>44. Referring to the alarming human rights situation in the administrative detention centre of 
Pamandzi in Mayotte, to the detention of minors, inhuman and degrading treatment, the 
impossibility for detainees to exercise their right to communicate, the absence of the right to health, 
suspensive recourse against administrative measures and of procedural guarantees, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
asked how France plans to reconcile these conditions with the international human rights 
instruments to which it is a party. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire recommended that experiments on detainees with 
electric impulsion weapons provoking acute pain, which can constitute a form of torture, be avoided 
in penitentiaries.  
</p>
<p>45. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed the introduction of a 
new policy for deprived urban areas, and asked whether there is provision for sufficient financing of 
the initiative and whether the measures go far enough in tackling the root causes of inequality and 
discrimination among disadvantaged groups. The United Kingdom welcomed that report of the 
CNCDH indicating that incidents of racist attacks reported to the authorities have decreased 
regularly since 2005, and recommended that France make efforts to enforce existing anti-
discrimination legislation more effectively, and that the Government consider compiling statistics 
on ethnic minority groups, as this would help to assess the extent and causes of inequality and 
evaluate the effectiveness of measures in place to address it. The United Kingdom asked what 
France is doing to ensure that those working in the political and public administration spheres 
reflect the diversity of France as a whole. It urged France to move forward with the appointment of 
a suitable candidate to the post of <i>Contr&#244;leur des lieux privatifs de libert&#233;</i> and asked for more 
information on what it is doing to address overpopulation in prisons, and to modernize its prison 
facilities, particularly with regard to juveniles. The United Kingdom recommended increased </p>

 <p> 
human rights training for law enforcement officials in response to reports of excessive use of force, 
notably in detention centres and holding areas for migrants. 
</p>
<p>46. Chad welcomed the legislation to combat racism, anti-Semitism and discrimination as well 
as the financial support provided to organizations in this area. It noted with satisfaction the 
establishment of a state secretariat for human rights, a high commissioner&#8217;s office for active 
solidarity and the post of human rights ambassador. Chad noted that France is toughening its 
immigration laws, in particular vis-&#224;-vis people from developing countries, especially Africa, and 
that the return <i>manu militari</i> is increasing, which represents a major regression in the field of 
human rights, and asked how France intends to act appropriately in respect for human dignity. 
Despite measures taken in the area of the protection of the rights of the child, Chad stated that 
certain associations have been escaping the oversight of public authorities and breaching the 
elementary rules of law, and in particular the rights of the child; the case of the &#8220;Arche de Zo&#233;&#8221; 
brought to light these failures by the public authorities, and asked what steps are being taken by 
France to prevent such acts from occurring. 
</p>
<p>47. The Islamic Republic of Iran<b> </b>shared concerns expressed by various United Nations human 
rights mechanisms regarding: persistence and worsening of discriminatory practices; the 
unfavourable situation of migrants, especially migrant women, with respect to housing, 
employment and education; existing grave concerns about Law 2004-228 which has mainly 
affected certain religious minorities, notably Muslims, with discriminatory effects and has led to 
violations of freedom of religion and of expression and the right to education; poor detention 
conditions in prisons and in administrative detention centres; incidents of police violence, including 
ill-treatment, particularly against people of non-Western origin, non-citizens and asylum-seekers; 
existence of all forms of violence against women, especially homicides resulting from domestic 
violence; increase in trafficking, particularly of women and girls, and also alarming incidents of 
child pornography and trafficking of children, prostitution and related issues; and allegations of 
cases of torture of individuals with the excuse of anti-terrorist activities. It called on the French 
Government to take the necessary measures to put an end to these incidents of human rights 
violations.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>48. Japan noted that despite many legislative measures to strengthen the fight against racial 
discrimination, the ILO Committee of Experts and CERD have expressed r concern at incidents 
related to racial discrimination, which, in their view, still occur and which are tending to get worse. 
Japan asked what remedies the Government foresees to address this situation. Regarding 
immigration, Japan asked what political measures the Government is taking to ensure the right to 
work and education of immigrants and their families, and regarding deportation of illegal 
immigrants, what considerations are made for families with school-age children . In reference to 
concerns raised by CEDAW and the Committee on the Rights of the Child, Japan enquired about 
measures the Government is taking to combat trafficking in women and children and encouraged 
the Government to consider withdrawing its reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>49. Noting that racism and xenophobia affect all, Guatemala commended France on legislative 
measures taken to strengthen the fight against discrimination, particularly against racial 
discrimination. It asked for more information on the High Authority to Combat Discrimination and 
in favour of equality, regarding its work in practice and whether it is represented throughout the 
French territory. Guatemala also asked how France intends to apply the United Nations Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous People, particularly in overseas territories. Finally, Guatemala 
recommended that France implement the recommendation of CERD to take all preventive measures 
to put an end to racist incidents involving members of security forces or other public officials. </p>

 <p> 
50. Djibouti thanked France for the technical cooperation provided within the framework of the 
<i>Francophonie</i>. Regarding the outburst of violence in suburbs in 2005, Djibouti asked what steps the 
Government has taken to resolve this type of problem. 
</p>
<p>51. Madagascar drew attention to and commended on the training undertaken by the national 
school of magistrates to combat racism, and asked whether acting magistrates received the same 
training, and if not, whether trainings are planned for them as well. It also asked whether in 
practice, violations of human rights guaranteed in international treaties ratified by France can be 
brought to court and applied by such courts, and whether compensation can be provided to victims.  
</p>
<p>52. Haiti noted with satisfaction that the constitutional revision of 2007 enshrines in the 
Constitution the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances and welcomed the adoption of 
legislation concerning the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, prostitution of children and 
child pornography. Haiti expressed concern at violence against women, referring to information 
from Amnesty International that in 2006, 127 women were killed by their partners, and enquired 
about measures taken to address this situation. Haiti also expressed concern at overpopulation of 
prisons and asked how an increase of 22,3 per cent since 2002 could be explained in a country 
where human rights are part of the founding values. Finally, Haiti recommended that France 
intensify its struggle against racism. 
</p>
<p>53. Slovenia<b> </b>drew attention to an increase in the participation of women in Parliament and 
asked how France has achieved this success, as well as about measures it intends to take to improve 
the representation of women in elective office to achieve the ideal of democracy. Further, Slovenia 
asked what France has done so far to ensure a gender perspective during the consultations and 
preparation of the national report. It also asked about the next steps and concrete measures 
envisaged to ensure that the gender perspective is fully integrated, particularly in the outcome of the 
UPR. Slovenia recommended that the gender perspective be systematically and continuously 
integrated in the follow-up to the UPR. 
</p>
<p>54. Noting that the Human Right Committee has called upon France to remove reservations and 
interpretative statements to the ICCPR, the Russian Federation said it would be wise to make a 
similar recommendation in this regard. In reference to the fact that France has historically rejected 
the concept of recognizing minorities and that treaty bodies have recommended that France 
reconsider its position, the Russian Federation recommended that France find effective ways of 
realizing the rights of individuals belonging to ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. Noting the 
concern expressed by some treaty bodies about the absence of information on the implementation of 
treaties in France&#8217;s overseas territories and departments, the Russian Federation recommended that 
the Government include information on the implementation of the treaties in its overseas territories 
in its national reports to treaty bodies on a regular basis.  
</p>
<p>55. Philippines<b> </b>asked what measures France has taken to eliminate occupational segregation and 
to close the wage gap between men and women. It expressed its hope that France continue to 
implement measures to further empower women, including immigrant women. Further, it expressed 
its hope that France continue to build a multicultural and inclusive society with tolerance and 
respect, continue to address issues related to racism and xenophobia, and strengthen the protection 
of the rights of migrants and minorities. 
</p>
<p>56. Despite measures taken with respect to the integration of immigrants, South Africa noted 
that CERD has drawn attention to the situation of immigrant women and requested further 
information on additional measures taken to improve the situation of immigrants in the field of 
housing, employment and education, and to facilitate the social and economic integration of 
immigrant women. South Africa also asked about best practices in facilitating access by individuals </p>

 <p> 
of immigrant origin to employment and recommended that France take effective measures to 
eliminate all forms of discrimination against immigrant women in accessing basic social services.  
</p>
<p>57. Australia welcomed the priority given by France to the investigation and prevention of 
marital violence. It recalled the concern expressed by the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women regarding the lack of a body tasked with documenting violence against women, especially 
homicides resulting from domestic violence. Australia asked for more information about efforts to 
combat violence against women, including domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>58. Responding to questions raised with regard to combating trafficking of women, the 
representative of France noted that it is linked to the issue of prostitution, which is punished. Since 
the adoption of the law in 2003, prison sentences range from seven years to life, and fines from 
45,000 to 2.5 million euros. This law also provides for witness protection programmes granting 
anonymity, mandatory State-funded medical and social protections and accommodations for 
victims, and has been effective in reducing offences related to prostitution and dismantling a 
number of trafficking networks. France clarified its migration policy, which aims at controlling 
immigration and favours the integration of immigrants. France wants to organize legal migration 
with the objective of increasing economic migration from 7 per cent to 50 per cent. This is to be 
done through the <i>Contrat d&#8217;accueil et d&#8217;int&#233;gration,</i> which includes a day training on civic 
information, language training, information on living in France, and, if necessary, social support 
measures which are accessible to all applicants. Over 100,000 contracts were granted in 2007 and 
this implies partnerships with &#8220;sending&#8221; countries and &#8220;opening of France&#8217;s professions as broadly 
as possible.&#8221; Already six partnership contracts were signed with sending countries. Regarding 
shortcomings in the &#8220;Arche de Zo&#233;&#8221; case, France noted that the case is being prosecuted in France. 
Regarding the use of tazers by the police, France stated that they are non-lethal, and only used 
against violent, dangerous individuals. Officers are given special training on use of this weapon, 
particularly based on the principle of proportionality: tazers should never be used for torture, as it 
has been alleged, but exclusively for defence and neutralizing a person if necessary. This weapon 
introduces better proportionality, as it mitigates between the use of a truncheon and a firearm. With 
regard to urban policies for difficult neighbourhoods, they are indeed insufficient and have 
produced unsatisfactory results despite enormous efforts. Millions of euros have been spent to 
renovate sensitive neighbourhoods, participation among cities is widespread and 100,000 public 
housing units are built each year. The situation on the ground is sensitive, and attention must be 
paid to each individual&#8217;s situation. Regarding major illegal immigration in overseas French 
territories, France noted that in Mayotte 30 to 35 per cent of the local population is of immigrant 
origin, most of whom are staying illegally. 50 percent of France&#8217;s expulsions take place in overseas 
territories.  This is explained by the attraction of the better and higher standard of living and social 
protection offered in French overseas territories compared to neighbouring countries. France 
realizes that deplorable conditions exist in Mayotte, regarding housing conditions and and in 
detention centres, and is allocating 18 million euros  to housing reconstruction projects in Mayotte. 
The access to health facilities and counsel remains the same throughout the French territories. 
</p>
<p>59. Regarding the <i>Haute autorit&#233; de lutte contre les discriminations et pour l&#8217;&#233;galit&#233;</i>  (HALDE) 
established in 2005, France noted its independence and the major role it has played in society. 
Praising its effectiveness, the representative of France noted that the HALDE can bring cases to 
courts. France noted that judges do not receive trainings on racism, racial discrimination and 
religious issues.  Regarding prison conditions, France noted that the situation is an anomaly, but 
that France is currently correcting the situation. In that context the Head of Delegation compared 
France&#8217;s detention statistics (95 per 100,000) to that of other neighbouring countries (140 per 
100,000) France is therefore on the lower edge of the European average regarding the number of  </p>

 <p> 
detainees, and he  reiterated that France will continue to upgrade to renovate its centres at a rapid 
pace.

<p><b>III.  VOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS OF THE STATE UNDER REVIEW</b> 
</p>
<p>63. In its opening statement and during the interactive dialogue, France made the following 
voluntary commitments: 
</p>
<p>1. To organize an annual meeting with civil society representatives in the field of 
human rights to prepare main international events; 
</p>
<p>2. To seize the CNCDH as often as possible in the context of law-making so that it 
efficiently assumes its advisory role; 
</p>
<p>3. To associate the CNCDH in the follow-up to the recommendations made by the

periodic reports for the human rights treaty bodies; 
</p>
<p>4. To consider the establishment without delay of an inter-ministerial mechanism that 
would meet regularly, notably in view to examine, in cooperation with the CNCDH, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the follow-up to the recommendations made by human rights treaty bodies and 
competent national institutions; 
</p>

Related Intolerance; 
</p>
<p>7. To submit to Parliament, for early ratification, the Convention on the Rights of
