<p><b>  Report of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights on the question

<p><b>  Note by the Secretary-General

<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In the present report, which covers the period from 1 December 2013 to 30 
</p>
<p>November 2014, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>highlights the concerns voiced by international and regional human rights mechanisms at 
</p>
<p>factors and difficulties impeding the implementation of international human rights 
</p>
<p>standards on the whole island owing to the protracted conflict. It gives an overview of 
</p>
<p>specific human rights concerns in Cyprus, including with regard to the right to life and the 
</p>
<p>question of missing persons, the principle of non-discrimination, freedom of movement, 
</p>
<p>property rights, freedom of religion and cultural rights, freedom of opinion and expression 
</p>
<p>and the right to education. Moreover, it provides an update on activities conducted to 
</p>
<p>promote the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), in which the 
</p>
<p>Council called upon all actors involved to adopt a gender perspective when negotiating and 
</p>
<p>implementing peace agreements. 
</p>
<p> The Office of the High Commissioner notes some positive developments witnessed 
</p>
<p>during the period under review, including progress in the identification and return of the 
</p>
<p>remains of missing persons, an improved climate of interreligious communication and 
</p>
<p>cooperation and progress in conservation works of cultural heritage sites on the whole 
</p>
<p>island. The persisting division, however, still hinders the full enjoyment, in mutual 
</p>
<p>confidence by the whole population of Cyprus, of all human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms. The Office concludes that human rights do not have any borders and that all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders are thus obliged to uphold the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all 
</p>
<p>people. It reiterates the importance of addressing all human rights protection gaps and the 
</p>
<p>underlying human rights issues in situations of protracted conflict.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report was prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) pursuant to Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>resolutions 4 (XXXI), 4 (XXXII) and 1987/50, and Human Rights Council decision 2/102.1<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. As at 30 November 2014, Cyprus remained divided, with a buffer zone maintained 
</p>
<p>by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).2 In its resolution 2168 
</p>
<p>(2014), the Security Council welcomed the resumption of negotiations and the joint 
</p>
<p>declaration adopted by the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders on 11 February 
</p>
<p>2014, and the cross-visits of the Chief Negotiators to Ankara and Athens, and expressed its 
</p>
<p>support for the ongoing efforts of the leaders and negotiators to reach a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>settlement as soon as possible. The Council noted, however, that the move towards a more 
</p>
<p>results-oriented phase of negotiations had not yet resulted in an enduring, comprehensive 
</p>
<p>and just settlement based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, as set 
</p>
<p>out in relevant Council resolutions. It therefore encouraged the parties to intensify the 
</p>
<p>substantive negotiations on the unresolved core issues interdependently, stressing that the 
</p>
<p>status quo was unsustainable.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>3. During the period under review, from 1 December 2013 to 30 November 2014, 
</p>
<p>substantive negotiations on a comprehensive settlement in Cyprus, interrupted since late 
</p>
<p>March 2012, resumed. Following the appointment by the Greek Cypriot leader, Nicos 
</p>
<p>Anastasiades, of a new Greek Cypriot negotiator in September 2013, the sides engaged in 
</p>
<p>intensive negotiations on the text of a joint declaration to mark the re-launch of full-fledged 
</p>
<p>negotiations. The joint declaration, adopted on 11 February 2014, constituted an important 
</p>
<p>achievement in that it reaffirmed the basis of the talks and the parameters of a federal 
</p>
<p>solution. It also enshrined the leaders&#8217; commitment to engage in structured, results-oriented 
</p>
<p>negotiations. The joint declaration was welcomed by the Secretary-General in a statement 
</p>
<p>made on 11 February 2014 and by the Security Council in its resolution 2168 (2014). On 
</p>
<p>27 February 2014, the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot negotiators undertook cross-
</p>
<p>visits to Ankara and Athens, respectively, the first exchange of this type in the Cyprus 
</p>
<p>peace talks.  
</p>
<p>4. Following a screening phase from February to April 2014, during which positions 
</p>
<p>on all chapters of the negotiations were assessed, the sides tabled concrete proposals on all 
</p>
<p>issues. This &#8220;second phase&#8221; was concluded on 24 July. On 22 August, the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General appointed Espen Barth Eide of Norway as his new Special Adviser on Cyprus. 
</p>
<p>During the first leaders&#8217; meeting chaired by the Special Adviser on 17 September 2014, 
</p>
<p>the leaders agreed that the second phase of the negotiations had been concluded and that 
</p>
<p>the sides would move to the next phase of structured negotiations. Accordingly, the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 For an overview of resolutions on the question of human rights in Cyprus, see A/HRC/22/18, paras. 
</p>
<p>1-4.  
</p>
<p> 2 UNFICYP was established pursuant to Security Council resolution 186 (1964) to prevent a recurrence 
</p>
<p>of fighting between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities on the island and bring 
</p>
<p>about a return to normal conditions. Its responsibilities were expanded in 1974 following a coup 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;&#233;tat by elements favouring union with Greece and a subsequent military intervention by Turkey, 
</p>
<p>whose troops established control over the northern part of the island. Since the de facto ceasefire in 
</p>
<p>August 1974, UNFICYP has supervised the ceasefire lines, provided humanitarian assistance and 
</p>
<p>maintained a buffer zone between the Turkish and the Turkish Cypriot forces in the north and the 
</p>
<p>Greek Cypriot forces in the south (see also www.unficyp.org). </p>


<p>leaders instructed their negotiators to increase the pace of meetings with a view to 
</p>
<p>bridging the gaps on unresolved core issues. 
</p>
<p>5. On 6 October 2014, the Greek Cypriot side suspended its participation in the talks 
</p>
<p>following the announcement by Turkey that it would undertake a seismic survey in the 
</p>
<p>Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus. Efforts are under way to secure the resumption of 
</p>
<p>negotiations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Challenges for the implementation of international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights standards in a protracted conflict  
</b></p>
<p>6. Various United Nations human rights mechanisms have voiced their concern at the 
</p>
<p>factors and difficulties impeding the implementation of international human rights 
</p>
<p>standards on the whole island due to the protracted conflict. In this regard, United Nations 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies, the special procedures and the Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
</p>
<p>Review addressed their questions to and made recommendations for Cyprus, Turkey and 
</p>
<p>the de facto authorities in the northern part of the island.  
</p>
<p>7. In its list of issues in relation to the fourth periodic report of Cyprus, adopted in July 
</p>
<p>2014, the Human Rights Committee asked the Government to indicate the measures taken 
</p>
<p>to avoid a human rights protection gap resulting from the protracted conflict in both the 
</p>
<p>northern and southern parts of the island.3 
</p>
<p>8. In his report submitted to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-fifth session, in 
</p>
<p>March 2014, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief noted an apparent 
</p>
<p>improved climate of interreligious communication and cooperation in Cyprus that he 
</p>
<p>witnessed during the ground-breaking interreligious round tables held in Nicosia in 
</p>
<p>September 2013.4 In October and November 2014, the Special Rapporteur collected input 
</p>
<p>in the context of his follow-up procedure on steps taken to implement his conclusions and 
</p>
<p>recommendations made to the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, the de facto 
</p>
<p>authorities in the northern part of the island and other stakeholders following his mission in 
</p>
<p>2012.5 
</p>
<p>9. The two summaries prepared by OHCHR for the second universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>of Cyprus, which included summaries of stakeholders&#8217; submissions, both contained 
</p>
<p>chapters on human rights issues in the northern part of the island.6 During the meeting of 
</p>
<p>the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review on 4 February 2014, Portugal 
</p>
<p>recommended that the Government of Cyprus further develop projects concerning relations 
</p>
<p>between different religious and ethnic communities in line with relevant recommendations 
</p>
<p>of the Special Rapporteur.7 The Government accepted the recommendation in June 2014, 
</p>
<p>stating that Cyprus fully supported the work of the Special Rapporteur and ongoing 
</p>
<p>interreligious dialogue in Cyprus.8 
</p>
<p>10. Declarations and reservations to international human rights treaties may also 
</p>
<p>negatively affect the protection of all persons living in a territory marked by a protracted 
</p>
<p>conflict. For example, upon ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 CCPR/C/CYP/Q/4, para. 2. 
</p>
<p> 4 A/HRC/25/58, para. 44. 
</p>
<p> 5 A/HRC/22/51/Add.1, paras. 74-94.  
</p>
<p> 6 A/HRC/WG.6/18/CYP/2, paras. 71 &#8211; 74; A/HRC/WG.6/18/CYP/3, paras. 66 &#8211; 68. 
</p>
<p> 7 A/HRC/26/14, para. 114.73. 
</p>
<p> 8 A/HRC/26/14/Add.1, paras. 53 &#8211; 54. </p>


<p>of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Turkey declared that it would implement the 
</p>
<p>provisions of the Convention &#8220;only to the States parties with which it has diplomatic 
</p>
<p>relations&#8221;. It added that it ratified the Convention exclusively &#8220;with regard to the national 
</p>
<p>territory where the Constitution and the legal and administrative order of the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Turkey are applied.&#8221; Furthermore, it made the reservation that it did not consider itself 
</p>
<p>bound by article 22 of the Convention. &#8220;The explicit consent of the Republic of Turkey is 
</p>
<p>necessary in each individual case before any dispute to which the Republic of Turkey is 
</p>
<p>party concerning the interpretation or application of this Convention may be referred to the 
</p>
<p>International Court of Justice.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>11. In its combined fourth to sixth periodic reports to the Committee on the Elimination 
</p>
<p>of Racial Discrimination, received on 10 February 2014, the Government of Turkey 
</p>
<p>expressed the view that its declarations and reservation were permissible under 
</p>
<p>international law and compatible with the object and purpose of the Convention.9 This was 
</p>
<p>in reference to the concluding observations of the Committee made at its seventy-fourth 
</p>
<p>session, when it had noted that the reservation to article 22 and the two declarations on the 
</p>
<p>implementation and the territorial applicability of the Convention made by Turkey upon 
</p>
<p>ratification could affect the full implementation of the Convention, and encouraged Turkey 
</p>
<p>to consider withdrawing its reservation and declarations, including removal of the territorial 
</p>
<p>limitation to the application of the Convention.10 With regard to similarly worded 
</p>
<p>declarations made by Turkey at the time of ratification of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights, the Human Rights Committee expressed concern in its 
</p>
<p>concluding observations adopted at its 106th session, and stressed that Turkey should 
</p>
<p>ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction and effective control were afforded the full 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the rights enshrined in the Covenant.11 As emphasized by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee in its general comment No. 31, &#8220;a State party must respect and ensure the rights 
</p>
<p>laid down [in international human rights treaties] to anyone within the power or effective 
</p>
<p>control of that State party, even if not situated within the territory of the State party.&#8221;12 
</p>
<p><b> III. Specific human rights concerns 
</b></p>
<p>12. The persisting division of Cyprus continues to have consequences on human rights 
</p>
<p>throughout the whole island, including (a) the right to life and the question of missing 
</p>
<p>persons; (b) the principle of non-discrimination; (c) freedom of movement; (d) property 
</p>
<p>rights; (e) freedom of religion and cultural rights; (f) freedom of opinion and expression; 
</p>
<p>and (g) the right to education. In addition, it is important that a gender perspective be 
</p>
<p>adopted when negotiating and implementing peace agreements (see paras. 47 &#8211; 51 below). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to life and the question of missing persons 
</b></p>
<p>13. According to article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
</p>
<p>the right to life, liberty and security of person. Furthermore, article 1 of the Declaration on 
</p>
<p>the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance provides that any act of 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity, placing the persons subjected 
</p>
<p>thereto outside the protection of the law and inflicting severe suffering on them and their 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 CERD/C/TUR/4-6, para. 4.  
</p>
<p> 10 CERD/C/TUR/CO/3, para. 8. 
</p>
<p> 11 CCPR/C/TUR/CO/1, para. 5. 
</p>
<p> 12 CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, para. 10. See also A/HRC/22/18, para. 10, and A/HRC/25/21, para. 11.  </p>


<p>families; any act of enforced disappearance also violates or constitutes a grave threat to the 
</p>
<p>right to life.  
</p>
<p>14. As a result of the inter-communal fighting in 1963 and 1964, and of the events of 
</p>
<p>July 1974 and afterwards, a total of 1,508 Greek Cypriots and 493 Turkish Cypriots have 
</p>
<p>been officially reported as missing by both communities to the Committee on Missing 
</p>
<p>Persons in Cyprus. During the period under review, the Committee continued its 
</p>
<p>bicommunal project on the exhumation, identification and return of the remains of missing 
</p>
<p>persons. As at 30 November 2014, the remains of 1,105 individuals had been exhumed on 
</p>
<p>both sides of the buffer zone by the Committee&#8217;s bicommunal teams of archaeologists; of 
</p>
<p>these, the remains of 636 missing individuals had been identified and returned to their 
</p>
<p>respective families, including 159 in 2014, the highest annual number ever. At the 
</p>
<p>beginning of the year, the Committee made a major recovery with the exhumation of the 
</p>
<p>remains of 35 persons in a quarry near Limassol. 
</p>
<p>15. In its resolution 2168 (2014), the Security Council welcomed all efforts to 
</p>
<p>accommodate the exhumation requirements of the Committee on Missing Persons in 
</p>
<p>Cyprus, and called upon all parties to provide full access to all areas expeditiously, given 
</p>
<p>the need to intensify the Committee&#8217;s work. In February and March 2014, the Committee 
</p>
<p>excavated a military site in the north of Nicosia. In September 2014, authorization to 
</p>
<p>excavate a second military area was given by the Turkish Forces. As the area had been 
</p>
<p>declared a mine field by Turkish Cypriot authorities, a mine survey was conducted in 
</p>
<p>October 2014, during which no mines were found. Excavations were ongoing at the end of 
</p>
<p>the period under review.13  
</p>
<p>16. With regard to Greek Cypriot victims, the European Court of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>delivered its judgement in the inter-State case of <i>Cyprus</i> v. <i>Turkey</i> (application No. 
</p>
<p>25781/94) (just satisfaction) on 12 May 2014. The Court held, by 16 votes to one, that the 
</p>
<p>passage of time since the delivery of the principal judgement of 10 May 2001 had not 
</p>
<p>rendered the just satisfaction claims of the Government of Cyprus inadmissible. With 
</p>
<p>regard to the question of missing persons, it held, by 15 votes to two, that the Government 
</p>
<p>of Turkey was to pay the Government of Cyprus, within three months, 30 million euros for 
</p>
<p>non-pecuniary damage suffered by the relatives of the missing persons, and that this 
</p>
<p>amount should be distributed to the individual victims, under the supervision of the 
</p>
<p>Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (which supervises the execution of 
</p>
<p>judgements of the European Court of Human Rights). 
</p>
<p>17. In reaction, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey observed, 
</p>
<p>on 12 May 2014, that the judgement went &#8220;against the realities of Cyprus&#8221;, was unfair, 
</p>
<p>contained &#8220;errors and inconsistencies&#8221;, was &#8220;deprived of a legal basis&#8221; and lacked &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>capacity of being implemented under the conditions in which the Cyprus question continues 
</p>
<p>to be unsettled.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>18. The Committee of Ministers instructed the Secretariat of the Council of Europe to 
</p>
<p>present a general stocktaking of the different violations established by the Court, as well as 
</p>
<p>an analysis of the impact of the judgement of 12 May 2014 on just satisfaction, in good 
</p>
<p>time for examination by the Committee at its 1214th meeting.14  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 13 Information received from the Secretariat of the Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus. 
</p>
<p> 14 Council of Europe Committee of Ministers, decisions adopted at the 1201st meeting on 5 June 2014 
</p>
<p>(CM/Del/OJ/DH(2014)1201/19) on the case of <i>Cyprus v.</i> <i>Turkey</i>.  </p>


<p>19. On 25 September 2014, the Committee of Ministers deplored the fact that, despite an 
</p>
<p>interim resolution adopted on the case of <i>Varnava and Others</i> v. <i>Turkey</i>,15 in which the 
</p>
<p>Court found there had been a violation of the right to life and established the need for an 
</p>
<p>effective investigation, the Turkish authorities had not complied with their obligation to pay 
</p>
<p>the amounts awarded by the Court (see also para. 35 below).16<i>.</i> 
</p>
<p>20. With regard to Turkish Cypriot victims, on 11 March 2014, in <i>G&#252;rtekin and Others</i> 
</p>
<p>v. <i>Cyprus</i>, the Court declared inadmissible three applications of relatives of men who had 
</p>
<p>disappeared during inter-communal conflicts in 1963-1964, and whose bodies had been 
</p>
<p>found during the exhumation programme of the Committee on Missing Persons. Although 
</p>
<p>the applicants argued that the Government&#8217;s investigation was ineffective, the Court did not 
</p>
<p>find an infringement of the minimum standard required under article 2 of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>The Court acknowledged the applicant&#8217;s frustration that potential suspects had been 
</p>
<p>questioned, and that apparently no further steps were going to be taken, but stressed that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;article 2 cannot be interpreted so as to impose a requirement on the authorities to launch a 
</p>
<p>prosecution irrespective of the evidence which is available.&#8221;17 The applicants also argued 
</p>
<p>that the decision of holding the evidence insufficient to justify a prosecution should have 
</p>
<p>been submitted for decision by a court; the judges of the European Court of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>stated, however, that it was not for them &#8220;to micro-manage the functioning of, and 
</p>
<p>procedures applied in, criminal investigative and justice systems in Contracting States 
</p>
<p>which may well vary in their approach and policies.&#8221;18 
</p>
<p>21. The approach taken by the European Court of Human Rights in <i>G&#252;rtekin</i> contrasts 
</p>
<p>with the concluding observations of the Committee against Torture on the fourth periodic 
</p>
<p>report of Cyprus, adopted on 21 May 2014. While welcoming the fact that the Attorney 
</p>
<p>General had opened some criminal investigations as a result of the identification of remains 
</p>
<p>by the Committee on Missing Persons, the Committee against Torture noted that some 
</p>
<p>relatives of missing persons had not been given the opportunity to challenge the acts or 
</p>
<p>omissions of the investigating authorities in court.19 The Committee against Torture 
</p>
<p>recommended that Cyprus redouble its efforts to guarantee the relatives of missing persons 
</p>
<p>identified by the Committee on Missing Persons receive appropriate redress, including the 
</p>
<p>means for psychological rehabilitation, compensation and satisfaction, and for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the right to truth. In its general comment No. 3, the Committee against 
</p>
<p>Torture emphasized that a State&#8217;s failure to investigate, criminally prosecute or allow civil 
</p>
<p>proceedings related to allegations of acts of torture in a prompt manner may constitute a de 
</p>
<p>facto denial of redress and thus constitute a violation of its obligations under article 14 of 
</p>
<p>the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>Punishment.20 The Committee also recalled that judicial remedies must always be available 
</p>
<p>to victims, as should all evidence concerning acts of torture or ill-treatment upon the 
</p>
<p>request of victims, their legal counsel or a judge.21 It noted that the mandate of the 
</p>
<p>bicommunal Committee on Missing Persons was limited to looking into cases of Cypriots 
</p>
<p>reported missing, without attempting &#8220;to attribute responsibility for the deaths of any 
</p>
<p>missing persons or make findings as to the cause of such deaths&#8221;,22 and that the Committee 
</p>
<p>on Missing Persons was also not empowered to grant redress to the relatives of the missing 
</p>
<p>persons. 
</p>
<p>22. In August and September 2014, the European Court of Human Rights handed down 
</p>
<p>decisions of inadmissibility in three cases regarding Turkish Cypriots who had disappeared 
</p>
<p>during the events in 1963-64 and 1974. The cases, which had all been lodged by relatives 
</p>
<p>who complained about the ineffectiveness of the investigations by the government 
</p>
<p>authorities, were rejected as the Court considered the complaints to be premature, given that 
</p>
<p>investigations were under way.23 
</p>
<p><b> B. Non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>23. According to article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, all are equal 
</p>
<p>before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law.24 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, all are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of 
</p>
<p>the Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination. 
</p>
<p>24. As at March 2014, there were as many as 212,400 internally displaced persons living 
</p>
<p>in the part of the island controlled by the Government of Cyprus, including children born in 
</p>
<p>displacement.25 When compared with previous years, the number of internally displaced 
</p>
<p>persons remained more or less unchanged. In July 2014, the Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>asked the Government of Cyprus to indicate the measures taken to ensure that children of 
</p>
<p>women with internally displaced status are given the same status and benefits as children of 
</p>
<p>men with internally displaced status, including with regard to voting rights, social benefits 
</p>
<p>and housing assistance.26 Part of the relevant legislation was amended in December 2013, 
</p>
<p>resulting in the recognition of displaced person status for the children of female displaced 
</p>
<p>persons; however, the amendment applies only to certain housing schemes and benefits and 
</p>
<p>does not give access to the same voting rights awarded to children of male displaced

<p>persons to participate in elections for Greek Cypriot candidates at the 
</p>
<p>village/district/municipality level in the north of the island. 
</p>
<p>25. During the period under review, UNFICYP continued to address the living 
</p>
<p>conditions and well-being of Greek Cypriots and Maronites residing in the north, and by 
</p>
<p>Turkish Cypriots residing in the south, including through home visits and liaison with local 
</p>
<p>authorities to ensure access to health and welfare support. In its report covering 
</p>
<p>developments from 16 December to 20 June 2014, UNFICYP noted that, despite the 
</p>
<p>concerns repeatedly voiced about the deteriorating health of elderly Greek Cypriots and 
</p>
<p>Maronites in the north, the requests for Greek-speaking doctors to treat these patients were 
</p>
<p>yet to be addressed.27 However, UNFICYP noted improvements late in the period under 
</p>
<p>review with two health-care workers providing care to Greek Cypriots in the north.  
</p>
<p>26. With regard to discrimination of Greek Cypriot residents of the Karpas peninsula, 
</p>
<p>the European Court of Human Rights held on 12 May 2014, by 15 votes to two, that the 
</p>
<p>Government of Turkey was to pay the Government of Cyprus, within three months, 60 
</p>
<p>million euros in respect of non-pecuniary damage suffered by the enclaved Greek Cypriot 
</p>
<p>residents of the Karpas peninsula, and that this amount should be distributed by the 
</p>
<p>Government of Cyprus to the individual victims under the supervision of the Committee of 
</p>
<p>Ministers within 18 months from the date of that payment or within any other period 
</p>
<p>considered appropriate by the Committee of Ministers. The Court emphasized that &#8220;there is 
</p>
<p>no doubt about the protracted feelings of helplessness, distress and anxiety of the Karpas 
</p>
<p>residents whose rights under Articles 3, 8, 9, 10 and 13 of the [European] Convention and 
</p>
<p>of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 have been violated as found in the principal judgment&#8221; (See 
</p>
<p>also para. 16 above).28  
</p>
<p>27. With regard to Turkish Cypriots residing in the south, during the meeting of the 
</p>
<p>Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review of Cyprus on 4 February 2014, measures 
</p>
<p>were suggested to enable Turkish Cypriots to participate effectively in cultural, social and 
</p>
<p>economic life and public affairs. Concern was expressed about reports of racially motivated 
</p>
<p>verbal abuse, as well as attacks against, inter alia, Turkish Cypriots.29 In July 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Committee asked the Government of Cyprus to indicate measures taken to 
</p>
<p>prevent and combat discrimination against Turkish Cypriots, to investigate all allegations of 
</p>
<p>racially motivated verbal abuse and physical attacks &#8211; including the setting on fire of the 
</p>
<p>Koprulu Haci Ibrahim Aga Mosque in Limassol &#8211; and to prosecute and punish, as 
</p>
<p>appropriate, those responsible and to provide reparation to victims.30 
</p>
<p>28. The Human Rights Committee also asked the Government of Cyprus to provide 
</p>
<p>information on the legislative and policy measures adopted to ensure the right of Turkish 
</p>
<p>Cypriots to vote and be elected in municipal, national, European and presidential elections. 
</p>
<p>In this context, the Committee also asked for specific information on the allegations that a 
</p>
<p>significant number of Turkish Cypriots were unable to vote in the European Parliament 
</p>
<p>elections held on 25 May 2014 because their correct residential address had not been 
</p>
<p>entered in the government database.31

<p> 31 Ibid., para. 26. </p>


<p><b> C. Freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>29. According to article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
</p>
<p>the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State, as well as 
</p>
<p>the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.32  
</p>
<p>30. In Cyprus, however, crossings between the northern and the southern parts of the 
</p>
<p>island are still possible only through (currently seven) official crossing points, a situation 
</p>
<p>that obviously limits the freedom of movement. Between 1 December 2013 and 31 October 
</p>
<p>2014, UNFICYP reported more than 1,370,000 official crossings through the buffer zone. 
</p>
<p>The Committee on Crossings, which was tasked by the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish 
</p>
<p>Cypriot leaders to reach an agreement on new crossing points, did not meet during the 
</p>
<p>period under review; despite the engagement of UNFICYP with both sides, their positions 
</p>
<p>on the location of any new crossing points remained irreconcilable. In this regard, in July 
</p>
<p>2014, the Human Rights Committee asked for information on steps taken by the 
</p>
<p>Government of Cyprus to reach an agreement with Turkish Cypriot leaders on new crossing 
</p>
<p>points, and to provide information about the meetings of the Committee on Crossings since 
</p>
<p>December 2010.33  
</p>
<p>31. In its concluding observations on Cyprus, the Committee against Torture was 
</p>
<p>concerned by information about obstacles that impeded Turkish Cypriot prisoners detained 
</p>
<p>in the southern part of the island receiving visits from family and friends.34 Furthermore, in 
</p>
<p>July 2014, the Human Rights Committee asked the Government of Cyprus for information 
</p>
<p>about restrictions on crossing the Green Line that have been imposed on settlers from 
</p>
<p>Turkey and their descendants, who were born in the northern part of the island, which are 
</p>
<p>de facto hindrances to their undertaking pilgrimages and visiting Turkish Cypriot prisoners 
</p>
<p>held in the southern part of the island.35  
</p>
<p>32. In its tenth report on the implementation of the Green Line Regulation (EC) No. 
</p>
<p>866/2004, the European Commission noted an increase in the number of both Greek 
</p>
<p>Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots crossing the Green Line in 2013 when compared with 
</p>
<p>previous years. The Commission stated that the vast majority of the crossings had taken 
</p>
<p>place smoothly, with fewer incidents reported than in 2012, but that they remained a source 
</p>
<p>of concern to the Turkish Cypriot community.36 Furthermore, with UNFICYP support, 
</p>
<p>important steps were taken to facilitate the practice of religious worship, and religious 
</p>
<p>leaders benefited from easier crossing possibilities in both directions.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Property rights 
</b></p>
<p>33. According to article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
</p>
<p>the right to own property alone as well as in association with others, and no one is to be 
</p>
<p>arbitrarily deprived of his property.

<p> 36 Report from the Commission to the Council, COM(2014) 280 final, pp. 2-4. </p>


<p>34. With regard to property claims in the northern part of the island, as at 30 November 
</p>
<p>2014, a total of 6,045 applications had been lodged with the Immovable Property 
</p>
<p>Commission (www.tamk.gov.ct.tr) since its establishment, of which 589 were concluded 
</p>
<p>through friendly settlements and 13 through formal hearings. The Commission has paid a 
</p>
<p>total of &#163;182,740,348 to the applicants as compensation. Moreover, the Commission ruled 
</p>
<p>for exchange and compensation in two cases, for restitution in one case, and for restitution 
</p>
<p>and compensation in five cases. In one case, it delivered a decision for restitution after the 
</p>
<p>settlement of the Cyprus issue, and in another case it ruled for partial restitution. 
</p>
<p>35.  With regard to payment of just satisfaction in property cases, on 25 September 
</p>
<p>2014, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe deplored the fact that, despite 
</p>
<p>interim resolutions adopted with regard to the <i>Xenides-Arestis</i> case<i>,</i>37 the Turkish 
</p>
<p>authorities had not complied with their obligation to pay amounts awarded in that case, or 
</p>
<p>the 32 other cases in the <i>Xenides-Arestis</i> group, on the grounds that the payment could not 
</p>
<p>be dissociated from the measures of substance. The Committee recalled that it had stressed, 
</p>
<p>in two letters addressed to its Turkish counterpart (sent respectively in October 2009, in the 
</p>
<p>case of <i>Xenides-Arestis</i>, and in April 2014, for all cases), that the obligation to comply with 
</p>
<p>the judgements of the European Court of Human Rights was unconditional. The Committee 
</p>
<p>adopted an interim resolution in which it declared that the continual refusal by Turkey to 
</p>
<p>pay was in flagrant conflict with its international obligations, and exhorted it to review its 
</p>
<p>position and to pay the just satisfaction and interest without further delay.38 
</p>
<p>36. In its judgement of 12 May 2014 on <i>Cyprus</i> v. <i>Turkey</i>, the European Court of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights pronounced itself on the application submitted by the Government of Cyprus 
</p>
<p>for a &#8220;declaratory judgement&#8221; regarding the property rights of displaced persons. The Court 
</p>
<p>recalled that it had found a continuing violation of article 1 of Protocol 1 to the European 
</p>
<p>Convention on Human Rights, as Greek Cypriot owners of property in northern Cyprus 
</p>
<p>were being denied access to and control, use and enjoyment of their property, as well as any 
</p>
<p>compensation for interference with their property rights. It also found that Turkey had not 
</p>
<p>yet complied with the holding, and that any possible permission of, participation, 
</p>
<p>acquiescence or otherwise complicity in any unlawful sale or exploitation of Greek Cypriot 
</p>
<p>homes and property in the northern part of Cyprus could not be consistent with 
</p>
<p>compliance.39  
</p>
<p><b> E. Freedom of religion and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>37. According to article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
</p>
<p>the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, which includes freedom to change 
</p>
<p>his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public 
</p>
<p>or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.40 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 37 Interim resolutions CM/ResDH(2008)99 and CM/ResDH(2010)33, adopted respectively in 2008 and 
</p>
<p>2010 in the case of <i>Xenides-Arestis</i> v.<i> Turkey </i>(application no. 46347/99), judgements of 22 December 
</p>
<p>2005 and of 7 December 2006. 
</p>
<p> 38 Council of Europe Committee of Ministers&#8217; Deputies, interim resolution adopted at the 1208th 
</p>
<p>meeting on 25 September 2014 (CM/ResDH(2014) 185) on the cases of <i>Varnava and Others </i>v. 
</p>
<p><i>Turkey </i>and <i>Xenides-Aristis</i> group. See also Council of Europe Committee of Ministers&#8217; Deputies, 
</p>

</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief (General

<p>Furthermore, according to article 27, everyone has the right freely to participate in the 
</p>
<p>cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts as well as to share in scientific 
</p>
<p>advancement and its benefits.41 
</p>
<p>38. While many of the more than 500 churches and Christian monuments in the north 
</p>
<p>and the 100 mosques in the south remain out of reach for many worshippers, some progress 
</p>
<p>was made during the period under review, when more Greek Cypriots were able to worship 
</p>
<p>in previously inaccessible sites than ever before. Whereas no new sites were opened for 
</p>
<p>worship in the previous period under review, between 1 December 2013 and 30 November 
</p>
<p>2014 the Turkish Cypriot authorities approved visits to at least 11 new sites in the north: 
</p>
<p>Ayios Georgios Xorinos in Famagusta; Panagia Theotokou in Trachoni; Ayios 
</p>
<p>Charalambos in Kontea; Church of Saint George in Kyrenia; Church of Ayios Georgios in 
</p>
<p>Exo Metochi; the Armenian Church of the Virgin Mary in Nicosia; the Maronite Church of 
</p>
<p>Ayios Antonis; Ayios Ioannis Prodromos in Gypsou; Panagia Evangelistria in Gerolakkos; 
</p>
<p>the Church of Ayios Georgios in Vatili; and Archangel Michael in Koma tou Yialou. With 
</p>
<p>the agreement of the religious leaders, UNFICYP facilitated arrangements for the crossing 
</p>
<p>of 914 pilgrims on 29 July 2014, and for 955 pilgrims on 22 November 2014, to Hala 
</p>
<p>Sultan Tekke Mosque in the south. On 30 November 2014, Saint Andrews Day, 
</p>
<p>approximately 1,000 pilgrims travelled to the north to pray at Apostolos Andreas 
</p>
<p>monastery. 
</p>
<p>39.  Religious leaders, including the Greek Orthodox Archbishop and the Mufti of 
</p>
<p>Cyprus, with the support of the Office of the Religious Track of the Cyprus Peace Process 
</p>
<p>under the auspices of the Embassy of Sweden, intensified efforts during the period under 
</p>
<p>review. On 26 February 2014, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop, the Mufti, the Maronite 
</p>
<p>Archbishop, the Armenian Archbishop and the Patriarchal Latin Vicar in Cyprus issued a 
</p>
<p>joint statement in which they welcomed the political leaders&#8217; expressed determination to 
</p>
<p>resume negotiations in a results-oriented manner, and stressed that religion was still a 
</p>
<p>victim of the protracted conflict.42 In March 2014, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop, on the 
</p>
<p>invitation of the Mufti, officially crossed to the north for the first time ever to participate in 
</p>
<p>a joint interreligious press conference hosted by the Office of the Religious Track. On 13 
</p>
<p>March 2014, in Geneva, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief 
</p>
<p>participated in a side event of the twenty-fifth session of the Human Rights Council on the 
</p>
<p>theme &#8220;Fostering interreligious communication&#8221; together with Christian and Muslim 
</p>
<p>leaders from Cyprus, which was hailed as a historic moment by several speakers. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur emphasized on that occasion that interreligious dialogue was certainly 
</p>
<p>not a luxury, and that the current moves and practical results in Cyprus were quite 
</p>
<p>remarkable. In June 2014, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop welcomed the Mufti in his first-
</p>
<p>ever visit to all mosques in Nicosia, during which the Mosque of Tahtakale was opened for 
</p>
<p>prayer for the first time since 1963. In October 2014, he hosted the Mufti in Paphos for a 
</p>
<p>two-day visit, during which Turkish Cypriots came to pray at the Mosque of Agia Sophia, 
</p>
<p>open for the first time since 1974. 
</p>
<p>40. Between 1 December 2013 and 30 November 2014, UNFICYP facilitated 67 
</p>
<p>religious and commemorative events involving more than 24,000 individuals, which either 
</p>
<p>were held in or required crossing of the buffer zone. During the period under review, 
</p>
<p>however, the Turkish Cypriot authorities did not approve several requests to hold religious 
</p>
<p>services in the northern part of the island, for example at the Greek Orthodox Churches of 
</p>
<p>Saint. George of Xalona in Kato Zodia, Saint George in Vathylakas, Saint George in 
</p>

</p>
<p>addition, the religious service at the reopened Maronite chapel of Saint Antonis in Kythrea 
</p>
<p>was interrupted on 31 May 2014. A request for a service at the Panayia Pergaminiotissa 
</p>
<p>Church in Akanthou on 5 September 2014 was cancelled despite having been initially 
</p>
<p>approved. 
</p>
<p>41. The bicommunal Technical Committee on Cultural Heritage, in partnership with the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), pursued its surveys, designs, emergency 
</p>
<p>measures and conservation works of cultural heritage sites on the whole island. Surveys, 
</p>
<p>investigations and conservation project designs are being completed for the Agios 
</p>
<p>Panteleimonas Monastery in Myrtou/Mirti/&#199;aml&#305;bel, the Walls between Othello and 
</p>
<p>Arsenal, the Ravelin/Land Gate and the Martinengo Bastion. Conservation designs for the 
</p>
<p>Watermill/Aqueduct in Chrysochou/Hirsofu were completed. On 11 December 2013, the 
</p>
<p>completion of the first conservation project was marked by a ceremony at the Church of 
</p>
<p>Panagia in Trachoni/Trahoni/Demirhan. In June 2014, the emergency measures at the 
</p>
<p>Panagia Melandrina Church in Kalograia/Kalogreya/Bah&#231;eli were completed. On 1 July 
2014, the contract for phase 1 of the restoration project for the Apostolos Andreas 
</p>
<p>Monastery was signed between the UNDP Partnership for the Future and a joint venture 
</p>
<p>comprising Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot contractors. Site preparations were 
</p>
<p>completed and works have been progressing. Completion of the conservation works at the 
</p>
<p>Agios Nicolaos Church in Syrianochori/Siryanahoro/Yayla was marked by an event held on 
</p>
<p>15 October 2014. Conservation works at the Agios Afksentios Church in Komi/Komi 
</p>
<p>Kebir/B&#252;y&#252;kkonuk are ongoing. Structural consolidation works at the Othello Tower in 
</p>
<p>Famagusta are ongoing and emergency measures for the mosques in Evretou/Evretu were 
</p>
<p>completed in November 2014. On 26 November 2014, emergency measures began at the 
</p>
<p>Mosque of Cherkezoi/&#199;erkez. Additional work is being carried out at the Profitis Elias 
</p>
<p>Church in Fyllia/Filya/Serhatkoy, hamam in Paphos and the mosque in Deneia/Denya. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>42. According to article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
</p>
<p>the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions 
</p>
<p>without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any 
</p>
<p>media and regardless of frontiers. 
</p>
<p>43. In July 2014, the Human Rights Committee asked the Government of Cyprus to 
</p>
<p>provide information on the amendments to the Law on the Procedure for the 
</p>
<p>Standardization of Geographical Names of the Republic of Cyprus, and to state how the 
</p>
<p>amendments comply with article 19, paragraph 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights.43  
</p>
<p>44. The Law on the Procedure for the Standardization of Geographical Names of the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Cyprus was amended in July 2013, criminalizing the alteration of names of 
</p>
<p>regions, cities and villages. According to article 6, paragraph 1 of the law, any person who 
</p>
<p>publishes, imports, circulates, offers, distributes or sells in the Republic of Cyprus maps, 
</p>
<p>books or other documents, conventionally or digitally printed, in which geographical names 
</p>
<p>and toponyms of areas of the Republic are printed differently from those designated in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the procedures provided for in the law or of those in the dictionary of 
</p>
<p>toponyms commits an offence and, if convicted, is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 43 CCPR/C/CYP/Q/4, para. 25. </p>


<p>three years or a fine not exceeding &#8364;50,000, or both penalties, and all related documents are 
</p>
<p>liable to seizure and destruction. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>45. According to article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
</p>
<p>the right to education.44 Education should be directed to the full development of the human 
</p>
<p>personality and the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; it 
</p>
<p>should promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or 
</p>
<p>religious groups, and it should further the activities of the United Nations for the 
</p>
<p>maintenance of peace. Furthermore, parents have a prior right to choose the kind of 
</p>
<p>education that is given to their children. 
</p>
<p>46. Universities in the northern part of the island are not recognized by the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Cyprus, and Turkish Cypriot students still face limited access to European Union exchange 
</p>
<p>and educational programmes. A scholarship scheme for the Turkish Cypriot community 
</p>
<p>was set up by the European Commission under European Union Council Regulation (EC) 
</p>
<p>No. 389/2006 in order to compensate for this lack of mobility. The scheme allows Turkish 
</p>
<p>Cypriot students and professionals to spend up to one academic year abroad at a university 
</p>
<p>or other host institution in the European Union. The purpose is both to ensure academic 
</p>
<p>attainment and to bring Turkish Cypriots closer to the culture and values of the European 
</p>
<p>Union. In the 2012-13 academic year 2012/13, 28 students and teachers were granted 
</p>
<p>scholarships to participate in the scheme. In the academic year 2013/14, 181 participants 
</p>
<p>were granted scholarships, including undergraduate and graduate students, researchers and 
</p>
<p>professionals, and Turkish Cypriots were, for the first time ever, offered the option of 
</p>
<p>studying at a university in the southern part of the island through the scheme. According to 
</p>
<p>the Task Force for the Turkish Cypriot Community of the Directorate-General for 
</p>
<p>Enlargement of the European Commission, the Directorate-General also signed grant 
</p>
<p>contracts with 10 Turkish Cypriot schools in 2013 and 2014 to benefit from modern 
</p>
<p>teaching and management methods and to promote collaboration with Greek Cypriot 
</p>
<p>schools. 
</p>
<p>47. In the light of the fundamental human right to education, the Government of Cyprus 
</p>
<p>expressed deep concern in February 2014 that the replacement of a nursery teacher at 
</p>
<p>Rizokarpaso Nursery School in the northern part of the island had been rejected by the 
</p>
<p>Turkish Cypriot side. While an alternative in this case was later proposed and approved, the 
</p>
<p>appointments of seven teachers for the academic year 2014/15 were rejected, and two 
</p>
<p>teachers who had been serving there for a number of years had their appointments 
</p>
<p>terminated. UNFICYP noted that the Turkish Cypriot authorities also continued to vet all 
</p>
<p>textbooks used for teaching in these schools. There were again no new developments 
</p>
<p>regarding the establishment of a Turkish language school in Limassol in the southern part 
</p>
<p>of the island.45

<p><b> H. Gender perspective 
</b></p>
<p>48. In its resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security, the Security Council 
</p>
<p>called upon all actors involved, when negotiating and implementing peace agreements, to 
</p>
<p>adopt a gender perspective, including, inter alia, (a) the special needs of women and girls 
</p>
<p>during repatriation and resettlement and for rehabilitation, reintegration and post-conflict 
</p>
<p>reconstruction; (b) measures that support local women&#8217;s peace initiatives and indigenous 
</p>
<p>processes for conflict resolution, and that involve women in all of the implementation 
</p>
<p>mechanisms of the peace agreements; and (c) measures that ensure the protection of and 
</p>
<p>respect for human rights of women and girls, particularly as they relate to the Constitution, 
</p>
<p>the electoral system, the police and the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>49. With regard to Cyprus, the Security Council reiterated in its resolutions 2135 (2014) 
</p>
<p>and 2168 (2014) that the active participation of civil society groups, including women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>groups, is essential to the political process and can contribute to making any future 
</p>
<p>settlement sustainable. It recalled that women play an important role in peace processes, 
</p>
<p>and welcomed all efforts to promote bicommunal contacts and events, including, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>on the part of all United Nations bodies on the island.  
</p>
<p>50. During the review of Cyprus by the Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
</p>
<p>Review on 4 February 2014, Canada recommended that the State under review take further 
</p>
<p>concrete measures to promote equality between men and women by enabling full and 
</p>
<p>meaningful participation by women in the decision-making levels of the formal peace 
</p>
<p>process and the advancement of negotiations regarding the Cyprus issue. Australia 
</p>
<p>recommended that it incorporate a gender perspective in negotiating and implementing any 
</p>
<p>settlement accords.46 The Government accepted these two recommendations in June 2014, 
</p>
<p>noting that, &#8220;in the framework of the inter-communal talks, women have played an 
</p>
<p>important role as members of the negotiating bicommunal structures and bodies, working at 
</p>
<p>the same time outside the framework of the negotiations.&#8221; The Government encouraged 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations and civil society that deal with gender mainstreaming and 
</p>
<p>the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), and was taking their input 
</p>
<p>into account. It added that the overall objective remained &#8220;the comprehensive settlement of 
</p>
<p>the Cyprus problem in a manner that ensures the respect of fundamental freedoms and 
</p>
<p>human rights for everyone, including gender equality, in law and in practice.&#8221;47 
</p>
<p>51. In July 2014, the Human Rights Committee asked the Government of Cyprus to 
</p>
<p>provide information on the way in which human rights concerns, particularly gender 
</p>
<p>perspectives, were incorporated into the peace process, and on measures taken to strengthen 
</p>
<p>dialogue with non-governmental and women&#8217;s organizations to promote and encourage 
</p>
<p>civil society and community-level participation in the peace process; and to fully involve 
</p>
<p>women in all stages of the peace process, including in decision-making, in accordance with 
</p>
<p>Security Council resolution 1325 (2000).48 
</p>
<p>52. On 16 December 2013, the Gender Advisory Team, a group of academics and civil 
</p>
<p>society activists from both sides of the divide working on gender equality from a peace-
</p>
<p>building perspective, organized a seminar on the theme &#8220;Gender and the law: debating 
</p>
<p>citizenship in Cyprus&#8221;. The seminar targeted experts and practitioners in the fields of 
</p>
<p>gender and legal reform in Cyprus, focusing on the links between gender and citizenship in 
</p>
<p>situations of multiple and intersecting jurisdictions. Recognizing that forms of citizenship 
</p>
<p>around the world are premised on highly gendered concepts of personhood and State, the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 46 A/HRC/26/14, paras. 114.34 and 114.35. 
</p>
<p> 47 A/HRC/26/14/Add.1, para. 28. 
</p>
<p> 48 CCPR/C/CYP/Q/4, paras. 2 and 5. </p>


<p>Gender Advisory Team endeavoured to sketch out the parameters for making the 
</p>
<p>citizenship clauses of an eventual agreement more gender-sensitive. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>During the period under review, there were some positive developments with 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard to the promotion and protection of human rights in Cyprus, including</b> <b>progress 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the identification and return of the remains of missing persons, an improved 
</b></p>
<p><b>climate of interreligious communication and cooperation, and progress in 
</b></p>
<p><b>conservation works of cultural heritage sites on the whole island.  
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The persisting division of the island still, however, hinders the full enjoyment, 
</b></p>
<p><b>in mutual confidence by the whole population of Cyprus, of all human rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>fundamental freedoms. These include the right to life and the question of missing 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons, the principle of non-discrimination, freedom of movement, property rights, 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of religion and cultural rights, freedom of opinion and expression, and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to education.  
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>Various United Nations human rights mechanisms have voiced their concern at 
</b></p>
<p><b>factors and difficulties impeding the implementation of international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards on the whole island. In this context, United Nations treaty bodies, special 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures and the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review addressed their 
</b></p>
<p><b>questions and recommendations to Cyprus, Turkey and the de facto authorities in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>northern part of the island. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>As concluded in previous OHCHR reports on the question of human rights in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cyprus, it is hoped that the efforts to negotiate and achieve a comprehensive 
</b></p>
<p><b>settlement of the protracted conflict in Cyprus will ultimately open avenues to 
</b></p>
<p><b>improve the situation of human rights on the island. In the spirit of the Secretary-
</b></p>
<p>General&#8217;s &#8220;<b>Human Rights Up Front</b>&#8221;<b> initiative, addressing underlying human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues and causes should be an increasingly important part of peacekeeping efforts 
</b></p>
<p><b>and also underpin the political dialogue aimed at achieving a comprehensive 
</b></p>
<p><b>settlement of the Cyprus problem. Ensuring </b>adequate women&#8217;s participation and the 
</p>
<p><b>consideration of gender-related issues in these discussions is vital. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>Further visits by special procedures mandate holders are encouraged, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>on cultural rights, minority issues, the human rights of internally displaced persons, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right to education, and enforced or involuntary disappearances. It is imperative 
</b></p>
<p><b>that OHCHR and other relevant actors have access to the whole island, all pertinent 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities and persons affected. 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>Human rights do not have any borders; all stakeholders are thus obliged to 
</b></p>
<p><b>uphold the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all people. It is vital that all 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights protection gaps and underlying human rights issues in situations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>protracted conflict be addressed.</b> <b> 
</b></p>
