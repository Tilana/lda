2.

3.      
Conviction had been entered subsequent to your "plea of guilty" on 13th of March 2012. The Court is satisfied that you were fully comprehended the legal effects of your plea and you acted voluntarily and free from influence.

4.      
The Court granted permission for an amendment to be made as the date of the 'summery of facts' that was presented by the prosecution was incorrect. The amendment had been explained and you admitted the same on 02.05.2012. 

5.      
The Summary of facts revealed that the offence was committed on 29th January 2012 at around 12 noon in Foster Street, Walu Bay, Suva.

Further, the summery of facts revealed that, you and another (unknown to the Prosecution) have approached the victim who was standing on the road. You have surrounded the victim and then punched. The victim fell on the ground. You and your companion searched the pockets of the victim. By doing this you tried to grab the wallet and his mobile phone.

7.      
It was not easy as the victim held on to his belongings tightly.

8.      
This was the time that a Fire officer (PW2) arrived at the scene. The victim had been fortunate to have the assistance of the Fire officer. He not only saved the victim but detained the two offenders until the arrival of the police.

9.      
Later you had been arrested by the Totoga police station. You were positively identified by the victim and admitted the allegation leveled in your interview under caution.

Early guilty plea,
ii.     
Sole breadwinner,
iii.

iv.     
Remorse,

12.     
 The offence of Aggravated robbery is becoming a serious problem and warrants great judicial intervention. The increasing crime rate of this nature has made the society vulnerable and unsecured place. 

13.     
I have adequately considered the general principles of 'Sentencing' at Section 15 (3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree and objective of sentencing under section 4 (1) and 4 (2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. 

14.     
 Pursuant to section 4 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, the purpose of sentencing an accused person is to punish offenders to an extent and in a manner which is just in all the circumstance, to protect the community from offenders, to deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature, more importantly the to signify that the Court and the community denounce the commission of such offences.

Tariff for the offences

15.     
 Hon; Justice Goundar in State vs Mataiasi Bulivou Susu[2010] FJHC 226; HAC054.2010; HAC055.2010; HAC056.2010 (2 July 2010) found that organized gang robberies attract the sentence of 8-14 year imprisonment. 

16.     
Her ladyship Justice Shameem in Seseu v State 2003, FJHC 224, HAM0043J, 2003S, (10 December 2003) found that the tariff for robbery with violence is 4-7 years. Justice Shameem in Sakiusa Basa vs. the State(Criminal Appeal AAU 24/2005), held that "'Sentences for robberies involving firearms should range from six to eight years. A lower range of four to seven years is appropriate where firearms are not used and the premises are banks, or shops, post offices or service stations. However, the sentence may be higher where the victim or victims are particularly vulnerable due to age, infirmity, disability or where children are involved. Similarly where injuries are caused in the course of the robbery, a higher sentence will be justified. The value of the property stolen, evidence of planning or premeditation, multiple offences and previous convictions for similar offences should be considered aggravating features. The sentence may be reduced where the offender has no previous convictions, has pleaded guilty and has expressed remorse. This list of aggravating and mitigating features is by no means exhaustive. Furthermore, the sentence will always be adjusted up or down, depending on the facts of the particular case'

17.     
Justice Goundar inSusu's case(supra), has summarized the guiding principles in sentencing in cases involving robbery. They are:' From these authorities, the following principles emerge. The dominant factor in assessing seriousness for any types of robbery is the degree of force used or threatened. The degree of injury to the victim or the nature of and duration of threats are also relevant in assessing the seriousness of an offence of robbery with violence. If a weapon is involved in the use or threat of force that will always be an important aggravating feature. Group offending will aggravate an offence because the level of intimidation and fear caused to the victim will be greater. It may also indicate planning and gang activity. Being the ringleader in a group is an aggravating factor. If the victims are vulnerable, such as elderly people and persons providing public transport, then that will be an aggravating factor. Other aggravating factors may include the value of items taken and the fact that an offence was committed whilst the offender was on bail.

The seriousness of an offence of robbery is mitigated by factors such as a timely guilty plea, clear evidence of remorse, ready co-operation with the police, response to previous sentences, personal circumstances of the offender, first offence of violence, voluntary return of property taken, playing a minor part, and lack of planning involved.

18.     
In a recent case, Jone Nawai & Another v. The State (Criminal Appeal No HAA 023/11 dated 08/09/2011) the starting point was reduced from 8 years to 4 years. The facts of the case are very much similar to this case. 'The complainant had been a bus driver. He was robbed by two accused at around 6.45 am in a street of Lautoka. The wallet and $84 was taken away by the robbers'. The two accused ware given a custodial sentence of two years by the appellate Court. The Hon: Justice Madigan stated that ' I do not consider the offence that is suitable to qualify for suspension. Your attack on the victim was unprovoked and our citizens on their way to work should be protected from such random crime'. 

19.     
Having considered the sentencing guidelines and principles that was discussed in, Jone Nawai's case, I am of the view that this is a fit case to consider a starting point which is below from the standard tariff. I select 4 years imprisonment period as the starting point for this case.

20.     
 You completely disregarded the law and order of the country and utilized the vulnerability and insecurity of the victim to carry out your criminal act.

21.     
In view of aforementioned aggravating factors I increase your sentence by 2 years. Now your sentence stands at 6 years. 

22.     
Having considered your early guilty plea I reduce 2 years and in view of other mitigating factors, I reduce 12 months to reach the period of 3 years. Furthermore, pursuant to section 24 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree I reduce 3 months for the period that you were in remand prior to this sentence.

23.     
 Now your final sentence reaches to 2 years and 09 months imprisonment period for the offence. You will serve 2 years of that term before being eligible for parole.

24.     
Since this court exercising the extended jurisdiction of the High Court, you may appeal against this sentence within 30 days with leave to the Court of Appeal.
