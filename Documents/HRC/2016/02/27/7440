<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The present report provides an overview of the situation of human rights in 
</p>
<p>Guatemala and the work undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala (OHCHR-Guatemala) during 2014. 
</p>
<p>In the context of elections to high-level posts in the justice sector, the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner describes progress and challenges to judicial independence and the fight 
</p>
<p>against impunity, including transitional justice. He highlights persisting high levels of 
</p>
<p>violence, which particularly affect women, and outlines the response strategies of security 
</p>
<p>institutions. He describes the insecure environment in which human rights defenders work, 
</p>
<p>and the outstanding challenges in ensuring the rights of indigenous peoples. The causes of 
</p>
<p>social unrest, particularly in indigenous territories,** human rights impacts and the 
</p>
<p>response provided by the State are identified. Issues related to the right to food, access to 
</p>
<p>land and labour rights are also addressed, and a section on business and human rights is 
</p>
<p>incorporated.

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.1

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. On 10 January 2005, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>signed an agreement with the Government of Guatemala for the establishment of a country 
</p>
<p>office (OHCHR-Guatemala). Under the agreement, OHCHR-Guatemala monitors the 
</p>
<p>human rights situation and advises State institutions and civil society. The agreement was 
</p>
<p>extended in March 2014 for a third time, for three years. 
</p>
<p>2. The Deputy High Commissioner visited Guatemala from 19 to 22 May 2014, and 
</p>
<p>met with high-level State officials, civil society organizations, indigenous authorities and 
</p>
<p>representatives of the international community. 
</p>
<p><b> II. National context  
</b></p>
<p>3. The political landscape was marked by advance campaigning by several political 
</p>
<p>parties for the 2015 presidential, legislative and municipal elections. The newly appointed 
</p>
<p>authorities of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal temporarily suspended 11 of the 28 political 
</p>
<p>parties for violating the law on electoral campaigning. Some of the sanctioned parties filed 
</p>
<p>injunctions (<i>amparos</i>) to try to overturn those decisions. 
</p>
<p>4. The gross domestic product (GDP) of Guatemala registered 3.6 per cent growth, but 
</p>
<p>tax revenue fell to 10.8 per cent of GDP.1 The World Bank declared Guatemala as the 
</p>
<p>country with the lowest public spending in the world in relation to the size of its economy.2 
</p>
<p>An example of the seriousness of the situation was the severe crisis in the health system, 
</p>
<p>with shortages of medical supplies and overdue salary payments.  
</p>
<p>5. A prolonged drought severely affected the population living in the &#8220;dry corridor&#8221; &#8212; 
</p>
<p>Chiquimula, Jutiapa, Jalapa, Baja Verapaz, El Progreso, Zacapa and Quich&#233; departments &#8212; 
</p>
<p>placing 275,625 families in a situation of food insecurity. Corn and bean production fell by 
</p>
<p>80 per cent and 63 per cent, respectively. In August, Congress declared a state of 
</p>
<p>emergency (<i>calamidad p&#250;blica</i>) in 16 departments. The Government initiated, among other 
</p>
<p>actions, an action plan to provide food, but the plan benefited only 168,000 affected 
</p>
<p>families. 
</p>
<p>6. In October, the Government and the United Nations signed the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Development Assistance Framework 2015&#8211;2019. OHCHR-Guatemala contributed to the 
</p>
<p>Framework by incorporating a human rights approach and reflecting the commitments 
</p>
<p>made by Guatemala through the universal periodic review.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Overall human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p>7. Selection for high-level positions in the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the Attorney 
</p>
<p>General&#8217;s Office (Ministerio P&#250;blico), the Supreme Court, the Appeals Court and the 
</p>
<p>Office of the Controller General took place in 2014. Selection processes failed to observe 
</p>
<p>international standards, and were marked by legal uncertainty and interference by private 
</p>
<p>interests (see paras. 18&#8211;22 below). Civil society actors filed injunctions against the 
</p>
<p>appointments on account of those irregularities, and the Constitutional Court temporarily 
</p>
<p>suspended congressional appointment of judges to the Supreme Court and the Appeals 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>Court. However, it later decided that the judges should be sworn in. This, together with 
</p>
<p>general discontent over the work of the Nominating Commissions and Congress, 
</p>
<p>highlighted the challenges to judicial independence and impartiality in the country. 
</p>
<p>8. The reactivation of the Congressional Working Group on Security and Justice in 
</p>
<p>March3 enabled debates on major legislative initiatives, such as the Law to Implement the 
</p>
<p>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Public Order Law, the Organic Law 
</p>
<p>of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and articles of the Civil Code relating to the legal age for 
</p>
<p>marriage. However, by December, those initiatives had yet to be passed into law. 
</p>
<p>9. In September, the Plan to Develop a Democratic Criminal Justice Policy was signed 
</p>
<p>under the leadership of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office. It was structured around prevention, 
</p>
<p>investigation, punishment and social reintegration. The act represents the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>commitment to develop a policy with multisectoral participation and a gender perspective. 
</p>
<p>10. The right to life continued to be affected by widespread violence and crime, 
</p>
<p>although the number of homicides decreased in comparison with 2013. The National 
</p>
<p>Institute of Forensic Sciences (INACIF) reported 5,924 violent deaths, of which 13 per cent 
</p>
<p>were of women. This represents an average of 16 homicides per day and a 2.4 per cent 
</p>
<p>reduction over 2013.4 However, there was a 8.8 per cent increase in homicides in the 
</p>
<p>capital,
5
 where most of the joint military and police task forces operate. In addition, there 
</p>
<p>were 156 reported cases of lynching, which resulted in 17 deaths and 136 people injured.6  
</p>
<p>11. Human rights defenders continued to perform their work in an insecure 
</p>
<p>environment. OHCHR-Guatemala registered attacks and media campaigns that stigmatized 
</p>
<p>them and impeded their work. Some government officials publicly questioned their work 
</p>
<p>and their cooperation with international human rights mechanisms (see paras. 45&#8211;50 
</p>
<p>below).  
</p>
<p>12. There were several cases of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
</p>
<p>transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals, as well as family violence, sexual 
</p>
<p>harassment and harassment in the workplace.7 The Presidential Commission for 
</p>
<p>Coordinating Executive Policy in the Field of Human Rights (COPREDEH) and the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Ombudsman&#8217;s Office actively sought to address various forms of discrimination and 
</p>
<p>drafted guidelines for a public policy for the LGBTI population. 
</p>
<p>13. In many cases, indigenous peoples turned to social protest in the face of the 
</p>
<p>ineffectiveness of the high-level dialogues with the authorities or because they were not 
</p>
<p>involved in decision-making. Their main demands were the right to self-determination, 
</p>
<p>consultation, nationalization of electricity, approval of the comprehensive rural 
</p>
<p>development law, and the repeal of several laws. However, only the Law for the Protection 
</p>
<p>of Vegetable Production was repealed by Congress, as it was found detrimental to the right 
</p>
<p>to food. 
</p>
<p>14. The Human Rights Ombudsman&#8217;s Office continued to strengthen its regional offices 
</p>
<p>and its interventions in order to prevent human rights violations in situations of eviction, 
</p>
<p>states of emergency and social conflicts. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 The Working Group is a forum created by Member of Congress Oliverio Garc&#237;a Rodas to promote 
</p>
<p>legislative initiatives relating to security and justice, and comprised of State institutions, civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations and other sectors.

<p>15. The High Commissioner welcomes the adoption by the Government, in October, of 
</p>
<p>a reparations policy (which included a budget allocation approved in November
8
) to 
</p>
<p>address violations of the human rights of communities displaced by the construction of the 
</p>
<p>Chixoy hydroelectric dam in 1975.9 After the victims&#8217; decades-long pursuit of justice, it is 
</p>
<p>hoped that this unprecedented policy will substantially improve their living conditions. 
</p>
<p>16. Between October 2013 and September 2014, approximately 17,000 unaccompanied 
</p>
<p>Guatemalan children were detained at the southern border of the United States of 
</p>
<p>America.10 Violence and a lack of opportunities were invoked as the principal reasons for 
</p>
<p>that migration.11 Their possible massive repatriation from the United States and Mexico 
</p>
<p>brought to light the limited local capacity to receive and reintegrate migrants, in particular 
</p>
<p>unaccompanied children. In July, a legislative initiative was introduced to protect migrant 
</p>
<p>children, which has yet to be approved. 
</p>
<p>17. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights closely monitored the human rights situation. In 2014, the Commission held 
</p>
<p>seven thematic hearings and issued eight press releases on issues such as militarization of 
</p>
<p>security and the situation of human rights defenders.12 The Court issued two orders 
</p>
<p>declaring Guatemala in contempt for violation of its obligation to comply with 13 of its 
</p>
<p>judgements.13 It also reiterated that provisions adopted domestically could not be used as 
</p>
<p>justification for non-compliance with its rulings, including in the case of amnesties, even if 
</p>
<p>they came from the highest court in the country (see para. 27).14 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Justice 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Independence of the judiciary and selection and appointment of high-
</b></p>
<p><b>level judicial authorities 
</b></p>
<p>18. The processes for selecting high-level judicial authorities entrusted to Nominating 
</p>
<p>Commissions were characterized by the lack of objective and transparent criteria to 
</p>
<p>evaluate the candidates&#8217; merits, suitability and moral standard. Nor was the inclusion of 
</p>
<p>ethnic diversity promoted. The recommendations made by the High Commissioner,15 the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers16 and the Inter-American 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights17 to prevent this situation were not taken into account. Nor 
</p>
<p>were most of the interpretative guidelines of the Constitutional Court, which were in line

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>with international standards.18 The Constitutional Court established that the term of the 
</p>
<p>former Attorney General (Fiscal General) would end in May and not December, and her 
</p>
<p>name was not included in the final list sent by the Nominating Commission to the President 
</p>
<p>even though she had obtained the second highest score among the candidates. 
</p>
<p>19. Attacks and threats were directed against judges and prosecutors involved in high-
</p>
<p>impact cases, to the detriment of judicial independence. There were also media and social 
</p>
<p>media campaigns aimed at discrediting their work. Those attacks were reported to have 
</p>
<p>discouraged potential candidates from seeking appointment to high-level judicial posts. 
</p>
<p>20. Civil society organizations and individuals did valuable social auditing of the 
</p>
<p>selection processes together with the Human Rights Ombudsman, the International 
</p>
<p>Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and OHCHR-Guatemala. Nearly 100 
</p>
<p>legal challenges were filed, as well as injunctions against decisions adopted by Nominating 
</p>
<p>Commissions and Congress. 
</p>
<p>21. In October, the resignation of an Appeals Court judge (who had been re-elected to 
</p>
<p>her post) over irregularities during the selection process was supported by numerous judges, 
</p>
<p>reflecting the general discontent about the work of the Nominating Commissions. In 
</p>
<p>response to this and to the above-mentioned legal challenges, the Constitutional Court 
</p>
<p>issued a ruling that provisionally suspended the swearing in of judges to the Supreme Court 
</p>
<p>and the Appeals Court.19 As a result, private individuals filed complaints against four 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Court judges who signed the ruling for violating the Constitution and abuse 
</p>
<p>of authority. However, an impeachment request against those judges was eventually 
</p>
<p>rejected by the Supreme Court.  
</p>
<p>22. A thorough analysis of the current model for selecting and appointing judicial 
</p>
<p>officials is essential with a view to guaranteeing judicial independence. This will require a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive review of the legal framework, including the Constitution, the Law on 
</p>
<p>Nominating Commissions, the Law on the Judiciary and the Law on the Judicial Career.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p>23. The new Attorney General and her Office maintained coordination and cooperation 
</p>
<p>with CICIG in high-impact cases, such as the one related to a corruption network in the 
</p>
<p>prison system, in which both prison officials and detainees were implicated; the case of a 
</p>
<p>corruption network in the judiciary, made up of public officials and private citizens; and the 
</p>
<p>case of an organized criminal network operating in the Pet&#233;n and Izabal departments. In 
</p>
<p>October, a contract killer was sentenced to 90 years in prison for the 2013 murder of lawyer 
</p>
<p>Lea de Le&#243;n.20 In June, a Swiss court convicted the former Director of the National Civil 
</p>
<p>Police and sentenced him to life in prison for extrajudicial executions at the Pav&#243;n 
</p>
<p>penitentiary.21  
</p>
<p>24. High-risk courts have played a crucial role in combating impunity for past and 
</p>
<p>present human rights violations. In 2013 and 2014, they had a high rate of effectiveness and 
</p>
<p>reduced the backlog of cases. In 2013, 60 cases were presented and 67 judgements handed 
</p>
<p>down; 42 cases were presented and 78 judgements were handed down in 2014.22 However, 
</p>
<p>some judges, faced constant attacks and intimidation, including one who has handled major 
</p>

<p>transitional justice cases. In April, the Honour Tribunal of the Guatemalan Bar Association 
</p>
<p>imposed a public reprimand on the latter, suspended her from practicing law for one year, 
</p>
<p>and fined her for allegedly offending one of the lawyers of former Head of State Efra&#237;n 
</p>
<p>R&#237;os Montt during his trial in 2013. The sanction was reduced to a private reprimand on 
</p>
<p>appeal. 
</p>
<p>25. The judiciary continued to make important progress in non-criminal justice to 
</p>
<p>expedite proceedings, decrease backlogs and facilitate access for rights holders. Progress 
</p>
<p>was made in drafting reforms to the Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure. In August, 
</p>
<p>the Centre for Family Justice was established in the capital, which includes infrastructure 
</p>
<p>changes and the creation of a judicial body with specialized jurisdiction over cases 
</p>
<p>involving domestic violence. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Transitional justice  
</b></p>
<p>26. The issues raised by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the 
</p>
<p>Inter-American Court of Human Rights, including resistance to international scrutiny on 
</p>
<p>transitional justice cases, are of high concern. Nonetheless, there was progress in some 
</p>
<p>criminal investigations, and prosecutions continued into cases of grave human rights 
</p>
<p>violations committed during the internal armed conflict. In October, a case of sexual 
</p>
<p>violence against a group of indigenous women in the Sepur Zarco military base in 1982&#8211;
</p>
<p>1983 was brought to trial. On 18 December, the Constitutional Court issued a resolution 
</p>
<p>that allows for the reopening of the trial of Efra&#237;n R&#237;os Montt for the crime of genocide.23 
</p>
<p>Also, at the time of writing, a judgement was awaited with regard to the deaths of 37 people 
</p>
<p>during the occupation and burning of the Spanish embassy in 1981. In July, the Criminal 
</p>
<p>Court (Tribunal de Sentencia Penal) of Chimaltenango convicted a member of a non-State 
</p>
<p>armed group for the 1988 massacre of 22 people in El Aguacate. In other cases, such as the 
</p>
<p>1978 Panz&#243;s massacre and the finding of military records in Cob&#225;n (the Diario Militar 
</p>
<p>case), testimonies were given before the trials began due to the advanced age of the 
</p>
<p>witnesses. Still, many cases remained unpunished. In July, the Criminal Court of Cob&#225;n 
</p>
<p>acquitted those accused of the 1983 enforced disappearance of two brothers from Tactic, 
</p>
<p>Baja Verapaz.  
</p>
<p>27. The debate over the applicability of amnesty provisions continued. Over 50 per cent 
</p>
<p>of Appeals Court judges recused themselves from resolving an injunction issued by the 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Court requesting them to decide whether Decree Law 8-86, which offers 
</p>
<p>amnesty for common political and other related crimes, should apply to Efra&#237;n R&#237;os 
</p>
<p>Montt.24 In that regard, the Constitutional Court recognized that the jurisprudence of the 
</p>
<p>Inter-American Court of Human Rights was binding25 and part of the body of constitutional 
</p>
<p>law. The Court reiterated that extinction of criminal liability on the grounds of a statute of 
</p>
<p>limitations or due obedience was not applicable, and that States could not invoke provisions 
</p>
<p>in domestic law that impeded the prosecution of grave human rights violations.26 It also 
</p>
<p>recognized the imprescriptible character of &#8220;crimes against humanity&#8221; as stipulated in 
</p>
<p>article 378 of the Penal Code, in line with the State&#8217;s duty to apply <i>jus cogens</i> norms.27 
</p>
<p>Despite this, the State continued to invoke the primacy of internal amnesty provisions 
</p>
<p>before regional and international human rights mechanisms.

<p>28. In May, Congress passed a non-binding resolution expressing that it was &#8220;legally 
</p>
<p>unviable&#8221; that the crime of genocide could have been committed in Guatemala.28 OHCHR-
</p>
<p>Guatemala considers that the resolution may interfere with judicial independence and 
</p>
<p>impartiality. The High Commissioner reiterates that the obligation to investigate, prosecute 
</p>
<p>and sanction grave human rights violations and crimes against humanity is a peremptory 
</p>
<p>norm (<i>jus cogens</i>); therefore, any act contrary to such obligations is considered null and 
</p>
<p>void.29 
</p>
<p>29. Ten years after the National Reparations Programme was established, there is still 
</p>
<p>uncertainty over its selection criteria, delays in the processing of requests for compensation 
</p>
<p>of up to seven years, and a lack of measures to guarantee comprehensive reparation for 
</p>
<p>victims. 
</p>
<p>30. The handing over of declassified military documents to the General Archives of 
</p>
<p>Central America in August is an important step towards the realization of victims&#8217; rights to 
</p>
<p>truth and justice. Institutional safeguarding of those archives is critical and should be 
</p>
<p>established through a proper legal framework. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Justice and indigenous peoples  
</b></p>
<p>31. Indigenous peoples continued to face barriers in accessing the justice system. 
</p>
<p>However, some progress identified in previous years continued.30 The judiciary&#8217;s Centre for 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Legal Translation and Interpretation was instrumental in guaranteeing access to 
</p>
<p>justice for indigenous peoples in their own languages. In 2014, the Centre supported 1,901 
</p>
<p>hearings, in 19 indigenous languages, held by different jurisdictional bodies located in 
</p>
<p>departments with majority indigenous populations.31 The Indigenous Peoples Department 
</p>
<p>of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office drew up an action plan to improve access to justice. The 
</p>
<p>measure was recommended in an institutional assessment carried out with OHCHR-
</p>
<p>Guatemala technical assistance. To overcome the weaknesses diagnosed, the plan proposes 
</p>
<p>reforms to internal regulations as well as specialized training for interpreters, especially on 
</p>
<p>victim assistance. 
</p>
<p>32. In a ruling issued in February, the Injunctions Chamber of the Supreme Court of 
</p>
<p>Justice in February denied the existence of indigenous jurisdiction,
32
</p>
<p> which represents a 
</p>
<p>serious reversal of existing jurisprudence, including by the Supreme Court,33 which 
</p>
<p>recognized the decisions of indigenous authorities.  
</p>
<p>33. The Third Chamber of the Court of Appeals, Civil and Commercial Division, 
</p>
<p>granted an injunction to the Sipakapense Maya Council in San Marcos Department, who 
</p>
<p>claimed a lack of consultation prior to the concession of the exploration licence for &#8220;Los 
</p>
<p>Chocoyos&#8221; mine. Although the Court allowed the licence to stand, it urged the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Energy and Mines not to fail to carry out the obligations acquired by the State of Guatemala 
</p>
<p>with regard to indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in the future.34

<p><b> E. Persons deprived of liberty 
</b></p>
<p>34. The prison system continues to face serious challenges. While it has a capacity for 
</p>
<p>6,492 detainees, 18,204 people, almost half of whom were in pretrial detention, were 
</p>
<p>deprived of liberty as at August 2014.35  
</p>
<p>35. As previously reported,36 lack of control within the prisons continued, along with 
</p>
<p>criminal activity perpetrated by structures involved in grave human rights violations within 
</p>
<p>and outside the penitentiary system. This was reflected in a CICIG-led investigation leading 
</p>
<p>to the criminal prosecution of high-level officials of the penitentiary system, inmates 
</p>
<p>(among them former army captain Byron Lima Oliva, convicted for the assassination of 
</p>
<p>Bishop Juan Gerardi in 1998) and others, for influence peddling, illicit association and 
</p>
<p>money laundering. 
</p>
<p>36. The High Commissioner welcomes the adoption, in September, by the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>the Interior of the institutional model for attention to children and adolescents with parents 
</p>
<p>and/or legal guardians deprived of liberty, women deprived of liberty and female 
</p>
<p>penitentiary guards, with the support of Colectivo Artesana. It is hoped that the ongoing 
</p>
<p>process of drafting a penitentiary policy, with broad participation of civil society, will 
</p>
<p>address some of the challenges. 
</p>
<p>37. Despite some improvements in infrastructure and equipment at the Federico Mora 
</p>
<p>Hospital in compliance with the precautionary measures issued in 2012 by Inter-American 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights in favour of 334 patients,
37
</p>
<p> significant challenges remain.38 
</p>
<p>Those include guaranteeing medical attention appropriate for each pathology, reducing the 
</p>
<p>use of solitary confinement and adopting measures to prevent violence. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Security 
</b></p>
<p>38. Within the framework of the Covenant for Security, Justice and Peace, steps were 
</p>
<p>made towards a comprehensive approach to violence prevention, including the approval, in 
</p>
<p>August, of the National Policy for Violence and Crime Prevention, Citizen Security and 
</p>
<p>Peaceful Coexistence 2014&#8211;2034. However, the Government&#8217;s response to violence and 
</p>
<p>insecurity remained predominantly reactive and without a focus on structural causes.  
</p>
<p>39. In comparison with 2013, the number of police officers increased from 163 to 188 
</p>
<p>per 100,000 inhabitants, with a total of 29,798 active officers.39 However, working 
</p>
<p>conditions, such as low salaries and a lack of equipment and fuel, continued to affect the 
</p>
<p>operational capacity of the National Civil Police.40 
</p>
<p>40. Violent incidents were registered during police operations, essentially due to the 
</p>
<p>lack of appropriate operational protocols, equipment and training. In May, in San Jos&#233; del 
</p>
<p>Golfo, Guatemala, 11 demonstrators were injured, the majority by tear gas projectiles, 
</p>
<p>while police cleared the entrance to the El Tambor mine. In August, in Samacoch, Alta 
</p>
<p>Verapaz, three indigenous people were killed by gunfire and eight were wounded, allegedly 
</p>
<p>by police agents, during the clearing of a road block. In November, in Sanarate, El 
</p>
<p>Progreso, a community member was injured during a protest and subsequently died. In

<p>those situations, some police officers were also victims of violence &#8212; nine police officers 
</p>
<p>were injured in San Jos&#233; del Golfo, six in Samacoch and seven in Sanarate. 
</p>
<p>41. In addition, military participation in citizen security increased. Joint military/police 
</p>
<p>patrols were made up of a majority of military personnel.41 The presence of Reserve Army 
</p>
<p>Squads for Citizen Security was extended from 2 to 12 departments in two years,42 and the 
</p>
<p>military officially took part in guarding detention centres.43 Information was also received 
</p>
<p>regarding armed soldiers giving classes, inter alia in family planning, in schools in 
</p>
<p>Guatemala and Huehuetenango.44 
</p>
<p>42. The army continued to participate in task forces with the police, but this has not 
</p>
<p>resulted in visible improvements in security. In two areas of the capital where the Maya 
</p>
<p>(zone 18) and Kaminal (zones 7 and 12) task forces operate, the number of attempted 
</p>
<p>murders and homicides increased by 5 per cent and 38.8 per cent respectively, despite a 
</p>
<p>decline in 2012 when the task forces began operations.45  
</p>
<p>43. Of all violent deaths, 85.4 per cent were due to firearms, a 4.3 per cent increase from 
</p>
<p>2013.46 A national disarmament plan has yet to be proposed and challenges remain in the 
</p>
<p>registration and control of firearms and munitions. The Directorate-General of Arms and 
</p>
<p>Munitions Control (DIGECAM) reported that it had registered only 56.7 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>nearly 500,000 privately owned firearms before registration deadline at the end of April.47 
</p>
<p>The remaining 214,023 were pending legalization, along with another estimated 800,000 
</p>
<p>unregistered firearms.48 A debate was also initiated on the proposed destruction of the more 
</p>
<p>than 49,000 firearms deposited at DIGECAM. 
</p>
<p>44. Only 24 of the 151 registered private security companies were assessed to be in 
</p>
<p>compliance with Decree 52-2010, which regulates private security services.49 The General 
</p>
<p>Bureau of Private Security Services increased actions to control private security companies. 
</p>
<p>However, major challenges persist, such as training and certification of guards and 
</p>
<p>improvement of their working conditions. Only 477 of the estimated 46,000 private security 
</p>
<p>agents are certified. Several cases illustrate the consequences of insufficient oversight on 
</p>
<p>these companies. In July, a woman was killed and a police officer wounded when a private 
</p>
<p>security guard suffering from schizophrenia opened fire in a pharmacy in Guatemala City. 
</p>
<p>In October, two private security guards were apprehended in Mixco, Guatemala, for the 
</p>
<p>kidnapping and murder of a 62-year-old woman.

</p>
<p>comparison with 2013, with seven recorded as at September,50 but there was an increase in 
</p>
<p>the number of attacks, particularly against women defenders.51 The victims were mainly 
</p>
<p>defenders of land-related rights and of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, and journalists.  
</p>
<p>46. The work of human rights defenders was also obstructed by arrests and criminal 
</p>
<p>prosecution. In Chiquimula, five people, including a journalist, were arrested during a 
</p>
<p>national demonstration in September and released after three days for lack of evidence. In 
</p>
<p>February, in Monta&#241;a de las Granadillas<i>, </i>Zacapa, landowners accused 14 community 
</p>
<p>leaders, who were defending the right to water, of aggravated robbery. Although the 
</p>
<p>Attorney General&#8217;s Office did not find evidence to press charges, the case remained open. 
</p>
<p>47. Despite some progress, high levels of impunity persist for the killing of human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders, as in the cases of eight trade union members and four journalists 
</p>
<p>assassinated in 2013. The CICIG analysis of the investigation undertaken by the Attorney 
</p>
<p>General&#8217;s Office between 2004 and 2013 of 56 cases of homicide of trade unionists 
</p>
<p>identified serious shortcomings. Only two convictions were obtained in those cases in 
</p>
<p>2014.52  
</p>
<p>48. Human rights defenders continued to operate in an environment marked by media 
</p>
<p>smear campaigns. The previous Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of opinion and expression, a Guatemalan national, also became the victim 
</p>
<p>of such campaigns. In addition, some high-level authorities publicly questioned the work of 
</p>
<p>foreign human rights defenders, accusing them of interfering in the country&#8217;s internal 
</p>
<p>affairs. That led to the cancellation of the resident visas of two international volunteers 
</p>
<p>from Peace Brigades International. The High Commissioner welcomes the decision of the 
</p>
<p>Minister of the Interior to reverse the cancellation following intervention by OHCHR-
</p>
<p>Guatemala.53 
</p>
<p>49. The Attorney General&#8217;s Office recorded 71 attacks on journalists to November, an 
</p>
<p>increase over the 57 cases registered in 2013. The attacks included threats by non-State 
</p>
<p>actors and State agents and 30 criminal complaints by high-ranking officials. The 
</p>
<p>establishment of a working group to discuss a protection plan for journalists constitutes a 
</p>
<p>positive step towards the creation of a national protection mechanism for journalists with 
</p>
<p>the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
</p>
<p>(UNESCO) and OHCHR-Guatemala. 
</p>
<p>50. The Unit for Analysis of Attacks on Human Rights Defenders of the Ministry of the 
</p>
<p>Interior strengthened the division specialized in the criminal investigation of such attacks 
</p>
<p>(from 8 to 22 agents), but its capacity to analyse patterns of attacks on human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders remains to be strengthened.

</b></p>
<p><b> A. Violence against women  
</b></p>
<p>51. INACIF reported 774 cases of violent deaths of women.54 There were also 
</p>
<p>1,236 reports of femicide
55
</p>
<p> and 281 complaints of other forms of violence against women.56 
</p>
<p>The specialized tribunals on femicide and violence against women issued 1,400 verdicts, 
</p>
<p>compared to 779 in 2013.57 The judiciary inaugurated specialized courts in 4 departments, 
</p>
<p>expanding its coverage to 11 departments.  
</p>
<p>52. OHCHR-Guatemala carried out an analysis of judgements in cases of femicide and 
</p>
<p>other forms of violence against women, and identified an important difference in the 
</p>
<p>application of the law between specialized courts and ordinary courts. Women in rural areas 
</p>
<p>do not benefit from protection and redress, as they do not have access to the specialized 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction. Some shortcomings found in the treatment of violence against women in 
</p>
<p>ordinary courts include the application of the principle of prosecutorial discretion to reject a 
</p>
<p>case; changes in the definition of crimes; lack of analysis of other types of discrimination 
</p>
<p>such as ethnic and age-based; and gender stereotypes in the reasoning of decisions. The 
</p>
<p>Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in its July judgement on the murder of an 
</p>
<p>adolescent, Mar&#237;a Isabel Veliz Franco, in 2001, established that gender stereotypes had had 
</p>
<p>a negative influence on the investigation, as they had shifted blame for what happened onto 
</p>
<p>the victim and her family members, shutting down other possible lines of investigation.58 
</p>
<p><b> B. Sexual and reproductive rights  
</b></p>
<p>53. According to the Ministry of Health, 363 pregnancies of girls aged 10 to 13 were 
</p>
<p>registered, as well as 50,791 of girls aged 14 to 18. By the end of 2014, there could be a 
</p>
<p>3 per cent increase in teenage pregnancies compared to 2013.59  
</p>
<p>54. There were 7,221 deaths of children under 5. Of those, 72.9 per cent were infants 
</p>
<p>under one year old. Almost half died in the first 27 days following their birth, mainly due to 
</p>
<p>complications in the perinatal period and respiratory diseases, most of them preventable 
</p>
<p>with adequate prenatal care.60 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Rights of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>55. The recently created Cabinet for Indigenous Peoples and Intercultural Affairs is a 
</p>
<p>very positive step, but the need for higher level interlocutors to address the demands of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples remains. The will expressed by the Government to address the issue of 
</p>
<p>multiculturalism was not reflected in recent policies, such as the Plan for Private 
</p>
<p>Investment in Rural Territories or the National Policy for Violence and Crime Prevention,

<p>principle of collective land management in protected areas, such as in the six communities 
</p>
<p>of the Sierra de Santa Cruz, where collective property rights were registered in the Property 
</p>
<p>Registry Office (Registro de la Propiedad Inmueble). However, there remain serious 
</p>
<p>obstacles to indigenous peoples&#8217; efforts to recover the ancestral lands taken from them 
</p>
<p>during the internal armed conflict. One hundred and seventy-four land conflicts in protected 
</p>
<p>natural areas remain unsolved.63 
</p>
<p>58. There was an increase in conflicts over the exploitation of natural resources in 
</p>
<p>indigenous territories. Oftentimes, governmental responses included the declaration of 
</p>
<p>states of emergency and excessive use of force (see para. 40 above), despite the existence of 
</p>
<p>the National Dialogue System.64  
</p>
<p>59. In San Juan Sacatep&#233;quez, the division in the community provoked by the 
</p>
<p>construction of a cement plant and a road was aggravated in recent years in the wake of 
</p>
<p>several episodes of violence and the presence of unidentified armed groups. OHCHR-
</p>
<p>Guatemala called for an investigation to dismantle those groups. It also condemned the 
</p>
<p>massacre of nine people and acts of violence against women in the indigenous community 
</p>
<p>of Los Pajoques in September. The President declared a state of emergency (<i>estado de 
</i></p>
<p><i>prevenci&#243;n</i>), the second since 2008 in the area. The High Commissioner recalls that states 
</p>
<p>of emergency are not means to resolve social conflicts.65 The passing by Congress of the 
</p>
<p>reform to the Public Order Law, which regulates states of emergency, in line with 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards, will constitute an important step. 
</p>
<p>60. One of the main sources of tensions among indigenous communities, State 
</p>
<p>authorities and private corporations was the lack of consultation in the context of the 
</p>
<p>construction of hydroelectric projects. Communities opposed 14 of the 36 hydroelectric 
</p>
<p>plants being constructed or planned. In view of the State&#8217;s lack of intervention to guarantee 
</p>
<p>that indigenous people are fully informed and consulted, some companies made direct 
</p>
<p>contact with the communities, which in many cases led to divisions within communities, 
</p>
<p>given the failure to observe their traditional forms of organization and decision-making. In 
</p>
<p>other cases, the dialogue between the companies and the communities was successful. 
</p>
<p>61. Despite the institutional strengthening of the National Dialogue System, the 
</p>
<p>response to conflicts through dialogue was limited. In the case of the Santa Rita 
</p>

</p>
<p>conflicts.

<p>hydroelectric project, in Alta Verapaz, even though an agreement had been reached with 
</p>
<p>most of the Q&#8217;eqchi&#8217; communities, the division generated in the communities led to the 
</p>
<p>forced eviction in August of community members opposed to the project. In San Jos&#233; del 
</p>
<p>Golfo, Guatemala, despite the existence of a dialogue mechanism, the lack of agreement 
</p>
<p>between the parties led the company to bring in machinery, aided by government forces. 
</p>
<p>The high-level dialogue in northern Huehuetenango was interrupted in May following the 
</p>
<p>burning of machinery and facilities of a hydroelectric project in San Mateo Ixtat&#225;n.  
</p>
<p><b> IX. Economic and social rights  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Right to food 
</b></p>
<p>62. According to the Secretariat for Food Security (SESAN), chronic malnutrition 
</p>
<p>among children under the age of 5 in the municipalities prioritized by the Zero Hunger Plan 
</p>
<p>diminished by 1.7 percentage points between 2012 (59.9 per cent) and 2013 (58.2 per cent), 
</p>
<p>approaching the annual reduction of 2 per cent set by the Government.66 Nonetheless, the 
</p>
<p>change was due to a 6.1 per cent reduction in urban areas, whereas rural areas showed a 
</p>
<p>1.1 per cent increase.67  
</p>
<p>63. The Ministry of Health registered 13,919 cases of acute malnutrition, a 16 per cent 
</p>
<p>decrease in relation to 2013.68 However, it confirmed that 130 children had died from 
</p>
<p>causes related to acute malnutrition, an increase from the 116 cases recorded in 2013.69 
</p>
<p>64. At the local level, the Zero Hunger Plan was useful in providing guidance to relevant 
</p>
<p>institutions on the destination of resources. Important challenges to its implementation 
</p>
<p>remain, including the need for greater involvement of mayors to guarantee access to 
</p>
<p>drinking water and sanitation, to strengthen the income-generation component, and to 
</p>
<p>establish controls to prevent the political use of social programmes. The decision by the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Health to cancel 84 contracts with civil society organizations in charge of 
</p>
<p>offering health services to 2.5 million people in rural areas jeopardized the interventions 
</p>
<p>planned by the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Monocultures and access to land  
</b></p>
<p>65. In the past 10 years, the area occupied by four cash crops &#8211; coffee, sugar cane, palm 
</p>
<p>oil and rubber &#8211; increased by 40 per cent, while the area occupied by basic food crops 
</p>
<p>decreased by 37.5 per cent. Out of the total arable land devoted to cultivation, 28.3 per cent 
</p>
<p>is for export cash crops, while 25.4 per cent is used to grow basic food crops.70 
</p>
<p>66. OHCHR-Guatemala received complaints from communities in Escuintla, 
</p>
<p>Suchitep&#233;quez and Retalhuleu about the impact of the expansion of monoculture on their 
</p>
<p>rights to food and health. Complaints highlighted the limitations on access to land to grow 
</p>
<p>basic food crops due to tripled land prices, the diversion of rivers to irrigate large 
</p>
<p>plantations, and the impact of aerial spraying of sugar cane crops. Pollution of rivers and

<p>discharge of waste from some sugar refineries reportedly led to an increase in diseases 
</p>
<p>among the population. SESAN conducted initial monitoring in the department of 
</p>
<p>Retalhuleu, confirming the problems. Notwithstanding the economic activity in those 
</p>
<p>departments, they register the highest rates of acute malnutrition.71  
</p>
<p>67. The Agrarian Policy, adopted in October, includes positive elements, such as a 
</p>
<p>programme providing access to land, a mechanism to address the situation of 37,000 
</p>
<p>families still living under the labourer-tenant farming regime (<i>r&#233;gimen de mozo colonato</i>), 
</p>
<p>and a scheme to contain the expansion of monocultures through local taxation. The 
</p>
<p>implementation of the policy requires the adoption of the bill on the comprehensive rural 
</p>
<p>development system, which was pending approval by Congress. 
</p>
<p>68. The Land Fund (FONTIERRAS) has resolved the situation of 100 of the 123 farms 
</p>
<p>with agrarian debt.72 In February and August, 140 families, previously evicted from the 
</p>
<p>Polochic valley<i>,</i> were relocated. Despite the Government&#8217;s commitment to relocate the 
</p>
<p>remaining 628 evicted families by the end of 2014, land was purchased for only 100 
</p>
<p>families.73 The main obstacles continue to be high land prices and the limited resources of 
</p>
<p>the Land Fund. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Labour rights  
</b></p>
<p>69. OHCHR-Guatemala continued to receive complaints regarding serious violations of 
</p>
<p>agricultural workers&#8217; labour rights, including about salaries below the daily minimum wage 
</p>
<p>(US$ 10). On some coffee farms, for example, in San Marcos, daily salaries range between 
</p>
<p>$5 and $6, on African palm plantations in the Northern Strip and Sayaxch&#233;, Pet&#233;n, salaries 
</p>
<p>are less than $8 per day, and on sugar cane plantations some of the day labourers receive 
</p>
<p>daily salaries of less than $8.60. 
</p>
<p>70. In the agricultural sector, OHCHR-Guatemala observed the practice of conditioning 
</p>
<p>salaries on reaching productivity goals imposed unilaterally by the companies. As a result, 
</p>
<p>overtime is not remunerated and workers&#8217; physical integrity and health have been affected.  
</p>
<p>71. The Ministry of Labour continued to verify respect for labour rights, and noted 
</p>
<p>serious violations in certain sectors. Of the 702 export companies (<i>maquilas</i>) inspected, 
</p>
<p>only 13 per cent paid the minimum wage, and only 15 of the 44 banana companies visited 
</p>
<p>on the Southern Coast did so.74 
</p>
<p>72. During the year, an important congressional debate was sparked by government law 
</p>
<p>initiatives on investment and employment, hourly work and reforms to the Labour Code. 
</p>
<p>While according to the Government and the business sector the initiatives could foster 
</p>
<p>investment and generate employment, trade unions indicated that their adoption would 
</p>
<p>weaken workers&#8217; rights and the monitoring ability of the Labour Inspectorate. 
</p>
<p>73. OHCHR-Guatemala received information of employees being dismissed for creating 
</p>
<p>trade unions in the rural sector. The persistent failure to implement judicial orders to 
</p>
<p>reinstate workers who have been illegally dismissed was evidenced in San Jos&#233; el Rodeo, 
</p>
<p>San Marcos, in the case of 39 workers who, despite a judicial decision, had not been 
</p>
<p>reinstated 30 months after their dismissal. In another case related to freedom to form trade 
</p>
<p>unions, workers of the Ternium company who had been dismissed in March 2012 for 
</p>
<p>establishing the first trade union could only be reinstated in December 2014, after several

<p>judicial decisions and writs of injunction at several instances.75 The trade union has still not 
</p>
<p>been recognized legally, since the company has filed several legal actions, which are still 
</p>
<p>pending in court.  
</p>
<p>74. In September 2014, under the Dominican Republic &#8211; Central America &#8211; United 
</p>
<p>States Free Trade Agreement, the Government of the United States established an 
</p>
<p>arbitration panel for non-compliance with the Implementation Plan established by 
</p>
<p>Guatemala and the United States in April 2013 to improve labour conditions. The United 
</p>
<p>States considered that key commitments of the Plan, such as the restoration of the Labour 
</p>
<p>Inspectorate&#8217;s competence to sanction, had not been fulfilled.76 The International Labour 
</p>
<p>Organization decided to defer until March 2015 its decision to appoint a commission of 
</p>
<p>inquiry. 
</p>
<p><b> X. Business and human rights  
</b></p>
<p>75. In April, the Coordinating Committee of Agricultural, Commercial, Industrial and 
</p>
<p>Financial Associations (CACIF) adopted its institutional policy on human rights. Although 
</p>
<p>the policy constitutes a step forward in integrating human rights into business practices, 
</p>
<p>challenges remain with regard to transparency and policies to prevent and address possible 
</p>
<p>negative impacts of business activities on human rights, especially on indigenous peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>rights.  
</p>
<p>76. The Association of Renewable Energy Producers continued to promote the 
</p>
<p>implementation of its Code of Ethics amongst its 49 members. This includes the 
</p>
<p>commitment to adopt a policy of transparency and access to information, respect for the 
</p>
<p>legitimate representatives of the communities in the context of consultations, and the 
</p>
<p>promotion of corporate social responsibility. 
</p>
<p><b> XI. Activities of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p>77. OHCHR-Guatemala carried out 57 missions, including some in coordination with 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, to observe the human rights situation, and 
</p>
<p>regularly met with authorities, social organizations, indigenous communities, human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders and victims and their relatives, as well as with witnesses of alleged or confirmed 
</p>
<p>human rights violations. The office also monitored judicial proceedings in paradigmatic 
</p>
<p>cases. 
</p>
<p>78. OHCHR-Guatemala observed the selection of high-level judicial authorities, 
</p>
<p>provided the Nominating Commissions with technical assistance, and accompanied the 
</p>
<p>monitoring efforts of civil society, CICIG and the United Nations system.  
</p>
<p>79. Technical assistance was provided to Congress and civil society organizations in 
</p>
<p>drawing up various legislative initiatives so that they comply with international human 
</p>
<p>rights standards. Support was given to the Secretariat of Food Security in drawing up a 
</p>
<p>protocol that allows individuals to pursue administrative remedies to demand the realization 
</p>
<p>of their right to food.

</p>
<p>The office updated the systematization of international standards for the website of the 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Court and organized two seminars. It also conducted follow-up training for 
</p>
<p>the <i>Amparos</i> Section and the Human Rights Section of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and 
</p>
<p>for the Human Rights Ombudsman&#8217;s Office on issues related to administration of justice. 
</p>
<p>82. Technical assistance was provided to the School of Legal Studies in analysing

</p>
<p>84. OHCHR-Guatemala also facilitated forums for organizations of indigenous women, 
</p>
<p>indigenous authorities, and the United Nations system to discuss the outcome document 
</p>
<p>adopted at the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples held in September.  
</p>
<p>85. Along with civil society organizations, OHCHR-Guatemala organized a seminar on 
</p>
<p>the international framework for the protection of the rights of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>Together with UNESCO, it organized a seminar on mechanisms of protection for 
</p>
<p>journalists.

</p>
<p>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, OHCHR-Guatemala held a round-table discussion on the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>87. In the context of the selection of judges to the highest courts, OHCHR-Guatemala 
</p>
<p>and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) organized public 
</p>
<p>forums on judicial independence and freedom of expression. Forums were organized on the 
</p>
<p>application of international human rights standards, the rights of LGBTI persons and the 
</p>
<p>rights of unaccompanied migrant children; a meeting of experts on disarmament was also
