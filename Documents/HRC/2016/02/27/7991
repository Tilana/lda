<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 21/21, entitled &#8220;Enhancement of 
technical cooperation and capacity-building in the field of human rights&#8221;, requested the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit a report to 
the Council at its twenty-second session on activities undertaken by the Office, other 
relevant United Nations agencies, in particular the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime, and, where applicable, regional organizations to support efforts by States to 
strengthen their judiciary system and administration of justice. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report provides an overview of activities undertaken by the following 
organizations: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the 
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Department for Peacekeeping Operations, 
International Labour Organization, International Organization for Migration, United 
Nations Children`s Fund, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Entity 
for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, Council of Europe, Organization for 
Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Commonwealth Secretariat.1  
</p>
<p><b> II. United Nations system 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>(OHCHR) 
</b></p>
<p>3. At the national level, OHCHR is involved in a large number of activities to promote 
and protect human rights in the administration of justice, including in policy development, 
normative guidance and capacity-building activities. In particular, the Office contributes to 
the development of robust, rule of law-based justice systems by providing ongoing 
assistance to Member States in human rights capacity-building activities for judges, 
prosecutors, defence lawyers and law enforcement agencies. Such assistance includes 
support and needs assessment in the field of human rights, implementation of specific 
activities, review of relevant legislation and procedures to ensure compliance with 
international human rights standards and the delivery of practical human rights training 
programmes.  
</p><p>4. OHCHR plays an important role in providing advice on draft laws to ensure that 
human rights concerns are fully taken into account and that international human rights law 
is respected, including in legislation such as criminal codes and codes of criminal 
procedure. Several OHCHR field presences have devoted special attention to assisting 
national legislative processes regarding various aspects of the administration of justice in 
recent years. For instance, in Guatemala, OHCHR provided technical assistance to the 
General Attorney&#8217;s Office in 2011, including with the adoption of internal regulations on 
strategic investigation and prosecution, particularly in cases related to the internal armed 
conflict.  
</p>
<p>5. Other examples include support to the National Congress of Honduras which 
approved new legislation on judicial governance and careers in 2011. Through the 
organization of a seminar with international experts, its participation at a plenary Congress 
</p>
<p>  
 1 A note verbale dated 2 November 2012 was sent to United Nations agencies, departments and funds, 
</p>
<p>as well as regional organizations, requesting contributions to the contents of this report. The report is 
based on the answers received. </p>


<p>session and a publication, OHCHR contributed to ensuring that the law complies with 
international standards on the independence and impartiality of the judiciary. In Kenya, the 
National Council on the Administration of Justice was established as a mechanism to 
ensure a coordinated approach to the administration of justice and secure the independence 
and accountability of the judiciary. OHCHR comments and suggestions were reflected in 
the draft bill which was adopted by Parliament. In Ecuador, the OHCHR Regional Office 
for Central America in partnership with UN Women and other actors supported the 
development of a protocol on the investigation of femicide with the objective of tackling 
the epidemic of violence against women in El Salvador and enhancing the investigative 
capacities of public prosecutors, judges and members of the police.  
</p><p>6. In addition to supporting legislative reform, OHCHR also provides support to States 
regarding policy reform. Activities, in particular related to the administration of the justice 
sector, include the 2011-2015 Strategic Plan of the Burundi Ministry of Justice, which 
contains reforms pertaining to judicial independence and accountability. Following 
advocacy work of the United Nations Office in Burundi, two key activities were undertaken 
in 2011: the organization of a national conference on justice, which will serve as a platform 
for recommendations on different issues related to judicial independence; and a study on 
the capacity-building plan for the Supreme Council of the Magistracy, which will serve as a 
preliminary step for wider reforms.  
7. In Afghanistan, the Human Rights Support Unit was established within the Ministry 
of Justice to strengthen the Government&#8217;s capacity to fulfil its international human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations under the human rights treaties it has ratified, which have also been 
incorporated into its Constitution. OHCHR/the United Nations Assistance Mission in 
Afghanistan, in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 
supported the establishment of the Unit in 2011. The Office also conducted training on the 
human rights-based approach for newly recruited staff and provided policy advice and 
technical advice to the Unit for the development of an action plan to implement 
recommendations of the universal periodic review. In Guinea-Bissau, the United Nations 
Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau facilitated the creation of an 
interdisciplinary committee to ensure the compliance of prisons and detention centres with 
international standards for detention. As a result of monitoring related to the administration 
of justice, the Government agreed to the creation of an integrated structure for the 
administration of the correctional system. OHCHR provided technical support to the 
drafting of the terms of reference for the structure in 2011. 
</p>
<p>8. Strengthening human rights compliance by judicial and law enforcement institutions 
is also a primary focus of activity for OHCHR. The joint OHCHR-Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) Rule of Law Indicators Project was launched in 2011, 
receiving the endorsement of the Rule of Law Coordination and Resource Group as a 
system-wide guidance tool. The project was implemented in Haiti and Liberia and the 
indicators were launched in South Sudan in late 2011. By March 2012, the implementation 
of the indicators was completed in all three countries. Through the project, national 
authorities are provided with the necessary information and guidance to assess and identify 
areas in need of reform, such as performance, integrity, transparency and accountability of 
national criminal justice institutions, and to ensure compliance with international standards 
regarding fair trial and the treatment of members of vulnerable groups.  
</p><p>9. OHCHR also organizes and facilitates human rights training sessions in field 
presences around the world for the judiciary, police and other security forces, including 
military forces in order to contribute to improving their compliance with international 
human rights standards. For instance, with the International Labour Organization (ILO), the 
OHCHR Regional Office for South America organized and conducted a two-month course 
in Peru in 2011 focused on the direct applicability or the interpretative value of </p>


<p>international human rights treaties in domestic courts. The course was broadcast live on the 
judiciary&#8217;s television channel for public prosecutors and judges in several judicial regions 
throughout the country, including the primarily indigenous regions. Through these 
activities, 50 public prosecutors and judges have been able to increase their awareness, 
knowledge and skills relating to the application of human rights treaties and standards 
relating to indigenous peoples. In Togo, the justice and security ministries and OHCHR 
carried out a training programme on human rights norms in the administration of justice for 
magistrates and criminal investigative police officers. The programme was the first to bring 
together these entities and contributed to enhancing their understanding of and ability to 
apply human rights norms in their work. Similarly, OHCHR helped strengthen the capacity 
of law enforcement officials in Guinea-Bissau, including those in the penitentiary system, 
through training, monitoring, reporting and advising authorities on necessary measures. 
This contributed to a significant reduction of arbitrary detentions and ill-treatment in 
prisons and detention centres and prompted the creation of an interdisciplinary committee 
to provide support to the authorities in adequately managing the penitentiary system.  
</p><p>10. In 2012, OHCHR training activities included facilitating a training workshop on 
human rights in the administration of justice for magistrates in Djibouti; facilitating 
training-of-trainers for Somali judges, law professors and other legal professionals on 
human rights in the administration of justice; supporting a workshop for judges and 
prosecutors in Tunisia on human rights in the administration of justice organized by the 
International Bar Association; supporting two training workshops for Libyan prosecutors in 
Tripoli; conducting a needs assessment mission to Egypt on activities relating to the 
administration of justice, with particular reference to training of judges, law enforcement 
personnel and parliamentarians and contributing to a training workshop for Somali military 
judges in cooperation with the Human Rights Section of the United Nations Political Office 
for Somalia.  
11. In addition, OHCHR continued efforts to ensure that individuals and groups facing 
discrimination, in particular women, minorities and indigenous peoples and people of 
African descent, have increased access to justice. For instance, in Kyrgyzstan, five Kyrgyz 
human rights non-governmental organizations (NGOs) provided free legal aid for the 
population affected during, and in the aftermath of, the June 2010 violence in the southern 
part of the country, in order to contribute to the restoration of justice and promotion and 
protection of human rights. The five NGOs received technical and financial support from 
the OHCHR Regional Office for Central Asia and maintain a network of lawyers 
experienced in criminal law who are on-call seven days a week and provide immediate 
legal representation to arrested individuals. By the end of the year 2011, more than 12 legal 
clinics had been opened in several districts of Osh and Jalal-Abad regions, including in 
marginalized areas of the country. OHCHR also strengthened the capacity of judges, 
lawyers and civil society organizations on the judicial protection of economic, social and 
cultural rights through training activities in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Central 
America and Western Africa. 
</p>
<p><b> B. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) 
</b></p>
<p>12. UNODC, through four of its five thematic pillars &#8211; crime prevention and criminal 
justice; organized crime and trafficking; corruption; and terrorism prevention &#8211; supports 
States in building the capacity of justice systems to operate more effectively within the 
framework of the rule of law. In particular, as the guardian of the United Nations standards 
and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, its work includes paying attention to 
vulnerable groups as well as providing assistance to victims and witnesses of crime, 
improving access to justice (including access to legal aid), promoting restorative justice, 
preventing gender-based violence, promoting justice for children and supporting prison </p>


<p>reform and alternatives to imprisonment. UNODC also promotes professional standards of 
conduct among criminal justice practitioners, including police officers, prosecutors and 
judges, and helps States improve criminal justice case management and monitoring and 
oversight systems.  
</p>
<p>13. In 2010&#8211;2011, UNODC, through its expanding field office network and its 
headquarters, supported 50 Member States in establishing effective, fair and humane crime 
prevention policies, strategies and programmes and reforming criminal justice systems 
based on the rule of law and in line with the international human rights standards. Main 
achievements included supporting Member States in developing and/or revising standards 
and norms relating to violence against women, women prisoners and non-custodial 
measures for women offenders, access to legal aid civilian private security services and the 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.  
</p>
<p>14. Additionally, UNODC developed 20 tools covering virtually all areas of crime 
prevention and criminal justice. They include a variety of handbooks, training curricula and 
model laws which provide guidance to United Nations agencies, Governments and 
individuals at each stage of criminal justice reform. New publications include the 
<i>Handbook on improving access to legal aid in Africa</i>,2 <i>Child-Friendly Legal Aid in Africa</i>,3 
<i>Criminal justice reform in post-conflict States: A guide for practitioners</i>,4 <i>Handbook on 
police accountability, oversight and integrity</i>,5 and <i>Criteria for the Design and Evaluation 
of Juvenile Justice Reform Programmes</i>.6 Based on the Criminal Justice Assessment 
Toolkit, UNODC also conducted assessments in 29 countries, either on all crime prevention 
and criminal justice areas or in a specific area &#8211; e.g. juvenile justice. They serve as a 
starting point for policy development and programme implementation. 
</p>
<p>15. In the area of police reforms and strengthening of prosecution services and judiciary, 
UNODC was active in Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Ghana, Kenya, Libya, Mauritius, 
Seychelles, Somaliland, South Africa, Indonesia, South-East Asia, Afghanistan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Panama, and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Main activities 
concerned comprehensive assessments of the functioning of the criminal justice systems 
covering access to police, justice, courts, the independence, impartiality and integrity of the 
judiciary and the prosecution, the distribution of equipment, the realization of training 
courses and improved monitoring of criminal justice officials. 
</p>
<p>16. Strategies and programmes on access to legal aid, with particular focus on 
vulnerable groups in society, were developed in Egypt, Jordan, Liberia, Mauritania, 
Mexico, Panama, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
Activities focused on training courses for paralegals and criminal justice actors, needs 
assessments and strengthening of the rule of law, local and State capacities for conflict 
prevention, peace building in communities. 
</p>
<p>17. In Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, El Salvador, Panama, Ethiopia, Ghana, 
Guinea-Bissau, Libya, Nigeria, South Sudan, Uganda, Indonesia, Iran, Lebanon, the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, Caribbean, UNODC assisted States in, inter alia, 
developing alternatives to imprisonment; establishing prison monitoring databases; building 
functioning penitentiary systems focusing on rehabilitating prisoners and training prison 
staff.

<p>18. Moreover, UNODC provided assistance to a multitude of States regarding 
legislation, policies, strategies and plans for children in conflict with the law, victims and 
witnesses of crime; sustainable responses to gender-based violence, the needs of women in 
prisons and development of alternatives to imprisonment for women offenders; and 
measures to empower victims through access to justice and assistance and protection 
services.  
</p>
<p> <b>C. Department for Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) 
</b></p>
<p>19. Many post-conflict countries suffer from a collapse of law and order, a security 
vacuum and a legacy of human rights violations. In such contexts, strong rule of law 
institutions are crucial for creating a secure and stable environment while strengthening the 
State&#8217;s ability to provide security, with full respect for the rule of law and human rights.  
Since 1999, the Security Council has mandated virtually all new peace operations led by 
DPKO to assist host-country authorities in strengthening the rule of law, including through 
support to their legal, judicial and prison systems. DPKO currently has justice and 
corrections components in nine peace operations. In addition, its Justice and Corrections 
Standing Capacity based in Brindisi can deploy rapidly to help start up new missions and 
reinforce existing ones. Together with OHCHR and UNDP, DPKO is a member of the 
Team of Experts on Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict. 
</p>
<p>20. Core responsibilities of justice and corrections components in peace operations 
comprise assisting national authorities in the re-establishment of justice institutions, 
including the prisons; supporting the strengthening of the constitutional and legislative 
framework and developing strategies for the development of the rule of law sector; 
preparing and implementing integrated United Nations police, judicial and corrections 
strategies and programmes in support of security, justice and stabilization; training and 
advising magistrates, corrections officers and other rule of law personnel and supporting 
their deployment; facilitating the rehabilitation of judicial and prison infrastructure and the 
provision of equipment; and providing technical assistance for the prosecution of serious 
crimes. 
</p>
<p>21. In 2011, the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo helped to construct and supply equipment for four tribunals in North 
and South Kivu. The mission has also helped the Government to prosecute more than 150 
military officers accused of committing serious crimes against civilians. Following the 
April/May 2011 post-electoral crisis in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the United Nations Operation in C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire helped with the reopening of 37 courts and the rehabilitation of 22 prisons. 
Similarly, the African Union&#8211;United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur has supported the 
national authorities with the reopening of courts in West and North Darfur. The United 
Nations Mission in South Sudan is providing the Government of South Sudan with 
technical and logistical support to establish mobile courts. 
</p>
<p>22. The United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste assisted in the drafting of the 
Audit Chamber Law, which has allowed the Audit Court to assume an independent 
oversight role over public funds. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti has 
provided logistical support for the establishment and management of legal aid offices, 18 of 
which were operating throughout the country by the beginning of 2012. The United Nations 
Mission in Liberia has been supporting the Law Reform Commission tasked with 
streamlining the law reform and review process there.  
</p>
<p>23. DPKO, in collaboration with United Nations country teams, has also been assisting 
prison authorities in host countries with the development of national frameworks governing 
corrections institutions, such as standard operating procedures for prison officers in Timor-
Leste and prison registries and data management system in Cote d&#8217;Ivoire. Assistance has </p>


<p>also been provided to national authorities to conduct mapping and assessments of prison 
facilities, such as the cartography of prisons in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
Through the deployment of Government-provided corrections personnel, the collocation 
and mentoring programmes in the prison facilities have led to enhanced capacity of national 
prison personnel on prison management.   
</p>
<p><b> D. International Labour Organization (ILO) 
</b></p>
<p>24. ILO provides training on a regular basis to familiarize national labour court judges, 
legal professionals and legal educators with the key human rights principles of the ILO 
Recommendation No. 200 (2010) concerning HIV and AIDS and the World of Work and to 
promote implementation of its provisions. In 2011&#8211;2012, training on the key principles of 
Recommendation No. 200 was provided to judges, lawyers and magistrates in Brazil, 
China, India, Liberia and Senegal. In 2012, ILO trained labour judges and magistrates in 
Cameroon and Senegal. In addition, an in-depth training course was held for 25 high-level 
labour court judges from Botswana, Malawi, Nigeria and South Africa in the context of a 
course focusing on gender equality and the application of international instruments, 
including international labour standards. The training course also addressed the issue of 
procedural safeguards that protect the rights of persons living with HIV. 
</p>
<p><b> E. International Organization for Migration (IOM) 
</b></p>
<p>25. In order to improve and support the protection of the rights of migrants, IOM is 
working closely with national Governments to strengthen their justice systems. In the 
projects and programmes aimed at capacity building, IOM assists Governments in 
developing and implementing migration legislation and procedures consistent with 
applicable international and regional standards. The objective is to strengthen both the 
capacity of Governments to govern migration more effectively and consistently with the 
rule of law, and training in international law, including human rights, for those working 
directly with migrants, such as police, judges, prosecutors and border management officials.   
</p>
<p>26. In some areas, such as counter-trafficking, IOM provides technical cooperation 
activities to build capacities of both government and civil society institutions to better 
address the challenges posed by human trafficking. Relevant examples include, for 
instance, Colombia, where IOM implemented a project named &#8220;Technical Assistance to the 
Administrative Reparation Programme&#8221; with the goal of supporting the Government of 
Colombia in carrying out a programme, which aims to assist victims of illegal armed 
groups with compensation and provide them with ease of access to the reparation process. 
In Guatemala, IOM has established a series of trainings on trafficking for more than 600 
judges in Guatemala. Furthermore, IOM oversees a broader regional programme for 
migrants in Mesoamerica. The initiative offers similar trainings for judges in Central 
American countries and technical cooperation to Governments, and promotes dialogue, 
exchange, and sharing of information and best practices.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>27. In Nicaragua, IOM implemented the &#8220;Supporting Regional Integration through 
Improved Migration Management in Central America&#8221; project to combat and prevent 
</p>
<p>trafficking and support victims&#8217; reintegration. In collaboration with the Anti-Trafficking 
National Coalition, IOM also helps to prosecute traffickers and promote the participation of 
an active community and private sector to strengthen the local network in order to defend 
victims of trafficking and provides assistance for institutional capacity-building in 
Nicaragua to ensure victims&#8217; access to justice.  </p>


<p>28. In Turkey<b>,</b> IOM carried out a project named &#8220;Supporting Turkey&#8217;s Efforts to 
Combat Human Trafficking and Promote Access to Justice for All Trafficked Persons&#8221;. In 
Ukraine, between 2000 and 2011, IOM Ukraine provided assistance to victims of 
trafficking to reintegrate into society. Support included legal consultation and 
representation in criminal and civil court.  
</p>
<p>29. In the Baltic States, targeted at law enforcement officials, prosecutors, lawyers, and 
civil society representatives, the IOM project named &#8220;The Counter-Trafficking Capacity 
Building and Awareness Raising Activities for Officials in the Baltic States&#8221; aims to 
combat and prevent trafficking specifically in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The project, 
carried out in training and seminars, focuses on strengthening capacity building and 
development for law enforcement and Government officials. The results are increased 
efficiency of the prosecution process and enhanced partnerships and cooperation between 
regions. 
</p>
<p><b> F. United Nations Children</b>&#8217;<b>s Fund (UNICEF) 
</b></p>
<p>30. UNICEF is working with Government partners in over 100 countries to improve 
justice for children, with a particular focus on legislative reform, capacity-building, 
advocacy, coordination and partnership, for children in conflict with the law and for child 
victims and witnesses. Efforts to develop and raise awareness of national law and 
procedures are a priority for many offices, and advocacy and technical assistance regarding 
law reform take international human rights standards into account. With UNICEF support, 
an estimated 33 countries undertook comprehensive mapping and assessment exercises in 
2010&#8211;2011.  
</p>
<p>31. UNICEF has provided support to countries from different regions which have or are 
currently undertaking legislative reform to ensure alignment with the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women (e.g. Brazil, Colombia, Rwanda). Seventy countries have legal or policy 
frameworks in place for preventing and responding to child abuse in line with international 
human rights standards and 77 countries have laws and secondary legislation on free and 
universal birth registration. An important number of countries have developed laws on 
juvenile procedures (e.g. Bangladesh, Cambodia, Jordan). UNICEF offices in around 130 
countries report that Governments are taking, or partially taking, measures to implement the 
Guidelines on Justice in Matters Involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime (e.g. 
Costa Rica, Croatia, Madagascar).  
</p>
<p>32. Prevention of violence is part of the UNICEF child protection systems approach, one 
objective of which is to reduce the estimated number of one million children who are in 
detention. These efforts include advocating for increasing and upholding minimum-age 
criminal responsibility legislation, and proactive measures that prevent children from 
entering in conflict with the law. Tunisia and Belarus country offices, for example, carried 
out research into the causes of delinquency.  
</p>
<p>33. The UNICEF child protection strategy is directed towards the reduction of the 
number of children in detention. In this regard, 2011 outputs include the development of the 
online Toolkit on Diversion and Alternatives to Detention. In Lebanon, 207 children in 
conflict with the law benefited from the implementation of the community sentencing as an 
alternative measures to detention. In Jordan, similar progress was made regarding the 
protection of children in conflict with the law by providing them access to restorative 
justice approaches through a pilot community-based diversion project being set up in two 
communities. A special juvenile police was established to tackle children in conflict with 
the law cases. In Thailand, a strengthened juvenile justice system to promote prevention, 
diversion, restorative justice and reintegration for children in contact with the law was </p>


<p>developed, including reintegration support services for juvenile offenders and a restorative 
justice centre. In Bangladesh, UNICEF supported the launching of a pilot &#8220;diversion&#8221; 
</p>
<p>initiative in one district, establishing a coordination mechanism between the police, 
judiciary, probation officers, lawyers and local elected bodies to prevent unnecessary 
placement of children in institutions and therefore channel children in conflict with the law 
away from judicial proceeding.  
</p>
<p>34. The capacities of law enforcement and the justice sector were improved in a number 
of countries as a result of UNICEF work. For example, in Honduras, over 350 staff were 
trained in the prevention, investigation and protection of the rights of child victims of 
abuse, sexual exploitation and trafficking. In Uruguay, UNICEF supported the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in implementing a course on sexual abuse. More countries are also 
investing in comprehensive support services for children who have experienced sexual 
violence, including health, legal, protective and counseling services. For example, in 
Zimbabwe, UNICEF contributed to a review of the protocol on multisectoral management 
of child sexual abuse. In Argentina, intersectoral coordination to address cases of child 
sexual abuse has improved through the development of integrated protocols for care. In 
Chile, a clinical guide to care for child victims of sexual abuse younger than age 15 has 
been developed by the Ministry of Health, with subsequent training for professionals. 
</p>
<p><b> G. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
</b></p>
<p>35. Rule of law, access to justice and legal empowerment of the poor are at the core of 
the UNDP contribution to sustainable human development. UNDP supports rule of law in 
over 100 countries that are stable, experiencing political transition or conflict-affected 
contexts. In line with its mandate, UNDP focuses on improving access to justice for the 
poor and marginalized, with a particular focus on women, involving support to the legal 
empowerment of the poor; improving access to justice through informal, non-State and 
customary justice systems, and legal aid and other justice services. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>36. UNDP supports capacity-strengthening of the formal justice system with the aim of 
improving efficiency, transparency, accountability and accessibility in the civil and 
criminal justice systems. Support includes improving court administration and management 
through improved case management, capacity development of justice actors and 
strengthening systems of oversight and integrity, coordinated support to justice sector 
through sector wide strategies, support to police and prisons and criminal justice 
functioning, juvenile justice administration, civil matters related to land, property, 
inheritance, family and other matters, and citizen security and violence reduction.  
</p>
<p>37. For instance, in Swaziland, UNDP is currently supporting the High Court in 
installation of a case management system for efficient management of their service and 
access to justice. In Malawi, UNDP is engaged in the development of a sector-wide 
approach to democratic governance, which includes rule of law and access to justice, 
established in 2009/2010, and the Sector Strategic Plan for 2012&#8211;2016. UNDP has 
longstanding rule of law programming in Bangladesh, where from 2005 until today it, inter 
alia, has led on community policing and police reform. Another country with a 
comprehensive approach is Indonesia, where UNDP has been engaged since 2004 in 
strengthening rights-based legal and justice sector reform. 
</p>
<p>38. With over 80 per cent of disputes resolved through informal justice systems, 
improving access to justice for the poor requires recognition of the important role of 
traditional or informal justice systems in delivering affordable, accessible and culturally 
relevant justice to communities. At the country level in these areas, UNDP supported 
assessments, studies; convened dialogue processes aimed at catalysing policy and legal 
reform, evidence-based programming and capacity development and supported South-</p>


<p>South learning in over 20 developing countries. For instance, UNDP in Argentina<b> </b>is 
supporting development of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) strategies. In the Republic 
of Moldova<b>,</b> court efficiency is being enhanced through identification of an ADR 
mechanism, while in Serbia an ADR database system is being developed and piloted in 
anti-discrimination cases. In Somalia, UNDP support to traditional justice mechanisms and 
the empowerment of women&#8217;s groups to engage with these mechanisms have improved the 
</p>
<p>administration of cases concerning women. In Niger<b>,</b> UNDP is also supporting increased 
attention to gender equality in the customary justice system.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>39. At the<b> </b>regional level, UNDP supported in 2012 the development of the <i>Guide on 
Legal Aid Programming in Africa</i>, which takes an expansive view of legal services for 
criminal and civil matters. In partnership with UNODC, UNDP has commenced the process 
of elaborating a handbook and curriculum on early access to legal aid in criminal 
investigation and proceedings, which will be finalized in 2013.  
</p>
<p>40. At country level in over 50 developing countries, UNDP supports legal aid and 
services programming through establishment of legal aid centres, legal and paralegal 
assistance networks, development of relevant institutional, policy and legislative 
frameworks and the requisite capacity and awareness. For instance, in Mozambique<b>,</b> UNDP 
supported establishment of legal aid clinics and one-stop shops at district level which 
resulted in 4,472 individuals benefiting, including 3,647 persons in pretrial detention. In 
Maldives, UNDP supported the establishment of gender-sensitive legal aid schemes. Other 
countries in which UNDP has supported legal aid include Ethiopia, Georgia, Indonesia, 
Montenegro, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Swaziland<b>.</b> </p>
<p>41. As a core element of UNDP rule of law programming, legal empowerment of the 
poor is seen as central in helping countries to attain inclusive and sustainable human 
development through introduction of systemic changes to empower the poor and provide 
them with opportunities for earning a livelihood through access to property and land, 
labour, and environment and business rights.7 </p>
<p>42. For instance, in the Philippines, UNDP is supporting environmental justice, which 
work has resulted in the Philippines passing of Rules of Procedure for Environmental 
Cases. Additionally, in 2011, a book entitled <i>Access to Environmental Justice: A 
Sourcebook on Environmental Rights and Legal Remedies </i>was developed and launched. In 
China, UNDP is also taking a legal empowerment approach to environmental justice 
through supporting the All-China Environment Federation to strengthen the role of civil 
society organizations in environmental governance and legal processes, including 
representation of public interests as plaintiff in China&#8217;s environmental tribunals.  
</p>
<p><b> H. United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Women (UN Women) 
</b></p>
<p>43. In accordance with its mandate to advance gender equality and the empowerment of 
women, UN Women continues to support efforts by States to strengthen their judiciary 
systems and contribute to ensuring women&#8217;s access to justice.  
</p>
<p>44. In response to the findings and recommendations of UN Women&#8217;s flagship report 
for 2011&#8211;2012, Progress of the World&#8217;s Women: In Pursuit of Justice, UN Women, UNDP 
and OHCHR are developing a joint global programme on women&#8217;s access to justice, aimed 
at supporting efforts to enhance women&#8217;s access to justice through comprehensive and 
coordinated justice sector reforms.  
</p>
<p>  
 7 &#8220;Integrating Legal Empowerment of the Poor into UNDP&#8217;s work, A Guidance Note&#8221;, 2010. </p>


<p>45. UN Women, in partnership with UNDP and UNICEF commissioned a study 
launched in 2012, <i>Informal Justice Systems: Charting a Course for Human Rights-Based 
Engagement</i>, which offers the first comprehensive assessment of informal justice systems 
and human rights protection.  
</p>
<p>46.  In 2012, UN Women carried out a mapping of specialized training for judges and 
lawyers on women&#8217;s human rights and gender equality issues, supported by the United 
Nations system, with a view to identifying the extent and types of capacity-building 
programmes and ascertaining good practices and lessons learned.  
</p>
<p>47. UN Women has supported various capacity-building initiatives for judges, 
magistrates, prosecutors, lawyers, paralegals and other legal actors in the formal and 
informal justice sectors in various countries. The training initiatives have focused in 
particular on sexual and gender-based violence, including during armed conflict, gender 
equality in the workplace, women&#8217;s rights within the family and women&#8217;s access to justice, 
</p>
<p>including through transitional justice mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>48. For instance, since 2009 UN Women has been implementing a three-year project on 
women&#8217;s access to justice in conflict and post-conflict aimed at strengthening the rule of 
law, justice and security in Uganda by supporting the justice law and order sector. UN 
Women continues to work with the Ugandan justice law and order sector to inform the 
existing manual on the prosecution of sexual and gender-based violence crimes. Key 
activities include developing training materials for prosecutors, police and court staff on 
gender-sensitive investigations and prosecutions; helping to develop gender-sensitive rules 
of procedure building on international best practice and supporting the Office of the 
Directorate of Public Prosecutions by building capacity for gender-sensitive prosecution. 
</p>
<p>49. UN Women supported an intervention in Kosovo: the project &#8220;Women Building 
Peace and Human Security in the Western Balkans: Implementing UN SCR 1325&#8221; focused 
on working with security sector agencies, including the Kosovo Judicial Institute and the 
Kosovo Judges Association. In respect of access to justice for survivors of violence, UN 
Women supported two initiatives of the justice sector: engaging judges and prosecutors in a 
dialogue on improved access to justice for women and training justice professionals on 
women&#8217;s human rights provided by the Kosovo Judicial Institute.  
</p>
<p>50. As part of a broader intervention in Albania on strengthening legal and institutional 
frameworks, between 2007 and 2010, UN Women supported capacity-building initiatives 
for judges and prosecutors on gender equality and women&#8217;s human rights. As a direct result 
</p>
<p>of the work, the School of Magistrates&#8217; courses on family law, labour law, criminal law and 
social assistance law have been revised to include gender equality and domestic violence 
content as well as legal obligations of duty-bearers. 
</p>
<p>51. In Kenya, UN Women supported the Kenya Women Judges Association in building 
the capacity of judges, magistrates and kadhis to apply international and regional human 
rights instruments in court decisions. With support from UN Women, a training manual was 
developed by the association which is currently used by judicial officers and there are plans 
to incorporate it into the judicial academy&#8217;s curriculum. One exemplary judgment that 
followed the training was a case of inheritance in which the judge, referring to the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, ruled that a 
girl child can inherit land, reversing a custom that would have precluded such inheritance. 
</p>
<p>52. In Serbia, UN Women supported the development of educational modules on 
women&#8217;s socioeconomic rights, gender-based discrimination and gender equality in the 
workplace based on international and domestic law. In 2011, the modules were approved by 
the Judicial Academy&#8217;s Program Council and are now included as an integral part of 
mandatory Judicial Academy&#8217;s curriculum. In 2011, UN Women also supported 
development of a pool of experts consisting of judges and gender advocates from academia </p>


<p>and Government institutions to be responsible for delivering training to judges based on the 
modules adopted. During 2011, training was delivered to more than 140 judges based on 
the modules.  
</p>
<p>53. In 2010, UN Women supported initiatives to improve access to justice for women 
survivors of violence and ethnic-based discrimination in both indigenous and formal justice 
systems, educational programmes in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Ecuador, Honduras, 
Guatemala, Panama and Peru. The purpose of the work is to build the capacity of judicial 
personnel in order to improve access to formal and informal justice systems for indigenous 
women and, in particular, to ensure better protection of women&#8217;s right to be free from all 
forms violence. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Regional organizations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Council of Europe 
</b></p>
<p>54. The efficiency and quality of independent judicial systems in its member States 
remain a priority for the Council. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>55. The European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) aims to improve 
the efficiency and quality of the day-to-day functioning of the justice systems of member 
States. Its ongoing work focuses in particular on:<b> 
</b></p>
<p>(a) The evaluation of the judicial systems of all its member States thanks to the 
collection and analysis of data through a specific scheme aiming at identifying main trends 
of these systems and defining the Council&#8217;s priorities to improve justice efficiency; 
</p>
<p>(b) The concrete knowledge of lengths of proceedings in the member States so as 
to propose pragmatic tools and measures to improve judicial time management, through the 
work of the SATURN Centre, which is due to evolve towards a genuine permanent 
European observatory of judicial timeframes, with the support of the CEPEJ Network of 
Pilot courts; 
</p>
<p>(c) Preparation of concrete tools for promoting the quality of justice; 
</p>
<p>(d) The European Day of Civil Justice, co-organized in all European countries 
with the European Commission, including the European prize for innovative practice 
contributing to the quality of justice &#8220;The Crystal Scales of Justice&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(e) The adoption of guidelines for a better implementation of the existing 
Council recommendations concerning mediation, execution of court decisions or judicial 
time management. </p>
<p>56. The Council attaches special importance to dialogue with members of the judicial 
service. The Consultative Council of European Judges is the first body consisting solely of 
judges ever set up within an international organisation. It supports the Committee of 
Ministers in carrying out the priorities identified in the Framework Global Action Plan for 
Judges in Europe and advises on whether it is necessary to update legal instruments. The 
Consultative Council may be called upon to provide practical assistance to help States 
comply with standards relating to judges.  
</p>
<p>57. The prosecuting authorities also play a crucial role as the interface between 
Governments, which are responsible for crime policy, and courts, which must be 
independent. Their functions and powers thus depend on a balance, which is not easily 
defined. The Council of Europe works to define such a balance in Recommendation No. 19 
(2000) on the role of public prosecution in the criminal justice system.  </p>


<p>58. The Committee of Ministers decided in 2005 to create the Consultative Council of 
European Prosecutors. This consultative body has, in particular, the task of preparing 
opinions for the Committee in order to facilitate and promote the implementation of 
Recommendation No. 19 (2000) and collect information about the functioning of 
prosecution services in Europe. The Consultative Council has also been given the task of 
continuing to organize regular European conferences of prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>59. Under its various programmes, the Council has developed a number of assistance 
activities in order to help its member States on issues relating to the reform of their justice 
systems. Current programmes for supporting judicial reforms are being implemented in 
Armenia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Ukraine and, at a regional level, with the countries of the 
Eastern Partnership (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Republic of Moldova and Ukraine) and 
soon in Albania. In addition, cooperation is taking place within the framework of the 
Council&#8217;s neighbourhood policy with Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia. 
</p>
<p>60. The European Network for the exchange of information between persons and 
entities responsible for the training of judges and public prosecutors supports the 
development of judicial training in the Council&#8217;s member States. The Network meets 
regularly to discuss topics of common interest, such as the training of judges and 
prosecutors, in matters relating to their professional skills, obligations and ethics. 
</p>
<p>61. The HELP Programme supports the Council&#8217;s member States in implementing the 
European Convention on Human Rights at national level. This is done by enhancing the 
capacity of judges, lawyers and prosecutors in all 47 member States to apply the 
Convention in their daily work. 
</p>
<p>62. A large peer-to-peer European Human Rights Training Network among national 
training institutions for judges and prosecutors and bar associations has been created, with 
the aim of encouraging and facilitating multilateral meetings, the identification of the most 
urgent training needs for legal professionals, the sharing of best practice and the knowledge 
of different national jurisprudence based on the Convention. 
</p>
<p>63. The HELP website provides free online access to materials and tools for 
professional training on the Convention. Following the recommendations of the participants 
of the 2012 HELP Network Conference, several initiatives have been taken in the last 
months: 
</p>
<p>(a) National pages in national languages have been created and made available 
on the HELP website for a first group of pilot countries; 
</p>
<p>(b) National experts have been appointed as HELP Focal Points in 14 pilot 
countries, to cooperate with national training institutions and organize national events 
focused on disseminating the use of the HELP resources among national legal professionals; 
</p>
<p>(c) New curricula and training materials are being developed; 
</p>
<p>(d) The HELP website is undergoing continuous improvement and now includes 
a section entitled &#8220;HELP in 47&#8221; where news on Convention training activities from all 
member States is published in English to serve as examples of best practice. 
</p>
<p>64. In the framework of the HELP Programme, a separate project has been developed on 
enhancing the capacity of lawyers to comply with the admissibility criteria in applications 
submitted to the European Court of Human Rights. This project is currently focused on 6 
pilot countries: Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, the Russian Federation 
and Turkey. </p>


<p><b> B. Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) is the 
specialized institution of OSCE dealing with elections, human rights and democratization. 
OSCE/ODIHR is involved in a large number of activities to support efforts by States to 
strengthen their administration of justice, in particular in the areas of trial monitoring, 
criminal justice reform, administrative justice, electoral dispute resolution and 
independence of the judiciary.   
</p>
<p>66. With the purpose of maximizing OSCE expertise in monitoring trials, contributing 
to the sustainability of OSCE trial monitoring programmes, and building the capacity of 
partner NGOs by enhancing their substantive and methodological skills, ODIHR has 
developed methodological tools on trial monitoring, including <i>Trial-Monitoring: A 
Reference Manual for Practitioners8 </i>and<i> Legal Digest of International Fair Trial Rights</i>.9 
ODIHR has, for instance, trained NGOs and attorneys from Belarus and Kyrgyzstan on trial 
monitoring methodologies.  
67. Another focus of ODIHR is the reform of criminal justice systems. ODIHR has been 
developing projects in cooperation with OSCE field operations present in Central Asia and 
in the Caucasus to foster regional exchanges between relevant actors of the criminal justice 
system and provide expertise on specific issues of interest to the protection of fair trial 
rights in criminal procedures. For instance, in October 2012, ODIHR organized the Fourth 
Expert Forum on Criminal Justice for Central Asia where around 100 policymakers, 
members of the judiciary, prosecution and legal profession, academics and NGO 
representatives gathered to discuss latest trends in criminal justice reforms in the region.  
</p>
<p>68. In the Republic of Moldova, ODIHR conducted an assessment of the newly 
established Superior Council of Prosecutors in 2010. Assistance in strengthening judicial, 
prosecutorial and bar structures throughout the OSCE region remains a key issue for access 
to justice and the right to a fair trial and will constitute a cornerstone in ODIHR work in the 
period to come. 
</p>
<p>69.  Additionally, in October 2011, ODIHR completed the War Crimes Justice Project, 
in partnership with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the 
United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, with the support from 
the OSCE field operations in the Western Balkans. The project contributed to enhancing the 
capacity of the institutions for prosecuting and adjudicating war crimes cases, facilitated 
exchange of experience between justice actors from the region and the Tribunal; transferred 
relevant material from the Tribunal to the region; and fostered regional cooperation 
between legal professionals. ODIHR continues supporting the jurisdictions of the countries 
to enhance their capacity to process war crimes cases. Activities include further 
strengthening the institutional capacity of training institutions and legal practitioners, 
through peer-to-peer meetings and targeted training based on curriculums developed under 
the project.  
70. Monitoring court proceedings for their compliance with international and European 
fair trial standards is of key importance to supporting States&#8217; reform efforts, also related to 
administrative justice systems. To support monitoring of administrative courts and promote 
fair trial rights in administrative judicial proceedings, ODIHR in partnership with the 
Swedish Folke Bernadotte Academy started developing the <i>Handbook on Monitoring 
Administrative Justice</i>. Through distribution and promotion of the handbook, ODIHR aims 
</p>
<p>  
 8 Warsaw, 2008.  
 9 Warsaw, 2012.  </p>


<p>to support the growing trend of establishing separate courts or specialized chambers dealing 
with judicial review of administrative acts in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe (Albania, 
Serbia, Ukraine), South Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia) and upcoming efforts in 
Central Asia (Kazakhstan). OHCHR has been a counterpart in this endeavour since 2011.   
</p>
<p>71. Another area of ODIHR activities to support States&#8217; efforts to strengthen their 
judicial system is the resolution of electoral disputes, which is at the core of the ODIHR 
mandate to assist OSCE-participating States in ensuring free and fair elections. ODIHR 
assists OSCE-participating States in following up on recommendations made in ODIHR 
election-observation reports, including on electoral disputes. In 2012, ODIHR started 
assisting countries bilaterally with a pilot round table on election dispute resolution in 
Kyrgyzstan, where all relevant stakeholders &#8211; including the judiciary and national court and 
election observers &#8211; gathered to discuss how to implement the respective recommendations 
from the ODIHR <i>Election Observation Mission Report</i>.10  
</p>
<p>72. ODIHR also assists OSCE-participating States&#8217; efforts to strengthen judicial 
independence and accountability. For this purpose, it has developed, jointly with the Max 
Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law and a group of experts, 
concrete and technical policy suggestions, namely the Kyiv Recommendations on Judicial 
Independence in Eastern Europe, South Caucasus and Central Asia, at a regional meeting in 
</p><p>2010. This document serves as basis for ODIHR support to States in the region providing 
policy advice and participating in reform debates, as was done in Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, the 
Republic of Moldova and Ukraine. In some States, ODIHR consultations about the 
relevance of the Kyiv Recommendations for strengthening judicial independence in the 
national reform context have led to technical assistance projects offered in cooperation with 
OSCE field operations, such as training for members of the Council for the Selection of 
Judges in Kyrgyzstan in 2011 (followed by an analytical report on selection of judges in 
Kyrgyzstan in March 2012) and developing criteria and procedures for evaluating the 
performance of judges in the Republic of Moldova in 2012.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Commonwealth Secretariat 
</b></p>
<p>73. Enhancing international cooperation is at the core of the Commonwealth 
Secretariat&#8217;s activities. Primary goals of its technical cooperation programmes are 
supporting its member countries in strengthening their judiciary system and administration 
of justice as well as promoting respect for human rights. The Commonwealth Secretariat&#8217;s 
work on strengthening the judiciary and the administration of justice is carried out by the 
Justice Section of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Division. The work is demand 
driven and tailor-made to the needs of the requesting member State. Most requests received 
revolve around strengthening court registries and building the capacity of court staff, 
effective case-flow management and training for judicial officers in the subordinate and 
superior courts. The nature of any assistance is usually identified through needs assessment 
missions and consultations on how best the capacity of the judicial system can be enhanced. 
The <i>Handbook of Best Practice for Registrars of Final/Appellate, Regional and 
International Courts and Tribunals</i>11 was developed and disseminated in member countries. 
</p>
<p>74. The Justice Section provides training to judicial officers and court administration 
staff. Training activities are conducted either in-country or by sponsoring the participation 
of judicial officers in relevant and appropriate courses and/or events held abroad.  
</p>
<p>  
 10 Warsaw, 2010.  
 11 London, 2012.   </p>


<p>75. The primary focus of assistance includes the training of court staff and the judiciary 
as well as the training of trainers; the preparation of court manuals; training on case-flow 
management; assistance with organizational development and strategic planning for courts; 
assistance in protecting the rights of juveniles in the judicial system; how to deal with 
vulnerable witnesses in court; assistance in compiling domestic laws and judgments. Recent 
countries to benefit under this project include Cameroon, Maldives, Samoa, Seychelles, 
Swaziland, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia. Other examples include training 
to the judiciary of Rwanda on the assessment of damages in civil cases (December 2011 
and October 2012); and regional training to the judiciary in the Southern Africa region held 
in Zambia (March 2012) on a suitable legal framework for a sustainable investment and 
business environment.  
</p>
<p>76. Assistance is also provided upon request to jurisdictions seeking training in judicial 
ethics as well as training in substantive areas of domestic law. For instance, a workshop on 
judicial independence was held in Cameroon in June 2012 focused on how the maintenance 
of high standards of judicial behaviour contributes to public confidence in the profession. A 
workshop held in Papua New Guinea in February 2012 focused on the relevance of the 
Latimer House Principles12 to judicial independence, ethics and the protection of human 
rights. In March 2012 in Botswana, a workshop was held on strengthening a jurisprudence 
of equality in regards to violence against women. Other examples of technical assistance 
relating to the judiciary include: assistance to the judiciary of Rwanda in October 2012 on 
the assessment of damages; and training of magistrates in Belize on strengthening the 
administration of justice in June 2011. Ongoing assistance has been provided to Maldives 
since 2009 to strengthen the capacity of the judiciary to include: attendance at high-level 
training courses for senior members of the judiciary overseas; and study visits to judiciaries 
in other Commonwealth countries.  
</p>
<p>77. The Justice Section provides technical advice to the Governance and Institutional 
Development Division on the placement/appointment of judges in small Commonwealth 
jurisdictions to address the problem of lack of capacity. These judges assist in clearing case 
backlogs; strengthening the administration of justice and maintaining the independence and 
integrity of member State judiciaries. Under this initiative, judges have over the years been 
sent to: Belize, the Gambia, Lesotho, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, 
Swaziland, Tonga and Vanuatu. The Justice Section also provided technical advice to the 
Division on the appointment of an expert to conduct a scoping mission with a view to 
placing on digital record, the Vital Statistics of Tonga in 2009.13  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Although only representing a small sample of activities across United Nations 
agencies, programmes and funds as well as regional organizations, the report reflects 
</b></p>
<p><b>that strengthening States` judiciary systems and ensuring a fair and efficient 
</b></p>
<p><b>administration of justice is a common concern among the United Nations and regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations. The work of the different organizations underscores the particularly 
</b></p>
<p><b>crucial role of human rights in the administration of justice.

<p>79. <b>Activities are manifold and range from standard-setting to capacity-building at 
national level. They reflect the mandates of the respective organizations. However, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>increasing focus on and importance of implementing international standards at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country level, in particular ensuring respect for international human rights law, 
</b></p>
<p><b>becomes apparent as a common feature. The report also highlights successful
