Cypress Development Corp. has prepared this technical report detailing  base 
and  precious  metal  exploration  results  on  its  100%  owned  Gunman  Property 
located in White Pine County, Nevada.  Cypress owns the mineral rights to 55 
federal lode claims covering approximately 1140 acres.  The property location 
is shown on figure 1-1 below.  The map also shows the position of active and 
historic  mines, Tertiary  age  intrusions,  paleo  hot  spring  sinters  and  jasperiod 
alteration  zones  within  the  southern  extension  of  the  regional  scale  Carlin 
Trend.
Surface sampling and drilling on the property has resulted in the discovery of a 
series  of  zones  of  zinc  and  silver  mineralization  over  a  strike  length  of 
approximately  2500  feet.    The  northern  most  mineralization  known  on  the 
property  was  discovered  at  the  end  of  the  most  recent  drill  program  in  2007 
and  this  mineralization  remains  essentially  unexplored.    No  mineral  resource 
calculations have been done on the Gunman property 
 
The  mineralization  at  Gunman  appears  to  be  of  carbonate  replacement  style 
with central zones of massive mineralization being flanked by halos of partial 
replacement  and  veining.    The  replacements  are  now  very  strongly  oxidized 
within  400  feet  of  surface.    Rare  sulfide  mineralization,  sphalerite,  pyrite  and 
argentite, is seen at the base of the oxidized portion of the high grade zones. 
 
Cominco  Ltd.  conducted  a  due  diligence  investigation  of  the  Gunman  project 
following  discovery  of  very  high  zinc  and  silver  mineralization  by  Cypress  in 
2000.  As part of the due diligence work, Cominco conducted a series of zinc 
assays  using  an  acetic  acid  leach  method.    The  results  indicate  that  zinc 
recovery  from  oxidized  mineralization  at  Gunman  by  acetic  acid  leaching  is 
excellent.  A  comparison  chart  of  ICP  assay  vs.  Acetic  Acid  Leach  assay  is 
presented in Section 16 of this report. 
 
The mineralization is hosted by karsted, and locally decalcified, silty limestone 
of Permian age.  Zinc and silver mineralized zones are flanked on the east by 
copper  oxide  mineralization  hosted  by  a  distinctive,  decalcified  poly-lithic 
sandstone, also of Permian age.  
  
The RH Zone lies in the central portion of the 2500 foot strike length of known 
mineralization.    Mineralization  within  the  RH  Zone  is  spectacular  for  its  zinc 
and  silver  grade,  for  the  down  hole  interval  length  of  the  very  high  grade 
mineralization  and  for  the  continuous  nature  of  zinc  grades  in  excess  of  5% 
accompanied by multi ounce silver values.  The mineralization is also located 
close to surface.

Very  impressive  oxide  zinc  and  silver  mineralization  was  found  in  reverse 
circulation  drilling  of  the  RH  Zone  in  several  holes  including  hole  GM-26  in 
August  of  2000.    The  interval  from  40  to  250  feet  down  hole,  a  210  foot 
interval,  including  lower  grade  upper  and  lower  contact  zones,  grades 13.1% 
zinc and 126 ppm silver.  This interval includes a 165 foot interval from 50 feet 
down hole to 215 feet down hole that assayed 16.6% zinc and 156 ppm silver. 
 
A potential analog to the zinc and silver mineralization at the Gunman property 
is found at the Eureka mining district, located 27 miles SSW of the project.  A 
series  of  high  grade  precious  metal  –  base  metal  carbonate  replacement 
deposits  were  mined  historically  at  Eureka.    These  were  described  by  the 
USGS in 1884, and many times since, as being of intrusion related, carbonate 
replacement type.  The deposits were worked as under-ground operations and 
were  famous  for  very  high  grade  oxide  mineralization  containing  very  high 
lead, zinc, silver and gold.  It is noted here that, unlike in the Eureka district, no 
intrusions have been identified at Gunman. 
 
Mineralization  at  Gunman  appears  to  be  controlled  by  a  series  of  well-
developed NNE trending fracture zones. This setting is seen in other locations 
along  the  Carlin  and  Battle  Mountain  gold  trends  where  north-south  to  NNE 
alignments  of  mineralization  and  ore  zones  are  located  in  cross  cutting 
structural zones within or adjacent to the main NNW striking trends.  
 
Jasperiod rubble crop lies at surface along the western flank of the largest and 
highest grade of the discovered zones at Gunman.  These jasperoid boulders 
and  rubble  crop  are  highly  anomalous  in  Zn-Ag-Au-As-Cu  and  Hg,  a 
geochemical  signature  common  in  jasperoids  within  controlling  faults  above 
and within Carlin style gold deposits. 
 
The complex carbonate and calcareous clastic sediments that host the known 
mineralization  lie  in  the  east  limb  of  a  north  striking  syncline.    This  rock 
package dips steeply west into the nose of the syncline located in the western 
portion of the property.  The syncline is cut by a series of well-developed N-S 
trending 
the  position  of 
mineralization.    Fracturing  along  the  axis  of  the  syncline  is  covered  by  the 
Cypress  claim  block  but  has  not  been  explored  by  drilling  to  date  and 
represents one of the high quality exploration targets on the property. 
 
The  very  high  grade  of  zinc  and  silver  mineralization  in  the  RH  Zone  is  a 
compelling reason to continue exploration on the Gunman property.  Five main 
exploration targets have been identified and exploration recommendations are 
made for each of them in this report.  The five targets are:
fault-fracture  zones
that  appear
to  control
1.  North RH Zone.  Hole GD-15 intersected multiple zones of zinc-silver 
mineralization  in  a  position  approximately  1300  feet  north  of  the  RH

Zone. The grade of the mineralization in the hole is from 0.5 to 2.0% 
Zn and has accompanying Ag mineralization in the 5 to 15 ppm range.  
This low grade mineralization is very similar to that seen on both the 
east  and  west  flanks  of  the  RH  Zone.    1200  feet  of  RC  drilling  in  a 
position north and east of GD-15 is recommended.
2.  Confirmation  drilling  of  the  high  grade  RH  Zone  is  recommended  in 
order  to  provide  high  quality  data  for  a  resource  estimation  and  to 
obtain  large  samples  of  mineralization  for  metal  recovery  studies.  
Approximately 1000 feet of RC drilling is needed.
3.  Down-dip exploration of the east limb of the syncline.  No systematic 
exploration of the deeper extensions of the RH Zone has been done.  
It is recommended that an east-west fence of holes be completed into 
the 
the  known 
mineralization  at  RH.    A  total  of  1800  feet  of  RC  drilling  is 
recommended.
footwall  carbonaceous  shale  which  underlies
4.  Syncline axis exploration west of the RH Zone.  Surface mapping and 
analysis of detailed DEM and satellite imagery indicate that the axis of 
the syncline at Gunman is strongly fractured.  No drilling of the axis of 
the fold has been done.  Drill testing of the target in a position down-
dip of the RH Zone would require two holes totalling 1400 feet.
5.  Surface  sampling  of  carbonate  rubble  crop  in  the far  north portion  of 
the property,  the  Far North Target  Area  is  strongly  recommended as 
preliminary  observations  made  during  the  staking  of  the  north 
extension claims indicate that abundant altered carbonate rock rubble 
crop or near source float is present in a position roughly on strike with 
the known mineralization to the south.  Identification  of significant Zn 
or  Ag  mineralization  in  the  north  portion  of  the  property  would 
immediately increase the scope of the project.
A  phased  approach  to  the  recommended  work  is  the  most  efficient  way  to 
proceed.    Phase  1  would  include  items  1  and  2  above,  the  very  important 
exploration  drilling  around  RH  North  discovery  hole  GD-15  and 
the 
confirmation\bulk  sample  drilling  of  the  RH  Zone.    This  would  amount  to  the 
drilling  of  8  -  10  holes  and  a  total  of  2200  feet  of  R-C  drilling.    The  phase  1 
program should also include surface sampling in the Far North Target Area as 
this  area  has  the  potential  to  materially  change  the  scope  of  the  project  at  a 
very modest cost.
Phase  1  drilling  and  surface  sampling  is  estimated  to  cost  approximately 
$90,000, all in, right through to a final report on results.

The  drilling  of  the  down  dip  RH  target  and  the  syncline  axis  fracture  zone 
target  along  with  follow-up  and  further  extension  drilling  at  RH  North  is 
recommended  to  form  the  core  exploration  work  of  a  Phase  2  program.  
Drilling  of  any  high  quality  targets  that  could  result  from  the  Phase  1  surface 
sampling  at  the  Far  North  Target  area  could  also  be  added  to  Phase  2.  
Priorities  will  be  identified  based  on  Phase  1  results.    The  Phase  2  program 
would  entail  approximately  4000  feet  of  R-C  drilling  and  is  estimated  to  cost 
$135,000.
A total expenditure in the Phase 1 and 2 programs of approximately $225,000 
would advance the core RH South, RH and RH North portion of the property to 
a  state  of  readiness  for  a  resource  calculation  as  well  as  conduct  important 
extension exploration in the Far North Exploration area.
Cypress  Development’s  Gunman  project  is  well  located  on  the  margin  of  the 
Carlin  Trend  and  contains  zones  of  carbonate  replacement  style,  high  grade 
zinc  and  silver  oxide  mineralization.    Cypress  intends  to  extend  this  type  of 
mineralization  along  strike  while  also  closely  monitoring  gold  and  trace 
element  data for  any  indications  of  a  potentially  more  gold  rich  portion  of  the 
system.
High  quality  exploration  targets  remain  on  the  property.    These  include 
detailed  targets  in  the  RH  and  RH  North  areas.    The  area  around  north 
extension hole GD-15 needs additional drilling to explore for high grade.  The 
fault  –  fracture  zone  along  the  axis  of  the  syncline  west  of  the  RH  Zone 
remains unexplored.
In  addition,  mapping  by  the  USGS  in  1963  and  more  recent  mapping  by 
Cypress  indicates  that  a  carbonate  conglomerate  cap  rock  outcrops  in  the 
northern  portion  of  the  property.    This  unit  appears  to  have  acted  as  a  cap 
rock during mineralization at RH.  The northern portion of the property remains 
essentially unexplored, either at surface or beneath the cap rock.  Exploration 
of  this  area  along  the  projection  of  the  NNE  mineral  trend  presents  a  very 
attractive grass roots target, see Section 24 of this report.

Cypress has completed 64 reverse circulation (R-C) holes for 29930 feet and 
17  “NQ”  diamond  drill  holes  totaling  11,516 feet  of  drilling  on  the  Gunman 
property, located in eastern White Pine County, Nevada.   
 
This NI 43-101 Technical Report is intended to provide a detailed accounting 
of Cypress’s exploration of the Gunman property and to provide interpretations 
of  the  compiled  data  for  the  purposes  of  proposing  additional  exploration  for 
silver and zinc and potentially for gold mineralization on the property.   
 
The  Gunman  property  is  located  in  a  region  of  active  open  pit  mining  of 
sediment hosted gold deposits.  Mine construction is currently underway at the 
Pan  Project,  located  39  miles  south  of  the  Gunman  property.    The  Bald 
Mountain mining complex operated by Barrick Gold is located 10 miles east of 
the property.  Base metal production from high grade ores has occurred in the 
Bald Mountain area and in the nearby Eureka district.

Throughout this report, measurements are in imperial units (feet and miles) for 
all down hole drill data including assays. , Drill hole collar locations are in UTM 
NAD 83 meters. The use of both imperial and metric units for the program is 
necessary  due  to  10  foot  drill  rods  being  used.    UTM  meters  is  used  for  drill 
hole locations due to the convenience and more reliable interaction with other 
map data in GIS data compilation work. 
 
Silver (Ag) assay values are presented as parts per million (ppm), base metal 
values are presented as % Zinc (Zn). For reference, 1 ppm equals 1 gram.

Outcropping,  oxide  copper  showings  at  the  Gunman  property  were  explored 
by  prospect  pits  and  shallow  shafts  during  the  period  from  the  1860’s  to  the 
1940’s.    No  production  is  recorded.    Western  Mining  Corporation  (WMC) 
conducted  an  intensive,  sediment  hosted  gold  exploration  program  in  the 
region  in  the  early  1990’s.    During  this  work,  WMC  geologist  Charlie  Clark 
sampled  jasperoids  and  other  altered  limestone  outcrops  exposed  along  the 
range front on what was to become the Gunman property.  Highly anomalous 
Zn-Ag-Au-As-Cu and Hg assays were returned in the surface assays from the 
property.  The samples contained up to 0.5 grams per ton gold.   
 
The geochemical signature of sampled jasperoids is typical of Carlin style gold 
deposits  and  WMC  immediately  staked  lode  claims  covering  several  square 
miles  centered  on  the  mineralized  outcrops  and  rubble  crops  at  what  was  to 
become the RH Zone. 
 
WMC quickly moved to drill a series of R-C holes in and around the jasperoid 
exposures.  Results showed zones of mutli percent zinc and up to 2 ounces a 
ton  silver.    Gold  values  were  generally  low  and  erratic.   WMC  completed  26 
holes  on  the  property  for  total  of  9335  feet.    The  significant  zinc  and  silver 
mineralization  was  not  of  interest  to  WMC  at  that  time  and  they  allowed  the 
claims to lapse in 1996. 
 
White  Pine  minerals  staked  the  property  in  1999  and  vended  the  claims  to 
Cypress.    Cypress  began  an  aggressive  R-C  drill  program  in  May,  2000 
centered  around  the  jasperoid  area.    The  program  was  highly  successful, 
Cypress  began  to  discover  zinc  grades  >10%  over  down  hole  intervals 
exceeding 60 feet  Mutli ounce silver values were found with the zinc.  The RH 
Zone  was  partially  outlined  by  September  2000  and  additional  discoveries  of 
mutli  percent  zinc  and  local  percent  level  lead  were  made  at  RH  South,  800 
feet south of the RH Zone. 
 
Late  in  the  2000  drill  program,  Cypress  returned  to  the  RH  and  began  close 
spaced  drilling  aimed  at  both  extension  and  infill.    Hole  GM-26  intersected  a 
210  foot  down  hole  interval  grading  13.1%  zinc  and  126  ppm  silver.    This 
intercept  includes  a  100  foot  interval  starting  at  a  depth  115  feet  that  grades 
22.72%  Zn and  231.43  ppm  Ag.    Five foot sample  intervals  of up  to  37%  Zn 
and 497 ppm Ag  (16 oz/ton Ag) were recorded in the hole.

Hole  GM-32  was  the  final  hole  of  the  program  and  was  located  as  a  30  foot 
northward  extension  of  the  developing  high  grade  RH  Zone.    Hole  GM-32 
returned  a  115  foot  interval  of  9.1%  Zn  and  51.1  ppm  Ag  starting  a  vertical 
depth  of  50  feet.    Cypress  completed  32  reverse  circulation  drill  holes  for  a

Results and Recommendations by Mr. Robert D. Marvin.
Surface  work  by  Cypress  in  2001  included  the  collection  of  a  grid  of  soil 
samples  that  were  analyzed  by  mobile  metal  ion  analysis  (MMIA)  methods.  
The MMIA assay method was used as such methods were seen as potentially 
effective in detecting bedrock mineralization in areas were recent soil or other 
regolith cover is present.   The results of the survey are presented below.
In addition, Cominco Ltd.  conducted a series of due diligence studies on RC 
drill  cutting  from  the  property.    These  studies  included  XRD  analysis  and  a 
acetic  acid  leach  assay.    The  studies  indicate  that  smithsonite  is  the  most 
abundant zinc mineral in oxide mineralization at Gunman and that acetic acid 
is highly effective at recovering zinc from the oxide material. These studies are 
detailed later in the report.

Cypress returned to the property in 2004 to continue the drill exploration of the 
1000  foot  strike  length  containing  the  mineralized  RH  and  RH  South  zones 
identified from the combined WMC and Cypress drilling programs.  The other 
main  goal  of  the  2004  R-C  drill  program  was  to  test  the  RH  NW  Target 
developed from the results of the MMIA soil sample grid done in 2001.
The  2004  drill  program  totaled  32  holes  and  a  total  footage  of  8565.    The 
holes  were  of  shallow  depth  and  most  were  angled  at  targets  at  45  to  60 
degrees.  The  results  of  the  program  were  disappointing.    Extension  drill 
targets on the N and NW flank of the RH Zone returned wide intervals of low 
grade  zinc-silver  mineralization  but  no  extension  of  the  RH  high  grade  zone 
was achieved.
A  series  of  angle  holes  were  drilled  to  the  west  to  test  the  area  immediately 
under the MMIA NW RH target.  These holes intersected low grade zinc and

anomaly.  Hole GM04-06 intersected 30 feet starting at surface grading 0.24% 
Zn and 2.72 ppm Ag.
Drilling in the RH South area in 2004 found several zones of moderately well-
developed  mineralization  in  positions  along  the  south  and  east  flank  of  the 
zone.  Hole GM04-24 intersected a 65 foot interval of 0.40% Zn and 140 ppm 
Ag starting at 80 feet down hole.
Following the 2004 drill program, Cypress decided to try geophysical methods 
to  attempt  to  locate  indications  and  targets  of  deep  mineralization  under  the 
RH  and  RH  South  Zones.    A  Titan  Survey  was  done  over  the  core  of  the 
property  covering  approximately  4000  feet  of  strike  length  along  the  range 
front zone that contains the RH and RH South zones.  A summary of the 2006

To  very  briefly  summarize  the  results  of  the  2006  Titan  here,  the  survey 
identified a series of strong conductors at depth below the RH and RH South 
Zones as well as further south along the range front.
An  NQ  core  drilling  program  designed  to  test  a  series  of  strong  Titan  survey 
subsurface  conductors  was  commenced  in  April  2007.    Seventeen  NQ  core 
holes were drilled totaling 11,516 feet.  Eight of the holes, totaling 6900 feet of 
drilling,  were  used  confirming  the  source  of  the  Titan  conductor  anomalies.  
The conductors, in all cases were found to be coincident with highly graphitic 
silty to shaley limestones and dolomitic units.
The other nine holes of the program were used testing targets at RH South, at 
RH and at a new structural trend target, the RH North target.
The RH North target was developed as a result of combining the results of the 
2004  drill  program  with  structural  control  concepts  for  the  RH  and  RH  South 
zones.  Weak mineralization was intersected at the top of hole GM04-06 (a 30 
foot  interval  starting  at  surface  grading  0.24%  Zn  and  2.72  ppm  Ag)  in 
apposition  immediately  west  an  interpreted  feeder  structure  linking  the  RH 
South  to  RH  Zone.    2007  hole  GD-15  was  collared  as  a  vertical  hole  at  the 
location of the west angle hole GM04-06.
GD-15  intercepted  over  200  feet  containing  numerous  intervals  of  zinc-silver 
mineralization from 145.8 feet to 352 feet below surface.   The mineralization 
is hosted in a sandy limestone unit identical to the wall rocks of the RH Zone.  
The best interval was 9.8 feet of 1.5% Zn and 14 ppm Ag starting at 154.3 feet

the RH and RH South zones.   
 
Hole  GD-15  is  located  1400  feet  north  of  the  RH  Zone  and  was  positioned 
within  200  feet  of  the  north  property  boundary.    Barrick  Gold  owned  a  large 
block  of  lode  claim that  surrounded  the north  and east flanks  of  the  Cypress 
claims.  Barrick failed to file the claims in 2012 and Cypress staked the ground 
in  September  2012.  Cypress  has  added additional  claims  to  the  property  by 
staking  in  January,  2014  and  now  controls  of  7000  feet  of  strike  length

The  Gunman  project  lies  within  a  complex  sequence  of  Permian  age 
carbonate  and  calcareous  clastic  rocks  units  (blue  colored  patterns  on  the 
Figure  7-1).    The  complex  nature  is  the  result  of  numerous  erosional  and 
angular  disconformities  within  the  sequence.    The  Permian  age  stratigraphy 
overlies  chaotic  clastic  sequences  of 
the  Diamond  Peak  Formation, 
Mississippian age clastic rocks that are related to emplacement and erosion of 
the  Roberts  Mountains  Thrust  (RMT).      The  Mississippian  sequence  is 
bounded above and below by erosional unconformities.
Cambrian,  Ordovician  and  Devonian  and  lower  Mississippian  age  rocks  lie 
below the Diamond Peak Formation (dark purple colored patterns on Figure 7-
1).    This  lower  sequence  is  not  exposed  along  the  eastern  flank  of  the 
Diamond  Mountains  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Gunman  Project.    Abundant 
exposures  occur  to  the  east  in  the Bald  Mountain  and  Alligator  Ridge  mining 
areas as well as in Eureka to the SSW of the project.
The entire sequence of Cambrian through Permian age rock units are locally 
intruded  by  Tertiary  age  stocks  and  dikes  (bright  red  on  7-1).    Northwest 
trending  stock  complexes  intrude  the  early  Paleozoic  rocks  in  the  Bald 
Mountain area and further south near Alligator Ridge.  A stock is also present 
in  the  Diamond  Range  NNW  of  the  Gunman  area.    These  stocks  have  a 
strong spatial relationship to jasperoid development and precious metal – base 
metal mineralization in the Bald Mountain, Alligator Ridge and Eureka mining 
centers.    The  intrusions  at  Eureka  are  older  than  those  at  Bald  Mtn.  and 
Alligator Ridge but the relationship is the same.
All Paleozoic age rock units are deformed by several stages of compressional 
folding  and  faulting.    Major  folding  events  occurred  in  the  late  Devonian  to 
early Mississippian time and again in the Mesozoic.  Extensional deformation 
in  the  Tertiary  has  produced  the  present  landforms,  basin  and  range 
physiography,  and  is  also  responsible  for  igneous  activity  and  hydrothermal 
alteration  –  mineralization,  which  occurred  very  early  during  the  extensional 
event  and  predate  the  present  basin  and  range  landforms  and  active  range 
front normal faults.  One outcome of the mid Tertiary extension is the opening

Three types of Tertiary age hydrothermal activity occur in a NW trending belt 
that includes the Gunman Project (Figure 7-2 below).
1.   Large Scale Siliceous Sinter Mounds; Siliceous and calcareous sinter 
deposits  form  a  large  set  of  hills  that  rise  above  the  center  of  the 
Newark Valley and are seen in the valley SE of Alligator Ridge.  These 
mounds  results  from  large  scale  circulation  of  warm  to  hot  ground 
water and are likely related to igneous intrusions at depth.
2.  Jasperoid and Jasperoid Breccias; Jasperoids result from intense silica 
replacement  of  limestone  during  hydrothermal  alteration.    They  are 
often  brecciated  by  episodic  boiling  during  formation.    Jasperoids  are 
commonly  directly  related  to  calcareous  hosted  precious  metal  and 
base  metal  deposits  in  north  central  Nevada.    Well-developed 
Jasperoids  with  highly  anomalous  Zn-Ag-Au-As-Cu  and  Hg  occur 
along the break in slope in the central portion of the Gunman property 
as  well  as  within  both  the  Bald  Mountain  and  Alligator  Ridge  mining 
area.
3.  Decalcification  and  mineralization;
limestone,  silty
Paleozoic  age  calcareous 
limestone,  dolomites  and 
sedimentary  deposits, 
carbonate  cemented  clastic  units,  have  all  been  locally  impacted  by 
decalcification and Silicification by Tertiary are hydrothermal activity in 
the area encompassing Eureka-Bald Mtn. and Gunman.  Large areas 
of  outcropping  jasperoid  breccias  are  associated  with  gold  and  base 
metal  mineralization  at  Bald  Mountain.    Small  area  of  outcrop,  rubble 
crop and subsurface intersection of jasperoid are associated with very 
grade zinc and silver mineralization at Gunman.
These hydrothermal features of the district are specially related to a large NW 
trending area containing Tertiary age intrusions.  While no intrusions have yet 
been found at Gunman, the intrusion mapped in the Diamond Range north of 
the  project  is  associated  with  copper-gold  mineralization.    Figure  7-2  below 
displays  the  map  pattern  of  Tertiary  age  intrusions,  hot  spring  sinters, 
jasperoid alteration and mineralization.
It is worth noting again that the Tertiary age igneous and hydrothermal activity 
occurred  just  at  the  onset  of  extensional  deformation  in  the  early  Tertiary.  
Continued  extension  as  now  opened  wide  valleys  and  created  numerous 
range  front  normal  faults,  all  of  which  have  occurred  post  district  scale 
mineralization.

Gunman project has abundant outcrops in the western portion  of the property 
and  is  largely  covered  by  recent  gravel  deposits  in  the  eastern  portion.    The 
outcropping  rocks  are  all  of  sedimentary  origin  and  are  essentially  not 
impacted  by  metamorphism.      Strong  layering  observed  in  certain  units  is  all 
preserved, original sedimentary bedding.
The  sedimentary  rocks  at  Gunman  have  been  assigned  a  Permian  age  by 
regional  mappers  based  on  the  observed  fossil  assemblages  and  correlation 
with  stratigraphy  in  surrounding  areas.    No  igneous  rocks  are  known  on  the 
property.
The  sequence  of  Permian  carbonate  rocks  and  clastic  sediments  have  a 
complex  depositional  history  with  several  major  angular  and  erosional 
disconformities  being  mapped  between  rock  packages.    Cypress  has 
interpreted  a  major  angular  unconformity  mapped  in  western  and  northern 
portions of the property to be caused by thrusting of a carbonate conglomerate 
unit  over  a  folded  sequence  of  limestones  and  red  bed  sandstones.    This 
contact  has  been  alternatively  interpreted  as  a  major  erosional  unconformity 
with  flat  lying  carbonate  conglomerate  lying  depositional  contact  with  an 
underlying, folded sequence of carbonate and clastic rocks.
In either case, this contact appears to have acted as hydrologic barrier during 
hydothermal  alteration  and  mineralization  at  the  property.    As  a  result, 
exploration  for  blind  mineralization  below  the  carbonate  conglomerate  unit 
along  know  mineralized  trends  represents  a  high  quality  target  for  future 
exploration at Gunman.

7.2.1 Property Rock Units
The  Gunman  property  is  underlain  by  sequence  of  Permian  carbonate  rocks 
and  clastic  sediments  that  have  a  complex  depositional  history  and  several 
major  angular  and  erosional  disconformities  between  rock  packages.  A 
stratigraphic  section  for  the  property  is  presented  in  figure  7-4  below.  The 
section  exposed  along  the  range  front  on  the  property  begins  with  a  lower 
most  carbonaceous  limestone  –  dolomite  unit  that  is  only  locally  exposed  in 
the southern portion of the property.
A  silty  limestone  overlies  the  carbonaceous  unit  and  is  in  turn  overlain  by  a 
more  massive  fossiliferous  limestone  unit.    This  unit  is  locally  complex  and 
contains lenses of rounded clast, poly-lithic, carbonate cemented sandstones.  
A sharp contact at the top of the fossilferous limestone marks the change to a 
clastic  sediment  package  of  locally  calcareous  siltstone  and  sandstones.  
These  are ubiquitously  oxidized  to  red  and orange  yellow  color.    All  of these 
units together are folded into a north trending syncline with a fold axis located 
in the western portion of the property.

Lying above a sub horizontal erosional or faulted surface developed at the top 
of  the  folded  sequence  is  a  nearly  flat  lying  carbonate  conglomerate  unit  or 
limestone  conglomerate.    The  unit  is  composed  of  dm-scale,  sub rounded  to 
sub-angular clasts in a carbonate matrix.  The unit is matrix supported.  This 
unit appears to have acted as a cap rock, trapping mineralizing, hydrothermal 
fluids within the east flank of the Gunman syncline.
A series of photos of rocks units at Gunman are presented below.

7.2.2 Property Structure
The  Permian  age  rocks  of  the  Gunman  property  are  impacted  by  both 
Paleozoic age compression and by post mineral, mid Tertiary age  extension.  
No penetrative foliation or other metamorphic effects are evident.
A  well-developed  syncline  with  a  roughly  north-south  axis  traverses  the 
property.  The mineralization at RH and adjacent zones all lie in the east flank 
of the syncline.   The RH North Zone is hosted in a down dropped section of 
the  silty  limestone  and  is  a  blind  discovery  below  recent  gravel  cover.    See 
figure 7-6 below.
Normal faulting and fracturing has occurred throughout the property.  It is likely 
that  early  normal  faulting  and  fracturing  resulted  in  fluid  pathways  for 
mineralizing  fluids.    More  recent  normal  faulting  associated  with  regional 
extension  have  produced  the  range  front  fault  which  lies  just  east  of  the  RH 
Zone and which also passes through the RH North Zone (Figure 7-3 above).

The  main  extension  phase  and  resulting  normal  faults  are  very  likely  much 
younger  than  mineralization  on  the  property  and  thus  have  likely  off-set  and 
down  dropped  mineralization  into  positions  east  of  the  range  front  and 
concealed  beneath  gravel  cover.   The  under  explored  RH  North  Zone  is  one 
example of mineralization being offset by later faulting.
The  amount  of  off-set  on  the  range  front  fault  that  passes  very  near  the  RH 
Zone  is  unknown  but  outcrops  of  Permian  rocks  do  occur  on  the  down 
dropped side of the fault in the northern portion of the property.  This mapped 
geology indicated that off–set on this fault is <300 feet (figure 7-3 above).
7.2.3 Alteration and Veining of Rock Units
Property  scale  alteration-mineralization  of  both  the  host  silty  limestone  unit 
and within clastic lenses within the overlying fossiliferous limestone.  Property 
scale zonation of two distinct types of alteration-mineralization is recognized:
lenses  of  carbonate  cemented  sandstone
1.   Dolomitization  -  decalcification  and  jasperiod  development  is  seen  for  a 
3000 foot  strike  length within  the  RH  Zone  host  silty  limestone  and  locally 
within 
the  overlying 
fossiliferous  limestone.    The  alteration  is  most  intense  in  the  RH  South  – 
RH  Zone  and  RH  North  area.    All  discovered  oxide  and  sulfide  zinc-silver 
mineralization  is  within  this  alteration  type.    Surface  and  subsurface 
jasperiod  alteration  zones  with  anomalous  gold  to  500  ppb  occur  directly 
over known ore zones at Gunman.
in
2.  Tension gash quartz-carbonate veining is seen  as a halo around the  west 
margin  of  the  dolomitization-decalcification-jasperiod  zone.    The  veining  is 
best  developed  within  the  basal  clastic  unit  of  the  over  thrust  section.  
Copper oxide mineralization is developed within this alteration type.

P R O P E R T Y   M I N E R A L I Z A T I O N
Drilling  on  the  Gunman  property  has  discovered  the  presence  of  zinc  and 
silver  mineralization  over  a  strike  length  of  over  2000  feet.    The  RH  Zone 
contains the strongest mineralization found on the property to date.  Oxidized, 
carbonate  replacement  zones  at  RH  can  produce  spectacular  assays  over 
down hole intervals > 100 feet.   
 
Determination  of  oxide  mineralization  at  Gunman  has  been  done  by  XRD

multiple  zones  of  zinc  and  silver  mineralization  over  a  200  foot  interval  from

Significant Mineralized Intercepts
While  the  zinc  grade  of  the  mineralization  in  North  RH  GD-15  is  2%  or  less, 
the multi zone nature and combined zinc and silver grades are very similar to 
those found on the flanks of the bonanza zones at RH. 
 
As an indicator of the continuation of the mineralized trend to the NNE, GD-15 
is  very  encouraging.    Figure  7-8,  below,  shows  the  location  of  the  RH  North 
Zone  relative  to  the  RH  South  and  RH  Zones.    The  base  map  shows  the

The  origins  of  mineralization  at  the  Gunman  Property  and  in  surrounding 
districts  is  of  epigenetic  origin,  is  of  Tertiary  age  and  has  resulted  from 
epithermal, hydrothermal fluids which have caused the observed alteration and 
metal deposition.  At Bald Mountain and Eureka, gold and base metal deposits 
are genetically related to quartz monzonite intrusions.  No intrusions have yet 
been found  on the  Gunman Property  but a quartz  monzonite  in  the  Diamond 
Range NNW of Gunman is associated with copper – gold mineralization. 
 
The  Tertiary  age  features  related  to  intrusion  and  hydrothermal  alteration  of 
carbonate rich wall rocks forms a NW trending belt of approximate width of 15 
miles.    This  belt  passes  through  the  exposed  jasperoid  alteration  and  zinc-
silver-copper-gold mineralization at Gunman.   
 
The  timing  of  jasperoid  development  and  carbonate  replacement  style 
mineralization  at  the  Gunman  shares  many  important  characteristics  with 
those seen at the nearby Bald Mountain mining area and it is very  likely that 
they  share  a  common  NW  trending,  deep  seated  fault  system  control.  
Potentially important differences also exist. The ore deposits at Bald Mountain 
are more gold rich than the base metal – precious metal mineralized zones at 
Gunman.  Additionally, the ore deposits at Bald Mtn. are hosted by Cambrian 
to  Mississippian  age  stratigraphy,  while  the  mineralization  at  Gunman  is 
hosted by carbonate rocks mapped as being Permian in age.   
 
Despite  the  age  difference  of  the  host  rocks,  however,  both  areas  display 
jasperoid  alteration,  decalcification  and mineralization  of  silty  limestone  units.  
Both  areas  contain  graphitic  carbonate  units  in  areas  below  the  level  of 
oxidation.    The  grade  of  the  RH  Zone  at  Gunman  certainly  makes  a  strong 
statement  about  the  suitability  of  the  Permian  age  rocks  there  to  host  high 
grade, epigenetic, epithermal mineralization.

Exploration experience at Gunman has conclusively shown that drilling is the 
only  trustworthy  exploration  tool.    Western  Mining  Corporation  tried  Induced 
polarization (IP), drilled an IP target west of the RH Zone and found nothing.  
Cypress has tried Titan and other down hole probe electrical methods and has 
shown  that  strong  conductors  are  related  to  graphite  alteration  of  carbonate 
rocks below the level of oxidation.
A  geophysical  method  that  would  potentially  be  of  use  would  be  detailed 
gravity  as  that  would  be  very  helpful  in  estimating  the  thickness  of  recent 
gravel cover rocks as well as indicate the geometry of large-scale faults in the 
lithologic section.
The  results  of  past  geophysical  survey  conducted  on  the  property  are 
adequately detailed in reports as referenced in section 6.1 of this report.
Soil  sampling  with  MMIA  assay  methods  has  also  been  tried  at  Gunman  as 
shown  on  figure  6-1  and  more  importantly,  on  figure  7.3-1.    The  RH  North 
Zone  was  discovered  in  2007  by  drilling  blind  through  gravel  cover  in  a 
position  along  the  strike  projection  of  known  zones  of  mineralization  to  the 
SSW.    The  MMI  assay  method  failed  to  detect  the  zinc  and  silver 
mineralization through the range front gravel cover materials.   This being said, 
soil  sampling  in  the  northern  portion  of  the  Gunman  property  in  an  area  of 
rubble  crop  or  locally  sourced  float  could  be  very  effective  in  detecting 
additional  mineralization  and  drill  targets  in  that  unexplored  portion  of  the 
property.
Reverse  circulation  and  diamond  drill  exploration  of  the  Gunman  property  is 
outlined in the following sections and detailed in the 6.0 History section and in

WMC  completed  26  holes  on  the  property  for  total  of  9335  feet.    Significant 
widths  of  oxide  zinc  and  silver  mineralization  intersected  resulting  in  the 
discovery  of  a  sediment  hosted  base  metal  –  precious  metal  system 
underlying  surface  jasperoids  along  the  east  flank  of  the  Diamond  Range.  
Zinc  was  not  of  interest  to WMC at  that  time  and  the  claims  were  allowed  to 
lapse in 1996.

C Y P R E S S   V E N T U R E S
Cypress began an aggressive R-C drill program in May, 2000 centered around 
the  jasperoid  area.    The  program  was  highly  successful,  Cypress  began  to 
discover zinc grades >10% over down hole intervals exceeding 60 feet  Mutli 
ounce  silver  values  were  found  with  the  zinc.    The  RH  Zone  was  partially 
outlined  by  September  2000  and  additional  discoveries  of  mutli  percent  zinc 
and local percent level lead were made at RH South, 800 feet south of the RH 
Zone. 
 
Late  in  the  2000  drill  program,  Cypress  returned  to  the  RH  and  began  close 
spaced  drilling  aimed  at  both  extension  and  infill.    Hole  GM-26  intersected  a 
210  foot  down  hole  interval  grading  13.1%  zinc  and  126  g/t  silver.    This 
intercept  includes  a  100  foot  interval  starting  at  a  depth  115  feet  that  grades 
22.72%  Zn and  231.43  ppm  Ag.    Five foot sample  intervals  of up  to  37%  Zn 
and 497 ppm Ag  (16 oz/ton Ag) were recorded in the hole. 
 
Hole  GM-32  was  the  final  hole  of  the  program  and  was  located  as  a  30  foot 
northward  extension  of  the  developing  high  grade  RH  Zone.    Hole  GM-32 
returned  a  115  foot  interval  of  9.1%  Zn  and  51.1  ppm  Ag  starting  a  vertical 
depth  of  50  feet.    Cypress  completed  32  reverse  circulation  drill  holes  for  a 
total of 17,370 feet at Gunman during 2000. 
 
Cypress returned to the property in 2004 to continue the drill exploration of the 
1000  foot  strike  length  containing  the  mineralized  RH  and  RH  South  zones 
identified from the combined WMC and Cypress drilling programs.  The other 
main  goal  of  the  2004  R-C  drill  program  was  to  test  the  RH  NW  Target 
developed from the results of the MMIA soil sample grid done in 2001.

The  2004  drill  program  totaled  32  holes  and  a  total  footage  of  8565.    The 
holes  were  of  shallow  depth  and  most  were  angled  at  targets  at  45  to  60 
degrees.    Extension  drill  targets  on  the  N  and  NW  flank  of  the  RH  Zone 
returned wide intervals of low grade zinc-silver mineralization but no extension 
of the RH high grade zone was achieved.
A  series  of  angle  holes  were  drilled  to  the  west  to  test  the  area  immediately 
under the MMIA NW RH target.  These holes intersected low grade zinc and 
silver  mineralization  in  the  upper  portion  but  underlying,  oxidized  carbonate 
units  were  essentially  barren  in  positions  under  the  RH  NW  target  MMIA 
anomaly.  Hole GM04-06 intersected 30 feet starting at surface grading 0.24% 
Zn and 2.72 ppm Ag.
Drilling in the RH South area in 2004 found several zones of moderately well-
developed  mineralization  in  positions  along  the  south  and  east  flank  of  the 
zone.  Hole GM04-24 intersected a 65 foot interval of 0.40% Zn and 140 ppm 
Ag starting at 80 feet down hole.

For  reverse  circulation  drilling,  sampling  is  done  at  the  rig  by  continuously 
running  all  drill  cutting  through  a  splitter  in  order  to  obtain  a  representative 
sample of reasonable size for submission to the assay lab.  The drilling of the 
RH  Zone  in  2000  was  done  dry,  without  the  injection  of  water,  as  is  not 
required by OSHA.  The dry cutting for each 5 foot interval were dumped from 
a  catchment  container  on  the  rig  through  a  standard  Gilson  splitter.    The 
portion  of  the  cuttings  split  to  assayed  was  caught  in  a  metal  pan  below  the 
splitter which was then emptied into a sample bag for shipment to the lab.
When drilling with water injection in 2004, the muddy water  and cutting slurry 
was continuously run through a rotating cyclone splitter attached to the rig and 
the spit portion was caught directly into the sample shipment bag attached to 
the cyclone.
In  either  case,  series  of  5  foot  sample  splits  in  their  own  sealed  bags  were 
then placed in larger rice bags to provide extra protection during shipment to 
the sample prep lab in Elko.
For NQ drill core in 2007 the following procedures were used.  Samples are all 
less than or equal to 5 feet long.  Broken pieces of core are first fitted together 
end  to  end,  and  a  cutting  reference  line  is  marked  along 
the  core 
perpendicular to bedding.  The sample start and end points are clearly marked 
with  lumber  crayon.   The  core  is  transferred  to  the  cutting  room,  where  it  is 
sawn  along  the  reference  line  and  both  halves  are  returned  to  the  core 
box.  The technician then collects the samples by taking the back half of core 
for each marked interval and placing the half core in standard plastic sample 
bags.    A  unique  sample  tag  is  included  in  the  bag  with  each  sample.    The 
sample number is also written on the outside of the plastic sample bag. 
 
The  plastic  sample  bags  are  bundled  together  in  large  woven  polyethylene 
sacks (rice bags) which are sealed at the cutting site.  The samples were then 
taken to ALS Chemex in Reno by Cypress personnel.

Certified  reference  materials  were  used  by  Cypress  in  2004  and  2007  to 
provide  assay  standards  as  part  of  the  QA/QC  procedures  for  the  Gunman 
exploration programs.
Standard reference samples of known precious and base metal concentration 
are  inserted  by  Cypress  in  the  sample  sequences  at  a  rate  of  one  standard 
sample per 30 core samples.  These standards are purchased in durable, pre-
sealed  aluminum  packets.    The  assay  results  of  the  sample  standards  have 
been  monitored  for  all  assay  batches  of  samples  from  the  property.      These 
results  have  been  found  to  fall  within  the  expected  range  of  expected 
variability,  as  provided  by  the  manufacturer  of  the  standards.    No  systematic 
errors in sample assay results are apparent or suspected.
Sample  repeats  are  carried  out  as  a  process  check  by  the  laboratory.    After 
the sample has been crushed and pulverized, 2 subsamples are selected for 
analysis.    Sample  duplicates  are  best  used  to  monitor  the  analytical  method 
used  by  the  laboratory,  and  should  not  be  relied  upon  to  monitor  the  overall 
quality  control  of  the  sampling  program.    The  variability  between  original 
assays and repeat assays should be low.
No  sample  duplicates  from  split  core  from  the  Gunman  have  been  done  but 
the  remaining  half  of  core  from  the  2007  drill  program  is  available  for  any 
future QA/QC programs which may be needed.

All R-C drill samples were bagged for shipment right at the drill site and were 
collected several times a week by the sample prep lab in Elko.  NQ drill core 
was transported from the drill to the logging facility by Cypress personnel.  The 
logging facility consisted of a large metal building in Eureka, Nevada.
After geological logging of the core it is transferred to the cutting room, where 
it  is  sawn  in  half.   The  technician  then  collects  the  samples  for  each  marked 
interval  and  placing  the  half  core  in  standard  plastic  sample  bags.    A  unique 
sample  tag  is  included  in  the  bag  with  each  sample.    The  sample  number  is 
also written on the outside of the plastic sample bag.  The plastic sample bags 
are  bundled  together  in  large  woven  polyethylene  sacks  (rice  bags)  which

Cominco expressed interest in the Gunman project in early 2001.  As part of their due 
diligence,  Cominco  ran  a  series  of  XRD  analysis  on  sample  pulps from  5 foot  RC  drill 
cuttings  from  three  RH  Zone  drill  holes  to  determine  the  mineralogy  of  the  oxidized 
mineralization at Gunman.  The XRD work showed that smithsonite was the main zinc 
bearing  mineral  in  the  oxide  intercepts.    Another  zinc  oxide  mineral,  hemimorphite  is 
also present.   
 
Following  completion  of  the  XRD  study  Cominco  proceeded  with  a  leach  recovery 
testing  on  5  foot  sample  rejects  from  a  long,  continuous  interval  from  high  grade  hole 
GM-26. The samples were subjected to a bench scale acetic acid leach assay method.  
The results are shown in Table 4 below in direct comparison to ICP assays of the same 
samples.

The assay comparison between ICP methods and a simple acetic acid leach 
clearly show that excellent recoveries of zinc could be obtained by acetic acid 
treatment of zinc oxide mineralization at Gunman.  The average zinc grade in

the  ICP  assays  is  16.56%  while  in  the  acetic  acid  leach  assay  method  the 
average  grade  is  slightly  lower  at  15.02%.    The  comparison  sample  series 
from  hole  GM-26  includes  lower  grade  zinc  mineralization,  <5%  zinc, 
moderate  grade  zinc  mineralization,  <10%  zinc  and  high  grade  zinc 
mineralization,  >10%  zinc.    The  relative  recovery  of  zinc  with  the  acetic  acid 
method  v.  ICP  assays  is  more  erratic  for  the  lower  grade  material  vs.  the 
higher grade material.
The  data  indicate  that  a  simple  heap  leach  operation  could  very  likely  be 
effective  in  recovering  zinc  from  oxide  mineralization  at  Gunman.    The  data 
above  represent  only  a  simple  bench  scale  study  on  small  sample  sizes.    A 
more  detailed  study  will  be  required  to  confirm  and  expand  upon  the  very 
encouraging recovery data obtained by the simple acetic leach test.

The  Gunman  is  surrounded  by  federal  lands  under  BLM  administration.  
Cypress  has  not  done  a  detailed  land  status  study  recently  so  is  uncertain 
whether areas surrounding the current 55 claim clock are claimed by others or 
if  they  are  currently  open  to  location.    Barrick  Gold  had  much  of  the  area 
surrounding  the  core  of  the  Cypress  claim  block  staked  from  2006  through 
2012.    Barrick  allowed  portions  of  this  block  to  lapse  as  of  September  1st, 
2012.  Cypress has been steadily adding to land position as targets evolve.

Cypress's  Gunman  property  shares  many  similarities  with  nearby  precious-
metal  producing  mines.    Many  of  the  current  mines  in  the  area  had  an  early 
history  of  precious  metal  and  base  metal  production  from  high  grade, 
carbonate  replacement  style  ore  bodies  followed  by  discovery  and  mining  of 
more disseminated, gold rich zones within close proximity to the historic, high 
grade, replacement style zones.   
 
The  Gunman  project  is  currently  being  explored  for  zinc  and  silver  oxide 
mineralization  based  on  the  exploration  success  for  these  metals  since 
discovery  of  the  area  in  1990.    Cypress  intends  to  extend  this  type  of 
mineralization  along  strike  while  also  closely  monitoring  gold  and  trace 
element  data for  any  indications  of  a  potentially  more  gold  rich  portion  of  the 
system.

Based  on  observations  made  from  outcrop  as  well  as  R-C  and  core  drill 
exploration,  Cypress  is  confident  that  high  grade  zinc  and  silver  oxide 
mineralization  on  the  Gunman  property  represents  the  oxidized  remains  of 
original  carbonate  replacement  deposits. 
  These  oxidized,  very  well 
mineralized zones are very similar to high grade base metal  – precious metal 
deposits  mined  historically  at  Eureka  and  Bald  Mountain.    The  presence  of 
significant  gold  mineralization  at  Gunman  has  not  been  established.    Known 
zones of >10% Zinc and multi ounce per ton Silver over intervals of >100 feet 
do  not  contain  gold  values  >200  ppb  and  the  average  gold  grade  would  be 
<15 ppb.  The Gunman appears to represent of very zinc and silver rich end 
member  within  a  region  of  abundant,  high  grade  examples  of  the  carbonate 
replacement class of ore deposits.
The  pattern  of  the  of  Tertiary  age  intrusions,  large  sinter  mounds  and 
jasperiod  alteration  strongly  suggests  a  district-scale,  NW  trending  zone  of 
focused  paleo  hot  spring  activity,  hydrothermal  alteration  and  local  precious 
metal  –  base  metal  mineralization  passes  through  the  Gunman  project  area 
(Figure 24-1).  This pattern suggests that the northern portion of the Gunman 
property should be explored for further evidence of mineralization.
High  quality  exploration  targets  remain  on  the  property.    These  include 
detailed  targets  in  the  RH  and  RH  North  areas.    The  area  around  north 
extension hole GD-15 needs additional drilling to explore for high grade.  The 
fault  –  fracture  zone  along  the  axis  of  the  syncline  west  of  the  RH  Zone 
remains unexplored
The NNE strike extension of the series of RH zones has barely been started 
and a much larger extension target could exist along that trend clear into the 
northeastern portion of the property.  Outcrops of the limestone conglomerate 
cap  rock  in  the  far  northern  portion  of  the  property  at  the  very  least  indicate 
that the target silty limestone stratigraphy is at very explore able levels in that 
area.  No surface sampling of the northern area has ever been done by either 
WMC in the early 1990’s or by Cypress.  This target area is shown on figure 
24-2.

The  very  high  grade  of  zinc  and  silver  mineralization  in  the  RH  Zone  is  a 
compelling  reason  to  continue  exploration  on  the  Gunman  property.    Four 
exploration  targets  and  one  resource  evaluation  target  have  been  identified 
and drilling/exploration recommendations are made for each.  The five targets 
are:
1.  North  RH.    Hole  GD-15  intersected  multiple  zones  of  zinc-silver 
mineralization in a position approximately 1300 feet north of the RH 
Zone.  The  grade  of  the  mineralization  in  the  hole  is  from  0.5  to 
2.0%  Zn  and  has  accompanying  Ag  mineralization  in  the  5  to  15 
ppm  range.    This  low  grade  mineralization  is  very  similar  to  that 
seen on both the east and west flanks of the RH Zone.  1500 feet of 
RC drilling in a position north and east of GD-15 is recommended.
2.  Confirmation drilling of the high grade RH Zone is recommended in 
order  to  provide high quality  data for  a  resource  estimation and  to 
obtain  large  samples  of  mineralization  for  metal  recovery  studies.  
Approximately 1000 feet of RC drilling is needed.
3.  Down-dip  exploration  of  the  east  limb  of  the  syncline.    No 
systematic  exploration  of  the  deeper  extensions  of  the  RH  Zone 
has been done.  It is recommended that an east-west fence of hole 
be completed into the footwall carbonaceous shale which underlies 
the known mineralization at RH.  A total of 1800 feet of RC drilling 
is recommended.
4.  Syncline  axis  exploration  west  of  the  RH  Zone.    Surface  mapping 
and analysis of detailed DEM and satellite imagery indicate that the 
axis of the syncline at Gunman is strongly fractured.  No drilling of 
the  axis  of  the  fold  has  been  done.    Drill  testing  of  the  target  in  a 
position down-dip of the RH Zone would require two holes totalling 
1400 feet.
5.  Surface sampling of carbonate rubble crop in the Far North Target 
Area  is  strongly  recommended  as  preliminary  observations  made 
during  the  staking  of  the  north  extension  claims  indicate  that 
abundant, altered carbonate rock rubble crop or near source float is 
present in a position roughly on strike with the known mineralization 
to the south.  Identification of significant Zn or Ag mineralization in 
the  north  portion  of  the  property  would  immediately  increase  the

scope of the project.  The sampling could be  either by soil sample 
grid, or abundant rock chip sampling, or both.
A  phased  approach  to  the  recommended  work  is  the  most  efficient  way  to 
proceed.    Phase  1  would  include  items  1  and  2  above,  the  very  important 
exploration  drilling  around  RH  North  discovery  hole  GD-15  and 
the 
confirmation/  bulk sample drilling of the RH Zone.  This would amount to the 
drilling  of  8  -  10  holes  and  a  total  of  2200  feet  of  R-C  drilling.    The  phase  1 
program should also include surface sampling in the Far North Target Area as 
this area has the potential to materially change the scope of the project with at 
a very modest cost.
Phase  1  drilling  and  surface  sampling  is  estimated  to  cost  approximately 
$90,000 all in right through to a final report on results.
The  drilling  of  the  down  dip  RH  target  and  the  syncline  axis  fracture  zone 
target  along  with  follow-up  and  further  extension  drilling  at  RH  North  is 
recommended  to  form  the  core  exploration  work  of  a  Phase  2  program.  
Drilling  of  any  high  quality  targets  that  could  result  from  the  Phase  1  surface 
sampling  at  the  Far  North  Target  area  could  also  be  added  to  Phase  2.  
Priorities  will  be  identified  based  on  Phase  1  results.    The  Phase  2  program 
would require 4000 feet of R-C drilling and is estimated to cost $135,000.
A total expenditure in the Phase 1 and 2 programs of approximately $225,000 
would advance the core RH South, RH and RH North portion of the property to 
a  state  of  readiness  for  a  resource  calculation  as  well  as  conduct  important 
extension exploration in the Far North Exploration area.
Cypress  Development’s  Gunman  project  is  well  located  on  the  margin  of  the 
Carlin  Trend  and  contains  zones  of  carbonate  replacement  style,  high  grade 
zinc  and  silver  oxide  mineralization.    Cypress  intends  to  extend  this  type  of 
mineralization  along  strike  while  also  closely  monitoring  gold  and  trace 
element  data for  any  indications  of  a  potentially  more  gold  rich  portion  of  the 
system.
High  quality  exploration  targets  remain  on  the  property.    These  include 
detailed  targets  in  the  RH  and  RH  North  areas.    The  area  around  north 
extension hole GD-15 needs additional drilling to explore for high grade.  The 
fault  –  fracture  zone  along  the  axis  of  the  syncline  west  of  the  RH  Zone 
remains unexplored.
