<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights conducted an official 
</p>
<p>visit to Guinea-Bissau from 23 February to 1 March 2014. In the present report, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur outlines the challenges that Guinea-Bissau is facing in implementing measures 
</p>
<p>to address poverty and in ensuring the rights of those living in poverty. 
</p>
<p>Guinea-Bissau ranks as one of the poorest countries in the world, with a consistent 
</p>
<p>decline of investment in essential social services such as health care and education. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the disproportionate vulnerability of 
</p>
<p>certain groups, especially women, as well as obstacles to poverty reduction such as political 
</p>
<p>instability, corruption and impunity. 
</p>
<p>This Special Rapporteur provides recommendations to ensure that relevant policies 
</p>
<p>and programmes are implemented to enable those living in extreme poverty to enjoy their 
</p>
<p>human rights on an equal basis with the rest of the population.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and 
</p>
<p>human rights, Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda Carmona, visited Guinea-Bissau from 23 February to 
</p>
<p>1 March 2014. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur collected first-hand information on 
</p>
<p>the human rights situation of people in that country living in poverty. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met with the Transitional President, Serifo Nhamadjo; the 
</p>
<p>Transitional Prime Minister, Rui Duarte de Barros; the Minister of Justice, Mamad&#250; Saido 
</p>
<p>Bald&#233;; the Minister of Economy and Regional Integration, Soares Samb&#250;; the Minister of 
</p>
<p>Agriculture, Nicolau dos Santos; the Minister for Women, Family and Social Solidarity, 
</p>
<p>Gabriela Alfredo Fernandes; the Minister of Education, Youth, Culture and Sports, Alfredo 
</p>
<p>Gomes J&#250;nior; the Secretary of State for Food Security, Bilony Nhama Nantamba Nhasse; 
</p>
<p>and representatives of the Commission for Strategic Planning. She met with the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and Head of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS), Jos&#233; Ramos-
</p>
<p>Horta, and also with the Deputy Special Representative and Resident Coordinator, Gana 
</p>
<p>Fofang, as well as with representatives of United Nations agencies, the donor community, 
</p>
<p>international financial institutions and a range of civil-society organizations. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also held meetings with communities living in poverty in 
</p>
<p>villages surrounding Quinhamel, Mansoa, Bissor&#227;, Mansaba and Nhacra, as well as on the 
</p>
<p>Bijagos islands of Bubaque, Canhabaque and Soga. She visited health-care facilities such as 
</p>
<p>Mansoa Hospital in the Oio region and the Bandim Health Project in the Biombo region 
</p>
<p>(Bucumul village).  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General, the Deputy Special Representative and Resident Coordinator, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Development Programme (UNDP) in Guinea-Bissau and, in particular, the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Section of UNIOGBIS for their excellent collaboration and assistance with the mission. She 
</p>
<p>would like to offer her sincere gratitude to all those who took the time to meet with her, as 
</p>
<p>their contributions were invaluable to the success of her visit. She was particularly struck 
</p>
<p>by the vibrant and active engagement of civil-society organizations working on human 
</p>
<p>rights and poverty issues. She is especially grateful to all those who shared their personal, 
</p>
<p>and sometimes very troubling, experiences of struggling with extreme poverty and social 
</p>
<p>exclusion. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General context 
</b></p>
<p>5. Since the end of its decade-long armed struggle for independence in 1973, Guinea-
</p>
<p>Bissau has experienced near-constant political instability, characterized by recurrent high-
</p>
<p>level political assassinations, coups d&#8217;&#233;tat, political persecution and forced resignation from 
</p>
<p>office by officials, with the latest presidential elections interrupted by a military coup in 
</p>
<p>April 2012. Guinea-Bissau was ranked 176th out of 186 countries on the UNDP Human 
</p>
<p>Development Index in 2012 and has a life expectancy of 48.6 years.1  
</p>
<p>

</i></p>
<p><i>South: Human Progress in a Diverse World</i>, p. 160. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>6. According to official figures, the proportion of the population living on less than 
</p>
<p>US$ 2 per day increased from 64.<footnote name="7">6 Ibid. 
</footnote> per cent in 2002 to 69.<footnote name="3">2 Amnesty International, The State of the World&#8217;s Human Rights, 2011, p. 159. </footnote> per cent in 2010.2 The increase 
</p>
<p>in people living on less than US$ 1 per day was even greater, from 21 per cent to 33 per 
</p>
<p>cent.3 Moreover, the Special Rapporteur was informed by the authorities that these 
</p>
<p>indicators have quite likely deteriorated since the April 2012 coup d&#8217;&#233;tat.4 The instability 
</p>
<p>following the coup disrupted the investment plans of traditional donors, such as the 
</p>
<p>European Union, the African Development Bank and the World Bank. They all suspended 
</p>
<p>their programmes, although the European Union continued its humanitarian assistance, 
</p>
<p>directly supporting the population. Additionally, both the European Union and the United 
</p>
<p>Nations imposed travel bans on individuals they identified as responsible for the coup. 
</p>
<p>7. These developments have had an impact on the human rights situation of the 
</p>
<p>country. Although there were some improvements in social indicators from 2000 to 2006, 
</p>
<p>information gathered in 2013 showed a general decline in these indicators following the 
</p>
<p>April 2012 coup and the suspension of many official development assistance programmes. 
</p>
<p>As a result, Guinea-Bissau will be unable to meet any of the Millennium Development 
</p>
<p>Goals by 2015. 
</p>
<p>8. The large disparity between the capital, Bissau, and the rest of the country also 
</p>
<p>widened between 2002 and 2010, with the population living on less than US$ 1 per day 
</p>
<p>increasing from 25 to 40 per cent in the regions, compared with an increase of from 9  to 13 
</p>
<p>per cent in Bissau. Between one third and half of the population live on less than US$ 1 a 
</p>
<p>day in regions other than the Bissau autonomous sector, and absolute poverty is pervasive 
</p>
<p>throughout the countryside.<footnote name="5">Ibid., p. 32. 
</footnote> Even in the best-performing region, Bolama/Bijag&#243;s, almost 
</p>
<p>half the population lives on less than US$ 2 a day, and in Gab&#250; absolute poverty is close to 
</p>
<p>universal, affecting 84 per cent of the population.6 Widespread poverty underscores the 
</p>
<p>vulnerability of the population: maternal mortality rates are some of the highest in the 
</p>
<p>world; few people have food security and potable water; and most communities lack access 
</p>
<p>to health care and education. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. Guinea-Bissau has been led by a Transitional Government since the 12 April 2012 
</p>
<p>coup. Following the coup, the Transitional Government passed a number of transitional 
</p>
<p>accords and pacts aimed at restoring constitutional governance. Following several 
</p>
<p>postponements, the first round of democratic elections took place on 13 April 2014, with a 
</p>
<p>massive and unprecedented voter participation rate of around 60 to 70 per cent, according 
</p>
<p>to the President of the National Electoral Commission. Planning for the post-election period 
</p>
<p>has begun and the National Commission of Planning and Strategic Coordination has been 
</p>
<p>established to develop an emergency plan addressing urgent needs in the areas of food 
</p>
<p>security, health and education, with support from the United Nations and in coordination 
</p>
<p>with government ministries. Funded equally by the Government and international partners, 
</p>
<p>including the World Bank and the African Development Bank, the plan foresees a budget of 
</p>
<p>approximately US$ 33 million to combat cholera, ensure social and political stability by

</p>
<p>activities.  
</p>
<p>10. Guinea-Bissau has actively engaged with human rights monitoring bodies by 
</p>
<p>participating in the universal periodic review (UPR) process in May 2010, engaging with 
</p>
<p>reviews by the United Nations human rights treaty bodies, and extending a standing 
</p>
<p>invitation to all special procedures of the Human Rights Council. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>welcomes Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s recent  ratification of key human rights instruments, including 
</p>
<p>the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment, and the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights aiming at the abolition of the death penalty; its signing of the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure, the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its optional protocol, the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, and the Convention for the Protection 
</p>
<p>of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; and its acceptance of the individual 
</p>
<p>complaints procedure under the Convention against Torture and the inquiry procedure 
</p>
<p>under the Convention against Torture, all in 2013, as well as the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 2009. 
</p>
<p>11. In 2010, the Government developed the Second National Poverty Reduction 
</p>
<p>Strategy Paper (Segundo Documento de Estrat&#233;gia Nacional de Redu&#231;&#227;o da Pobreza da 
</p>
<p>Guin&#233;-Bissau) (DENARP II). The national priorities and strategic options in this poverty 
</p>
<p>reduction strategy were guided by the vision <i>Djitu Ten</i>,<footnote name="7">DENARP II (2011&#8211;2015), p. 12. </footnote> which defines the priorities of the 
</p>
<p>country until 2025, and by the lessons learned from the implementation of DENARP I 
</p>
<p>(Documento de Estrat&#233;gia Nacional de Redu&#231;&#227;o da Pobreza da Guin&#233;-Bissau (2006-2010)). 
</p>
<p>The main objective of the second strategy paper is &#8220;to significantly reduce poverty in its 
</p>
<p>many dimensions by creating more opportunities for income, employment and improving 
</p>
<p>access to basic public services of good quality within a strengthened rule of law&#8221;. This 
</p>
<p>document recognizes that the systemic nature of weak governance in Guinea-Bissau is the 
</p>
<p>joint product of a severe and pervasive lack of administrative capacity, coupled with a 
</p>
<p>history of abuse in the exercise of political power. To address this situation, the 
</p>
<p>Government has articulated its commitment to strengthening the rule of law and national 
</p>
<p>institutions, ensuring a stable and conducive macroeconomic environment, promoting 
</p>
<p>sustainable economic development and raising the level of human capital development.  
</p>
<p>12. Despite the ratification of international human rights treaties and these robust policy 
</p>
<p>strategy documents, few steps have been taken to transform them into national policies and 
</p>
<p>action. Even in areas where there has been progress in establishing a legislative framework, 
</p>
<p>legislation does not translate into enforceable rights for many people in Guinea-Bissau.  
</p>
<p>There are severe implementation gaps in the application of poverty reduction strategies and 
</p>
<p>laws, including the new laws against female genital mutilation, human trafficking and 
</p>
<p>domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>13. While the Special Rapporteur takes note of the efforts by Guinea-Bissau to establish 
</p>
<p>a national human rights institution that is truly independent and has the requisite financial 
</p>
<p>and human resources, it is necessary to ensure that the new national human rights 
</p>
<p>commission is established by law and its statute is fully in accordance with the Principles 
</p>
<p>relating to the Status of National Institutions (the Paris Principles). The establishment of the 
</p>
<p>national human rights institution should be done following a participatory process that 
</p>
<p>includes human rights non-governmental organizations,  academics and community leaders. 
</p>
<p>Significant investment of human and financial resources is also needed, particularly in 
</p>

</p>
<p>efforts to make the work of the National Human Rights Commission accessible to 
</p>
<p>communities.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. General challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>14. Impunity constitutes one of the main threats to peace, stability, development and 
</p>
<p>national reconciliation in Guinea-Bissau, and has become a structural component of 
</p>
<p>democratic institutions such as the judiciary, particularly since the adoption of the Amnesty 
</p>
<p>Law in 2008, which covered crimes committed from 1973 to 2004. A subsequent amnesty 
</p>
<p>law was proposed in 2013, exempting from prosecution the military command and all 
</p>
<p>members of the military and paramilitary forces who in any way participated in the 
</p>
<p>preparation and carrying out of the 12 April 2012 coup and all related subsequent acts.<footnote name="8">0 UNICEF, State of the World&#8217;s Children, 2013, p. 109. </footnote> The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the second amnesty law was rejected by the 
</p>
<p>National Assembly on 10 September 2013, in line with what had been requested by civil-
</p>
<p>society organizations and international partners.  
</p>
<p>15. Combating impunity is a precondition for the sustainable development of the 
</p>
<p>country. Guinea-Bissau should avoid actions that reduce justice in favour of stabilizing 
</p>
<p>institutions, and renounce strategies that indefinitely postpone justice under the excuse of 
</p>
<p>first achieving economic growth.9 In order to ensure truth, justice, reparation and 
</p>
<p>guarantees of non-recurrence, the Special Rapporteur recommends that Guinea-Bissau 
</p>
<p>seriously consider the establishment of an international commission of inquiry supported by 
</p>
<p>the United Nations, as proposed in the concluding document of the first National 
</p>
<p>Conference on Impunity, Justice and Human Rights (July 2013). Social cohesion, peace and 
</p>
<p>stability depend on the extent to which there is rule of law, independence of the judiciary 
</p>
<p>and a modernized military operating under civilian oversight.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Corruption 
</b></p>
<p>16. Corruption is perceived to be rampant in Guinea-Bissau, as reflected in the 2013 
</p>
<p>Transparency International Corruption Perception Index ranking of the country in 163th 
</p>
<p>place out of 175 countries.10 The DENARP II strategy paper rightly acknowledges 
</p>
<p>corruption as being a main obstacle to reducing poverty. The prevailing climate of impunity 
</p>
<p>has fostered a culture of unfettered corruption and participation in illegal activities by some 
</p>
<p>senior State officials. According to information received by the Special Rapporteur, some 
</p>
<p>State officials and civil servants alike engage in nepotism, cronyism and bribery, and are 
</p>
<p>highly susceptible to political interference.  
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that corruption seriously undermines 
</p>
<p>the State&#8217;s capacity to fulfil its human rights obligations, and has a disproportionate impact 
</p>
<p>on people living in poverty. Corruption also compromises the sustainability of the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>natural resources and, therefore, the livelihoods of present and future generations. Although 
</p>
<p>Guinea-Bissau ratified the United Nations Convention against Corruption in 2007, very

<p><b>A/HRC/29/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>little effort has been made to implement it. There has not been any serious attempt to hold 
</p>
<p>high-level authorities accountable for recent corruption scandals. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur recalls that in June 2013, at the sixth annual Joint 
</p>
<p>Consultative Meeting between the Peace and Security Council of the African Union and the 
</p>
<p>Political and Security Committee of the European Union, the parties stressed the need for 
</p>
<p>Guinea-Bissau to take stronger measures to combat impunity and fight against organized 
</p>
<p>crime, drug trafficking and illegal fishing.11 In addition, they highlighted the importance of 
</p>
<p>the preservation and sustainable management of the natural resources of Guinea-Bissau, 
</p>
<p>including the sustainable exploitation of marine and land resources.  
</p>
<p>19. According to United Nations reports, Guinea-Bissau has become a transit country 
</p>
<p>for illicit drugs moving from Latin America to Europe, with top-level officials implicated in 
</p>
<p>drug trafficking.12 For example, in April 2013, Rear Admiral Bubo Na Tchuto, formerly the 
</p>
<p>head of the Guinea-Bissau navy, was arrested by United States anti-narcotics agents in 
</p>
<p>international waters near Cabo Verde and charged with conspiracy related to receiving, 
</p>
<p>storing and transporting large amounts of cocaine.13 The Chief of General Staff of the 
</p>
<p>Armed Forces, General Antonio Indjai, was formally charged with four counts of 
</p>
<p>conspiracy related to drug trafficking and terrorism.14  
</p>
<p>20. The country has an opportunity to progress. However, that depends on agreeing on a 
</p>
<p>common vision, a vision that moves the country&#8217;s politics away from short-term power 
</p>
<p>struggles and opportunistic alliances, towards working for the well-being of all members of 
</p>
<p>society, in particular the majority of the population, who live in abject poverty. In 
</p>
<p>corruption cases, the Government must take all measures to ensure that no one is above the 
</p>
<p>law. The Special Rapporteur notes the effectiveness of zero-tolerance policies in ensuring 
</p>
<p>transparency and accountability at all levels; such steps may be necessary to ensure that 
</p>
<p>public funds and the benefits of natural resources are not diverted by illegal means.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Neglect of public investments 
</b></p>
<p>21. While the Special Rapporteur recognizes Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s limited resources, a 
</p>
<p>compounding problem has been that the consistent decline of investment in critical social 
</p>
<p>services such as health care and education dramatically impairs the chances of further 
</p>
<p>development and drags the country backward.  
</p>
<p>22. As a result of the limited budget for overall government expenditure (22 per cent  of 
</p>
<p>gross domestic product (GDP), according to estimates), the share allocated to basic social 
</p>
<p>services is among the lowest in the Economic Community of West African States 
</p>
<p>(ECOWAS).15 The financial resources allocated to education in the national budget have

</p>
<p>declined sharply since 1987.16 In 2006, for example, less than 4 per cent of government 
</p>
<p>spending was allocated to education (US$ 10 per capita) as opposed to 6.<footnote name="7">9 Ibid., pp. 5 and 6. 
</footnote> per cent (US$ 
</p>
<p>14) in Niger.17 In 2007, per capita expenditure on health was estimated at US$ 4 in Guinea-
</p>
<p>Bissau, compared with an average of US$ 11 for low-income countries and US$ 34 for 
</p>
<p>Africa.18 In 2011, the budget allocated to education and health was a mere 20.7 per cent of 
</p>
<p>the total, as opposed to the international recommendation of 40 per cent.19 
</p>
<p>23. The lack of investment in critical social services raises serious concerns about the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the rights to education and health in the country. There are insufficient 
</p>
<p>schools and health infrastructure, the personnel are not adequately trained and the 
</p>
<p>distribution of the existing resources is unequal. For example, at a national level, 56.3 per 
</p>
<p>cent of students take more than one hour to access the nearest secondary school and 50.8 
</p>
<p>per cent of the population take more than an hour to reach the nearest health centre. For 
</p>
<p>Bissau, these figures are only 24.9 per cent and 24 per cent respectively.20 Moreover, as 
</p>
<p>reported in 2007, only 40.5 per cent of primary teachers have diplomas.21 
</p>
<p>24. Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child, States parties are legally obliged to take measures to 
</p>
<p>ensure the progressive enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. Guinea-Bissau 
</p>
<p>must spend the &#8220;maximum available resources&#8221; on the realization of economic and social 
</p>
<p>rights, such as health and education. Ultimately, the country cannot develop without 
</p>
<p>ensuring that funds stay out of the hands of corrupt officials and are invested in the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s most vital asset: its population. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur met 
</p>
<p>doctors, nurses and teachers who work tirelessly for their people, despite not receiving a 
</p>
<p>salary for months at a time. While commending their efforts, she calls on the State to ensure 
</p>
<p>that public workers, including those working in critical sectors such as health and 
</p>
<p>education, receive their salaries regularly and as a matter of priority.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Depletion of natural resources 
</b></p>
<p>25. Most of the population of Guinea-Bissau live in rural areas and their livelihoods 
</p>
<p>depend on the sustainable use of natural resources. The conservation of the environment is 
</p>
<p>critical to poverty reduction and the enjoyment of human rights. Farming and fishing 
</p>
<p>activities represent about 46 per cent of GDP. Guinea-Bissau is a country rich in natural 
</p>
<p>resources, including mineral deposits, rich bio-diversity and extensive fishing and forest 
</p>
<p>areas (72 per cent of the land area)22 that constitute an enormous potential for sustainable 
</p>
<p>development. 
</p>
<p>26. Corruption, impunity and lack of compliance with existing legislation is leading to 
</p>
<p>the unsustainable depletion of natural resources, which will have a major impact on the 
</p>
<p>livelihoods of the majority of the population and negatively affect the potential to diversify 
</p>
<p>sources of income. On the mainland, the nation&#8217;s forest resources are under threat due to 
</p>
<p>illegal logging activities. The Special Rapporteur visited the Bolama-Bijagos region, and 
</p>
<p>witnessed the impact of illegal fishing and logging of mangroves in protected marine areas.

<p>Moreover, communities potentially affected by the exploitation of natural resources are not 
</p>
<p>able to effectively and meaningfully participate in decision-making processes concerning 
</p>
<p>natural resource exploitation.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Gender inequality 
</b></p>
<p>27. The widespread gender inequality in the country is a major obstacle to sustainable 
</p>
<p>economic and social development. Gender inequality and discrimination are among the 
</p>
<p>main drivers of poverty and vulnerability, particularly in rural areas. The low human 
</p>
<p>development indicators in Guinea-Bissau impact women in particular. The gender 
</p>
<p>inequality gap continues to be very wide, placing the country 176th out of 186 countries on 
</p>
<p>the Gender Inequality Index (2012). Guinea-Bissau is an extremely patriarchal society 
</p>
<p>which has historically been indifferent to women&#8217;s rights and needs. In visiting rural 
</p>
<p>communities, the Special Rapporteur was struck by the extent to which the well-being and 
</p>
<p>the economy of the community and the households rely entirely on women. 
</p>
<p>28. The country cannot progress in crucial areas such as poverty reduction, sustainable 
</p>
<p>development or human rights enjoyment without significant measures to ensure the equal 
</p>
<p>status of women in society. This is not only a matter of basic justice and human rights, but 
</p>
<p>also a prerequisite for improving the lives of all in Guinea-Bissau. Evidence shows that 
</p>
<p>empowerment of women is a key factor in economic growth and development. This effort 
</p>
<p>must begin now without delay. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Situation of groups particularly vulnerable to poverty 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur identified the following groups as being particularly 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to poverty and requiring specific initiatives to overcome the impacts of 
</p>
<p>economic deprivation and social exclusion. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>30. Women and girls are often denied the full enjoyment of their human rights. 
</p>
<p>Disparities and lack of opportunities for women can be seen in all areas and sectors. Girls 
</p>
<p>are deprived from an early age of the possibility of achieving their full potential and of 
</p>
<p>acquiring the tools to lift themselves out of poverty. It is striking that the literacy rate of the 
</p>
<p>male population is 68.2 per cent, compared with 40.6 per cent for the female population.23 
</p>
<p>Women and girls are often solely responsible for unpaid care work and for providing for 
</p>
<p>their families in situations of extreme scarcity and their reward for a life of indefatigable 
</p>
<p>effort is the complete denial of their rights, such as the rights to education, health and 
</p>
<p>physical integrity. Compared with men, women have worse access to health services, a 
</p>
<p>higher incidence of HIV/AIDS, lower levels of school enrolment and literacy, reduced 
</p>
<p>incomes, higher rates of unemployment and greater difficulties in overcoming poverty.  
</p>
<p>31. Compounding their situation is the widespread prevalence of sexual and gender-
</p>
<p>based violence and a high level of impunity. All around the country, women are victims of 
</p>
<p>those abuses, without having access to protection, justice or remedies. Physical, 
</p>
<p>psychological and sexual violence against women is widespread, but remains 
</p>
<p>underreported. Domestic violence is rarely brought to the attention of the legal authorities. 
</p>

</p>
<p>Adult and Youth Literacy, 1990-2015 Analysis of data for 41 selected countries, 2012, pp. 14 and 15. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>For example, from 2006 to 2010, a total of 23,193 cases of violence against women, 
</p>
<p>including homicide, physical violence, sexual violence, psychological violence and 
</p>
<p>excision
 
were reported to the police across the country.24 Thirty-seven per cent of these 
</p>
<p>cases were reported in the capital, Bissau, where the presence of law enforcement and 
</p>
<p>judicial officials is stronger than in the regions, and transportation is more accessible.25 
</p>
<p>Cultural norms and taboos, lack of law enforcement officials and lack of economic 
</p>
<p>resources often deny women any possibility of seeking redress and seeking justice for those 
</p>
<p>responsible.  
</p>
<p>32. Female genital mutilation, which is an assault on women and girls&#8217; physical 
</p>
<p>integrity and violates their right to health, often has an impact on education and is 
</p>
<p>widespread in certain communities. In Guinea-Bissau the prevalence of this practice is 
</p>
<p>linked to poverty, because performing excisions may be the sole source of income for some 
</p>
<p>women. The prevalence and the increase in the number of reported cases may reflect an 
</p>
<p>unacceptable retrogression in women&#8217;s rights. As measured in 2011, 50 per cent of women 
</p>
<p>in Guinea-Bissau between 15 and 49 years of age have been genitally mutilated, while 39 
</p>
<p>per cent of women aged between 15 and 49 years of age have at least one mutilated 
</p>
<p>daughter.26  
</p>
<p>33. The practice of forced marriage is common in Guinea-Bissau, especially in the Gab&#250; 
</p>
<p>and Bafat&#225; regions.27 On average, between 7 and 10 per cent of girls are forced into  
</p>
<p>marriage before they reach the age of 15 years28 and 29 per cent are married before 
</p>
<p>reaching 18 years of age.29 It is also evident that there are some differences according to 
</p>
<p>economic status, with 37 per cent of women from very poor households married before the 
</p>
<p>age of 18.30 In many instances, the marriage is a direct result of poverty, with the male head 
</p>
<p>of household &#8220;selling&#8221; the girl in return for money, land or cattle. The Special Rapporteur is 
</p>
<p>concerned that, in many cases, early marriages are the result of trafficking, in other words, 
</p>
<p>girls being sold or traded for the purpose of marriage, usually via the threat or use of force, 
</p>
<p>fraud or coercion.31  
</p>
<p>34. Anecdotal reports paint a tragic picture: in 2011 alone, members of a church in the 
</p>
<p>Tombali region were beaten for sheltering 20 girls aged 14 to 16 who had run away to 
</p>
<p>avoid forced marriages to older men, a 15-year-old girl was beaten to death for refusing to 
</p>
<p>marry a much older man, and a girl and two of her female relatives were beaten for 
</p>
<p>objecting to her wedding on the grounds that the girl was under age. No legal or law 
</p>
<p>enforcement actions were taken in any of these cases.32 Although marriage under the age of

<p>14 years for girls and forced marriage are forbidden by law in Guinea-Bissau, this law is 
</p>
<p>broken among all ethnic groups in the country.33 
</p>
<p>35. Other factors affecting the right to health and education of women are the prevalence 
</p>
<p>of early pregnancy and early marriage. In 2011, 31 per cent of women between 20 and 24 
</p>
<p>years of age had given birth before reaching the age of 18, with the adolescent birth rate 
</p>
<p>measured at 137 births per 1,000 adolescent girls from 15 to 19 years of age.34 The early 
</p>
<p>pregnancy rate is slightly higher than the rate of early marriage. Much more needs to be 
</p>
<p>done to sensitize some ethnic groups on the negative impact of these traditional practices on 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s well-being. State authorities, health-care personnel and law enforcement officials 
</p>
<p>must demonstrate the strongest commitment to end all forms of harmful traditional 
</p>
<p>practices. The neglect of sexual and reproductive health in the country has an enormous 
</p>
<p>impact on the health and social well-being of women. For example, women reportedly face 
</p>
<p>high rates of obstetric fistula as early as at the age of 15 due to lack of access to emergency 
</p>
<p>obstetric care and may be discriminated against and socially excluded for the rest of their 
</p>
<p>lives as a result of their condition.35 The lack of attention to, data on and resources 
</p>
<p>dedicated to sexual and reproductive health perpetuate the lack of understanding by 
</p>
<p>authorities and health personnel of the tremendous negative impact on women.   
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that there has been some progress in establishing 
</p>
<p>legislative and policy frameworks to address gender inequality and combat violence against 
</p>
<p>women. In accordance with the recommendations of the Human Rights Council&#8217;s universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Discrimination against Woman, and with technical and financial support 
</p>
<p>from United Nations partners, Guinea-Bissau adopted the Law to Prevent, Fight and 
</p>
<p>Suppress Female Genital Mutilation (Law No. 14/2011), and the Law to Prevent and 
</p>
<p>Combat the Traffic of Persons, Particularly Women and Children (Law 12/2011). The 
</p>
<p>Government has also finalized the National Policy on Gender Equality and Equity, a 
</p>
<p>framework for promoting, coordinating and following up on equity in all sectors. 
</p>
<p>Collaboration with the specialized Parliamentary Committee on Women and Children 
</p>
<p>resulted in the Law against Domestic Violence being adopted by the National Assembly in 
</p>
<p>July 2013; it was promulgated by the President in January 2014. Recently, the Transitional 
</p>
<p>Government approved the National Plan to End Gender-based Violence (2014-2016) 
</p>
<p>following a wide-ranging dialogue with women&#8217;s organizations, human rights defenders, 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations and United Nations partners. Other important steps include the 
</p>
<p>2012 declaration by the National Islamic Conference for the abandonment of female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation, and the symbolic signing, in February 2013, of a fatwa condemning female 
</p>
<p>genital mutilation, by the Speaker of the Parliament, the President of the National 
</p>
<p>Committee for the Abandonment of Harmful Practices and representatives of 130 religious 
</p>
<p>leaders throughout the country. There are no recent data to indicate whether rates of 
</p>
<p>violence against women and the incidence of harmful traditional practices have dropped. 
</p>
<p>37. Despite being the pillar of society in Guinea-Bissau, women continue to be under-
</p>
<p>represented in decision-making positions, placing the country among the weakest-
</p>
<p>performing States in this respect in the ECOWAS region.36 In the April 2014 general 
</p>
<p>elections, women won 14 out of 102 legislative seats, or 13.7 per cent of the seats. 
</p>
<p>Ministers have not yet been appointed to the new Government. The current Transitional 
</p>
<p>Government includes just two women (compared with 28 men), accounting for 7.4 per cent 
</p>
<p>of the total membership in a country where women make up 51.5 per cent of the

</p>
<p>population.37 This severe under-representation is reflected at the local, community and 
</p>
<p>household levels, where women are largely unable to participate meaningfully in decision-
</p>
<p>making processes.  
</p>
<p>38. Women&#8217;s access to land and economic resources is also very limited. Although they 
</p>
<p>are the main users of the land as farmers and producers, and domestic law confirms the 
</p>
<p>equality of the sexes, in practice, women do not have secure land tenure. Rather, they are 
</p>
<p>restricted to secondary land rights, whereby their rights to use the land are gained only 
</p>
<p>through their husbands or other male family members.  
</p>
<p>39. Despite being the primary workers of the land, producing food and resources from it, 
</p>
<p>single, widowed or abandoned women have less access to land and economic opportunities. 
</p>
<p>Without secure rights and access to land and productive resources, rural women can easily 
</p>
<p>fall into even deeper poverty, and they face huge challenges to working their way back to 
</p>
<p>even subsistence levels for their families.  
</p>
<p>40. Women&#8217;s political participation at all levels must be improved and supported 
</p>
<p>without delay. Although women&#8217;s equal presence in decision-making bodies is only a first 
</p>
<p>step towards gender equality, it is a necessary one, to ensure women&#8217;s voices are able to be 
</p>
<p>heard in all matters that affect them. Critical measures must be taken by the newly elected 
</p>
<p>authorities as a matter of priority or women&#8217;s disempowerment will be perpetuated.  
</p>
<p>41. There are numerous examples of other developing countries, including post-conflict 
</p>
<p>countries, which have managed to increase the political participation of women 
</p>
<p>exponentially within a short time. The Special Rapporteur suggests that Guinea-Bissau 
</p>
<p>learn from such efforts in addressing its own challenges, although of course its own 
</p>
<p>measures must be carefully chosen and informed by the country&#8217;s social, political and 
</p>
<p>cultural context. 
</p>
<p>42. The new Government must make it a priority to ensure equality of women in all 
</p>
<p>spheres of life and consolidate a legal framework in which their role at all levels of 
</p>
<p>decision-making bodies, from the electoral commissions to the local governments, is 
</p>
<p>increased, facilitated and supported.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Children and youth 
</b></p>
<p>43. Guinea-Bissau has an extremely young population, with 47 per cent of the total 
</p>
<p>population under 18 years of age.38 Approximately 65 per cent are under 25 years of age 
</p>
<p>and 73 per cent are under 30 years of age.39 Females constitute a slightly higher percentage 
</p>
<p>of the population (51.8 per cent, compared with 48.2 per cent for males).40 Despite Guinea-
</p>
<p>Bissau being an extremely young country, the rights of children and youth have been 
</p>
<p>consistently neglected. Progress in their enjoyment of rights has not only been slow, but in 
</p>
<p>some cases, there have been retrogressions.  
</p>
<p>44. For example, the percentage of children whose births are registered declined from 
</p>
<p>39 per cent in 2006 to 24 per cent in 2010, limiting their access to basic services. Child 
</p>
<p>poverty also deepened their vulnerability to violence, exploitation and abuse, in particular 
</p>
<p>trafficking, child labour, child marriage and commercial sexual exploitation.

<p>45. Mortality rates for children under 5 in Guinea-Bissau are the seventh highest in the 
</p>
<p>world, with 161 child deaths per 1,000 live births in 2011.41 Tragically, one in 10 children 
</p>
<p>dies before his or her first birthday and one in 6 before reaching the age of 5.42 The main 
</p>
<p>causes of child mortality are neonatal complications, malaria, acute respiratory infections 
</p>
<p>and diarrhoea&#8212;all highly preventable.  
</p>
<p>46. Malnutrition, which has always been a major public health problem in Guinea-
</p>
<p>Bissau, continues to be one of the main underlying causes of infant mortality and 
</p>
<p>morbidity: 32 per cent of children suffer from moderate to severe stunting as a result of 
</p>
<p>chronic malnutrition, while 5 per cent are severely underweight.43 According to a 2012 
</p>
<p>SMART44 nutrition survey, the prevalence of acute malnutrition is 6.5 per cent  nationally, 
</p>
<p>reaching as high as 9.8 per cent in some areas.45 In 2013, the situation further deteriorated, 
</p>
<p>in part because of food insecurity, affecting mostly children under the age of 5. Despite a 
</p>
<p>significant improvement in breastfeeding prevalence (from 38 per cent to 67 per cent 
</p>
<p>between 2010 and 2012), infant feeding practices are one of the causes of this situation.46  
</p>
<p>47. The worst forms of child labour are prevalent in the country. In 2010, 57 per cent of 
</p>
<p>children between 5 and 14 years of age were engaged in child labour.47 Although the labour 
</p>
<p>law set the minimum employment age at 14 and prohibits heavy or dangerous labour for 
</p>
<p>children under 18, the law is not enforced. A comprehensive policy to combat the worst 
</p>
<p>forms of child labour is lacking and the Government has not established a list of hazardous 
</p>
<p>occupations that are prohibited for children.48  
</p>
<p>48. The number of reported cases of child trafficking seems to have increased in 2013 
</p>
<p>compared with previous years owing to greater poverty and the inability of families to feed 
</p>
<p>and take care of their children. Some child-trafficking victims are reportedly being forced 
</p>
<p>to work on the streets during the day begging for their masters at Koranic schools, and 
</p>
<p>study at night, while others are reported to be working in cotton fields in Ziguinchor 
</p>
<p>(Senegal) and surrounding areas.49  
</p>
<p>49. Significant work must be done to guarantee children&#8217;s right to education, 
</p>
<p>particularly in relation to secondary education. Only 20 per cent of girls and 27 per cent   of 
</p>
<p>boys attend secondary school.50 Girls are also more likely to experience educational 
</p>
<p>deprivation than boys&#8212;for various reasons, including early marriage and teenage 
</p>
<p>pregnancy.51 The number of schools is inadequate and children are required to walk or 
</p>
<p>travel long distances in order to continue attending school past the primary level. The low 
</p>
<p>quality of education, especially in rural areas, is of particular concern, with poor, rural 
</p>
<p>children less likely to complete primary education.

<p><b> VI. Challenges to the enjoyment of specific rights by those living 
</b></p>
<p><b>in poverty 
</b></p>
<p>50. While people living in poverty face challenges in relation to a wide range of rights, 
</p>
<p>this section addresses those rights that the Special Rapporteur perceived as particular 
</p>
<p>challenges during the visit.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to health  
</b></p>
<p>51. The Constitution of Guinea-Bissau provides for the promotion of the physical well-
</p>
<p>being and mental health of the population, including through prevention, progressive access 
</p>
<p>to medical treatment and improvement of the medical sector. Nonetheless, the health 
</p>
<p>system is not functioning. The Government prepared a National Health Development Plan 
</p>
<p>II for 2008-2017, which was not implemented owing to political instability. The health 
</p>
<p>sector lacks a basic law on health, with the most recent efforts to establish one abandoned 
</p>
<p>shortly after the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat of 2012. Public health expenditure has been decreasing over the 
</p>
<p>past 15 years. In 2010, an estimated 1 per cent of the country&#8217;s GDP was spent on health,52 
</p>
<p>the second-lowest expenditure among ECOWAS member States.   
</p>
<p>52. There is a lack of investment in public health centres: 44 per cent of the population 
</p>
<p>must walk for more than an hour to reach the closest primary health centre.53 Moreover, 
</p>
<p>health centres and State hospitals lack basic equipment. The Sim&#227; Mendes National 
</p>
<p>Hospital, the referral hospital for the country, faces severe constraints, such as power cuts, 
</p>
<p>shortages of medicines and food, and intermittent strikes by health workers over poor 
</p>
<p>working conditions and non-payment of salaries and subsidies. Sim&#227;o Mendes has 
</p>
<p>insufficient funding to maintain its generator and buy fuel from private sources, and the 
</p>
<p>frequent power shortages mean that operating theatres cannot run and the ability to 
</p>
<p>maintain sanitary conditions is severely compromised. Health posts in the regions are 
</p>
<p>merely symbolic, with most of them empty. Those which are &#8220;functioning&#8221; lack medical 
</p>
<p>personnel, basic equipment and medicines and they are not accessible due to distance and 
</p>
<p>the costs of travel and treatment. 
</p>
<p>53. The extremely high level of maternal mortality in the country presents a dire 
</p>
<p>situation. Maternal mortality rates rank eighth highest in the world, with an estimated 
</p>
<p>790 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births.54 It is deplorable that, in 2014, two women die 
</p>
<p>per day while giving birth. Nationally, 6 out of 10 women have no access to a skilled 
</p>
<p>attendant while giving birth&#8212;one of the most important factors in helping women survive 
</p>
<p>complications during and after delivery.55 Unsanitary and run-down facilities, a critical 
</p>
<p>shortage of health personnel, an inadequate supply system for medicines, geographic 
</p>
<p>barriers and the unaffordable cost represent major obstacles for women&#8217;s access to care. 
</p>
<p>54. According to the Human Development Report 2013, in Guinea-Bissau life 
</p>
<p>expectancy at birth is 48 years.56 Guinea-Bissau ranks second lowest among the ECOWAS

<p>countries (Sierra Leone being the lowest). However, life expectancy due to inequality drops 
</p>
<p>by 22 per cent, placing Guinea-Bissau in the last position in ECOWAS.57  
</p>
<p>55. HIV remains a significant problem. The national prevalence rate among adults is 
</p>
<p>5.3 per cent, with women disproportionately affected when compared to men: 6.9 per cent  
</p>
<p>versus 2.4 per cent.58 These rates are higher than the HIV prevalence in the West and 
</p>
<p>Central African region (estimated by UNAIDS at 2 per cent or under in 12 countries in 
</p>
<p>2009).59 The lack of anti-retroviral treatment, as a result of the suspension of support from 
</p>
<p>the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, is of particular concern. The 
</p>
<p>suspension of the Global Fund programme had a major impact in 2013 as the country 
</p>
<p>suffered a lack of test kits for almost six months and a reduction of treatment preventing 
</p>
<p>mother to child transmission.60 During that period, only 17.4 per cent of affected women 
</p>
<p>and 11.7 per cent of affected children benefited from treatment. The latest prevalence rates 
</p>
<p>for pregnant adolescents/women age 15 to 24 vary between 3 and more than 10 per cent 
</p>
<p>depending on the region.61 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>56. The educational system in Guinea-Bissau is very weak. More than 45 per cent of 
</p>
<p>school-age children do not have access to school, owing to lack of infrastructure and of 
</p>
<p>qualified and motivated teachers.62 Only 67 per cent of children aged between 7 and 12 
</p>
<p>years, and 24 per cent of secondary school children, are enrolled in school.63 Owing to the  
</p>
<p>high repetition rate, some 37 per cent of children attending primary school are aged 
</p>
<p>between 13 and 17. 64 Thirty-seven per cent of teachers have no formal teaching skills and 
</p>
<p>only 14 per cent of schools offer a complete primary cycle of six years.65 The inadequate 
</p>
<p>curriculum, school manuals and school infrastructure, and frequent and lengthy strikes by 
</p>
<p>teachers contribute to high dropout and repetition rates, especially for girls.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the number of children in primary 
</p>
<p>schools more than doubled between 2000 and 2010, with gross enrolment increasing from 
</p>
<p>70 to 117 per cent.66 However, educational outcomes remain extremely poor, as 
</p>
<p>demonstrated by the 2011 national examination results (76 per cent of children failed 
</p>
<p>ninth grade) and the low rate of 40 per cent literacy among women aged 15 to 24.67 Overall, 
</p>
<p>45.8 per cent of the population of Guinea-Bissau is illiterate.68

<p>58. If prevailing patterns of age-specific enrolment rates persist throughout the child&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>life, a child of school entrance age can expect to receive between 9 and 10 years of 
</p>
<p>schooling. Few students transition from primary to secondary education. Only 12 per cent  
</p>
<p>of girls complete the primary cycle (18 per cent of boys) as a result of girls&#8217; work in 
</p>
<p>household chores, agriculture and small businesses.69 Even fewer students transition from 
</p>
<p>secondary to tertiary education. Data collected between 2005 and 2012 indicate that, on 
</p>
<p>average, people aged 25 and older have received 2.3 years of education.70 
</p>
<p>59. The Constitution describes the elimination of illiteracy as a fundamental task,71 
</p>
<p>guarantees every citizen the right to an education72 and provides that the State will 
</p>
<p>gradually promote free education at every level.73 Yet, in reality, students face financial 
</p>
<p>barriers, including (a) requests by teachers to contribute to their survival because the State 
</p>
<p>does not pay teachers&#8217; salaries on a regular basis; (b) purchase of educational materials; 
</p>
<p>(c) transportation to school. Additionally, in the past three years, at least one third of each 
</p>
<p>academic year was lost as a result of repeated teachers&#8217; strikes. On 30 September 2013, the 
</p>
<p>first day of the academic year, State school teachers started a 60-day strike to demand full 
</p>
<p>payment of eight months of salary arrears and better working conditions. The strike was 
</p>
<p>lifted on 16 December 2013 following an agreement between the two teachers&#8217; unions and 
</p>
<p>the Transitional Government for the payment of four months of salary arrears. 
</p>
<p>60. Other factors hampering access to education are the prevalence of child labour, early 
</p>
<p>pregnancy and early marriage. Child labour affects both boys and girls, while early 
</p>
<p>pregnancy and marriage affects girls predominantly. In 2010, 57 per cent of children 
</p>
<p>between the ages of 5 and 14 were engaged in child labour.74 
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to adequate food 
</b></p>
<p>61. Food security is another critical concern. An in-depth analysis of food security and 
</p>
<p>vulnerability was conducted in 2010 throughout the country and provided mapping of rural 
</p>
<p>households in food insecurity.75 In the most severely affected regions of Quinara, Tombali, 
</p>
<p>Oio, Biombo and Bijagos, the levels of food insecurity were as high as 40 per cent in 2012, 
</p>
<p>representing around 50,000 households.76 Food access and availability became increasingly 
</p>
<p>difficult for the most vulnerable members of the population. The southern region had the 
</p>
<p>highest prevalence of food insecurity, followed by the north and east.77 Lowland rice fields 
</p>
<p>in the Gab&#250; and Oio regions were flooded; and 2,375 hectares of rice were destroyed.78 
</p>
<p>Rice production in mangrove areas decreased as a result of the flooding of 3,350 hectares in 
</p>

<p>the Tombali region. The drought caused by the influence of the Sahel drought affected the 
</p>
<p>production of cereals in the Gab&#250; and Bafata regions, and resulted in the loss of 15 per cent   
</p>
<p>of the yields of agricultural fields. Pest attacks in mangrove (Tombali region) and lowland 
</p>
<p>rice fields (Bafata region) devastated about 1,254 hectares, causing a 25 per cent loss in 
</p>
<p>production. Populations faced a significant decrease in their purchasing power.79  
</p>
<p>62. A National Nutrition Policy was validated in February 2014. It constitutes an 
</p>
<p>important prerequisite for Guinea-Bissau to adhere to the global Scaling Up Nutrition 
</p>
<p>initiative, which enables States to mobilize support and access resources for nutrition 
</p>
<p>improvement in their respective countries. The Policy has yet to be endorsed by the Council 
</p>
<p>of Ministers.  
</p>
<p>63. Guinea-Bissau has extremely low agricultural productivity and is dependent on one 
</p>
<p>crop (the cashew nut), which creates a major risk of food insecurity, and even famine, if the 
</p>
<p>crop fails or market prices drop. Despite the size of the agricultural sector, local food 
</p>
<p>production is insufficient to meet national requirements for various reasons, including poor 
</p>
<p>transport infrastructure, underdeveloped marketing systems, lack of access to credit and a 
</p>
<p>lack of agricultural inputs and irrigation facilities. 
</p>
<p>64. In 2013, the cashew nut sector faced an extraordinary crisis, with the Terms of Trade 
</p>
<p>going from one kilo of rice in exchange for one kilo of cashew nuts in 2011, to one kilo of 
</p>
<p>rice in exchange for three kilos of cashew nuts in 2013. This resulted in decreased 
</p>
<p>household food stocks in some regions. 
</p>
<p>65. The agricultural sector could be a motor of sustained economic growth, but this 
</p>
<p>cannot happen without an improved agricultural and rural infrastructure, which would also 
</p>
<p>have the benefit of increasing productive capacity, boosting livelihoods and increasing food 
</p>
<p>security. 
</p>
<p>66. While the development of infrastructure is essential, environmentally sustainable 
</p>
<p>development must be the goal. In Guinea-Bissau, forests and fisheries are at risk of 
</p>
<p>depletion. Greater measures must be taken to ensure the preservation of natural resources 
</p>
<p>for future generations and to address the degradation of the environment. The country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>natural resources rightfully belong to all the people of Guinea-Bissau, and must provide 
</p>
<p>food and livelihoods for them for many generations to come.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Rights to water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>67. Having access to safe drinking water and sanitation is central to living a life of  
</p>
<p>dignity and upholding human rights. As recognized by the General Assembly and the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, the right to water and sanitation derives from the right to an 
</p>
<p>adequate standard of living, enshrined in articles 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>68. In Guinea-Bissau, one third of the population and half of the rural population do not 
</p>
<p>have access to safe water. More than 80 per cent of the people lack access to sanitation, 
</p>
<p>including more than two thirds in urban areas. The situation in rural areas is critical, with 
</p>
<p>just 53 per cent of the people having access to improved drinking water sources and only 9  
</p>
<p>per cent to improved sanitation facilities.80  
</p>
<p>69. The lack of capacity to provide accessible, affordable and safe water has severe 
</p>
<p>consequences. The country faces recurrent outbreaks of cholera (e.g. in 2005, 2008, 2012 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>and 2013), which coincide with the rainy seasons between May and October. In 2013, the 
</p>
<p>epidemic affected only the Tombali region, where there were over 470 cases and 31 deaths 
</p>
<p>between March and early December 2013.81 Whereas a national sanitation and hygiene 
</p>
<p>policy was drafted in 2011, it has not yet been approved.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. International assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>70. Guinea-Bissau remains heavily dependent on official development assistance, which 
</p>
<p>represents up to 15 per cent of its GDP. In 2010, official development assistance amounted 
</p>
<p>to approximately 57 per cent of total revenue and funded over 50 per cent of the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>total expenditure. Given the grave situation of poverty in Guinea-Bissau, all States that are 
</p>
<p>in a position to assist should endeavour to do so, through financial and technical assistance 
</p>
<p>and capacity-building. The political situation of the past two years has understandably 
</p>
<p>jeopardized international assistance efforts, but the international community should 
</p>
<p>recognize the 2014 elections as a turning point and ensure that the people of Guinea-Bissau, 
</p>
<p>who are so much in need, are not further penalized for the actions of the political and 
</p>
<p>military elites. 
</p>
<p>71. Strong efforts should be made to ensure that in parallel with the support provided to 
</p>
<p>build the capacity of State institutions, civil society organizations continue to receive the 
</p>
<p>assistance that they need. Supporting and enabling vibrant civil society organizations in the 
</p>
<p>country is a way to ensure citizens&#8217; oversight and effective channelling of resources to the 
</p>
<p>poorest segments of the population. Despite all the obstacles, many civil-society 
</p>
<p>organizations are very effective in assisting in building up the livelihoods and capacities of 
</p>
<p>those they are able to reach, often with innovative projects. Additional resources are needed 
</p>
<p>to allow them to increase their impact, coverage and support, and transition from small 
</p>
<p>micro projects to broader ones. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the steps already taken by the State to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address poverty and inequality, to consider recommendations made by international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights bodies and to improve the effectiveness of poverty-reduction measures. 
</b></p>
<p><b>However, as evidenced in the present report, considerable challenges remain, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly with regard to widespread gender inequality, lack of implementation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation and poverty-reduction policies, the ongoing risk of corruption and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>culture of impunity. These issues are major obstacles not only to the </b>country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>development and economic growth but also to the enjoyment of human rights of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>vast majority of the population. In order to ensure a future in which the population of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guinea-Bissau has a higher level of enjoyment of rights, immediate action must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>taken to strengthen the rule of law and the judiciary, modernize the defence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>security forces, and ensure good governance and zero tolerance of corruption.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>While the report includes recommendations in each of its sections, the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur would like to especially urge Guinea-Bissau to take the following steps to 
</b></p>
<p><b>improve the enjoyment of rights by the poorest sectors of society:
