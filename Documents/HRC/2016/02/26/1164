<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in 
</p>
<p>practice carried out an official mission to Iceland at the invitation of the Government, from 
</p>
<p>16 to 23 May 2013. Two of its five members, Kamala Chandrakirana and Frances Raday,1 
</p>
<p>then respectively Chair-Rapporteur and Vice-Chair of the Working Group, participated in 
</p>
<p>the visit. 
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with its mandate as contained in Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 15/23, which was extended by Council resolution 23/7, the objectives of the 
</p>
<p>Working Group were to: engage in dialogue with the Government of Iceland and other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders on the issue of eliminating discrimination against women in law and in 
</p>
<p>practice; identify good practices relating to the elimination of laws that discriminate against 
</p>
<p>women or are discriminatory in terms of implementation or impact; and make 
</p>
<p>recommendations on improving legislation and implementing the law. More specifically, 
</p>
<p>the Group focused on achievements in gender equality laws, persisting gaps in 
</p>
<p>implementation and the gender dimensions of measures taken to address the economic 
</p>
<p>crisis. 
</p>
<p>3. During its eight-day visit, the Working Group&#8217;s delegation had discussions in 
</p>
<p>Reykjav&#237;k and Akureyri with government officials, the Acting Speaker and members of 
</p>
<p>parliament, the Althing Ombudsperson and the Debtor&#8217;s Ombudsperson, a trade union and 
</p>
<p>an employers&#8217; confederation, women&#8217;s rights and other civil society organizations, 
</p>
<p>academics and journalists. The Group also visited the fishing village of Dalvik, where it 
</p>
<p>met with the first female mayor and a female chief executive officer of a fishing company. 
</p>
<p>The Group especially wishes to thank the Government of Iceland for agreeing to the first 
</p>
<p>visit undertaken by a special procedures mechanism of the Human Rights Council to the 
</p>
<p>country. 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group enjoyed the full cooperation of the Government and all 
</p>
<p>authorities during its visit, and expresses its gratitude for their transparency and 
</p>
<p>collaboration. It would also like to thank the representatives of civil society and the other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders with whom it met, for their insightful exchanges.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p>5. Iceland has enjoyed the status of being one of the wealthiest and most developed 
</p>
<p>nations in the world.<footnote name="2">6 Gender Equality Act, art. 8. 
</footnote> For decades, it has had one of the very highest employment 
</p>
<p>participation rates amongst developed countries. It maintains a modern welfare state that 
</p>
<p>guarantees its citizens the benefits of free health care, free education, guaranteed pensions 
</p>
<p>and high standards of living. The main industries are fishing, tourism, renewable energy 
</p>
<p>industries and increasingly, high-tech industries.  
</p>
<p>6. The history of women&#8217;s rights and gender equality in Iceland dates back to the mid-
</p>
<p>nineteenth century, with women gaining equal access to education and the same inheritance 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Ms. Raday assumed her functions as Chair-Rapporteur in June 2013. 
</p>
<p> 2 Before the 2008 crisis, Iceland had achieved high growth, low unemployment and even distribution of 
</p>
<p>income (see http://data.worldbank.org/country/iceland). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>rights as men.<footnote name="3">4 Act No. 19 (1940), art. 194.  </footnote> Icelandic society has been characterized by a high degree of gender equality 
</p>
<p>in political life, with many women in leadership positions in government, and in 1980, 
</p>
<p>Iceland had its first democratically elected female Head of State.4 
</p>
<p>7. Iceland ranks as the most advanced country in gender equality for the fifth 
</p>
<p>consecutive year, according to the World Economic Forum.5 It scores particularly highly in 
</p>
<p>the areas of educational attainment and political empowerment of women.  
</p>
<p>8. In 2008 Iceland suffered a dramatic drop in its economy and currency following the 
</p>
<p>collapse of its banking system. The collapse came in the wake of a substantial increase in 
</p>
<p>spending related to consumption and the real estate market. This growth in the economy of 
</p>
<p>Iceland was fuelled by massive borrowing in foreign currencies. At the onset of the 
</p>
<p>financial crisis, the currency, the Icelandic kr&#243;na, strongly depreciated, the major 
</p>
<p>commercial banks collapsed, unemployment rose from 1 per cent to over 9 per cent, 
</p>
<p>inflation increased and there was a dramatic loss of savings. A salary freeze was imposed 
</p>
<p>and loan payment interest was increased to 50 per cent.  
</p>
<p>9. The post-crisis Government, which was elected in 2009, consisted of four men and 
</p>
<p>five women, including the former Prime Minister, who was the first female Prime Minister. 
</p>
<p>Women represented 42.9 per cent of the Althingi, the Icelandic Parliament. Thus, female 
</p>
<p>representation in the post-crisis Government peaked.  
</p>
<p>10. During the April 2013 elections, 25 women were elected to the Althingi, constituting 
</p>
<p>39.<footnote name="7">Gender Equality Act, art. 4. </footnote> per cent of its membership, a slight drop compared to the 2009 elections. In the current 
</p>
<p>Government, there are three women and six men, including the Prime Minister,6 thus 
</p>
<p>indicating a decline in women&#8217;s executive power.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal framework and policy measures, with a focus  
on the economic and financial crisis  
</b></p>
<p>11. Key gender-sensitive measures were introduced by the post-crisis Government, 
</p>
<p>including gender-budgeting across all ministries and some municipalities, gender quotas for 
</p>
<p>boards of private corporations, legislation criminalizing the purchase of sex, and a ban on 
</p>
<p>strip clubs.  
</p>
<p>12. A legal and policy framework on gender equality has been developed over the past 
</p>
<p>35 years and has provided a sound basis for achieving full equality between men and 
</p>
<p>women. This was made possible due to the vibrancy of the women&#8217;s movement in Iceland, 
</p>
<p>the high-level of voluntarism of civil society, coupled with recognition by the Government 
</p>
<p>of its role in shaping policy, and a strong tradition of participatory policymaking. Almost 
</p>
<p>all stakeholders, including government officials, agreed that for that framework on gender 
</p>
<p>equality to be fully and effectively implemented, a further change in stereotypical attitudes 
</p>
<p>and the increase of social awareness presented a significant challenge.

<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>13. The principle of gender equality is specifically addressed in article 65 of the 1995 
</p>
<p>Constitution, which states that men and women shall enjoy equal rights in every respect. 
</p>
<p>Further legislation has been adopted to ensure that that principle is guaranteed and 
</p>
<p>enforced. Iceland has ratified all the major international and regional instruments 
</p>
<p>guaranteeing gender equality, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women and its Optional Protocol, the European Convention on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and most of the European Union directives. 
</p>
<p>14. Iceland has adopted special legislation intended to ensure equality between women 
</p>
<p>and men and their equal status in all respects. In 1961, it adopted the Equal Pay Act, aimed 
</p>
<p>at addressing the gender pay gap. Currently, the Act on Equal Status and Equal Rights of 
</p>
<p>Women and Men No. 10/2008, as amended by Act No. 162/2010 and No. 126/2011 
</p>
<p>(hereinafter the Gender Equality Act) establishes and maintains equal status and equal 
</p>
<p>opportunities for women and men.  
</p>
<p>15. Article 1 of the Gender Equality Act lists a number of means to achieve that goal. It 
</p>
<p>introduces, inter alia, a minimum quota of 40 per cent in governmental (State and 
</p>
<p>municipal) committees and councils, when such bodies consist of more than three 
</p>
<p>members. It also institutionalizes gender mainstreaming, bans advertising in the media 
</p>
<p>which demeans, debases or disrespects women or men or counteracts the equal status of 
</p>
<p>women and men, and makes prevention of gender-based violence a priority.  
</p>
<p>16. The Working Group particularly welcomes the inclusion in the Gender Equality Act 
</p>
<p>of measures for men&#8217;s engagement, reinforcing men&#8217;s role as agents of change in 
</p>
<p>advancing gender equality. In particular, the Act tasks the Centre for Gender Equality, a 
</p>
<p>national bureau in charge of administering the Act, to seek a greater involvement of men in 
</p>
<p>gender equality issues, as well as aiming to change traditional gender images and working 
</p>
<p>against negative stereotyping regarding the roles of women and men.7 
</p>
<p>17. The Working Group also welcomes reforms in the area of sexual and gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence through the adoption of Act No. 61/2007, which introduced amendments 
</p>
<p>concerning sexual offences to the Penal Code. In particular, amendments were made to 
</p>
<p>articles 194&#8211;199 of the Code relating to rape and other offences against the sexual freedom 
</p>
<p>of persons and also to articles 200&#8211;<footnote name="2">5 The Centre for Gender Equality is only located in Akureyri. 
</footnote>02, dealing with sexual offences against children.  
</p>
<p>18. The Working Group further observes that article 22 of the Gender Equality Act 
</p>
<p>clearly places a duty on employers to take measures to protect employees, students and 
</p>
<p>clients from gender-based or sexual harassment in the workplace and in schools.  
</p>
<p>19. In 2000, the Althingi passed Act No. 95/2000 on Maternity/Paternity and Parental 
</p>
<p>Leave. The joint leave entitlement was extended from six to nine months and parents who 
</p>
<p>are active in the labour market are paid 80 per cent of their average salaries during their 
</p>
<p>leave. Parents have equal rights as the leave is distributed evenly between both parents. 
</p>
<p>Fathers have three months&#8217; non-transferable leave, mothers have three months and the 
</p>
<p>parents then have three months to share as they wish (3:3:3).  
</p>
<p>20. The Working Group notes with appreciation that in December 2012, the Althingi 
</p>
<p>voted in favour of a bill revising Act No. 95/2000, which proposed that parental leave be 
</p>
<p>gradually extended from 9 to 12 months and that parents should be paid 80 per cent of their 
</p>
<p>previous pre-crisis income. Under the proposal, by 2016, fathers would have five months&#8217; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>non-transferable leave, mothers five months, followed by two months for parents to share 
</p>
<p>as they wish (5:5:<footnote name="2">4 Ibid., art. 12. 
</footnote>).  
</p>
<p>21. The Working Group welcomes the Act on Gender Quotas in Corporations, adopted 
</p>
<p>in 2010, which has extended the 40 per cent gender quota, already in force in public 
</p>
<p>committees and bodies, to the corporate world for companies with 50 employees and above.  
</p>
<p>22. In 2010, purchase of prostitution was made punishable by law, through amendments 
</p>
<p>to the Penal Code.8 It became illegal to advertise prostitution. That same year, a ban on strip 
</p>
<p>clubs was enacted through amendments to the Act on Restaurants, Accommodation and 
</p>
<p>Entertainment,9 prohibiting profit from nudity. The ban enabled authorities to close strip 
</p>
<p>clubs that had been linked with prostitution, human trafficking and other illegal activities. 
</p>
<p>23. The Working Group, however, has received information that implementation of 
</p>
<p>those two amended laws remains weak. A campaign organized by women&#8217;s activists called 
</p>
<p>Operation Big Sister, aimed to uncover the existing online prostitution market. Although 
</p>
<p>the evidence the campaign gathered could not be used to launch an investigation or make 
</p>
<p>any arrest since it was deemed to have been collected by entrapment, the campaign drew 
</p>
<p>attention to the issues and highlighted both a lack of political will to prioritize 
</p>
<p>implementation of those laws coupled with a lack of capacity of law enforcement agencies 
</p>
<p>to enforce them effectively.  
</p>
<p>24. Legislative developments have also taken place in the area of lesbian, gay, bisexual 
</p>
<p>and transgender rights. The Marriage Act, adopted in 2010, establishes a gender-neutral 
</p>
<p>definition of marriage and applies to both heterosexual and same-sex couples. In addition, a 
</p>
<p>new law on the rights of transgender individuals was adopted in June 2012, improving their 
</p>
<p>legal status.  
</p>
<p>25. The Working Group notes that at the time of its visit three separate anti-
</p>
<p>discrimination bills had been under discussion for quite some time: the bill on equal 
</p>
<p>treatment in the labour market, whose objective is to combat discrimination, establish and 
</p>
<p>maintain equal treatment of persons in the labour market regardless of a person&#8217;s race, 
</p>
<p>ethnic origin, religion, belief, disability, age, sexual orientation or transgender identity; a 
</p>
<p>bill on equal treatment, aimed at ensuring equal treatment in relation to social protection, 
</p>
<p>including social security, health care and education, regardless of a person&#8217;s race and ethnic 
</p>
<p>origin; and a bill on equality in administration, whose purpose is to combine in one 
</p>
<p>legislative instrument the provision of administration in relation to equal treatment, 
</p>
<p>regardless of prohibited grounds, and in relation to gender equality.  
</p>
<p>26. The Working Group notes that those anti-discrimination bills had been sent to key 
</p>
<p>stakeholders for review and were to be made available to the public for comments in May 
</p>
<p>2013 and due for submission to Parliament in 2014&#8211;<footnote name="2">3 Ibid., art. 13. </footnote>015. The Group is of the opinion that 
</p>
<p>the adoption of such an anti-discrimination law framework would help remove multiple 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women based on the intersection of sex and race or ethnicity, 
</p>
<p>including with regard to women of foreign origin. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Policy measures 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Policy measures aimed at mitigating the gender impact of the crisis 
</b></p>
<p>27. In the context of the ongoing economic crisis in several parts of the world, Iceland 
</p>
<p>provides some key lessons for nations facing a severe financial crisis, as the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>economic and social measures have led to a strong and gender-responsive recovery. In fact, 
</p>
<p>Iceland was designated number one in the world for gender equality by the World 
</p>
<p>Economic Forum10 precisely at the time that it was dealing with the worst economic crisis 
</p>
<p>in its history. That achievement reflects the consistently high priority given by the 
</p>
<p>Government to integrating gender equality throughout its policymaking, and the wide 
</p>
<p>consensus among all stakeholders that gender equality is a pillar of Icelandic society.  
</p>
<p>28. The Working Group conducted its visit when Iceland was still emerging from the 
</p>
<p>2008 economic meltdown. Iceland had been praised by international experts, including 
</p>
<p>those of the International Monetary Fund, for taking measures which had led to recovery, 
</p>
<p>such as keeping a strong commitment towards safeguarding its welfare system and 
</p>
<p>imposing the immediate cost of losses on bondholders rather than taxpayers.11 In response 
</p>
<p>to the banking crisis, Iceland engaged in financial restructuring involving greater State 
</p>
<p>ownership of banks and increased overall public expenditure. Emergency legislation 
</p>
<p>authorized the takeover by the State of banks experiencing payment difficulties. Unlike 
</p>
<p>several other countries in the world that faced financial crisis, Iceland chose not to offer 
</p>
<p>immediate repayment to creditors of the country&#8217;s banks, thus alleviating the economic 
</p>
<p>burden on employers, employees and other members of society.12 Instead, the International 
</p>
<p>Monetary Fund gave its consent to a recovery programme, which was conditional on 
</p>
<p>Iceland reimbursing its creditors for their losses over a prolonged period. 
</p>
<p>29. To avoid undermining the position of women in the job market, an economic policy 
</p>
<p>decision was made to preserve public service jobs. The Working Group appreciates the 
</p>
<p>importance of this measure for working women as women occupy 57 per cent of public 
</p>
<p>service jobs and the public service sector also provides services on which families, and 
</p>
<p>especially working women, are dependent. In some sectors, including health-care centres, 
</p>
<p>employees&#8217; working time was reduced from 100 per cent to approximately 80 per cent and 
</p>
<p>employers were allowed the possibility of laying off employees for a maximum of 50 per 
</p>
<p>cent of their working time, accompanied by a compensatory grant of 50 per cent 
</p>
<p>unemployment benefit. At the peak of the crisis, the unemployment rate reached 10 per 
</p>
<p>cent, which was lower than that of many other European countries in crisis.  
</p>
<p>30. In December 2008, the Parliament of Iceland established a Special Investigation 
</p>
<p>Commission tasked with investigating and analysing the processes leading to the collapse 
</p>
<p>of the three main banks in Iceland. The Commission report13 to the Althingi in 2010 
</p>
<p>concluded that the main cause of the failure of the banks was the rapid growth of the banks, 
</p>
<p>their size at the time of the collapse and high-risk borrowing and investment.  
</p>
<p>31. The governmental analysis of the Special Investigation Commission, issued by 
</p>
<p>Thorgerdur Einarsd&#243;ttir and Gyda Margr&#233;t P&#233;tursd&#243;ttir, respectively Professor and 
</p>
<p>Assistant Professor of Gender Studies in the Faculty of Political Science at the University 
</p>
<p>of Iceland, found that &#8220;social and culturally ingrained ideas and discourse relating to gender

</p>
<p> 11 In 2011, after the introduction of austerity measures, the economy of Iceland showed and maintained 
</p>
<p>the first signs of growth, allowing unemployment to quickly decrease. The positive results of 
</p>
<p>monetary and financial policies led Iceland in 2012 to be lauded by the International Monetary Fund 
</p>
<p>for its impressive economic recovery. 
</p>

</p>
<p>played a large part&#8221; in the events leading to the financial collapse.14 Examining the role 
</p>
<p>gender played in the events leading up to and after the collapse of the banks, the report 
</p>
<p>revealed that social and culturally ingrained ideas and discourse relating to gender played a 
</p>
<p>large part in those events.  
</p>
<p>32. In particular, the above-mentioned report showed that all the main players in the 
</p>
<p>collapse of banks were men and that women were in a minority in politics, business, and 
</p>
<p>companies&#8217; boards of directors, the media, bank owners, borrowers and the recipients of 
</p>
<p>grants.15 It also stated that men, who were the main players in the collapse, had acted in the 
</p>
<p>context of a masculine culture which was highly competitive and encouraged risk-taking.  
</p>
<p>33. The intense public debate following the crisis also led to a governmental decision to 
</p>
<p>create a Gender Equality Watch, to ensure that the crisis would not undermine existing 
</p>
<p>achievements in gender equality. Its role was to evaluate the ongoing impact of the 
</p>
<p>economic situation from a gender perspective with the objective of ensuring that actions 
</p>
<p>taken to strengthen the economy would reflect gender equality principles.  
</p>
<p>34. After the 2009 elections, the Gender Welfare Watch was incorporated into the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Security&#8217;s Well-Being Watch, whose task was to 
</p>
<p>systematically monitor the effects of the financial crisis on individuals and households in 
</p>
<p>Iceland. Its broad constituency composition16 ensured its legitimacy. Successive reports 
</p>
<p>from the Well-Being Watch recommended options for the social protection system of 
</p>
<p>Iceland to shelter more vulnerable groups during the economic crisis.  
</p>
<p>35. The issue of gender equality gained an increased momentum in the post-crisis debate 
</p>
<p>and, after 2008, women became very prominent in leading positions in the executive 
</p>
<p>branch. Prime Minister J&#243;hanna Sigur&#240;ard&#243;ttir was Head of Government and she 
</p>
<p>established the position of Special Adviser on Gender Equality in her Cabinet. She also 
</p>
<p>brought other women into government during her tenure and women held economic 
</p>
<p>portfolios such as Minister of Finance.  
</p>
<p>36. Furthermore, in January 2011, the Government presented the Iceland 2020 policy 
</p>
<p>statement,17 which outlined a vision for the future of the country with a gender 
</p>
<p>mainstreaming perspective. That policy statement was developed through dialogue and 
</p>
<p>collaboration among all stakeholders throughout Iceland, including consultations with 
</p>
<p>regional associations, local authorities, trade unions and economic interest groups. The 
</p>
<p>policy aimed to ensure more targeted and effective policymaking and planning in the public 
</p>
<p>sector and acknowledged the need to continue to incorporate a gender mainstreaming 
</p>
<p>perspective into government policymaking and employment creation measures. Among its 
</p>
<p>15 concrete objectives, it lists the goal of narrowing the gender gap to 0.9 by 2020, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the indices of the Global Gender Gap Index.  
</p>
<p>37. The Working Group welcomes the fact that the newly-elected Government, which 
</p>
<p>was inaugurated in May 2013, has retained the ministerial committee in charge of cross-
</p>
<p>sectoral coordination on gender issues, which was an initiative of the Office of the former 
</p>
<p>Prime Minister and is now chaired by the Prime Minister and composed of the Minister of 
</p>
<p>Social Affairs and Housing, the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs and the Minister 
</p>
<p>of the Interior.

</b></p>
<p>38. The Working Group notes that the economic crisis triggered a broad public debate 
</p>
<p>which led to an attempt to introduce constitutional changes. For that purpose, in 2011 the 
</p>
<p>Parliament appointed a Constitutional Council, composed of 25 delegates from the 
</p>
<p>citizenry, which delivered its proposal for a completely revised Constitution in mid-2011. 
</p>
<p>The proposal emphasized the need for checks and balances between the three branches of 
</p>
<p>government as well as principles of accountability. It also stressed the need for 
</p>
<p>transparency, fairness, protection of the environment; national ownership of natural 
</p>
<p>resources, with rules for efficient and fair exploitation; and prioritizing the fight against 
</p>
<p>corruption. It further stated that men and women should enjoy equal rights in all respects 
</p>
<p>and without discrimination on the basis of, inter alia, sex. Additionally, the proposal set out 
</p>
<p>an extensive programme on social rights. A national non-binding referendum, held in 
</p>
<p>October 2012, resulted in a 49 per cent turnout, with approximately two thirds of the voters 
</p>
<p>affirming the proposal of the Constitutional Council to be used as the basis of a legislative 
</p>
<p>bill for a new Constitution. However, the national Parliament was not able to conclude its 
</p>
<p>work on the bill before the April 2013 elections.  
</p>
<p>39. At the policy level, a plan of action on gender equality for the period 2011&#8211;<footnote name="2">2 Gender Equality Act, art. 15. </footnote>014 
</p>
<p>was adopted by Parliament. Its aim is to ensure that particular strategies, such as gender 
</p>
<p>budgeting, are implemented by all ministries. Under the new plan, the different implications 
</p>
<p>for women and men of any planned governmental action were to be examined in order to 
</p>
<p>ensure fuller and more widespread implementation of gender mainstreaming. The plan&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>objectives include addressing underrepresentation of women in government, gender 
</p>
<p>disparities in the labour market, the gender pay-gap, gender-based violence, gender equality 
</p>
<p>in education, the engagement of men in gender equality initiatives and the involvement of 
</p>
<p>the country in international cooperation efforts to promote gender equality.  
</p>
<p>40. The Working Group regards the introduction of gender budgeting during the 
</p>
<p>economic crisis in 2009 as commendable. The budget constitutes a central and crucial 
</p>
<p>policy statement and the inclusion of gender budgeting demonstrates a deep commitment to 
</p>
<p>gender equality which can help to remove invisible barriers to gender equality. Gender 
</p>
<p>budgeting has been part of the Government&#8217;s policy to mitigate the impact of austerity 
</p>
<p>measures on women. The gender budgeting programme aims to become an ongoing part of 
</p>
<p>public administration and good economic management. For 2011&#8211;<footnote name="2">1 An estimate of 1.88 children born/women (2013). 
</footnote>014, each ministry in 
</p>
<p>the Government has chosen a main policy area to which gender budgeting will be applied.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Policy on work-life balance 
</b></p>
<p>41. As noted above, through the Maternity/Paternity and Parental Leave Act 
</p>
<p>No. 97/2000, Iceland introduced measures to address many of the challenges women face in 
</p>
<p>accessing equal working conditions and balancing work and family life, such as equalizing 
</p>
<p>mothers&#8217; and fathers&#8217; access to parental leave, providing paid leave of three months for 
</p>
<p>mothers, three for fathers and three shared. The three months earmarked respectively for the 
</p>
<p>mother and the father are not transferable and the measure gives the distinct message both 
</p>
<p>within the family and within the workplace that parental care18 is not stereotypically a 
</p>
<p>woman&#8217;s burden and fathers share a common responsibility in the upbringing of their 
</p>
<p>children.  
</p>
<p>42. It is reported that fathers have accepted paid paternity leave with enthusiasm, with 
</p>
<p>approximately 90 per cent taking advantage of the leave, resulting in their enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>closer relationships with their children and placing women and men on a more equal 
</p>
<p>footing in the workplace.19 Although the Working Group heard from some sources that 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 18 A/HRC/WG.6/12/ISL/1, para. 25. 
</p>
<p> 19 See <i>Icelandic Review of Politics &amp; Administration</i>, vol. 9, No. 2 (2013), pp. 323&#8211;344. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>some men see their paternity leave as mere vacations, other research has shown that the 
</p>
<p>policy on paternity leave has led to a change in the culture that viewed women as primarily 
</p>
<p>responsible for childcare.  
</p>
<p>43. The Working Group commends the Government for its efforts to ensure that 
</p>
<p>austerity measures do not disrupt the gender balance. That was achieved by reducing the 
</p>
<p>level of leave payment, but in an equal manner for both parents. The Group also commends 
</p>
<p>the decision, in the post-crisis recovery, to re-establish the original level of leave pay and to 
</p>
<p>gradually reduce the length of the shared months from three to two (5:5:2) in order to 
</p>
<p>further reduce the divisible time frame in which women have been generally the parent to 
</p>
<p>take the leave.  
</p>
<p>44. In addition, subsidies to childcare providers have been granted and public childcare 
</p>
<p>has expanded over the past few decades. Municipalities are in charge of childcare and 
</p>
<p>provision of subsidized childcare services20 starting at the age of one year, which is when 
</p>
<p>paid leave for mothers and fathers ends. The Working Group notes with appreciation that 
</p>
<p>childcare leave and subsidized childcare services extend to self-employed parents. The 
</p>
<p>Group observes that that might partially explain the fact that, at 78 per cent, Iceland had 
</p>
<p>one of the highest rates of female labour force participation among Organization for 
</p>
<p>Economic Cooperation and Development countries in 2010, despite also having one of the 
</p>
<p>highest fertility rates in Europe.21  
</p>
<p>45. Despite highly progressive measures taken to conciliate family and work life, most 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, both governmental and non-governmental, with whom the Working Group 
</p>
<p>met, shared the view that more could be done to achieve greater flexibility in working 
</p>
<p>conditions and facilitate conciliation of work and parenthood. They suggested that one way 
</p>
<p>that could be achieved was by synchronizing parents&#8217; holidays and working hours with day 
</p>
<p>care and school hours for children.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Positive action in the corporate sector 
</b></p>
<p>46. As noted above, the Working Group appreciates the adoption of the Act on Gender 
</p>
<p>Quotas in Corporations, which extended the 40 per cent gender quota already in force in 
</p>
<p>public committees and bodies22 to the corporate world for companies with 50 employees 
</p>
<p>and above. The adoption of the Act was unanimously reported to the Group as being a 
</p>
<p>direct consequence of the financial crisis. However, the Group notes that the minimum 
</p>
<p>number of employees required is rather high for the Icelandic context. The Group was 
</p>
<p>encouraged to hear that, while the law was not to enter into effect until 1 September 2013, 
</p>
<p>private corporations had received it well and had already, during the visit of the Group, 
</p>
<p>started to increase the representation of women on their boards, so as to be fully compliant 
</p>
<p>at the date of its entry into force. The introduction of the quotas in public boards was 
</p>
<p>unanimously reported to have been effective in changing the working spirit of public 
</p>
<p>companies and making them more family-friendly. The Group is therefore confident that 
</p>
<p>the measure, applied in a corporate context, will have a transformative impact on women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>leadership in the private sector.  
</p>
<p>47. Another challenge facing women is access to financial resources for establishing 
</p>
<p>their own companies (women only own 20&#8211;25 per cent of companies). The Directorate of 
</p>
<p>Labour, within the Ministry of Welfare, manages projects providing either grants or loan 
</p>
<p>guarantee funds for women willing to start their own business.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 20 Childcare is mainly financed by taxes and supplemented by parental fees (approximately 25 per cent) 
</p>
<p>but with reduced or waived fees for low-income groups.

</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p><b> IV. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Ministry of Welfare is the main body responsible for creating and implementing 
</p>
<p>policies on gender equality through a number of gender equality bodies.  
</p>
<p>49. The main gender equality bodies in Iceland are the Centre for Gender Equality, the 
</p>
<p>Gender Equality Council and other specialized complaints committees such as the Gender 
</p>
<p>Equality Complaints Committee. In addition, the Althing Ombudsman plays an important 
</p>
<p>role in ensuring that the principle of equality, including gender equality, is observed by the 
</p>
<p>administration in Iceland. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Centre for Gender Equality  
</b></p>
<p>50. The Centre for Gender Equality is regarded by key stakeholders as an important 
</p>
<p>source of advice and assistance in advancing gender equality goals. It is a special institution 
</p>
<p>under the Ministry of Welfare, which is in charge of administering the Gender Equality Act 
</p>
<p>(art. 3). Among other tasks, as stated in article 4 of the Act, the Centre provides advice on 
</p>
<p>gender equality issues to government authorities, institutions, companies, non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations and individuals. It also monitors gender equality developments 
</p>
<p>in society, through the gathering of information and research. In addition, the Centre works 
</p>
<p>on preventive measures against gender-based violence, gender-based wage discrimination 
</p>
<p>and other forms of gender discrimination in the labour market. It is also involved in 
</p>
<p>mediating disputes referred to it under the Act.  
</p>
<p>51. The Centre for Gender Equality further acts as a watchdog. If it suspects a possible 
</p>
<p>violation of the Gender Equality Act, the Centre can request relevant information from any 
</p>
<p>governmental institution, private enterprise or non-governmental organization. If it receives 
</p>
<p>no response, it has the authority to impose a daily fine until the information requested has 
</p>
<p>been provided.  
</p>
<p>52. Similarly, according to article 18 of the Gender Equality Act, enterprises and 
</p>
<p>institutions with more than 25 employees are required to adopt gender equality programmes 
</p>
<p>or mainstream gender equality into their personnel policy, such as equal pay, combining 
</p>
<p>occupational and family obligations and special measures to prevent sexual harassment in 
</p>
<p>the workplace. If an enterprise or institution fails to comply with the instructions given by 
</p>
<p>the Centre for Gender Equality, the latter may determine that the enterprise or institution 
</p>
<p>pay a daily fine until it complies with instructions. In practice, this power has never been 
</p>
<p>used by the Centre, as a response to a request for information is invariably received. The 
</p>
<p>Centre reported that it had provided advice to banks regarding the design of their action 
</p>
<p>plans and that, during the visit of the Working Group, was examining the gender plans of 
</p>
<p>all the municipalities. 
</p>
<p>53. The Centre for Gender Equality is tasked under the Gender Equality Act to increase 
</p>
<p>the level of activity regarding gender equality issues through greater involvement of men in 
</p>
<p>gender equality work. As such, a working group composed of men submitted a report with 
</p>
<p>suggestions to the Minister of Welfare on a broad range of priority areas such as sexual and 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence, caregiving, health and quality of life, pornography and prostitution, 
</p>
<p>education and gender segregation of the labour market. Furthermore, the Act requires all 
</p>
<p>ministries to have a gender equality representative tasked with monitoring gender equality 
</p>
<p>work in the policy areas of the ministry in question and its institutions.23 The gender 
</p>
<p>equality representatives are requested to submit a report on a yearly basis to the Centre. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>Similarly, the Act also requires municipalities to appoint gender equality committees to 
</p>
<p>examine equal status and equal rights of women and men within their municipality.24 The 
</p>
<p>committees further submit a biennial report to the Centre.  
</p>
<p>54. Despite those achievements, the Working Group is concerned that inadequate 
</p>
<p>funding and staffing shortfalls at the Centre for Gender Equality are likely to have an 
</p>
<p>impact on its efficiency and effectiveness. While its mandate was expanded in 2008, its 
</p>
<p>budget was reportedly cut by 30 per cent during the economic crisis. Concerns were also 
</p>
<p>raised about the location of the Centre far from Reykjavik,25 making access very difficult 
</p>
<p>for some right holders to seek its services.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Gender Equality Council 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Gender Equality Council  is composed of 11 representatives appointed by the 
</p>
<p>Minister of Welfare in collaboration with employees, employers&#8217; associations and a 
</p>
<p>selection of major civil society organizations specialized in gender issues.26 The Council 
</p>
<p>works closely with the Centre for Gender Equality and advises the Minister of Welfare and 
</p>
<p>the Director of the Centre on policymaking regarding gender equality issues.27 Its role 
</p>
<p>particularly includes the promotion of gender equality in the labour market and the 
</p>
<p>reconciliation of work and family life. In addition, the Council is responsible for  preparing 
</p>
<p>the biannual Gender Equality Forum, in consultation with the Minister of Welfare. The 
</p>
<p>purpose of the Forum is to create a platform to assess and discuss gender equality issues in 
</p>
<p>the country. The Council presents a report on its work to the Forum.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Gender Equality Complaints Committee 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Gender Equality Complaints Committee examines cases and delivers a ruling on 
</p>
<p>whether provisions of the Gender Equality Act have been violated. The Committee&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rulings are binding for the parties and cases may be referred to the courts. 
</p>
<p>57. The Gender Equality Complaints Committee is competent to review cases of alleged 
</p>
<p>discrimination based on gender. According to information received during the visit, the 
</p>
<p>Committee received around 11 complaints in 2012, of which 70 per cent were from women. 
</p>
<p>Out of that number, approximately 50 per cent related to discrimination during the hiring 
</p>
<p>process and 20 per cent to wage discrimination. In general, however, only two cases on 
</p>
<p>average per year reach a decision on the merits.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Althing Ombudsperson 
</b></p>
<p>58. The institutional framework of Iceland for the protection of human rights is focused 
</p>
<p>on the office of the Althing or Parliamentary Ombudsperson. According to Act 
</p>
<p>No. 85/1997, article 3, the Ombudsman monitors the administration of the State and local 
</p>
<p>authorities, as well as the activities of private bodies, insofar as they have been vested by 
</p>
<p>law with authority to decide on individuals&#8217; rights and obligations. Furthermore, article 3 
</p>
<p>provides that jurisdiction of the Ombudsman shall not cover proceedings of the Althingi 
</p>
<p>and its bodies, proceedings of the courts of law, or decisions and other acts of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>authorities where the law expressly states that redress should be sought before the courts. 
</p>
<p>The Ombudsman has powers to act on complaints submitted to him or her by individuals, 
</p>
<p>and can also take up cases <i>suo motu</i> under article 5. Interestingly, proceedings under 
</p>
<p>article 5 are not bound by the restriction of jurisdiction prescribed under article 3, and so it 
</p>
<p>appears that the Ombudsman can inspect the actions of judicial bodies as long as it acts of 
</p>
<p>its own volition and not at the behest of a private person. 
</p>
<p>59. An important feature of the Althing Ombudsman is that he/she can also review the 
</p>
<p>legality of administrative acts. As such, he/she has an explicit role in safeguarding gender 
</p>
<p>equality. However, very few cases have been submitted in relation to discrimination against 
</p>
<p>women and it was reported that out of the total complaints received, only 25 per cent 
</p>
<p>emanated from women, a very low percentage bearing in mind that women constitute 
</p>
<p>57 per cent of women in the public service. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Lack of a national human rights institution 
</b></p>
<p>60. There is no national human rights institution under the Paris Principles in Iceland. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group acknowledges both the commitment of Iceland to assess the need for a 
</p>
<p>national human rights institution, as expressed during its consideration by the Committee 
</p>
<p>on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 2012 (E/C.12/ISL/Q/4) and preparatory work 
</p>
<p>undertaken for the establishment of such an institution. In the absence of a national human 
</p>
<p>rights institution, its role is de facto assumed by the Icelandic Human Rights Centre. This 
</p>
<p>Centre is an independent non-governmental institution established in 1994 and is partially 
</p>
<p>funded from the State budget. Its purpose is to promote human rights by collecting 
</p>
<p>information on and raising awareness of human rights issues in Iceland and abroad. The 
</p>
<p>Centre works to make human rights information accessible to the public by organizing 
</p>
<p>conferences and seminars on human rights issues and providing human rights education. 
</p>
<p>The Centre also promotes legal reform and research on human rights and has established 
</p>
<p>the only specialized human rights library in Iceland. It further provides legal counselling in 
</p>
<p>accordance with an agreement with the Ministry of Welfare. The majority of that 
</p>
<p>counselling is provided to women who have suffered abusive relationships. It also reaches 
</p>
<p>out to immigrant women by disseminating information on their rights in different 
</p>
<p>languages.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Persistent gaps and emerging challenges 
</b></p>
<p>61. Despite those highly progressive achievements, Iceland continues to face persistent 
</p>
<p>gaps, which are unresolved in two main areas: discrimination in the labour market and 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence. In both those areas, implementation of laws is lacking and it is 
</p>
<p>reported that women do not have sufficient trust in the system to seek redress for violations 
</p>
<p>of their rights.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Persistent gaps and emerging challenges 
</b></p>
<p>62. Despite the long-term achievements of Iceland in gender equality legislation and its 
</p>
<p>efforts to protect the most disadvantaged groups of society, including women, in the 
</p>
<p>aftermath of the financial crisis, discrimination against women remains in practice.  
</p>
<p>63. Annual salaries of women remain, on average, one third lower than those of men. 
</p>
<p>The wage gap is due to a variety of reasons, including: the gender-based hourly wage gap; 
</p>
<p>the sex-segregated job market with women predominately in lower paid sectors, such as 
</p>
<p>teaching and providing care; the low proportion of women in corporate leadership </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>positions; and the lack of any substantial reversal in traditional domestic gender roles, with 
</p>
<p>men continuing to be less likely to take paternity leave, despite the existence of progressive 
</p>
<p>legislation.28  
</p>
<p>64. In addition, studies29 commissioned by the Government have assessed that, although 
</p>
<p>after the crisis in 2010, female unemployment (6.7 per cent) was lower than that of male 
</p>
<p>unemployment (8.3 per cent), female unemployment would last longer due to the emphasis 
</p>
<p>of job-development plans proposed by the Government on traditionally male jobs in the 
</p>
<p>manufacturing and construction industries. Other studies have also found that the 
</p>
<p>proportion of women in low-wage jobs had grown more quickly than that of men between 
</p>
<p>2008 and 2010 and that the number of retired women on pension payments below the level 
</p>
<p>of the minimum wage had further increased.30 
</p>
<p>65. Despite the fact that an act on equal pay for equal work has been in force since 1961 
</p>
<p>and measures have been undertaken to close the pay gap, including through the imposition 
</p>
<p>of a compulsory submission of equal pay plans on companies with 50 employees and 
</p>
<p>above, a gender pay gap still persists of approximately 10&#8211;20 per cent, including in the 
</p>
<p>public sector. It is clear that the formal right to equality in pay is not enough and 
</p>
<p>enforcement mechanisms are necessary. In this respect, the Working Group notes that very 
</p>
<p>few gender pay-gap cases were brought to courts.31  
</p>
<p><b> B. Gender-based violence as the missing link to full equality  
</b></p>
<p>66. The Working Group is concerned that there is a high level of gender-based violence 
</p>
<p>in Icelandic society. The Working Group&#8217;s attention was drawn to the results of 
</p>
<p>comprehensive research32 carried out from 2008 to 2010 at the request of the Minister of 
</p>
<p>Welfare, which revealed that 42 per cent of the women surveyed had been since the age of 
</p>
<p>16 subject to violence at some point. Approximately 30 per cent reported having suffered 
</p>
<p>physical violence, 24 per cent reported sexual abuse and 13 per cent reported rape or 
</p>
<p>attempted rape. Reports commissioned by the Government33 at the peak of the crisis also 
</p>
<p>highlighted an increase in gender-based violence and an increasing number of women 
</p>
<p>seeking assistance from women&#8217;s shelters. 
</p>
<p>67. The Working Group notes that, in 2007, some positive reforms took place in the area 
</p>
<p>of sexual and gender-based violence, through Act No. 61/2007, which repealed a clause of 
</p>
<p>the Penal Code allowing a rapist to be exempted from punishment if he married the victim. 
</p>
<p>One of the amendments introduced was the broadening of the definition of rape, which now 
</p>
<p>includes, in addition to the use of physical violence, other forms of sexual coercion and 
</p>
<p>exploitation of the victim&#8217;s poor mental condition or inability to resist the action or to 
</p>
<p>realize its significance.34 Under the amendment, the offence of rape carries a far heavier 
</p>
<p>punishment than before, with a prison sentence of between 1 and 16 years, instead of a

</b></p>
<p>maximum of 6 years. Furthermore, aggravating circumstances leading to the imposition of 
</p>
<p>increased severity have been defined in the law.35 
</p>
<p>68. The Working Group acknowledges the introduction in 2011 of the system of 
</p>
<p>protective orders through Law No. 85/2011, which authorizes the removal of the party 
</p>
<p>accused of domestic violence from the household and puts in place restraining orders in 
</p>
<p>cases of suspected domestic violence. It heard criticism that the legislation was not proving 
</p>
<p>effective. No protective order had yet been issued in the two years since its enactment. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the very short duration of the orders (48 hours) renders them ineffective in 
</p>
<p>protecting the victim.  
</p>
<p>69. The Working Group appreciates the multifaceted initiative launched in 2010 by the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of the Interior to address the treatment of issues of sexual violence in the criminal 
</p>
<p>justice system and the extensive consultations with police, child protection specialists, 
</p>
<p>lawyers and academic researchers recommending, inter alia, increased emphasis on 
</p>
<p>violence prevention.  
</p>
<p>70. The Working Group notes that there is a clear need to make efforts to increase the 
</p>
<p>gender sensitivity of the judiciary, as emphasized by representatives of the Ministry of the 
</p>
<p>Interior during the Group&#8217;s visit. The Group also observes that women are severely 
</p>
<p>underrepresented in the judiciary. Only 2 out of 12 Supreme Court justices and 14 out of 38 
</p>
<p>District Court judges are women, while there are more female than male law graduates.36  
</p>
<p>71. The Working Group received information regarding a recent Supreme Court case in 
</p>
<p>Iceland which raises concern. While the perpetrators in that case were charged with sexual 
</p>
<p>assault, four of the five Supreme Court justices ruled that the facts of the case did not meet 
</p>
<p>the criteria for a charge of sexual assault, as the assailants&#8217; intent was not the achievement 
</p>
<p>of sexual gratification, but rather &#8220;only&#8221; to physically hurt the victim. The Group was also 
</p>
<p>informed of cases in which rape charges were dismissed because the prosecution decided 
</p>
<p>that the injuries could have been sustained during &#8220;rough sex&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>72. The Working Group is concerned that the current wording of the Penal Code, which 
</p>
<p>states that a person that uses violence, threats or other unlawful coercion or exploits the 
</p>
<p>victim&#8217;s poor mental condition or inability to resist the action or to realize its significance 
</p>
<p>shall be guilty of rape, provides too narrow a definition of rape.37 The Group is of the view 
</p>
<p>that the current definition, which does not regard lack of consent as the defining element of 
</p>
<p>rape, does not provide legal protection for a victim who &#8220;freezes&#8221; (responding to the attack 
</p>
<p>with tonic immobility, also known as rape-induced paralysis) or for victims of fraud, undue 
</p>
<p>influence, or other non-physical but coercive tactics.  
</p>
<p>73. The Working Group emphasizes that both the European Court of Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women have rejected 
</p>
<p>definitions of rape which require evidence of violence or physical coercion. The former has 
</p>
<p>found that Bulgaria had violated its positive obligations under the European Convention on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights primarily because the judicial authorities of Bulgaria had taken physical 
</p>
<p>resistance rather than lack of consent as the central defining element of rape.38  
</p>
<p>74. In the case of <i>Karen Tayag Vertido </i>v.<i> The Philippines</i>, the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Discrimination against Women focused on dismantling the gender-based 
</p>
<p>assumptions that require physical resistance by the victim, stressed that &#8220;there should be no 
</p>
<p>assumption in law or in practice that a woman gives her consent because she has not

</p>
<p>physically resisted the unwanted sexual conduct, regardless of whether the perpetrator 
</p>
<p>threatened to use or used physical violence&#8221; (para. 8.5) and recommended that the 
</p>
<p>Philippines review its definition of rape in the legislation so as to place the lack of consent 
</p>
<p>at its centre (para. 8.9).  
</p>
<p>75. Additionally, recommendation Rec (2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers of the 
</p>
<p>Council of Europe on the protection of women against violence proposes that member 
</p>
<p>States &#8220;penalise any sexual act committed against non-consenting persons, even if they do 
</p>
<p>not show signs of resistance&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>76. The Working Group is concerned that domestic violence is only indirectly covered 
</p>
<p>under various articles in the Penal Code and there is no specific and separate definition and 
</p>
<p>prohibition, to deal with the special characteristics of this offence, as required by the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women&#8217;s general recommendation 
</p>
<p>No. 19 (1992) on violence against women. The Group is also concerned at the insufficient 
</p>
<p>numbers of emergency shelters, with only one shelter each in Reykjav&#237;k and Akureyri. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Group received information that, in cases where women had killed their 
</p>
<p>husbands in response to severe domestic violence, those circumstances had not been given 
</p>
<p>any weight in the trial or in mitigation of the punishment.  
</p>
<p>77. The Working Group is concerned at the low rates of reporting gender-based violence 
</p>
<p>to the police, of prosecutions by the police or of convictions. In relation to rape, 46 cases of 
</p>
<p>rape were reported to the Office of the Prosecutor in 2008, out of which 14 cases were 
</p>
<p>brought to trial (30 per cent); seven cases led to convictions in district courts (15 per cent); 
</p>
<p>and seven cases were referred to the Supreme Court on appeal, of which three cases led to 
</p>
<p>acquittals.39  
</p>
<p>78. In that regard, the Working Group recalls the 2008 concluding observations to 
</p>
<p>Iceland of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women regarding 
</p>
<p>the significant disparity between the numbers of investigated cases of sexual offences and 
</p>
<p>the numbers of prosecutions and convictions. The Committee was alarmed that that issue 
</p>
<p>had not been fully addressed and corrected five years after the Committee&#8217;s earlier 
</p>
<p>recommendation on the issue.40 Furthermore, although national police statistics from 2011 
</p>
<p>show an increase in reporting figures, with 128 reports of rape, there seems to be a decrease 
</p>
<p>in the percentage of cases prosecuted and convicted: 22 cases went to trial (17 per cent) and 
</p>
<p>eight resulted in convictions (6 per cent) (three were still pending in the Supreme Court at 
</p>
<p>the time of the visit). 
</p>
<p>79. The Working Group met with women who expressed their loss of trust in the 
</p>
<p>criminal justice system. Icelandic activists argue that the low conviction rates are a result of 
</p>
<p>the burden of proof in rape cases, which discourages victims from reporting acts of rape 
</p>
<p>and authorities from prosecuting them. Furthermore, the Group is concerned at the leniency 
</p>
<p>of convictions. Despite the maximum penalty for rape being 16 years of imprisonment, it 
</p>
<p>was reported that, to date, the maximum sentence handed down has been five years for a 
</p>
<p>single offence and eight years for multiple counts of rape.  
</p>
<p>80. More specifically, the Working Group is concerned at the high number of dismissals 
</p>
<p>of charges by the national prosecutor. Decisions to prosecute are allegedly made by two 
</p>
<p>staff members who work for the national prosecutor, under article 145 of Law No.&#176;88/2008 
</p>
<p>on Criminal Procedure, which states that the national prosecutor shall not prosecute a case 
</p>
<p>which is not likely to result in a conviction.41 It was reported to the Group that only one in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 39 Jafnr&#233;ttisstofa, <i>Gender Equality in Iceland</i> , p. 25. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>three people who bring rape charges are brought before a judge. Furthermore, the Group 
</p>
<p>received information that such cases progressed very slowly in contravention of the official 
</p>
<p>regulations42 and victims who pressed charges were not kept abreast of the process. Some 
</p>
<p>cases which had attracted media attention were reported to the Group, in which suspected 
</p>
<p>rapists, who had been charged with rape and serious assault, had not been detained during 
</p>
<p>trial. In one such case, an alleged perpetrator with a prior conviction was released, enabling 
</p>
<p>him to commit additional acts of gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>81. In addition, the Working Group was informed that the sex crime unit of the police 
</p>
<p>which had formerly been comprised of five or six investigators had been dismantled in 
</p>
<p>2010 due to funding cuts as a result of the economic crisis. That unit was absorbed into a 
</p>
<p>unit that dealt, inter alia, with crimes such as murder and serious bodily harm. That was 
</p>
<p>perceived as a significant setback by representatives of many organizations working in the 
</p>
<p>field of sexual violence with whom the Working Group met. They feared that rape and 
</p>
<p>other forms of gender-based violence were likely to be neglected by the sex crime unit 
</p>
<p>when merely included in amongst other serious offences.  
</p>
<p>82. The Working Group was informed that rape crisis clinics, which provide 
</p>
<p>professional assistance and treatment to victims, have been progressively downsized since 
</p>
<p>2005 and that, since the posts of social workers and specialized nurses in those clinics had 
</p>
<p>been abolished, nurses who work in the emergency rooms of general hospitals assist rape 
</p>
<p>victims. In addition, it was reported that there were no standardized measuring tools for 
</p>
<p>psychological assessment of rape victims and psychologists used different standards for 
</p>
<p>measuring post-traumatic stress disorder, which could create different results making 
</p>
<p>judges hesitant to give weight to the assessments.  
</p>
<p>83. The Working Group is alarmed at reports of the growing numbers of boys, 
</p>
<p>sometimes as young as 13 years old, who watch violent pornographic images, which results 
</p>
<p>in a distorted perception of relationships between boys and girls. However, the Group 
</p>
<p>acknowledges the Government&#8217;s efforts to attempt to limit online access to pornography, 
</p>
<p>including a ban on print and online pornography. It also welcomes preventative measures, 
</p>
<p>including well-designed and creative educational programmes for children and teenagers, 
</p>
<p>which have been introduced in schools across Iceland.43 
</p>
<p><b> C. Insufficient collection of sex-disaggregated data 
</b></p>
<p>84. While the Gender Equality Act lists, as a means to establish and maintain equal 
</p>
<p>status and opportunities for men and women, the analysis of statistics according to gender 
</p>
<p>(art. 1), the Working Group has received information from various stakeholders regarding 
</p>
<p>the collection of sex-disaggregated data which has been reported as inconsistent and partial, 
</p>
<p>particularly in the area of violence against women. The Group notes that there is a need for 
</p>
<p>improvement in the availability and accessibility of statistics.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 42 A 60-day maximum for the police and 30-day maximum for the national prosecutor (available from 
</p>
<p>www.althingi.is/lagas/143a/2008088.html). 
</p>
<p> 43 For example, the puppet show <i>Krakkarnir &#237; hverfinu</i> (meaning &#8220;The kids in the neighbourhood&#8221;) is 
shown to all 9 year-olds in schools in Iceland, and the educational short film <i>F&#225;&#240;u j&#225;!</i> (&#8220;Get 
consent!&#8221;) is shown to 13&#8211;15 year old schoolchildren. The latter film emphasizes the importance of 
always obtaining consent from a partner before having sexual relations as well as addressing 
</p>
<p>pornography, self-image and setting boundaries in intimate relationships. </p>

</p>
<p><b> D. Women of foreign origin 
</b></p>
<p>85. Immigrants represented 8.3 per cent of the total population in 2009 and reached 
</p>
<p>approximately 16 per cent (of which 8.4 per cent were female) in 2013, confirming that 
</p>
<p>Iceland is undergoing an unprecedented demographic change, with a steady increase of 
</p>
<p>persons of foreign origin, including immigrants, migrant workers and their families, 
</p>
<p>refugees and asylum seekers. The Working Group takes note of a report44 released by 
</p>
<p>InterCultural Iceland in May 2013, which found that approximately 40 per cent of Icelandic 
</p>
<p>residents of foreign background felt discriminated against, on an almost daily basis, 
</p>
<p>particularly in the workplace.  
</p>
<p>86. While there is no evidence of discriminatory attitudes in the political discourse, 
</p>
<p>several representatives of non-governmental organizations stated that the lack of policies to 
</p>
<p>address the particular challenges that immigrant women face has resulted in de facto 
</p>
<p>discrimination against them. Reports indicated that women of foreign origin represented 
</p>
<p>31 per cent of all women seeking assistance and information at the women&#8217;s shelters and 
</p>
<p>52 per cent of those who stayed at the shelter for long or short periods of time.  
</p>
<p>87. The Working Group notes the measures which have been taken to address the risk of 
</p>
<p>immigrant victims of domestic violence adhering to abusive relationships in order to avoid 
</p>
<p>deportation, such as the amendment to the Act on Foreign Nationals (art. 5 (b)). This allows 
</p>
<p>individuals from countries outside the European economic area to retain their residence 
</p>
<p>permits upon divorce from Icelandic-born spouses, in circumstances where abuse or 
</p>
<p>violence has been perpetrated on the foreign spouse or the spouse&#8217;s child, as well as making 
</p>
<p>women aware of those changes.  
</p>
<p>88. Despite those efforts, the Working Group received information that women of 
</p>
<p>foreign origin are largely unaware of the above-mentioned changes and that additional 
</p>
<p>outreach should be undertaken to ensure that those victims of domestic violence are not 
</p>
<p>forced to stay in violent relationships to avoid deportation. The media were reported to have 
</p>
<p>been inactive in informing the public on immigrant issues, including the situation of 
</p>
<p>immigrant women in Iceland. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Single women and retired women 
</b></p>
<p>89. In Iceland, women account for 91 per cent of all single parents and 77 per cent of 
</p>
<p>those single parents suffer severe economic difficulties.45 Prior to the crisis, the difficulties 
</p>
<p>single mothers were facing in making a living and repaying debts had already been well 
</p>
<p>documented. It was estimated that a third of single mothers were at risk of poverty, working 
</p>
<p>more hours per week than other women and often working away from home.46 The 2011 
</p>
<p>report by Welfare Watch, which assessed the impact of the crisis on the welfare of 
</p>
<p>Icelandic women and focused on the economic status of women, noted that the financial 
</p>
<p>situation of single women and single mothers had deteriorated. 
</p>
<p>90. Wages and pension funds were badly hit during the financial crisis in 2008. 
</p>
<p>According to research, the proportion of women in low-wage jobs grew more quickly than 
</p>
<p>that of men during that period, as a result of the economic crisis. The number of retired 
</p>
<p>women receiving pension payments below the minimum wage level increased.47 The vast

</b></p>
<p>majority of people in retirement age received old age pensions from Social Security. That 
</p>
<p>category represented respectively 83 per cent of the female and 72 per cent of the male 
</p>
<p>retirement age populations48
 
(2009). Additionally, men accounted for approximately 40 per 
</p>
<p>cent and women almost 60 per cent of those who also received old-age pension 
</p>
<p>supplements provided to those below a certain level of minimum income.49 In the wake of 
</p>
<p>the financial crisis, the occupational pension funds generally had cut pension payments by 
</p>
<p>approximately 10 per cent in 2009 and again by 10 per cent in 2010.50 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political commitment to understand the role of gender in the crisis 
</b></p>
<p>91. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, gender equality principles have been 
</p>
<p>emphasized in initiatives undertaken to restore the economy. Multiple studies (e.g. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Women in the time of crisis&#8221; and &#8220;Nation-centric masculinity ideals and the Icelandic 
</p>
<p>bank collapse&#8221;) were commissioned by the Government in 2008&#8211;2009, with the broad aims 
</p>
<p>of assessing the impact of the crisis on the welfare of women and understanding the role 
</p>
<p>women could play in the process of economic recovery. In addition, the appointment of the 
</p>
<p>Special Investigation Commission of the Althingi to discover the causes, including gender 
</p>
<p>analysis, of the downfall of the Icelandic banks and related events is commendable.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Integration of gender equality in foreign policy 
</b></p>
<p>92. Promoting gender equality is a specific objective of the parliamentary resolution on 
</p>
<p>the Strategy for Iceland&#8217;s International Development Cooperation (2013&#8211;2016). The 
</p>
<p>Strategy underlines the importance of equal opportunities for women and men, so that they 
</p>
<p>may participate in and enjoy the benefits of projects supported by Iceland.  
</p>
<p>93. Gender equality is also an important aspect of the international work of Iceland on 
</p>
<p>human rights.51 In recent years, increased emphasis has been placed on human rights in the 
</p>
<p>foreign policy of Iceland.52 Special attention is dedicated to women&#8217;s empowerment and 
</p>
<p>their participation in peace negotiation and post-war reconstruction. In that regard, the 
</p>
<p>active support of Iceland to the Arms Trade Treaty53 is worth highlighting. The Treaty 
</p>
<p>recognizes gender-based violence and prohibits arms sales where there is a risk that 
</p>
<p>weapons could be used to violate international humanitarian or human rights law. Iceland is 
</p>
<p>the first country to have ratified the treaty.

</b></p>
<p>94. The Working Group commends the initiative launched in 2011 to encourage the 
</p>
<p>elimination of the gender pay-gap. This was achieved through the development of a tool for 
</p>
<p>monitoring payment of equal wages and the certification process (certified ISO

<p>agencies. Certification is being granted to companies which demonstrate that their wage 
</p>
<p>policy and human resources are non-discriminatory towards men and women.  
</p>
<p>95. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Security (now the Ministry of Welfare), 
</p>
<p>together with the Confederation of Trade Unions in Iceland and the Confederation of 
</p>
<p>Icelandic Employers, cooperated with Icelandic Standards to produce an equal pay 
</p>
<p>standard, with the aim of ensuring that women and men, working for the same employer, 
</p>
<p>are paid equal wages and enjoy equal terms of employment for the same jobs and jobs of 
</p>
<p>equal value. The standard was published in December 2012 and is considered a pioneering 
</p>
<p>step in the sphere of gender equality. Modelled on the international standards ISO-9000 and 
</p>
<p>ISO-14000, the Icelandic standard bears the number IST 85:2012.  
</p>
<p>96. Adoption of the equal pay standard is optional for companies and institutions; 
</p>
<p>however, those companies that wish to receive certification under the standard are required 
</p>
<p>to follow a formal procedure from an accreditation authority stating that they operate in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the requirements set in the standard. A special consultative team consisting 
</p>
<p>of representatives of the Government and the accreditation department of the Patent Office 
</p>
<p>have prepared a draft regulation on the qualification requirements demanded of certification 
</p>
<p>authorities and the procedures which should be followed in carrying out certification under 
</p>
<p>the standard. The regulation, specifying the professional demands to be met by certification 
</p>
<p>agencies in order to award certificates on the basis of the standard, is due to be published 
</p>
<p>soon. 
</p>
<p>97. The Working Group was particularly impressed by the initiative of the VA trade 
</p>
<p>union to reduce the gender pay-gap, as demonstrated by the 40 applications already 
</p>
<p>received and the deliverance of four certifications at the time of the visit of the Group. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Gender equality as a pillar of the education core syllabus 
</b></p>
<p>98. The Centre for Gender Equality has worked with the Ministry of Education and the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Welfare to increase those ministries&#8217; focus on gender equality issues in the 
</p>
<p>context of the core syllabus for school education. The Ministry of Education has recently 
</p>
<p>added &#8220;gender equality&#8221; to the main curriculum and in 2010 published a textbook 
</p>
<p>(<i>Kynungab&#243;k</i>), offering guidance to teachers on the mandatory teaching of gender equality 
</p>
<p>issues. The objectives of the textbook, designed for students in middle and secondary 
</p>
<p>school are to provide, inter alia, a realistic picture of the status of women and men in 
</p>
<p>Icelandic society; demonstrate that gender stereotypes are damaging for everyone; help 
</p>
<p>children critically analyse cultural gender constructs; and, importantly, raise awareness on 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>For some time, Iceland has been considered a world leader on gender equality 
</b></p>
<p>and women&#8217;s rights. <b>It also took appropriate measures to ensure that the effects of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>financial and economic crisis did not result in undermining past achievements. 
</b></p>
<p><b>However, serious gaps still persist despite the clear evidence of political will, high 
</b></p>
<p>levels of women&#8217;s participation in government and parliament, <b>legislation to prohibit </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, a progressive system of gender-balanced parental leave and childcare, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and a gender equality component of the core syllabus for schools. Access to justice for 
</b></p>
<p><b>women victims of domestic violence and gender-based violence is alarmingly low and 
</b></p>
<p><b>there are significant problems in legal definition, effective prevention, prosecution, 
</b></p>
<p><b>conviction and punishment for sexual violence; protection orders to remove 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrators of domestic violence from the home are ineffective, and there is a lack of 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity-building for law enforcement agents, including the police, prosecutors and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the judiciary. Although they outnumber men as university graduates, women still lag 
behind men in the economic arena, facing a segregated labour market, a persistent 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender pay-gap and low representation in the judiciary.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Working Group wishes to make the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Working Group recommends that the Government take measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>increase its institutional capacity to implement legislative and policy commitments to 
</b></p>
<p><b>eliminate de facto sex discrimination and violence against women: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Further institutionalize and expand gender budgeting and other gender-
</b></p>
<p><b>sensitive economic policies, so as to make them a systemic part of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>policymaking process throughout and after the process of economic 
</b></p>
<p><b>reconstruction; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Take necessary steps to establish a national human rights institution, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance with the Paris Principles and with a broad mandate to promote and 
</b></p>
<p><b>protect human rights, including a specific mandate to promote and protect 
</b></p>
<p>women&#8217;s human rights;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Significantly increase the capacity and resources of the Centre for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Gender Equality and improve its geographical location and accessibility; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Improve the collection of sex-disaggregated statistics; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) In relation to violence against women, the Working Group recommends 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the Government improve guarantees for access to justice for all victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender-based violence and specifically: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Introduce domestic violence legislation to improve the mechanisms for 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevention, punishment and protection in relation to domestic violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>increase the effectiveness of protection orders, including by immediate 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of restraining orders and lengthening the duration of 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection orders; and also provide additional shelters accessible to all women 
</b></p>
<p><b>who experience violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Base the definition of rape on lack of consent by the victim so that proof 
</b></p>
<p><b>of physical violence by the perpetrator or physical resistance or mental 
</b></p>
<p><b>incapacity of the victim are not required elements of the crime; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violence against Women and Domestic Violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Undertake awareness-raising and educational campaigns to deter 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence against women, aimed at both women and men, with particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention to the increased use of social media as a platform to disseminate 
</b></p>
<p><b>pornography, sexist hate speech, and continue to integrate training on non-
</b></p>
<p><b>violence, including sexual violence, in materials in the core gender syllabus;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Establish a standard methodology tool to assess post-traumatic stress 
</b></p>
<p><b>disorder, as well as a Special Prosecutor for sexual violence, introduce the right </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>to appeal against </b>a prosecutor&#8217;s decision not to prosecute; and reinstate rape 
</p>
<p><b>clinics as specialized units in hospitals; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vi) Intensify measures to raise awareness and train judges, prosecutors, 
</b></p>
<p><b>police and health officers on gender-based violence, including domestic 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vii) Develop awareness-raising campaigns targeted at Icelandic women and 
</b></p>
<p><b>those of foreign origin on their rights to protection against gender-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence and available remedies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(viii) Step up efforts to implement both the law on prostitution and the ban on 
</b></p>
<p><b>strip clubs and provide adequate resources for law enforcement agencies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including through the establishment of trained police teams specialized in those 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues and taking measures banning prostitution; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) </b>In relation to women&#8217;s economic empowerment, the Working Group 
</p>
<p><b>recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Improve efforts to reduce the sex segregation of the labour market by 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensuring that, through education, training and workplace ethos and 
</b></p>
<p><b>organization, a whole spectrum of jobs is open to both women and men; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Close the gender pay-gap, by improving access to the courts to combat 
</b></p>
<p><b>wage discrimination and enforce equal pay for equal work of equal value; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) S</b>ynchronize children&#8217;s school hours and holidays with the general 
</p>
<p><b>working hours of adults; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Increase investment in job creation and social security, especially for 
</b></p>
<p><b>single heads of households, the majority of whom are women, and for women of 
</b></p>
<p><b>foreign origin; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) In relation to women of foreign origin, the Working Group recommends 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the Government adopt special measures, such as: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Provide additional support for organizations which enable persons of 
</b></p>
<p><b>foreign origin, particularly women, to participate fully in economic, social, 
</b></p>
<p><b>public and political life; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Devote special attention to researching the needs of women of foreign 
</b></p>
<p><b>origin, increasing efforts to disseminate information on the rights of immigrant 
</b></p>
<p><b>women including through increased use of the media, existing legal mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>protecting women against gender-based violence and free government services 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessible in all relevant languages throughout the country, in addition to 
</b></p>
<p><b>providing them with opportunities to learn the Icelandic language; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The Working Group recommends that the Government ratify the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Convention on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights.</b>
