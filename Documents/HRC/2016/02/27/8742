<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present addendum to the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
education contains, on a country-by-country basis, summaries of general and individual 
letters of allegations and urgent appeals transmitted to Governments between 16 March 
2009 and 15 March 2010, as well as replies received between 1 May 2009 and 30 April 
</p><p>2010. Observations made by the Special Rapporteur have also been included where 
applicable. Letter of allegations and urgent appeals sent after 15 March 2010 as well as 
Government replies received after 30 April 2010 will be included in the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s next communications report. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur receives information alleging violations of the right to 
education and related rights from national, regional and international non-governmental 
organizations, as well as intergovernmental organizations. The Special Rapporteur responds 
to information received and considered to be reliable on alleged violations of the right to 
education, by writing to the Government and others actors concerned, either together with 
other special procedure mandates or independently, inviting comment on the allegation, 
seeking clarification, reminding them of their obligations under international law in relation 
to the right to education and requesting information, where relevant, on steps being taken 
by the authorities to redress the situation in question. The Special Rapporteur urges all 
Governments and other actors to respond promptly to his communications and, in 
appropriate cases, to take all steps necessary to redress situations involving the violation of 
the right to education. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur recalls that in transmitting allegations and urgent appeals, he 
does not make any judgement concerning the merits of the cases, nor does he support the 
opinion of the persons on behalf of whom he intervenes. The Special Rapporteur draws 
attention to the fact that the issues reflected in this addendum are not representative of the 
wide range of issues encompassed by the right to education. 
</p>
<p>4. Owing to restrictions on the length of documents, the Special Rapporteur has 
reduced when necessary the details of communications sent and received. To the extent that 
his limited resources permit, the Special Rapporteur continues to follow up on 
communications sent and to monitor the situation where no reply has been received or 
where questions remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p>5. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur transmitted 12 
communications to the Governments of 12 countries: Bulgaria, China (People&#8217;s Republic 
of), France, Honduras, India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Italy, Paraguay, Slovakia, Sudan, 
Thailand and United States of America.  
</p>
<p>6. Eleven responses to these communications were received and one reply to a 
communication transmitted by the Special Rapporteur in the previous year. The Special 
Rapporteur regrets that some Governments failed to respond and thanks those which took 
the time and made the effort to provide replies, which are reflected in the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Communications sent and replies from Governments 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Bulgaria 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>7. On 10 June 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication concerning children 
with moderate, severe or profound disabilities who are living in &#8220;Homes for Mentally </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>Disabled Children&#8221; (HMDC) and who allegedly were receiving no effective education on 
account of their disabilities.  
</p>
<p>8. According to the information received, Children living in &#8220;Homes for Mentally 
Disabled Children&#8221; (HMDC) were receiving no education on account of their disabilities. 
According to reports, a very limited number of the children living in HMDC had been 
enrolled in schools. Furthermore, it was alleged that mainstream schools are not adapted to 
accommodate the abilities and needs of children from HMDC. Also, it was reported that 
staff of HMDC provide no or wholly inadequate education for the resident children.  It was 
further alleged that the current educational system in Bulgaria denied the right to education 
for these children and that this denial is discriminatory. Reports indicated that the problem 
cannot be seen as due to a lack of resources or as an early step in the progressive realization 
of rights but it reflected instead the discriminatory denial of the right to education, as the 
situation is a result of policy failures which could be addressed effectively by the 
Government.  
</p>
<p>9. The source mentioned a complaint presented before the European Committee of 
Social Rights (&#8220;the Committee&#8221;) and declared admissible on 26 June 2007. The Committee 
issued its decision on the merits on 10 June 2008 (Mental Disability Advocacy Centre v. 
Bulgaria, Complaint 41/2007).  The decision of the European Committee of Social Rights 
(the Committee), made public on 11 October 2008, found that the Bulgarian government 
deprived institutionalised children with mental disabilities of their right to education and 
this was due to disability discrimination. The Committee reportedly found that there was a 
violation of Article 17(2) (right to education) alone and in conjunction with Article E (non-
discrimination) of the Revised European Social Charter because children with moderate, 
severe and profound intellectual disabilities residing in &#8220;Homes for Mentally Disabled 
Children&#8221; do not have an effective right to education and this is due to disability-based 
discrimination. Although it was recognized the Bulgarian government&#8217;s efforts to respect 
the educational rights of children with disabilities living in institutions through adopting 
legislation and drafting action plans, the Committee highlighted deficient implementation 
of legislation and policies, and noted that there were inadequate standards for the right to 
education and equality of educational opportunities.   
</p>
<p>10. In its decision, the Committee of Social Rights also referred to the educational 
standards established by the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, which considered that education must fulfill the criteria of availability, accessibility, 
acceptability and adaptability. In light of these criteria, the Committee found that the 
Bulgarian educational standards were inadequate because mainstream educational 
institutions and curricula were not accessible in practice: only 2.8% of children with 
intellectual disabilities residing in institutions were integrated in mainstream primary 
schools, whereas integration should be the norm. The Committee also reported that only 
3.4% of the children attended special classes, and concluded that special education was not 
accessible to children living in HMDC. Furthermore, mainstream schools were not adapted 
to the needs of children with intellectual disabilities, teachers were not appropriately 
trained, and resources were not developed to cater to the educational needs of children with 
disabilities. Due to the absence of primary educational opportunities, children with 
disabilities were ineligible to enter secondary education  
</p>
<p>11. It was reported that in its decision, the Committee argued that the burden was on the 
Government to refute the allegations presented in the complaint.  As the Government 
allegedly provided neither evidence nor justification for why children living in the HMDC  
were disproportionately denied their right to education, compared with children attending 
mainstream schools, it concluded that the disparity between the two groups was so great 
that it constituted discrimination against children with disabilities.    </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>12. It was further reported that on 23 January 2009, a new regulation, Regulation &#8470; 1 
for the Education of Children and Pupils with Special Educational Needs and/or Chronic 
Diseases, was adopted by the Minister of Education. According to the Regulation, children 
living in institutions for children with intellectual disabilities are only permitted to study in 
special schools, while those with profound disabilities are excluded from the education 
system altogether.  It is alleged that these newly enacted provisions not only violate the 
Public Education Act which provides for mandatory and free education for all children up 
to the age of 16, but also depart from the decision of the European Committee of Social 
Rights. 
</p>
<p>13. It was finally alleged that the Regulation did not achieve its initial aim of adopting 
state educational requirements for the academic achievements of children with intellectual 
disabilities &#8211; a gap that could leave these children functionally illiterate. Also the 
Regulation establishes a clear division between children with sensory disabilities and 
children with intellectual disabilities:  while legal provisions for the first group are 
enumerated with respect to the provision of a supportive environment, resources needed to 
ensure inclusive education, development of the talents of these children in school, and 
ensuring their vocational training in different fields, children with intellectual disabilities 
are excluded from those chapters. It was noted that the European Committee of Social 
Rights explicitly stated that Bulgarian schools are not suited to meet the needs of children 
with intellectual disabilities particularly because teaching materials are inadequate. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>14. By letter dated 14 December 2009, the Government informed that on 3 June 2008 
the European Committee of Social Rights with the Council of Europe (ESCR) prepared a 
report containing a Decision on the Merits on Collective Complaint N&#176;41, according to the 
Additional Protocol to the European Social Charter (ESC) of 1995 Providing for a System 
of Collective Complaints. The Decision points out that Bulgaria has violated Article 17&#167;2 
separately and in conjunction with Article E of the ESC because children with moderate, 
severe or profound intellectual disabilities residing in homes for mentally disabled children 
do not have an effective right to education, as well as that there is discrimination against 
children with moderate, severe or profound intellectual disabilities residing in such homes 
as a result of the low number of such children receiving any type of education when 
compared to other children. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>15. According to Article 8&#167;1 and &#167;2 of the Protocol, the Committee of Independent 
Experts &#8220;shall draw up a report in which it shall describe the steps taken by it to examine 
the complaint and present its conclusions as to whether or not the Contracting Party 
concerned has ensured the satisfactory application of the provision of the Charter referred 
to in the a complaint. The report shall be transmitted the report containing its Decision to 
the Committee of Ministers. According to Article 9&#167;1 of the Protocol, &#8220;&#8230;on the basis of 
the report of the Committee on Independent Experts, the Committee of Ministers shall 
adopt a resolution by a majority of those voting. If the Committee of Independent Experts 
finds that the Charter has not been applied in a satisfactory manner, the Committee of 
Ministers shall adopt, by a majority of two-thirds of those voting, a recommendation 
addressed to the Contacting Party concerned.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>16. The Government notes that at this point of time, the matter figures on the agenda of 
the Committee of Ministers, but the said Committee has not adopted a recommendation or a 
resolution in connection with it. This means that, albeit formally, the procedure on the 
matter is not completed. Both the ESC and the Additional Protocol to it contain identical 
provisions stating that both treaties legal obligations of an international character, the 
application of which is submitted solely to the supervision provided for&#8221; by themselves. We 
therefore believe that it is inadmissible for another body, all the more so outside the system </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>of the Council of Europe, to exercise control over the application of the ESC, and moreover 
while a procedure is pending before a control authority under that international treaty which 
is vested with exclusive powers under it and which was expressly created for this purpose. 
Despite this argument, the Government informs of the steps and practical measures taken 
by the Government of the Republic of Bulgarian further to the Decision of European 
Committee of Social Rights on Collective Complaint N&#176; 41/2007 of the Mental Disability 
Advocacy Center (Hungary) v. Bulgaria.  
</p>
<p>17. The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, the Ministry of Education and the State 
Agency for Child Protection, in their capacity as institutions vested with competences on 
the 41 findings raided in the collective complaint, examined closely the Decision on the 
Merits of the European Committee of Social Rights. To this end, a special interagency 
working group was formed and it analyzed the assessment and the conclusions of the 
Committee, with a view to taking the actions necessary to address the statements contained 
in the above mentioned Decision.  
</p>
<p>18. The Government is making concerted efforts for the consistent and purposeful 
implementation of the policy intended to ensure appropriate conditions for the schooling of 
mentally retarded children, for development of their potential with a view to their further 
successful social inclusion and integration into society, regardless of whether they live in a 
family environment or are placed in a specialized child care institution.  
</p>
<p>19. The allegations of the complainant, as well as the assessment of the European 
Committee of Social Rights, are based mostly on the Annual Report of the State Agency for 
Child Protection for 2005. Which contains out-of-date statistics which are no longer 
relevant. In this connection, we would like to provide information on the development of 
the situation since the adoption of the ESCR Decision:  
</p>
<p>20. A new Ordinance N&#176; 1 of 23 January 2009 on the Tuition of Children and Pupils 
with Special Educational Needs and/or Chronic Diseases was issued. The Ordinance 
regulates the conduct of a review and assessment, on the basis of documents, of children 
and pupils with special educational needs by an expressly formed expert commission at the 
Ministry of Education. This documents guarantees precision and objectivity upon the 
assessment and referral of children and pupils with special educational needs (including 
children residing in the relevant institutions) for attendance of special kindergartens and 
schools. The Ordinance also creates prerequisites for an improved co-ordination and co-
operation among institutions and experts upon the assessment and referral of children 
which special educational needs to a particular type of tuition; 
</p>
<p>21. At present, 1,018 educational establishments (820 schools and 198 kindergartens) 
are attended by children and pupils with special educational needs, compared to 953 
schools and kindergartens in 2008: an increase of 6.8 per cent; 
</p>
<p>22. The resource centres provide the specialists necessary to assist the mainstream 
schooling of children and pupils with special educational needs: 933 resource teachers, 
psychologists, speech therapists and hearing and speech remediation personnel, compared 
to 883 in 2008: an increase of 5.6 per cent; (by comparison, 717 children and pupils were 
receiving mainstream schooling in the 2004/2005 school year, and they were assisted by 
129 resource teachers and other specialists; in 2005/2006 the children and pupils numbered 
1,538 and the resource teachers 223; in 2006/2007 there were over 4,400 children and 
pupils and 635 resource teachers and specialists).  
</p>
<p>23. Accessible built environment has been constructed at 234 schools, kindergartens and 
auxiliary units countrywide. By comparison, such environment was available at 50 schools 
in 2008. The number of schools with accessible built environment has increased by 27.2 per 
cent;  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>24. The National Pedagogical Centre has delivered training to 519 educators for work 
with children with disabilities in a general educational environment, compared to 400 in 
2008: the number of trained teachers increased by 29.8 per cent;  
</p>
<p>25. In 2006 the State Agency for Child Protection organized the process of definitive 
evaluation of the specialized child care institutions on the basis of expressly developed 
criteria for the reform, restructuring or closure of the child care homes. As a result, all 26 
specialized care homes for children with disabilities have elaborated plans for reform, 
restructuring or closure;  
</p>
<p>26. Along with the upward tendency in the number of children from specialized 
institutions for children with disabilities who receive mainstream schooling, as part of the 
overall sustained deinstitutionalization of children, the total population of care homes for 
children with disabilities has been steadily diminishing. This population was 1,039 at 31 
December 2008, 862 fewer than in 2001 or a decrease of 45.3 per cent. Compared to 2007, 
the number of children placed at specialized institutions for children with disabilities 
dropped by 76 or 6.8 per cent;  
</p>
<p>27. At 31 December 2008, of the children placed at the care homes for mentally retarded 
adolescents/care homes for mentally retarded children:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; 13 attended kindergarten outside the specialized institution; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 204 children attended school outside the care home;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; 260 attended rehabilitation school; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 51 children attended mainstream school in the settlement;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; 19 children attended mainstream school outside the settlement;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; 153 children attended day care centres for children with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>28. In addition to the information already provided, it should be noted that an 
interagency working group was formed at the end of 2008 to co-ordinate the drafting of a 
National Plan for Children with Disabilities, and the suggestions of the Bulgarian mothers 
of children with disabilities were taken into consideration. The purpose of this plan is not 
only to act on the recommendations for the European Committee of Social Rights, but also 
to continue the implementation of the Bulgarian Government&#8217;s measures for improvement 
of the living conditions of children with disabilities and their families.  
</p>
<p>29. The Government does not contest that lingering challenges are encountered in 
ensuring school education to children with mental disabilities, but cannot possibly agree 
that the children with mental disabilities residing in child care homes for mentally retarded 
children do not have an effective right to education. We believe that the situation in this 
sphere has improved substantially during those three years (since the 2005 report of the 
State Agency for Child Protection).  
</p>
<p>30. As evident from the statistics cited, the Government is working consistently and 
purposefully on the policy intended to ensure appropriate conditions for the schooling of 
mentally retarded children, for development of their potential with a view to their further 
successful social inclusion and integration into society, regardless of whether they live in a 
family environment or are placed in a specialized child care institution.  
</p>
<p>31. The Government is resolved to achieve the objectives of the Charter by showing 
tangible progress within a feasible timeframe with financing maximizing the utilization of 
available resources.  
</p>
<p>32. Regarding the allocation of financial resources for the exercise of the right to 
education of children with disabilities, the Government informs that according to &#167;68 (1) of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>the Transitional and Final Provisions of the 2009 State Budget of the Republic of Bulgaria 
Act, the State budget resources for the activities of upbringing, preparation and tuition of 
children and pupils at the state and municipal schools, kindergartens and auxiliary units 
within the public education system are allocated per first-level spending unit on the basis of 
uniform expenditure standards per child and per pupil, approved by the Council of 
Ministers. These principles of allocation of financing for the secondary education system 
will continue to operate in the coming budget years as well. In 2009, the Council of 
Ministers determined the standards by its Decision N&#176;29 of 23 January 2009 on the 
Separation of Activities Financed through the Municipal Budgets between Local Activities 
and State-Delegated Activities and on the Determination of Standards for Financing of 
State-Delegated in 2009. The general schools are allocated an equal amount of financial 
resources for all their pupils, including those with disabilities who are mainstreamed in 
these schools. Schools which mainstream children with special educational needs are 
allocated an extra 10 per cent of the resources fixed as a uniform expenditure standard per 
resource-assisted pupil.  
</p>
<p>33. For the creation of conditions for allocation of financing for the specific activities of 
assisting children with special educational needs mainstreamed in a general educational 
environment, Council of Ministers Decision N&#176; 29 of 2009 determined a uniform 
expenditure standard per resource-assisted pupil. The financial resources allocated in this 
way are provided to 28 resource centers, which employ some 1,100 educational specialists 
(resource teachers, psychologists, speech therapists) who assist the successful integration of 
children with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>34. To achieve sustainability of the financing of children with special educational needs 
who are mainstreamed in a general educational environment, the Ministry of Education, 
Youth and Science plans to propose that in 2010 the uniform expenditure standards include 
a supplement for children and pupils with special educational needs who attend mainstream 
kindergartens, general and vocation schools. This supplement will provided in addition to 
the financial resources provided to kindergartens, general and vocational schools for 
children and pupils with disabilities. At the same time, the resource centres will also 
continue to be financed according to the standards.  
</p>
<p>35. Finally, the Government would like to emphasize that the right to education is a 
fundamental principle guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria (Article 
53 (1)). Compulsory schooling up to the age of 16 has been introduced in accordance with 
this principle. The State encourages education by establishing and financing schools, 
assisting gifted pupils and students, and creating conditions for vocational training and 
preparation.  
</p>
<p>36. The policy of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Science targets ensuring 
appropriate conditions for the schooling of children and pupils with special educational 
needs, including mentally retarded children, for development of their potential with a view 
to their further successful social inclusion and integration into society, regardless of 
whether they live in a family environment or are placed in a specialized child care 
institution. At the same time, it is fair to note that part of the children residing in care 
homes for mentally retarded children to not receive adequate education. This situation, 
however, is not the result of discriminatory practices. It is due to an intricate complex of 
economic, social and other administrative existing reasons.  
</p>
<p>37. The Ministry of Education, Youth and Science consistently addressed the problems 
encountered by school education and pre-school upbringing and preparation in Bulgaria. It 
seeks to define and foreground the issues to which the public is particularly sensitive and 
whose solution is essential for school education in Bulgaria becoming modern, accessible 
and high-quality, including for mentally disabled children. Specific measures are developed 
on the basis of the identified problems, and deadlines are set for their implementation as </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>well as arrangements are made for the appropriate resource allocation and regulatory 
framework.  
</p>
<p>38. The effective Bulgarian legislation explicitly regulates the right of equal access to 
education and the obligation of kindergartens and of schools to enroll children and pupils 
with special educational needs, including children aged under 16 residing in homes for 
mentally disabled children. Special guarantees are also provided for the tuition and 
upbringing of children with disabilities (children with special educational needs), with 
chronic diseases, with deviant behaviour and of children deprived of parental care. The 
tendency is to mainstream most of the children with disabilities in the general schools 
which are attended by their peers.  
</p>
<p>39. Educational policy envisages, on the one hand, reducing the number of special 
schools and an increasing the number of mainstreamed children with special educational 
needs and, on the other, assigning new functions to those special schools which will 
continue to exist, focused on children with severe and multiple disabilities, and on 
supporting inclusive education with methods and competent specialists. The mainstreaming 
of children with special educational needs in the kindergartens and general schools requires 
a number of measures intended to create a supportive environment for their tuition, which 
includes accessible physical environment, a possibility to be tutored according to individual 
syllabi, provision of textbooks, study aids, technical devices and equipment, specialists 
qualified to work with children with disabilities in a mainstream environment etc. These are 
also the key areas of the measures which Bulgaria has taken for the purpose of 
mainstreaming children with special educational needs into a general educational 
environment.  
</p>
<p>40. Implementing the policy of comprehensive, accessible and high-quality education 
and training in the sphere of secondary education in respect of children and pupils with 
special educational needs, substantial results have been achieved, part of which were 
discussed above. In addition, we would like to emphasise the following:  
</p>
<p>41. Methodological Guidelines for the work of the 28 integrated educational assessment 
teams (one at each regional education inspectorate) were developed in 2007. The 
Guidelines regulate the methods for assessment of the educational needs of children and 
pupils and are addressed to the members of the integrated educational assessment teams, to 
the teams and all educators at kindergartens and schools at which mainstream tuition is 
provided, as well as to parents, who are a key partner to the teams in elaboration of the 
individual syllabi for children and pupils with special educational needs;  
</p>
<p>42. Textbooks by subjects, as well as Braille textbooks for visually impaired children, 
for children with special educational needs who are mainstreamed, as well as for the pupils 
in the special schools, are provided annually free of change;  
</p>
<p>43 Two electronic Braille printers have been purchased and provided to the two 
secondary schools for visually impaired children in Bulgaria: the Louis Braille School for 
Visually Impaired Children in the City of Sofia and the Dr Ivan Shishmanov School for 
Visually Impaired Children in the City of Varna. The availability of electronic Braille 
printers in the two schools makes it possible to print on a permanent basis textbooks, study 
aids, study aids, study materials and examination papers using Braille code, which are 
necessary for the tuition of visually challenged pupils both in the special and in the general 
and vocational schools;  
</p>
<p>44. The necessary conditions have been created for pupils with special educational 
needs to sit for state matriculation examinations: consultant teachers are available 
depending on the pupils&#8217; educational needs, and the duration of the examination has been 
increased by 120 minutes. In 2008 157 school-leavers with special educational needs sat for </p>

<p>state matriculation examinations, and in 2009, 130 school-leavers with special educational 
needs sat for the such examinations;  
</p>
<p>45. Twenty-four special schools: 13 schools for pupils with special educational needs 
and/or with chronic diseases (rehabilitation schools, speech-therapy schools, convalescence 
schools and hospital schools) and nine schools for pupils with deviant behaviour were 
closed down in the 2006-2007 school year. Thirteen special schools: four rehabilitation 
schools for (mentally retarded pupils), two schools for pupils with deviant behaviour 
(correctional boarding schools and social educational boarding schools), there 
convalescence schools and four convalescence vocational schools were closed down in the 
2007/2008 school year. Most of the pupils who attended the closed down special schools 
for children with special educational needs have been referred to mainstream tuition in a 
general educational environment. There are currently 82 special schools. The care homes 
for children deprived of parental care have been decentralized as well: as from 1 January 
2007, the care homes for children deprived of parental care were transformed into 
specialized institutions for provision of social services to children.  
</p>
<p>46. All children and pupils with special educational needs, including the mentally 
disabled children, are ensured equal access to education under the syllabi of the respective 
kindergartens and schools. The children and pupils who fail to attain the state educational 
requirements for learning content for a particular grade, stage and level of education, are 
tutored under individual syllabi geared to their needs and capacities. Regardless of their 
tutoring under individual syllabi, they can achieve professional training in a particular 
specialty, as well as obtain a document attesting to the attainment of a level of education 
like all other pupils when they achieve the relevant State educational requirements.  
</p>
<p>47. Children placed at care homes for mentally retarded children have the same 
opportunities for education as all other children-depending on the assessment of their 
educational needs made by the integrated educational assessment teams with the regional 
education inspectorates, part of them are mainstreamed in general schools, and another part 
are tutored in special schools.  Tuition of children with severe and multiple disabilities is 
organized on site at the care homes for mentally disabled children by teachers from the 
special schools or by resource teachers.  All children placed at care homes for mentally 
disabled children, who have been presented by the directors of such homes for assessment 
to the integrated educational assessment teams with the regional education inspectorates, of 
the children of compulsory school age placed at care homes for mentally disabled children, 
at present 75 children with disabilities attend general and vocational schools and 259 
children with disabilities attend special schools. Forty-one specialists of the specialized 
child care institutions participate in the assessment of children and pupils with disabilities, 
conducted by the integrated educational assessment teams with the regional education 
inspectorates.  
</p>
<p>48. A comprehensive check of all rehabilitation schools in Bulgaria was conducted in 
</p><p>2006. The check was intended to evaluate the rehabilitation schools and to optimize their 
network, to examine the existing conditions for the removal of pupils from such schools 
and for their mainstreaming in general and vocational schools, to identify the opportunities 
for relocation of the existing personnel resources to reinforce mainstream tuition.  
</p>
<p>49. In connection with the creation of conditions and guarantees for integration of 
people with disabilities in the kindergartens, schools and auxiliary units within the public 
education system, as well as in the higher schools in Bulgaria, by Order N&#176;. P 09-355 of 13 
March 2007 the Minister of Education and Science designated the officials of the Ministry 
of Education and Science and the Regional Education Inspectorates who are competent to 
draw up written statements ascertaining administrative violations in the sphere of education 
under Article 53 (1) and (2) Article 54 (1) of the Integration of Persons with Disabilities 
Act.  </p>

<p>50. The directors of all specialized child care institutions where are children of 
compulsory school age with various disabilities reside are directly responsible for providing 
information to the competent regional education inspectorates and for taking the necessary 
measures and creating conditions for the inclusion in tuition of children residing in such 
institutions. On the other hand, Chapter Seven &#8220;Administrative Penalty Provisions&#8221; of the 
Public Education Act regulated the written statements on violations drawn up by the 
municipal authorities in respect of all parents, curators and tutors who fail to ensure the 
attendance of their children at school for the time during which they are subject to

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its extensive and informative 
reply. 
</p>
<p><b>  China (People&#8217;s Republic of) 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>52. On 16 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication regarding the 
alleged deprivation of non-Chinese speaking children with special educational needs, in the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, from their fundamental right to appropriate 
education. 
</p>
<p>53. According to information received, the Education Bureau of the Government of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong) considered children to have 
special educational needs (SEN) if they have learning difficulties or disabilities which 
prevent or hinder them from making use of educational facilities generally provided in 
schools for children of their age. It was assumed, in line with internationally accepted 
standards, that approximately six percent of the population had a special educational need. 
In 2006 there were 38&#8217;048 documented ethnic minority children, under the age of 15, in 
Hong Kong. It was therefore alleged that Hong Kong has around 2&#8217;282 potential SEN 
children of non-Chinese speaking backgrounds. However, it was reported that there are 
currently merely 22 placements for non-Chinese speaking SEN students in government 
schools, supplemented by 282 placements in English Schools Foundations (ESF-partially 
subsidised by the Government) and other private international schools. 
</p>
<p>54. This shortfall of 1973 places for non-Chinese speaking children with SEN in the 
educational system of Hong Kong was believed to be a result of such children being unable 
to attend mainstream public schools, in which Chinese is the only language of instruction. 
Despite English and Chinese being the two official languages of Hong Kong, most 
educational establishments are Chinese-medium schools. Moreover, it was alleged that 
there exists just one special school for non-Chinese speaking students. The remaining 
places for non-Chinese speaking students with SEN, at both the primary and secondary 
levels, were offered by the aforementioned ESF and private international schools. 
</p>
<p>55. This situation allegedly put appropriate education out of reach for most non-Chinese 
speaking children with SEN, as school fees at private international schools are too high for 
most families to afford. At the same time, information received indicated that a waiting list 
has been established for non-Chinese speaking students with SEN wanting a place at one of 
the ESF schools. The average waiting time for this list was allegedly between 24 and 36 
months. 
</p>
<p>56. According to the sources, this situation indicated that non-Chinese speaking children 
with SEN are frequently denied their fundamental right to appropriate education on the 
basis of language. Such students, who would better be able to learn with English as the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>language of instruction, were reportedly prevented from doing so by a lack of suitable 
educational places. Chinese-speaking students with SEN are generally believed to be able 
to learn to their full potential, thanks to an adequate number of places available in 60 
special schools and special education classes offered in some of the 641 mainstream 
government schools. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>57. By letter dated 3 March 2010, the Government informed that it is the policy of the 
Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) to facilitate the early integration of 
non-Chinese speaking (NCS) students into the local education system and the wider 
community. To this end, various support measures have been put in place to meet the needs 
of NSC students and NCS students with special educational needs (SEN). All legally 
eligible children, irrespective of ethnic origin and physical or intellectual ability, have the 
right to enjoy basic education in public-sector schools. Since 1978, Hong Kong has been 
providing nine years of free and universal basic education from primary to junior secondary 
levels in public-sector schools. Starting from the 2008/09 school year, free education is 
extended to include senior secondary education in public-sector secondary schools, 
including special schools (there are at present 60 special schools in HKSAR offering more 
than 8.000 school places ) which operate senior secondary courses. There is no disparity of 
treatment between Chinese-speaking and NSC students in this regard.  
</p>
<p>58. The HKSAR&#8217;s policy on Integrated Education (IE) is to provide equal opportunities 
and full participation for all the students. With parents&#8217; consent, children (including NSC 
children) with severe learning difficulties and multiple disabilities are referred to special 
schools where they can receive more intensive individualized support. Other children are 
enrolled in ordinary schools. The schools are obliged to cater for the diverse needs of their 
students and the Government provides additional resources and professional support to 
facilitate these schools to adopt the Whole School Approach to cater for students with SEN. 
In formulating the integration policy for NCS and SEN students, the Government of 
HKSAR is mindful of the compliance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and local 
anti-discrimination legislation.  
</p>
<p>59. Chinese and English are the two official languages of the HKSAR. Students are 
taught both the Chinese language and the English language in all public-sector schools. 
NSC students, including those with SEN, are encouraged to study in public &#8211;sector schools 
adopting the Chinese or English as the teaching medium to facilitate their integration into 
the local community (please see paragraphs 8-9 below for details on admission). That said, 
studying under the local education system does not mean that the NCS students are forced 
to learn in Chinese at all costs. Although most schools use Chinese as the main medium of 
instruction, there are quite a number of public-sector schools adopting English as the 
teaching medium in all or some subjects which NCS students may get enrolled, if the NCS 
students concerned (some of whom may not have English as their mother tongue) could 
indeed learn better in English. In short, there are sufficient school places in public-sector 
schools to cater for all eligible children, including NCS children with SEN. We have pledge 
to help all eligible students, including NCS students with SEN, and provide them a place in 
a public-sector school so as to ensure that their right to education is suitably protected. 
There is question of NCS children with SEN being deprived of their right to basic education 
in HKSAR due their language backgrounds or disabilities.  
</p>
<p>60. Concerning the issue of identification and assessment, the Government informed 
that under the current mechanism, medical professionals work in partnership with parents to 
monitor the development of children (including NCS children) from birth to the age of five </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>and to identify any possible developmental problems. There is also in place a cross-
departmental programme called the Comprehensive Child Development Service (CCDS), 
which enables pre-primary educators to identify and refer children with health, 
developmental and behavioral problems to respective Maternal and Child Health Centres 
run by the Government for assessment and timely assistance. The CCDS also provides 
comprehensive and integrated support for parents in need.  
</p>
<p>61. In assessing whether NCS students are with SEN, their different cultural and 
experiential backgrounds as well as their language abilities will be taken into account and 
adjustments will be made where appropriate. For instance, non-verbal tests of intelligence 
may be used for NSC students who are not proficient in Chinese. When specialists interpret 
the assessment findings, NCS students&#8217; learning history, social adaptive behavior and 
cultural and experiential exposure will also be taken into consideration.  
</p>
<p>62. Concerning admission to schools for NCS children, the Government mentioned that 
NCS children are encouraged to attend local kindergartens using Chinese as the medium of 
instruction to facilitate their early immersion in the Chinese environment. Pre-schoolers 
with disabilities may attend special child care centres or join an Integrated Programme in 
Kindergarten-cum-Child Centre, depending on their degree of disabilities. All eligible 
students, including NCS children, have equal access to Primary One or Secondary One of 
public-sector schools through the centralized Primary One Admission (POA) or Secondary 
School Places Allocation (SSPA) systems operated by the Education Bureau (EDB) of the 
HKSAR Government. In POA, NCS children are provided with an opportunity for 
allocation to schools that traditionally admit more NCS children. If parents indicate in POA 
application form that their child has SEN, the EDB would follow up by collecting relevant 
diagnosis/ assessment report (s) and related information on the child so as to identify 
his/her educational needs, and discussing with the parents the appropriate educational 
provision for him/her. Similar arrangements are also available under the SSPA. Students 
with severe or multiple disabilities may be placed in special schools according to the 
assessment and recommendations of the respective specialists/physicians and upon parents&#8217; 
written consent. Other children with SEN are offered places in ordinary schools. NCS 
students may also seek placement assistance from the EDB for other grade levels.  
</p>
<p>63. Regarding education support for NCS children including NCS children with SEN, 
the Government informed that support services in place to help NCS students adapt to the 
local education system include a full-time 6 month Initiation Programme and a 60-hour 
Induction Programme for newly arrived NCS children, a School-based Support Scheme 
Grant for public-sector schools to run school-based support programmes such as 
supplementary language classes for newly arrived NCS students, a 4 week Summer 
Bridging Programme at Primary One to Primary Four for NCS students to help them 
consolidate what they have learnt at Learning Stage 1 and prepare them for transition to 
Learning Stage 2, etc. To enhance the learning of the Chinese Language for NCS students 
&#8220;designated schools &#8220; for the NCS students have been set up and provided with a recurrent 
grant. Other support services include the &#8220;Supplementary Guide to the Chinese Language 
Curriculum for NCS Students&#8221;. The Guide, which covers the principles, strategies and 
recommendations for implementing the Chinese Language curriculum in the learning 
context of the NCS students, has been issued to schools. Reference teaching materials and 
adapted textbooks have also been issued to schools and NCS students. The development of 
assessment tools in underway. Tailor-made training courses are made available for Chinese 
Language teachers. After school Chinese courses to reinforce what NCS students have 
learnt in class have been provided through the operation of the Chinese Language Learning 
Support Centres.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>64. In fact, a multi-lingual (English, Chinese, Hini, Indonesian, Nepali, Thai and Urdu) 
parent information package entitled &#8220;Non-Chinese Speaking Parent Information Package: 
Your Guide to Education in Hong Kong&#8221; has been published and distributed to NCS 
parents to introduce to them the local school system, major education policies and related 
education services, including education services for NCS children with SEN.  
</p>
<p>65. With the enactment of the Disability Discrimination Ordinance (DDO) in September 
1996 and the Code of Practice on Education published in July 2001, all education 
establishments have the legal obligations to admit students with SEN and provide 
appropriate accommodation to help them develop their potentials. NCS students with SEN 
studying in ordinary public-sector schools have equal opportunities to benefit from the 
same curriculum as the other local students. Curriculum adaptation, differentiated teaching 
and assessment accommodation are provided to cater for individual differences. Schools 
also provide a variety of support for students with SEN, including those NCS students with 
SEN. These include small group teaching, co-teaching, Intensive Remedial Teaching 
Programme, individualized education programmes, learning support by teaching assistants, 
speech therapy service, language learning support programmes for Chinese and English, 
peer tutoring and individual and group guidance, etc.  
</p>
<p>66. The HKSAR Government implements the Whole School Approach to IE, which is 
in line with the global trend. The aim is to enhance ordinary schools&#8217; capability of 
supporting student diversity through establishing inclusive culture, policy and practices. 
The Government recognizes that the success of IE hinges on teachers&#8217; capacity in catering 
for the diverse needs of their students. The overall school policy, practices and resource 
deployment are also important. As such, it has put much emphasis on teacher training and 
professional support for schools to support the implementation of IE. It also provides 
additional resources to schools and encourages them to use the resources flexibly to cater 
for their students&#8217; needs (specific details were also provided). 
</p>
<p>67. For NCS Students studying in special schools, the schools will design individualized 
education programmes for them to cater for their SEN, including languages needs. For 
those with severe disabilities to the level that they are unable to communicate through 
verbal means, teaching and learning are conducted through the multi-sensory approach. To 
cater for the needs of their students for intensive individualized support, special schools 
operate with smaller class sizes (ranging from 8 to 15 students per class in different types of 
special schools). A part from the basic teacher provisions according to the prescribed 
teacher-to-class ratio, special schools are provided with additional teachers and specialist 
staff such as native-speaking English teachers, low vision training teachers, mobility 
instructors, resource teachers for autistic children, teachers assisting in speech therapy, 
Primary School Master/Mistress ( Curriculum Development), school social workers, school 
nurses, speech therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, occupational therapy 
assistants and educational psychologists. Some of the special schools also provide boarding 
service for students assessed to have genuine boarding needs.  
</p>
<p>68. Finally, regarding other education opportunities outside the public school sector, the 
Government informs that there are other education opportunities outside the public school 
sector to provide an alternative in the education system for NCS students who have their 
own language and/or curriculum preferences. Fifteen English Schools Foundation (ESF) 
schools and 35 privately operated international schools are providing education services for 
NCS students (including those with SEN). There are 127 SEN students studying in learning 
support classes in ESF mainstream schools whereas there are 60 places for SEN students in 
a special school operated by ESF. Same as public-sector schools, they are required by law 
to admit students with SEN and provide appropriate accommodation for them.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>69. ESF receives, as one of its major income sources, government subsidy for the 
provision of special education services under segregated and integrated modes. Under the 
segregated mode, ESF operates one special school and provides education services to 
students who have severe learning difficulties and require an alternative curriculum. Under 
the integrated mode, ESF operates Learning Support Classes (LSC) in ESF mainstream 
schools to SEN students with a moderate level of disabilities who require a modified 
curriculum. In the light of a review undertaken by ESF on all applicants on its waiting list 
for SEN provision, the HKSAR Government has allocated extra resources to ESF schools 
to increase their school places in the LSC to provide appropriate support for students with 
SEN. That said, we have to reiterate that ESF and international schools are, by design, not 
intended for meeting any unmet demands for services in the public school sector and they 
are serving as an alternative choice for parents who have their own language and/or 
curriculum preferences.  
</p>
<p>70. In its response to the allegations, the Government wishes to mention that against the 
background set out above, all eligible school-age children, including NCS children with 
SEN, in the HKSAR enjoy equal opportunities to receiving basic education. The HKSAR 
Government guarantees sufficient provision of school places within the public school 
system, where ordinary schools and special schools are operated in parallel, to cater for the 
students. In the 2008/09 school year, the public-sector primary and secondary schools 
(including special schools) provide a total of around 830 000 school places to meet the 
demand from eligible children including NCS students with SEN. All eligible children have 
equal access to public-sector schools and are provided with appropriate support and 
accommodation in accordance with their needs. At the same time, there are alternative 
education opportunities outside the public school system such as ESF schools and 
international schools for those NCS students who have other language and/or curriculum 
preferences. De spite the fact that ESF and other private international schools have been 
providing different types of SEN services for those students in need, they are by design not 
meant to meet any unmet demand in the public sector. It is a misconception that the ESF 
schools are the major providers of school places for NCS children with SEN.  
</p>
<p>71. Without a sufficient source of information or methodology for the estimation of 2 
282 NCS students with SEN residing in the HKSAR as mentioned in the letter, we are 
unable to comment further. However, the allegation that there are only 22 placements for 
NCS students with SEN in government schools is factually incorrect. According to the 
records of the HKSAR Government in the 2008/09 school year, around 300 NCS students 
with SEN attended public-sector schools comprising government and aided schools. We 
would like to highlight that such data is inputted directly by schools through a computer 
system which was fully developed in mid-2008. Hence, it would take some time for schools 
to take full advantage of the system. The data may therefore be subject to further 
refinement. In any case, the allegation of a shortfall of nearly 2000 school places for NCS 
children with SEN in the education system of the HKSAR is definitely ungrounded. The 
HKSAR Government will, as usual, monitor closely the provision of school places for all 
eligible children, including NCS children with SEN, to ensure equal access to education 
services by all eligible children.  
</p>
<p>72. The HKSAR Government is committed to promoting equal opportunities and 
eliminating all forms of discrimination. All education establishments in the HKSAR have 
the legal obligations to admit students with SEN and provide appropriate accommodation to 
help them develop their potentials according to the DDO which took effect in the HKSAR 
in September 1996 and the Code of Practice on Education published in July 2001. We have 
ensured a fair and non-discriminatory access to the existing local education system for all 
NCS students with SEN.  </p>

hondure&#241;os estar&#237;an incumpliendo con el art&#237;culo 12 del Reglamento General del Estatuto 
que establece que &#8220;el tiempo efectivo de trabajo durante el a&#241;o lectivo ser&#225; de diez meses y

desarrollado en el pa&#237;s, el Estatuto del Docente Hondure&#241;o pudiera haberse convertido en 
un instrumento exclusivo de lucha salarial y que se habr&#237;a olvidado de la calidad educativa, 
en los t&#233;rminos contenidos en el citado reglamento. Como consecuencia del deterioro del 
sistema educativo p&#250;blico a nivel nacional, los padres y madres de familia estar&#237;an 
obligados a pagar por la educaci&#243;n de sus hijos en centros privados, en perjuicio de la 
econom&#237;a familiar y propiciando la polarizaci&#243;n social entre los que pueden y los que no 
pueden pagar por la educaci&#243;n adecuada para sus hijos.

<p><b>  Observaciones

<p>83. El Relator Especial lamenta no haber recibido respuesta del Gobierno en relaci&#243;n a 
la comunicaci&#243;n mencionada previamente.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>84. On 28 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication regarding the 
conflict in India&#8217;s Bihar and Jhakhand States between the Maoist rebels (Naxalites) and 
government security forces. 
</p>
<p>85. According to information received, it was alleged that education of tens of thousands 
of India's most disadvantaged and marginalized children was being disrupted by the 
ongoing conflict between Naxalite insurgents and police and other security forces in the 
eastern states of Bihar and Jharkhand. Security forces are allegedly occupying government 
school buildings as bases for anti-Naxalite operations, sometimes only for few days but 
often for periods lasting years. Meanwhile, it was reported that the Naxalites are directly 
targeting and blowing up government schools, including those not used or occupied by 
security forces. 
</p>
<p>86. It was reported that police and paramilitary forces were occupying school buildings 
either temporarily or for extended periods, as part of their counter-insurgency operations. 
Security forces had been known to take over entire school facilities and campuses, 
completely shutting down the school, or occupy part of school buildings, forcing classes to 
continue in the reduced space and alongside the armed men. While some of these 
occupations had lasted only days at a time and coincide with extra protection to schools and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>remote locations during times such as an election, many other police occupations had been 
reported to last for many months and even for several years. 
</p>
<p>87. It was further alleged that the presence of heavily armed police and paramilitaries 
living and working in the same buildings where children were studying has detrimental 
impacts on children's studies and frequently puts the authorities in breach of their 
obligations to realize children's right to education.  
</p>
<p>88. It was s reported that school principals, teachers, parents, and students have not 
received prior notification regarding the police occupying their schools. Concern had been 
expressed that this lack of notification to school authorities deprived the community of the 
opportunity to prepare better alternatives for continuing studies and eliminates the 
opportunity for local residents and their children to propose alternative locations for the 
police presence. Moreover, lack of notification and explanation to the students left the 
children confused and uncertain.  Moreover, it was also reported that representatives from 
the Bihar and Jharkhand Departments responsible for education and schools had opposed 
and objected to the use of their schools by security forces, yet their objections had not been 
considered by the security units carrying out the school occupations. 
</p>
<p>89. It was further alleged that the generalized fear and disruption that results from 
attacks by the Naxalite rebels had lead to some students dropping out from school or 
experiencing interruptions to their studies. Concern had been expressed that girls especially 
appear likely to drop out following a partial occupation of a school. Although some 
students may transfer to other schools in the area if their parents can cover the related costs, 
many students simply drop out of education all together. The increased rate of girl students 
dropping out was linked to either perceived or experienced instances of harassment by the 
security forces of girl students. As well as leading to increased rates of students dropping 
out of school, long-term occupation of schools had been reported to also decrease the 
enrollment rate and the rate of students continuing on to higher years of study.  
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>90. On 7 April 2010, the Government responded to the communication sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 28 December 2009 and informed that the Government had examined 
this communication and, according to the concerned State authorities, no breach of the right 
to education of children had been reported in Bihar. However, the concerned authorities had 
been sensitized to provide adequate protection in this regard, so as to enable prompt and 
suitable action in the event of an instance of such a breach. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply, but nevertheless would 
like to express concern regarding the conflict in India&#8217;s Bihar and Jhakhand States between 
the Maoist rebels (Naxalites) and government security forces and its effects in the 
realization of the right to education.

</b></p>
<p>92. On 13 July 2009, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression sent an urgent 
communication regarding Ms. Clotilde Reiss, a 23-year-old graduate from Lille Political 
Sciences Institute and an assistant teacher at Isfahan University. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>93. According to the information received, Ms. Clotilde Reiss was arrested on 
Wednesday, 1 July 2009, at Mehrabat Tehran Airport by security agents, when she was on 
her way home to France. She was taken to Evin prison. French consular authorities, who 
were notified on 2 July of her arrest, had been in regular contact by telephone, but have not 
yet been able to visit her. It was further reported that Ms. Reiss had been accused of 
espionage solely because custom officers found in her mobile telephone some photographs 
of the demonstrations which took place in Isfahan in the aftermath of the June 12 
presidential elections. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received a reply from the Government 
regarding the above-mentioned communication. 
</p>
<p><b>  Italy 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>95. On 31 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the human rights of migrants sent a communication concerning some of the legislative 
developments, including Law No. 94 of 15 July 2009 on public security (&#8220;the Security 
Law&#8221;), Law Decree no. 11/2009 of 23 February 2009 (&#8220;Law Decree&#8221;), Law no. 125 of 24 
July 2008 (&#8220;Law no. 125&#8221;), and Law no. 155 of 31 July 2005 (&#8220;the Pisanu Law&#8221;).  In this 
communication, it was highlighed certain aspects of these laws which may have a negative 
impact on the rights of migrants, including: (a) irregular migration status as an aggravating 
factor in sentencing; (b) the offence of illegal entry and stay; (c) the expulsion of aliens; (d) 
the extension of administrative detention for migrants; (e)  restrictions on money transfer; 
(f) the modification of the Civil Code affecting irregular migrants&#8217; right to marry; and (g) 
restrictions on the right to birth registration.<b> </b>     <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  (a) Irregular migration status as an aggravating factor in sentencing 
</b></p>
<p>96. Law no. 125 provides that when a person commits an offence while unlawfully 
present in the national territory, his or her unlawful presence will be deemed an aggravating 
factor in respect of sentencing.  This may increase the period of imprisonment a person is 
sentenced to by up to one third.  The imposition of a more severe punishment solely on the 
basis of a convicted person&#8217;s legal status in the country is a subject of concern, as it may 
result in discrimination based on one&#8217;s immigration status..  <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  (b) The offence of illegal entry and stay 
</b></p>
<p>97. The Security Law introduced the offence of illegal entry and stay within the territory 
of the State.  Under Article 1, Paragraph 16, the offender is subject to punishment by a 
penalty ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 Euros.  While acknowledging the sovereign right of 
the State to regulate the entry and stay of aliens, concern was expressed about the effects of 
the criminalization of illegal entry and stay on the human rights of irregular migrants 
migration, which could further hamper access to, <i>inter alia</i>, education, health, housing, 
labor rights and the justice system, because of the fear of being denounced, imprisoned and 
ultimately deported. It had already been reported that many irregular migrants choose not to 
access health care even when their physical conditions demand medical attention, because 
of the fear that they would be reported by public officials and subsequently convicted of a 
crime.  According to information received, the number of migrants seeking treatment in the 
main hospitals in Rome had decreased by 35%, following the approval of the Security Law.  
Furthermore, there were reports that mothers and children who required urgent medical 
attention have died, because they did not access hospitals or doctors for fear of being </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>reported as illegal immigrants.  The criminalization of illegal entry and stay also fueled 
anti-migrant sentiments, aggravating an acute social problem.  The Security Law appeared 
to be not in line with the commitments of States, inter alia, in the framework of the Durban 
Declaration and Plan of Action which highlighted the importance of creating conditions 
conducive to greater harmony, tolerance and respect between migrants and the rest of 
society in the countries in which they find themselves. As reiterated irregular migration 
should be regarded as an administrative offence and irregular migrants should not be treated 
as criminals.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>98. According to Article 1, Paragraph 17 of the Security Law, the offence was 
adjudicated through a new fast-track procedure.  This procedure, which is designed to be 
fast and informal, was conducted before a justice of peace and allows the public prosecutor 
to transfer the defendant to trial before a justice of peace within 15 days, if there are 
particular reasons of urgency or the accused person is not subject to detention measures.  If 
the accused person is detained, the public prosecutor may send the defendant immediately 
before the justice of peace.  In preparation of the defence, the defendant can request no 
more than 7 days, or 48 hours in case he or she is already detained or for reasons of 
urgency.  Concern was expressed that the fast-track procedure diminishes the right of 
migrants to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR), given the limited time available to prepare a defense.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  (c) Expulsion of aliens 
</b></p>
<p>99. Article 1, Paragraph 22M of the Security Law envisages the administrative 
expulsion of persons for illegal entry or stay without the authorization of a criminal judge.  
An alien subject to expulsion may challenge the order of expulsion in a hearing before a 
justice of peace and the ordinary judge is only notified of the execution of expulsion.  
Concern was expressed that a migrant is not afforded the right to challenge his or her 
expulsion before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law and 
that the scope of review for the administrative expulsion is narrow, as the justice of peace is 
only asked to verify that all procedures have been duly complied with and that the person 
has been reported for the offence of illegal entry and stay.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>100. In addition, Article 3(1) of the Pisanu Law allows for expulsion of aliens by decree 
of the Minister of the Interior or the prefect when the alien is suspected of terrorist 
activities.  According to the information received, the Government had expelled three 
Tunisian terrorist suspects pursuant to the Pisanu Law since June 2008, despite the ruling of 
the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to suspend the expulsion until the ECHR 
issues decisions on their claims that they would face torture or other mistreatment upon 
their return to Tunisia.  Mr. Essid Sami Ben Khemais and Mr. Mourad Trabelsi were 
deported to Tunisia in June 2008 and December 2008 respectively.  With regard to the case 
of Mr. Essid Sami Ben Khemais, the ECHR held on 24 February 2009 that Italy violated 
article 3 (prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment) and article 34 (right of 
individual petition) of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Despite Court&#8217;s interim 
measure to suspend the planned expulsion, it was reported that the Government had 
forcibly expelled Mr. Ali Ben Sassi Toumi to Tunisia on 2 August 2009.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>101. Concern was expressed about the expulsion procedures, which did not seem to 
guarantee the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i>. The Government was asked to provide for 
adequate safeguards to ensure that the State refrains from expulsion where there are 
substantial grounds for believing that an individual faces a real risk, following the removal, 
of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or other violations of 
fundamental human rights, which seemed not to be the case neither in the procedures for 
administrative expulsion under the Security Law nor in the expulsion procedures under the 
Pisanu Law.  In light of these considerations, Article 1, Paragraph 22M of the Security Law </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>also raised some concern, as it appeared to favor and perpetuate the use of expulsion.  
Paragraph 22M requires the <i>Questore</i> (provincial police chief) to continue re-ordering 
expulsion where a person violates an order of expulsion, while the law in force before the 
amendments only sanctioned the person with detention. 
</p>
<p><b>  (d) The extension of administrative detention for migrants 
</b></p>
<p>102. It was reported that the Law Decree significantly increases the maximum length of 
administrative detention.  While the maximum period of detention was 60 days under the 
previous legislation, the Law Decree allowed renewals of 60 days up to a maximum of 6 
months by the justice of peace in cases of lack of cooperation of the irregular migrant or 
delays in obtaining the documentation from third countries that is necessary for repatriation.  
Concern was expressed that the length of the administrative detention is not proportionate 
to the objectives of such detention, particularly in light of reports that unaccompanied 
children are often subject to long administrative detention. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>103. While the new maximum period of administrative detention is still in line with the 
European Union Return Directive which allows detention of irregular migrants for up to 18 
months, concern was expressed that the decision of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
increase the maximum period of administrative detention from 60 days to 6 months 
appeared to be inconsistent with the principle of non-retrogression, which requires the most 
careful consideration in the adoption of any deliberately retrogressive measure.  In addition, 
concern was expressed that the scope of review for administrative detention was limited, as 
the review processes were identical to those for administrative expulsion, which did not 
allow for a review on the merits.  
</p>
<p><b>  (e) Restrictions on money transfer 
</b></p>
<p>104. Article 1, Paragraphs 20 and 21 of the Security Law imposes restrictive 
requirements on money transfer operations, which are often used by migrants to remit part 
of their income to their country of origin.  The provisions require that in cases of non-EU 
nationals requesting to transfer money abroad the, money transfer agents must acquire and 
store for 10 years a copy of the resident permit.  If the permit is missing, the agent must 
inform the local police within twelve hours. Failure to comply with this requirement may 
result in the cancellation of the agent&#8217;s license.  The new requirement may further foster a 
culture of denunciation vis-&#224;-vis irregular migrants.  Concern was expressed that the 
requirements unduly interfered with the private and family life of migrants, given that the 
possibility of transferring earnings, assets and pensions is essential for many migrants 
whose families rely on their support.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  (f) Modification of the Civil Code affecting irregular migrants&#8217; right to marry 
</b></p>
<p>105. Article 1, Paragraph 15 of the Security Law amends Article 116 of the Civil Code, 
which regulates the conditions for contracting marriage for aliens.  Aliens would be obliged 
to present a document demonstrating the legality of their presence in Italian territory before 
they could enter into a marriage recognized by the Italian Republic, Concern was expressed 
that this requirement impaired the enjoyment of the right of irregular migrants to marry, as 
legal resident status becomes a prerequisite to the exercise of this right.   <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  (g) Restrictions of the right to birth registration  
</b></p>
<p>106. Article 1, Paragraph 20 of the Security Law requires the presentation of a residence 
permit before the birth of a child can be registered. This effectively deprives the child of an 
irregular migrant of the right to personal identity and citizenship at the time of birth.  
According to information received, in the first six months of 2009 alone, there were at least 
412 children who were born to parents without a residence permit and whose birth was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p>hence not registered.  While irregular migrant mothers are entitled to a residence permit for 
the entire period of pregnancy and for the first six months after a child is born pursuant to 
Article 19 of Law no. 125, this temporary permit does not seem to effectively facilitate the 
registration of irregular migrant children, as the permit is granted only if the applicant 
mother holds a valid passport or an equivalent document, which many of the irregular 
migrants do not have.  The lack of registration may have grave consequences for the child, 
as he or she may be removed from his or her mother as an &#8220;abandoned&#8221; child and 
transferred to the social services by order of the Juvenile Court.  In addition, concern was 
expressed about the right to education in light of this new legislation that would 
significantly add further barriers to the full realization of the right to education to all, 
including irregular or undocumented migrants.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>Finally, reference was also made to other related information which raised specific 
concerns regarding the human rights of migrants.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>107. By letter dated 26 March 2010, the Government of Italy provided the following 
information.  
</p>
<p>108. A. Non-EU nationals can enter Italy for the purpose of tourism, study, family 
reunification and work. A stay permit is required<b> </b>for periods exceeding three-months. A 
computer-based procedure has been introduced to ensure the prompt release of the stay 
permit. In case of protection for victims of human trafficking, the permit can be released on 
the spot. Individuals from certain countries are not required to get a visa for tourism reason.  
</p>
<p>109. At each Prefecture, it has been established an immigration desk processing 
applications for the recruitment of foreign workers, family reunification and the change of a 
residence permit. In Autumn 2009, the above-mentioned computer-based procedure was 
introduced to facilitate the regularisation of those migrants<b>, </b>even without stay permit,<b> 
</b>involved in the informal labour sector. In few months, approximately 300.000 applications 
were submitted.  
</p>
<p>110. .B. With specific regard to the measures laid down in the so-called<b> &#8220;</b>security 
package<b>&#8221;</b>, they are meant to curb criminal behaviours of individuals and no provision at all 
is envisaged against any community, group or class nor is linked to any form of 
discrimination and xenophobia.  
</p>
<p>111. As for the offence of illegal entry and stay in Italy, the relevant provision has been 
introduced with the aim of reducing the mass flow of migrants illegally staying in Italy. 
More importantly, unlike other countries, to this end Italy has introduced a mere fine. Plus, 
under whatsoever circumstances, when the illegal migrant leaves the Country, the 
extinguishment of offence is applied by Law.   
</p>
<p>112. As for the aggravating circumstances, it applies to illegal migrants found guilty of a 
main crime. Such provision responds to the increasing trend, observed by the Italian 
judicial system, on the involvement of illegal or irregular migrants used as a workforce by 
the organized crime. Along these lines it has been introduced the detention penalty for those 
who rent apartments to illegal migrants.  
</p>
<p>113. The Government aims at addressing, more effectively, the illegal immigration (and 
its possible connection with organized crime) and its negative effects on the society as a 
whole, including the hundreds of thousands of legal migrants. To this end, it has been 
introduced the payment of a minimum tax and a test of the Italian Language as for the 
release or the renewal of the stay permit.<b>  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>114. The granting of the citizenship for foreigners stems from either a ten-year residence, 
or marriage, or birth combined with residence up to the coming of age<i>. </i>The relevant 
legislation, passed in 1992, has been supplemented by the &#8220;security package&#8221; for the case 
of family&#8217;s reunification, in the event of marriage. This envisages the release of the 
citizenship after a two-year period of legal residence of the spouses (couple) in Italy, while 
being in the past a six-month term.<b>   
</b></p>
<p>115. As for the children, the Law ensures that &#8220;any foreigner, born in Italy, who has 
resided legally and without any interruption, acquires the Italian citizenship at the coming 
of age, provided that s/he makes a declaration to this end, within one year&#8221;. The rationale 
behind this provision is clear: the best interest of the child is saved in the event of omission 
or delays in the registration procedure by the parents. It is sufficient that the child 
concerned can prove his/her stay, for instance by medical or school certificates. 
Accordingly, as for the birth declaration (birth register and civil status register), no 
residence-related document shall be produced as long as the submission of the declaration 
itself is sufficient. 
</p>
<p>116. As to the allegations/concerns about the possible limitations to enjoy the right of 
access to health-care service and education, the Government fully observes the relevant 
constitutional principles. No limitation to the right to health and to education has been 
introduced so far. The &#8220;security package&#8221; does not oblige physicians or school principals to 
denounce illegal migrants.    
</p>
<p>117. The provisions concerning the expulsion of aliens abide by Art.13 of ICCPR and by 
Protocol No.7 of the ECHR. Foreigners illegally entering or staying in Italy who fail to 
meet the requirements either provided by law, or due to public order or national security, 
may be refouled, returned under escort to the frontiers, expelled, or receive an expulsion 
order to leave the country. The domestic legislation envisages the judicial control over the 
order of expulsion adopted by the administrative authority. The request for validation of the 
order is submitted to the competent judge (justice of peace), within 48 hours. The judge 
may confirm the order within the following 48 hours. In case of expulsion, despite the ten-
year prohibition to re-enter (&#8220;security package&#8221;), the foreigner may always return to Italy if 
a stay permit for family reunification is granted or s/he is regularly hired. Besides a 
Constitutional Court&#8217;s verdict (No. 376/00) has stipulated the prohibition of expulsion to 
the spouse of pregnant women, or to the parent of a six-month child. 
</p>
<p>118. The expulsion measure is adopted by the Minister of Interior or the Prefect and 
executed by the Head of the Local Police HQs. (<i>Questore</i>).  
</p>
<p>119. At the normative level, the Unified Text on Immigration (286/98) envisages three 
differing expulsion measures: the cited administrative expulsion measure, the expulsion 
measure as a security measures and the expulsion replacing the detention penalty. The last 
two cases fall within the competence of the judicial Authorities, and, as per Constitution, 
have to be inspired by the principles of the fair trial and the due process of law. 
</p>
<p>120. As for the limits to said discipline, Italian Authorities reiterate: the compliance with<b> 
</b>international standards -as long as no collective expulsion measure can be adopted; the 
enforcement of the non-refoulement (Arts.32-33 of the 1951 Geneva Convention and Art. 
19 of the Nice Charter); the migrant worker cannot be expelled further to dismissal (ILO 
Convention No. 143); and, last but not least, in compliance with Art. 13 of ICCPR and Art. 
1 of Protocol No.7 to the European Convention on Human Rights, specific safeguards 
apply, allowing the lodging of complaint before the competent Authorities.  
</p>
<p>121. With specific regard to the additional case of expulsion for terrorism, it is worth 
recalling that since the entry into force of the Italian Constitution (1948), the legal system 
has to be and is in line with the general international law (Art.10). Along these lines, the 
Italian counter-terrorism legislation is in strict compliance with international law. Since </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b>  
</p>
<p>2001, Italy has not introduced any special procedure for terrorist cases, or special 
jurisdiction. Only the Courts of law may try and judge an individuals for terrorism-related 
crimes.  
</p>
<p>122. On a more specific note, in line with the EU policy and provisions, Italy adopted 
Law Decree No.144/2005, which was then converted into law by the so-called Pisanu Law 
(In brief, the law allows for increased surveillance and enhanced police powers to gather 
evidence in terrorism cases, for example DNA for purposes of identification). The 
European Court of Human Rights has acknowledged the necessity of the normative tools so 
introduced. The Constitutional Court has emphasized, with regard to the terrorism threat: 
the admissibility of provisions with a broad scope; the indefectible duty of the legal system 
towards democratic order and public security; and the admissibility of ad hoc measures, 
though under peremptory terms. In this perspective the additional administrative expulsion 
measure should be considered. The new case introduced by the Pisanu Law includes a 
suspensive effect of the expulsion measure upon request by the individual concerned; and 
that the procedure will follow and ensure the same safeguards envisaged in the event of the 
judicial expulsion.  Thus the principle of non refoulement is not restricted at all.  
</p>
<p>123. Besides, the recent domestic case-law shows the trend to replace the expulsion 
following the criminal conviction under Article 235 of the penal code with the so-called 
alternative measures to the detention penalty [specifically the transfer in a labour house, 
pursuant to Art. 216 of the penal code]. This decision matches both the public interest and 
the full compliance with relevant international obligations through a system of alternative 
sanctions that could limit the social dangerousness of the person convicted and fully secure 
the physical and psychological integrity while avoiding deportation.  
</p>
<p>124. In terms of data, it is worth recalling that: 1) on March 2, 2010 the Minister of 
Interior reported before the Italian Senate that since the introduction of the relevant 
measures by the &#8220;security package&#8221;, over 15,000 illegal migrants had been denounced; 2) 
In 2008, the measures against foreigners irregularly staying in Italy amounted to 70.625, of 
whom 24.234 were repatriated; in 2009 they amounted to 52.823, of whom 18.361 were 
repatriated; 3) As for those affiliated to terrorism-related organizations amounted to 8 
people and twelve people between 2008 and 2009, respectively (see Annex 1 for additional 
data). 
</p>
<p>125. C.<b> </b>With specific regard to the reception procedures,<b> </b>as for the extension of the stay 
in the Identification and Expulsion Centre up to 6 months, in line with the EU Directive on 
return (by which the holding period may be extended to a maximum of 18 months), such a 
provision has been adopted with the aim of detecting the identity of the migrant without 
documents. In this regard, it has to be mentioned that it is the judge - and not the 
administrative authority &#8211; to be tasked with controlling whether it is necessary and 
legitimate to extend the stay. Such review will take place every 30/60 days.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>126. In terms of reception, the initial phase includes health-care services, cultural 
mediation, legal counselling, identification, examination of the relevant applications and, 
eventually, repatriation, only for those who are not entitled to stay in Italy.  
</p>
<p>127. To this end, the Reception Centres have a capacity of 3.400 places. The Centres for 
the first-aid and reception (CPSA) with a 1.200-place capacity are placed in the locations 
most affected by landings from the sea, for instance in Lampedusa Island. There are 
thirteen Identification and Expulsion Centres<b> </b>(CIE) across the country with 1806 places. 
</p>
<p>128. As for asylum-seekers, specific reception Centres (CARA) have a 2.083-place 
capacity<b>. </b>They<b> </b>are also intended for undocumented people, those who violate border 
controls, and foreigners detained because illegally staying in Italy.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>129. Specifically, as regards asylum-seekers, the decision on the asylum application, as a 
general rule, should take 35 days. After this deadline, if a decision is still pending, a 
renewable temporary residence permit is granted; and asylum-seekers can leave the Centre 
during the day. In line with the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and 
its 1967 Protocol, Italy has established a system for providing protection to refugees.  
</p>
<p>130. The Government also provides temporary protection measures to individuals who 
may not qualify as refugees under the 1951 Convention, which have to be renewed 
periodically and do not ensure future permanent residence. As for the asylum procedure, no 
modifications has been introduced by the security-package (which has introduced: a fine for 
the illegal entry or residence in Italy; while the aggravating circumstance under reference 
applies only if a crime has been perpetrated by the illegal migrant; the requirement to pass a 
language test for the release of the stay permit; the extension of the stay in the CIE up to 
180 days when the expulsion order or the return cannot be enforced, inter alia, to ascertain 
the identity or to acquire due travel documents).    
</p>
<p>131. Stepping back to the asylum procedures, in order to speed up the processing of all 
the asylum applications -in 2009 amounted to 16.120-, in addition to the ten Territorial 
Commissions, five more sections have been established in 2009. It should be noted that in 
all the Commissions, there is a UNHCR representative. A negative decision may be 
appealed before the Judiciary. In all stages of the proceeding, it may be requested legal aid.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>132. If a decision is not taken on the individual case within six months &#8211; period during 
which the applicant can be accommodated by the State &#8211; s/he will get a residence permit, 
allowing her/him to work. To this end, in 19 out of 20 Regions, the SPRAR system - which 
is a network including local institutions and private sector &#8211; in charge of ensuring the 
integration of asylum-seekers and refugees, can make 6.000 places available, per year. In 
2008, this System guaranteed accommodation to 8412 refugees.  
</p>
<p>133. In terms of data, according to the most recent comparable data between the EU 
countries, in 2008 Italy granted asylum, subsidiary or humanitarian protection measures to 
the 48.2% of the applications against  28.3% of the EU average.  
</p>
<p>134. To date, Italy has translated all the EU asylum-related Directives. Within the EU 
framework Italy is also a party to the Dublin II Instruction<b>, </b>whose adherents generally 
transfer asylum applications to the first member country, in which the applicant was 
present.  
</p>
<p>135. Within the EU framework, Italy has been developing &#8220;emergency resettlement&#8221; 
projects for vulnerable individuals, including unaccompanied minors, women at risk, 
victims of torture and of physical and sexual violence, the elderly, and people who have 
suffered a prolonged detention or with serious health diseases. As for minors, they cannot 
be deported unless the removal order applies to the entire family. As for unaccompanied 
minors, until the coming of age, they enjoy the full protection, including the right of access 
to education and health-care. Victims of trafficking are granted protection and assistance, 
regardless of their cooperation with the police . They are granted a special social protection 
permit, while attention is paid to ensure their voluntary assisted return to the country of 
origin. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>136. Further Italy has signed 30 bilateral re-admission and cooperation agreements for the 
return of irregular migrants being untitled to international protection. These agreements are 
a useful tool to fight human trafficking and promote regular migration. 
</p>
<p>137. The integration of foreign nationals remains a key factor for social cohesion. Many 
projects are underway. In each Province there are Territorial Councils for immigration, 
which include immigrants representatives. For instance, a &#8220;Portal for Integration&#8221; is 
currently under implementation. It will be a useful multimedia instrument for supplying </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>26</b>  
</p>
<p>information and, at the same time, circulate all possible data for migrants inclusion within 
the Italian society, with a special focus on their rights and duties as well as their working 
opportunities in our country.  
</p>
<p>138. Along these lines, it is worth recalling that in Italy regular migrant workers are fully 
protected and enjoy equal civil, economic, social and cultural rights. According to Italian  
legislation, the national collective contract of employment signed with organizations 
representing workers and associations of employers, aims at jointly pre-regulate the 
minimum economic and regulatory issues applicable to all workers, including migrant 
workers. Thus several<b> </b>social protection measures, including social benefits<b>, </b>are ensured to 
all migrant workers.  
</p>
<p>139. In conclusion, the Government reiterated that the legislation on immigration has no 
relation with any kind of xenophobic attitude but, on the contrary, have the objective to 
address more effectively the phenomenon of illegal immigration, trafficking in human 
beings and exploitation, including its connection with organized crime and its negative 
consequences also on thousands of regular migrants living in Italy.    
</p>
<p>140. In the Government&#8217;s view, the basic rule, if any, which should guide modern 
democracies in the protection of rights, is <i>the effective implementation of the principle of 
non-discrimination (</i>as laid down in Art. 3 of the Italian Constitution). In this regard, this 
principle is and remain at the core of the <i>modus operandi</i> of the domestic Institutions. It is, 
indeed, one of the main pillars of our constitutional code, upon which the domestic 
legislative system is based. Therefore, such criterion is at the core of both the relevant 
legislation and the ongoing criminal proceeding under reference.  
</p>
<p>Italian Authorities reiterated their willingness to continue to fully cooperate with 
international human rights mechanisms.

<p>142. By letter dated 24 November 2009, the Government responded to the 
communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on 20 November 2008<b>1</b>, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
Indigenous people and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, and informed that based on the information made available by the 
authorities, since 1995 there have been one (1) police report involving a Penan girl and 
three (3) police reports involving Penan women. The reported cases are as follows:  
</p>
<p><i>  Marudi District Police Report 279/1995 
</i></p>
<p>143. A 14 year old Penan girl claimed that she was raped. Upon investigation the police 
had insufficient evidences to prosecute on the following grounds: 
</p>
<p> (a) The medical doctor&#8217;s report stated that the victim&#8217;s hymen was intact; 
</p>
<p> (b) The victim could not identify the suspects; and

</p>
<p><i>  Marudi District Police Report 645/2008  
</i></p>
<p>144. A police report was lodged by the victim, known as Cynthia, (not her real name). 
Cynthia&#8217;s ordeal was reported in the local newspaper &#8220;The Star on 6 october 2008 entitled 
&#8220;<i>Against their Will</i>&#8221;. According to the said article, Cynthia was abused and raped by 
loggers when she hitched a ride on the logging company&#8217;s vehicle to go to school. As a 
result Cynthia had given birth to baby girl in July 2008. The Investigation Papers have been 
submitted to the Senior Federal Counsel (SFC) of Sarawak on 17 December 2008. The SFC 
has instructed the police to conduct further investigation.  
</p>
<p><i>  Marudi District Police Report 646/2008 
</i></p>
<p>145. A police report was lodged by DSP Roselina from the Police Contingent 
Headquarters based on the article in &#8220;The Star&#8221; dated 6 October 2008 entitled <i>&#8220;Against 
Their Will</i>&#8221;. The victim, known as Rina (not her real name) did not make any police report 
but the report was necessary to allow the police to initiate investigations. Upon 
investigation and based on the article, it was alleged that a logger came to Rina&#8217;s house in a 
drunken state and she was raped. As a result, Rina gave birth in May 2005. The 
investigation Papers have been submitted to the Senior Federal Counsel (SFC) in Sarawak 
on 17 December 2008. The SFC has instructed the police to conduct further investigation.  
</p>
<p><i>  Marudi District Police Report 647/2008 
</i></p>
<p>146. A police report was lodged by the victim, known as Mindy (not her real name). 
Mindy&#8217;s ordeal was also reported in the local newspaper &#8220;The Star&#8221; on 6 Ocober 2008 
entitled &#8220;<i>Against Their Will</i>&#8221;. According to the said article, Mindy was alleged raped by a 
logger named Ah Heng and have given birth to two (2) children. The Investigation Papers 
have been submitted to the Senior Federal Counsel (SFC) in Sarawak on 17 December 
2008. The SFC has instructed the police to conduct further investigation.  
</p>
<p>147. Concerning the details, results, of the investigations carried out in relation to the 
cases, the Government informs that with regard to the Marudi District Police Report 
279/1995 as mentioned earlier, the investigation showed insufficient evidence to support 
any prosecution for rape. As for the other three cases, the SFC has instructed that the cases 
be investigated further. Apart from the police investigation, the Government had 
established the National-level Task Force to investigate the Accusations of Sexual Abuses 
towards the Penan Girls in Sarawak (&#8220;the Task Force&#8221;) on 8 October 2008. The Task Force 
is helmed by the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development, and was 
chaired by the then Minister of Women, Family and Community Development, Dato&#8217;s Sri 
Dr. Ng Yen Yen. Membres of the Task Force consists of senior officials from other 
Ministries and Agencies, including the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Health, 
the Ministry of Education; the Ministry of information, Community and Culture, Ministry 
of Rural and Regional Development, the Sarawak Government, and Non-Governmental 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>148.  The establishment of the Task Force is aimed at investigating the accusations of 
sexual exploitation of Penan women and school girls in Sarawak by the logging company 
workers. Members of the Task Force participated in a visit to the Baram area of Sarawak 
from 10 to 15 November 2008. As a result of the said visit, the Task Force proposed several 
improvements that falls under the jurisdiction of several Ministries/Government Agencies.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>28</b>  
</p>
<p>149. In its report, the Task Force unanimously concluded among others that the sexual 
abuse mostly occurred due to the victims&#8217; dependency on transportation owned by the 
logging company and the presence of outsiders dealing with the village people to purchase 
of forest products; the sexual abuse mostly occurred due to the victims&#8217; dependency on 
transportation owned by the logging company and the presence of outsiders dealing with 
the village people to purchase of forest products. 
</p>
<p>150. The Penan community are exposed to sexual abuse and exploitation due to the 
following reasons: poverty; isolated places of residence; high dependency on logging 
companies not only for transport for health services and schooling, but also for the basic 
necessities such as water, electric generators, etc; lack of trust towards higher authorities; 
the negative perception, prejudice and negative stereotypes with labels such as lazy, liars 
and alcoholics directed at the Penan by outside society making the Penan feel alienated and 
suffering from low self-esteem.  
</p>
<p>151. The Government informs that lack of infrastructure, such as roads, in addition to the 
lack of transportation let to the difficulties faced by the Penan villagers in dealing with 
outsiders, including Government agencies; and to ensure a more balanced development, 
there should be increased involvement of the Penan tribe in the decision-making processes 
relevant to them.  
</p>
<p>152. The full report of the Taskforce is available for public viewing on the official 
website of the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development. It must be 
highlighted that findings of the said Task Force is by no means meant to determine the 
criminal liability of any person or groups of persons. The Government wishes to draw the 
attention again to the fact that investigations with regards to cases involving police reports 
no.645, 646 and 647 of 2008 are still on-going.  
</p>
<p>153. The Government reassures that should there be sufficient evidence of any criminal 
wrong doing, the perpetrators would be brought to court for trial. If a person is charged for 
the offence of rape under section 375 of the Malaysian Penal Code, upon conviction, those 
found guilty could be punished with a very heavy custodial sentence for a term of not  less 
than five years and not more than thirty years and shall also be liable to whipping.  
</p>
<p>154. Concerning programmes or measures taken by both the Federal and Sarawak 
Governments to ensure the safety of the Penan women and girls and ensure that Penan 
children provided safe affordable transportation to reach their schools, the Federal 
Government had been working in collaboration with the Sarawak State Government to 
initiate several development programs to ensure that the Penan children have safe access to 
schools specifically through the Service Centre Development in the Penan area. The 
Service Centres in the Penan area are equipped with facilities such as schools, clinics and 
agricultural stations. Additionally, the State Government of Sarawak has also provides 
financial support for transport of Penan children that are staying too far from schools. The 
implementation of the transport service is managed by the Resident&#8217;s and District Office as 
well as the schools involved.  
</p>
<p>155. The Government takes note of Article (4) &#167; (d) of the United Nations Declaration on 
the Elimination of Violence against Women that was raised by the Experts. Malaysia has 
enacted or amended laws to punish acts of violence against women who are subjected to 
violence. Among those laws is the Penal Code whereby the punishment for rape has been 
amended from 20 years imprisonment to a minimum of 5 years and a maximum of 30 
years.  
</p>
<p>156. Women who are subjected to violence have been provided with unhindered access to 
justice and health services. The Government has set up programs for sexually abused 
women and also provides legal assistance for those who cannot afford their own legal 
counsel. The Government reaffirms it commitments to continue to fully protect indigenous </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>29 
</b></p>
<p>peoples in Malaysia as had been carried out long before the adoption of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of indigenous Peoples by the international community. 
Malaysia&#8217;s actions are fully in compliance with the requirements of this Declaration, in 
particular Article 22(2) whereby States shall take measures, together with indigenous 
peoples, to ensure that indigenous women and children enjoy the full protection and 
guarantees against all forms of violence and discrimination, as well as the provisions of 
Human Rights Resolution 2005/41-Elimination of violence against women.  
</p>
<p>157. The Government has long established structured programmes and mechanisms to 
consult with and in addressing issues raised by the indigenous communities in the country, 
in compliance with Article 21 (2) of the said Declaration. Besides the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of indigenous Peoples, the Government of Malaysia also 
complies with Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 13 of 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), even 
though Malaysia is not a party to the ICESCR. 
</p>
<p>158. The Government further notes the thematic report of the Special Rapporteur on the 
right to education (E/CN.4/2006/45), particularly his observation in paragraph 48 on the 
issue of safety on the way to and from school. Malaysia is making continuous efforts to 
improve this situation.  
</p>
<p>159. The Government wishes to reaffirm its commitment to provide education to all in 
consonance with its obligations under the CRC and CEDAW. The Government is serious in 
providing education to all in Malaysia. It has continually provided programmes to provide 
access to the education system to the indigenous peoples which include the Penans. The 
Federal Constitution provides these rights under Article 12.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>160. The Government concludes by submitting that the summary of the facts contained in 
the communication sent does not reflect the accurate facts and information. In this regard, 
the Government gives its assurance and pledge that the investigation on the sexual abuses 
against Penan women and girls will be conducted in accordance with the prevailing 
domestic laws of Malaysia which are fully consonant with the norms and standards of 
international law. The government reiterates its commitment to take necessary steps and 
measures to continuously guarantee to promote, protect and implement all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms as well as to guarantee the individual and collective rights of 
indigenous peoples, including their rights to culture, identity, language, employment, 
health, education and others.

</b></p>
<p>164. El 22 de diciembre de 2009, el relator Especial, junto con el Relator Especial sobre 
los efectos nocivos para el goce de los derechos humanos del traslado y vertimiento de 
productos y desechos t&#243;xicos y peligrosos, y el Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los 
derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas, envi&#243; una comunicaci&#243;n 
relativa a  impactos negativos causados por el cultivo intensivo de la soja y el uso asociado 
de agroqu&#237;micos sobre las comunidades campesinas e ind&#237;genas que viven cerca de dichos 
cultivos, y la supuesta situaci&#243;n de las comunidades ind&#237;genas Ka&#8217;agy Roky, Loma Tajy, 
Formosa, Ka&#8217;aty Miri, Ysati y Ka&#8217;a Poty en Alto Paran&#225;, que habr&#237;an sido rociadas con 
agroqu&#237;micos por empresas privadas brasile&#241;as. 
</p>
<p>165. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, la soja es el cultivo de mayor producci&#243;n en 
el Paraguay, en volumen y valor monetario, que se desarrolla sobre cerca de 2.5 millones de 
hect&#225;reas, principalmente en los departamentos de Alto Paran&#225;, Itap&#250;a, Canindey&#250; y 
Caaguaz&#250;. La producci&#243;n de la soya se ha extendido r&#225;pidamente en las &#250;ltimas d&#233;cadas, 
multiplic&#225;ndose por m&#225;s de cuatro la superficie cultivada entre 1991 y 2008 y 
concentr&#225;ndose 87 por ciento la producci&#243;n en explotaciones de m&#225;s de 100 hect&#225;reas. La 
mayor&#237;a de la producci&#243;n de soja se realiza en monocultivos industrializados con fines de 
exportaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>166. En el cultivo de la soja se har&#237;a supuestamente un uso intensivo de herbicidas, cuya 
aplicaci&#243;n infringir&#237;a con frecuencia las normas jur&#237;dicamente establecidas. Entre las 
normas que ser&#237;an ignoradas se encuentran las referentes a las franjas de seguridad para 
proteger a las poblaciones; las barreras vivas destinadas a minimizar la deriva de los 
agroqu&#237;micos; las franjas de bosque destinadas a proteger cuerpos de agua; y el aviso 
previo para las fumigaciones a&#233;reas. Asimismo, se reporta que el uso frecuente de 
variedades de soja transg&#233;nicas resistentes a herbicidas fomentar&#237;a una aplicaci&#243;n excesiva 
de &#233;stos. En particular, la variedad de soja <i>Roundup Ready, </i>producida por la empresa 
Monsanto, estar&#237;a ligada a un uso extendido de herbicidas con glisofato como su agente 
activo. 
</p>
<p>167. Se alega tambi&#233;n que el uso intensivo de herbicidas ha conducido a numerosos casos 
de intoxicaciones agudas y cr&#243;nicas en las comunidades colindantes a los campos de soja. 
Actualmente no existir&#237;a ning&#250;n seguimiento sistem&#225;tico de las intoxicaciones cr&#243;nicas, 
cuyas manifestaciones incluir&#237;an cefaleas, n&#225;useas, conjuntivitis, problemas 
dermatol&#243;gicos, dificultades respiratorias y trastornos nerviosos, convulsiones, esterilidad, 
anemia apl&#225;sica, c&#225;ncer, neurotoxicidad y afecciones a la descendencia. Seg&#250;n se informa, 
una intoxicaci&#243;n por agroqu&#237;micos habr&#237;a sido la causa de la reciente muerte de 12 
ind&#237;genas Mby&#8217;a entre junio y septiembre de 2009. 
</p>
<p>168. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, seria com&#250;n que los sembrad&#237;os de soja se 
encuentren a poca distancia de las escuelas rurales. Al no respetarse las franjas m&#237;nimas de 
seguridad o las barreras protectoras, las fumigaciones constantes alrededor de las escuelas 
pondr&#237;an en riesgo la salud de los alumnos y afectar&#237;an, por lo tanto, su acceso a la 
educaci&#243;n. En algunas escuelas rurales se reportan casos recurrentes de cefaleas entre los 
alumnos. </p>

la entrada en vigor del decreto 1937/09, &#8220;Por el cual se establecen medidas sanitarias para 
el uso adecuado de plaguicidas en la producci&#243;n agropecuaria&#8221;, que concentraba en una 
sola norma diversas disposiciones relativas al uso de plaguicidas, supuestamente 
simplificando su cumplimiento y vigilancia. Por otro lado, el Congreso habr&#237;a aprobado la 
Ley &#8220;De control de productos fitosanitarios de uso agr&#237;cola&#8221;, la cual transferir&#237;a 
atribuciones de vigilancia del Ministerio de Salud P&#250;blica y la Secretar&#237;a del Ambiente al 
Servicio Nacional de Calidad y Sanidad Vegetal y de Semillas, presuntamente socavando la 
capacidad p&#250;blica para controlar los efectos de los agroqu&#237;micos sobre la salud humana.  
</p>
<p>170. De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, el 6 de noviembre de 2009 las 
comunidades ind&#237;genas Ka&#8217;agy Roky, Loma Tajy, Formosa, Ka&#8217;aty Miri, Ysati y Ka&#8217;a Poty 
&#8211; pertenecientes al pueblo Av&#225; Guaran&#237; en Alto Paran&#225; &#8211; habr&#237;an sufrido un intento de 
desalojo. Las seis comunidades con sus 140 habitantes habr&#237;an resistido el intento de 
desalojo dirigido por fuerzas policiales y la fiscal Mar&#237;a Raquel Fern&#225;ndez, quien contaba 
con una orden de desalojo por invasi&#243;n de inmueble. M&#225;s tarde el mismo d&#237;a, un avi&#243;n 
fumigador habr&#237;a rociado directamente sobre las casas de las comunidades con pesticidas 
normalmente utilizados en cultivos de soja. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, la operaci&#243;n 
a&#233;rea habr&#237;a sido realizada por parte de productores brasile&#241;os<b> </b>supuestamente para 
intimidar las comunidades ind&#237;genas a dejar sus tierras. Las comunidades estar&#237;an en 
conflicto con los productores de soja brasile&#241;os sobre 2 638 hect&#225;reas de tierra. Las 
fumigaciones se habr&#237;an llevado a cabo al mediod&#237;a en sitios donde no existen cultivos, con 
el pleno conocimiento de la presencia de las seis comunidades. M&#225;s de 200 personas 
habr&#237;an sido afectadas, reportando n&#225;useas y desmayos, entre otros s&#237;ntomas. Al menos 
siete personas habr&#237;an sido trasladadas al hospital por presentar cuadros graves.   
</p>
<p>171. Finalmente, el<b> </b>Instituto Nacional del Ind&#237;gena (INDI) habr&#237;a presentado una

<p>173. El conjunto de comunidades habita en su territorio ancestral, en finca titulada en 
nombre del Instituto Paraguayo del Ind&#237;gena (INDI), inscripta como finca N&#186; 1584 del 
Distrito de Itakyry, adquirida del Sr. Manglio Vicente Medina C&#225;ceres, en el a&#241;o 1996 y la 
finca N&#186; 1709, del Distrito de Itakyry, adquirida del Sr. Francisco Gustavo Vargas Aguayo, 
en el a&#241;o 1997, del Distrito de Itakyry. Ambas fincas tienen en total una superficie de 2638 
Hect&#225;reas y se hallan ubicadas a 45 kil&#243;metros de la l&#237;nea de frontera con Brasil. El INDI es 
el &#243;rgano p&#250;blico encargado de la pol&#237;tica ind&#237;gena. 
</p>
<p>174. El Instituto Nacional de Desarrollo Rural y de la Tierra (INDERT) manifiesta que 
los alegatos presentados seg&#250;n experiencia y conocimiento de las diferentes situaciones de 
las poblaciones campesinas e ind&#237;genas aleda&#241;as a los cultivos de soja en general, son muy 
pr&#243;ximos. Sobre este caso espec&#237;fico, se considera que debe haber exactitud, porque los 
diferentes informes emitidos tienen coincidencias.   </p>

</p>
<p>175. Las investigaciones sobre el hecho se est&#225;n realizando ante el Juzgado mencionado 
se ha presentado formal imputaci&#243;n en contra del ciudadano brasile&#241;o Alair Alfonso, por el 
supuesto hecho punible de trasgresi&#243;n de la Ley N&#186; 716/96, Maltrato de Suelos, 
Comercializaci&#243;n y Uso no autorizado de sustancias qu&#237;micas y producci&#243;n de Riesgos 
Comunes, causa a cargo del Agente Fiscal de la Unidad Especializada en Hechos Punibles 
contra el Medio Ambiente de la Regi&#243;n 2 de Alto Paran&#225;.  
</p>
<p>176. Actualmente, el Ministerio de Salud Publica y Bienestar Social, forma parte del 
equipo intersectorial, conformado por entidades estatales y no gubernamentales  y gremios 
involucrados a la producci&#243;n agropecuaria que estudia la reglamentaci&#243;n de la Ley 3742/09 
&#8220;De control de Productos Fitosanitarios de Uso Agr&#237;cola&#8221;.  Esta labor est&#225; coordinada por 
el SENAVE, Servicio Nacional de Calidad y Sanidad Vegetal y de Semillas. 
</p>
<p>177. Respecto a la informaci&#243;n telef&#243;nica que obtuvo el INDI sobre el problema 
suscitado,  desde la primera comunicaci&#243;n de los l&#237;deres comunitarios, particularmente del 
l&#237;der Ignacio Gauto, los hechos ocurrieron como consecuencia de que los ind&#237;genas se 
defendieron contra un desalojo dirigido por los propietarios oponentes a los derechos del 
INDI sobre las tierras, y en base a un oficio de la Agente Fiscal Mar&#237;a Raquel Fern&#225;ndez, la 
que hab&#237;a sido recusada por los abogados del INDI y los ind&#237;genas, y en consecuencia, el 
desalojo suspendido.  Como parte de este informe se incluyen los antecedentes del 
problema judicial existente sobre supuestas superposiciones de fincas.  
</p>
<p>178. El Estado Paraguayo adquiri&#243; dichas tierras, tituladas provisoriamente  en nombre 
del INDI, a fin de cumplir con los derechos reconocidos a las comunidades ind&#237;genas, tanto 
en la Constituci&#243;n de la Rep&#250;blica, como en la Ley 904, Estatuto de las Comunidades 
Ind&#237;genas, y los instrumentos internacionales ratificados. No fue posible realizar la 
transferencia de las tierras a las comunidades ya que muy pronto surgieron las amenazas de 
sus vecinos brasile&#241;os dedicados al cultivo extensivo de soja. Grandes sojales rodean a las 
cinco comunidades, cuyas tierras se ven alteradas y sus arroyos da&#241;ados.    
</p>
<p>179. Desde hace varios a&#241;os, el INDI ha venido sosteniendo un largo proceso judicial, 
por problemas de catastro. En todo este tiempo, los propietarios brasile&#241;os vienen alegando 
que las tierras son suyas, neg&#225;ndose a reconocer los derechos de propiedad del INDI y 
negando que dichas tierras constituyan  parte del territorio ancestral de las comunidades 
Ava Guaran&#237;.  Por esta raz&#243;n, el INDI ha promovido varios juicios y cuenta a su favor con 
una Mensura Judicial aprobada por Sentencia N&#186; 848 del 21 de Noviembre de 2007, y con 
una Medida Cautelar de No Innovar del Juez Hugo Becker, prove&#237;do en el a&#241;o 2009.  A 
pesar de ello, los ind&#237;genas vienen soportando constantemente los asedios procesales y 
amenazas de todo orden de parte de los inversionistas brasile&#241;os, y sufriendo los efectos de 
pesticidas destinados al cultivo extensivo de soja.  
</p>
<p>180. El d&#237;a 6 de Noviembre de 2009, fue formulada una grave denuncia por los l&#237;deres de 
las comunidades, la que daba cuenta de que dichas tierras hab&#237;an sufrido el efecto de un 
extra&#241;o producto lanzado desde una avioneta. La reacci&#243;n del Instituto Paraguayo del 
Ind&#237;gena fue inmediata, presentando un informe al Ministerio P&#250;blico, a fin de que dicho 
&#243;rgano realice una investigaci&#243;n para precautelar la seguridad y el  respeto a los derechos 
humanos de las comunidades ind&#237;genas. Al mismo tiempo, emit&#237;a un comunicado a la 
prensa sobre tal hecho proveniente de particulares contra los ind&#237;genas.   
</p>
<p>181. Ante la denuncia planteada, el Poder Ejecutivo (Presidencia de la Rep&#250;blica), 
dispuso el traslado de una Comitiva de Alto Nivel, al lugar ubicado a seis horas por tierra 
desde la capital, a fin de verificar la denuncia de los ind&#237;genas, y obtener mayor 
informaci&#243;n sobre los responsables de tal hecho, y mostrar un claro mensaje de apoyo y de 
seguridad a las comunidades ind&#237;genas y a las actividades del INDI en su lucha por la 
defensa legal de las tierras, tituladas por el INDI, y en conflicto judicial con inversionistas 
brasile&#241;os.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>33 
</b></p>
<p>182. En cumplimiento de esta decisi&#243;n, el d&#237;a 7 de Noviembre de 2009, la Presidenta del 
INDI se traslad&#243;  a Itakyry en compa&#241;&#237;a de una Comitiva del Poder Ejecutivo, integrada por 
representantes ministeriales: La Ministra de Salud P&#250;blica, el Ministro de la Secretar&#237;a 
Nacional del Ambiente, SEAM, el Ministro de la Secretar&#237;a de Acci&#243;n Social,  el 
Viceministro de Asuntos Pol&#237;ticos del Ministerio del Interior, la Ministra de la Secretar&#237;a de 
la Ni&#241;ez y la Adolescencia, acompa&#241;ados de sus asesores. A esta Comitiva se sumaron 
representantes de la Organizaci&#243;n Pojoaj&#250;, la que nuclea a varias organizaciones no 
gubernamentales, as&#237; como representantes de la ONG Ambientalista Alter-Vida. A la 
comitiva acompa&#241;aron destacados periodistas de la prensa televisiva, oral y escrita. 
</p>
<p>183. Los representantes del Poder Ejecutivo, y en particular el INDI, han sido los 
primeros en denunciar el abuso cometido contra las comunidades, ante los &#243;rganos de 
justicia competentes. As&#237; mismo, el Estado ha tomado todas las medidas conducentes al 
bienestar de las comunidades afectadas. Tales medidas y obras se detallan en p&#225;ginas 
siguientes.   
</p>
<p>184. A la  llegada al lugar donde estaban esperando los l&#237;deres ind&#237;genas y los miembros 
de las comunidades, se realiz&#243; un Aty &#8211; Guaz&#250; (Gran Reuni&#243;n). En la ocasi&#243;n, los 
ind&#237;genas hicieron un relato pormenorizado de todo lo acontecido, y las autoridades 
manifestaron su inter&#233;s de verificar la situaci&#243;n a fin de hacer respetar los derechos 
humanos de las familias ind&#237;genas. Para el efecto, la comitiva  realiz&#243; un recorrido a todos 
los lugares, tales como el terreno sobre el cual se realiz&#243; el sobrevuelo del avi&#243;n; el 
cementerio y otros sitios identificados por los propios ind&#237;genas. Luego de este recorrido se 
realiz&#243; una &#250;ltima reuni&#243;n, donde se acordaron las pautas a seguir y los ind&#237;genas 
entregaron un listado de sus necesidades. 
</p>
<p>185. La Secretar&#237;a del Ambiente (SEAM) manifiesta que se puede afirmar que la mayor&#237;a 
de los hechos son ciertos, aunque no as&#237; cuanto sigue: lo establecido en la p&#225;gina 2, 5&#176; 
p&#225;rrafo, pues tras el veto parcial dado por el Presidente Lugo, a la Ley 3742 &#8220;De Control de 
Productos Fitosanitarios de uso agr&#237;cola&#8221; fueron derogados los art&#237;culos donde se atribu&#237;an 
al SENAVE funciones del Ministerio de Salud P&#250;blica y Bienestar Social y la SEAM.  
Considera que es impreciso hablar de herbicidas ya que en el pa&#237;s en los cultivos extensivos 
se aplican diferentes tipos de plaguicidas, no solo herbicidas. 
</p>
<p>186. En cuanto a las medidas que se han adoptado para solucionar el problema del uso 
intensivo de herbicidas cerca de las poblaciones, el Gobierno informa que para la Secretaria 
del Ambiente al Servicio Nacional de Calidad y Sanidad Vegetal y de Semillas (SENAVE) 
manifiesta que en referencia a estos hechos t&#233;cnicos de esta instituci&#243;n realizaron un 
procedimiento t&#233;cnico en la comunidad ind&#237;gena del distrito de Itakyry a los efectos de 
inspeccionar las fincas agr&#237;colas colindantes y corroborar el cumplimiento de las 
disposiciones legales vigentes.   
</p>
<p>187. El Ministerio de Salud dispone de un protocolo para la investigaci&#243;n de intoxicaci&#243;n 
por plaguicidas que es utilizado a nivel nacional y que est&#225; basado en los procedimientos 
internacionales. En otro orden,  el Ministerio, forma parte del equipo intersectorial, 
conformado por entidades estatales y no gubernamentales  y gremios involucrados a la 
producci&#243;n agropecuaria que estudia la reglamentaci&#243;n de la Ley 3742/09 <i>&#8220;De control de 
Productos Fitosanitarios de Uso</i> <i>Agr&#237;cola&#8221;</i>.  Esta labor est&#225; coordinada por el SENAVE, 
Servicio Nacional de Calidad y Sanidad Vegetal y de Semillas   
</p>
<p>188. Al respecto, han intensificados los monitoreos de producciones agr&#237;colas extensivas 
ubicados en torno a comunidades ind&#237;genas y campesinas de manera a verificar el 
cumplimiento de medidas de mitigaci&#243;n. Como resultado de los monitoreos hechos desde la 
segunda quincena de noviembre de 2009 hasta fines de enero de 2010, se han  intervenido 
cerca de 50 fincas agr&#237;colas en los Departamentos de Alto Paran&#225;, San Pedro, Caaguaz&#250;, 
Caazap&#225; y Canindey&#250; que incumplen con las medidas de mitigaci&#243;n necesarias para </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>34</b>  
</p>
<p>impedir que derivas de herbicidas y otros plaguicidas lleguen a poblaciones cercanas. 
Muchas de estas fincas intervenidas ya cuentan con sumarios abiertos. 
</p>
<p>189. Para la SNNA, bien se describen en las alegaciones las denuncias realizadas por el 
INDI, ante &#8220;Personas Innominadas&#8221; por la comisi&#243;n de los hechos punibles de Lesi&#243;n 
Grave y Coacci&#243;n Grave; y otra presentada por Delitos Ambientales, en el caso de Itakyry, 
y el Gobierno sugere remitirse al informe del INDI.   
</p>
<p>190. Desde la SNNA se ha acompa&#241;ado a la Comunidad de Campo Aguae, del Pueblo 
Av&#225; Guaran&#237; del Distrito de Curuguaty Dpto. De Canindeyu, donde aproximadamente 60 
familias son afectadas por el monocultivo de soja, las fumigaciones con agrot&#243;xicos, y la 
contaminaci&#243;n de fuentes de agua (nacientes y arroyos), incluso los pobladores denuncian 
la muerte de ni&#241;os antes de nacer y reci&#233;n nacidos. Esta Secretar&#237;a ha visitado el lugar en 
varias ocasiones, se ha apoyado a los pobladores con denuncias ante la Secretar&#237;a del 
Ambiente (SEAM) y la Fiscal&#237;a de Curuguaty del mismo Departamento. Las &#250;ltimas 
informaciones de la zona hacen referencia a que la fiscal&#237;a se ha constituido en el lugar y 
han constatado las irregularidades de los cultivos, la falta de barrera viva y la proximidad 
de los cultivos y fumigaciones de la poblaci&#243;n. Desde la SNNA se ha participado tambi&#233;n 
de reuniones y asambleas con la Coordinadora de V&#237;ctimas de Agrot&#243;xicos desde donde se 
han aportados datos e informaciones con relaci&#243;n a este tipo de hechos. Este espacio es 
coordinado por organizaciones campesinas, organizaciones barriales urbanas, movimientos 
sociales, comunidades ind&#237;genas y es apoyado por ONGs. Si bien este espacio se ha 
constituido requiere de mayor visibilidad y apoyo por parte de las instituciones p&#250;blicas y 
privadas, desde la SNNA se ha planteado en varias ocasiones crear una Mesa 
Interinstitucional de atenci&#243;n de V&#237;ctimas por Agrot&#243;xicos pero esta iniciativa no ha 
tomado impulso.  
</p>
<p>191. En cuanto al cumplimiento de las normas para la protecci&#243;n de las personas y el 
medio ambiente del uso de herbicidas, el Gobierno informa que conforme al mandato de la 
Ley 2459/04, uno de los objetivos generales del SENAVE es la de controlar los insumos de 
uso agr&#237;cola sujetos a regulaci&#243;n conforme a normas vigentes legales. En el &#225;mbito 
administrativo el SENAVE a procedi&#243; a notificar a aquellos propietarios que incumplen 
con las medidas establecidas en las reglamentaciones vigentes, para dicho cumplimiento de 
establece al infractor un plazo de manera a implementar las medidas correctivas. En el caso 
de no dar cumplimiento a lo dispuesto el SENAVE denuncia el hecho a la Fiscal&#237;a de 
Medio Ambiente. 
</p>
<p>192. El Ministerio de Salud Publica y Bienestar Social a trav&#233;s de  la Direcci&#243;n General 
de Vigilancia de la Salud lleva a cabo la coordinaci&#243;n de otras direcciones ministeriales, 
para la realizaci&#243;n y conclusi&#243;n de los estudios epidemiol&#243;gicos resultantes de los casos 
sospechosos de intoxicaci&#243;n por agroqu&#237;micos que se extienden por gran parte del territorio 
paraguayo. Acerca de los acontecimientos sobre la supuesta fumigaci&#243;n sobre las 
poblaciones ind&#237;genas de Alto Paran&#225;, el mismo d&#237;a de la denuncia, las primeras atenciones 
fueron realizadas por personal de salud de Itakyry y la intendencia municipal quienes 
derivaron a seis personas para su evaluaci&#243;n al Hospital Regional con asiento en Ciudad del 
Este donde se procedi&#243; a la toma de muestras de sangre que fueron remitidas para su 
procesamiento a laboratorios privados de esa ciudad. Posteriormente, las comunidades 
fueron visitadas por m&#233;dicos y enfermeras de esa Regi&#243;n Sanitaria y al d&#237;a siguiente por 
profesionales de la Direcci&#243;n General de Asistencia a Grupos Vulnerables del Ministerio de 
Salud y personal del Centro Nacional de Toxicolog&#237;a, quien obtuvo muestras que fueron 
derivadas a un laboratorio privado de la ciudad de Asunci&#243;n por disposici&#243;n de la Fiscal&#237;a 
del Medio Ambiente de ese distrito a cargo del Abogado Gustavo Sosa. Por otra parte, la 
Direcci&#243;n General de Sanidad Ambiental, realizo los estudios t&#233;cnicos de las fuentes de 
agua para consumo y aseo, entre otros,  utilizadas por las comunidades afectadas. De 
acuerdo con las conclusiones alcanzadas por esa dependencia conjuntamente con la </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>35 
</b></p>
<p>Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales de la Universidad Nacional de Asunci&#243;n, las 
fuentes utilizadas para las necesidades b&#225;sicas carecen de protecci&#243;n sanitaria adecuada, 
por lo que se hayan expuestas a factores de riesgo, entre ellos el uso de plaguicidas. Por lo 
tanto, las mismas no re&#250;nen las condiciones m&#237;nimas requeridas que aseguren el acceso al 
agua segura para el consumo humano.   
</p>
<p>193. El encargado es el Ministerio P&#250;blico a trav&#233;s de sus Unidades Especializadas en 
Hechos Punibles contra el Medio Ambiente, quienes promueven la acci&#243;n penal a trav&#233;s de 
sus denuncias, o a partir del conocimiento por cualquier medio fehaciente de la comisi&#243;n de 
alg&#250;n hecho punible contra el Medio Ambiente. Las sanciones a dichos hechos punibles se 
encuentran previstas en el C&#243;digo Penal Paraguayo, y en las diferentes leyes ambientales, 
como ser la Ley 716/96, siendo una de las sanciones la pena privativa de libertad. 
</p>
<p>194. La SEAM lleva a cabo fiscalizaciones e intervenciones a los efectos de certificar si 
cumplen con las normativas vigentes; en los casos en que se detecten inobservancias a las 
normativas, se procede a las instrucciones de sumarios administrativos donde los 
sumariados tienen derecho a presentar sus descargos correspondientes y en caso de 
determinarse las infracciones pueden aplicarse sanciones desde multas, suspensiones 
temporales y/o cancelaciones de Licencia y la reparaci&#243;n del da&#241;o ambiental cometido as&#237; 
como otras medidas de mitigaci&#243;n y/o remediaci&#243;n. En los casos en que observe la posible 
comisi&#243;n de hechos punibles (delitos ambientales) se procede a relevar inmediatamente 
todos los antecedentes al ministerio p&#250;blico a los efectos que se inicie la investigaci&#243;n 
pertinente (esto puede darse durante intervenci&#243;n, fiscalizaci&#243;n, durante el sumario o a la 
culminaci&#243;n del sumario) 
</p>
<p>195. En cuanto a los mecanismos de vigilancia que se han puesto en marcha para dar 
seguimiento y atender casos de intoxicaciones agudas y cr&#243;nicas producidas por 
agroqu&#237;micos, el gobierno informa que el Ministerio de Salud P&#250;blica se encuentra en la 
fase de recolecci&#243;n de datos sobre los casos espec&#237;ficos relativos a estos efectos y sus 
consecuencias en la salud de las poblaciones afectadas por la cercan&#237;a de las plantaciones 
de soja que utilizan herbicidas.  En cuanto a los an&#225;lisis laboratoriales practicados a las 
poblaciones afectadas, en general se recurre a laboratorios privados, ya que no se cuenta 
con la tecnolog&#237;a para an&#225;lisis espec&#237;ficos. 
</p>
<p>196. El Servicio Nacional de Calidad y Sanidad Vegetal y de Semillas ( SENAVE) en el 
marco de sus atribuciones y como &#243;rgano de aplicaci&#243;n de la Ley 123/91, contempla el 
control sobre el manejo y uso de agroqu&#237;micos en el tratamiento de cultivos, dentro de ese 
contexto, se realiza la aplicaci&#243;n del Decreto 2048/04 &#8220; Por la cual se reglamenta el uso y 
manejo de plaguicidas de uso agr&#237;cola establecido en la Ley 123/91, la Resoluci&#243;n N&#186; 
485/03 &#8220;Por la cual se establecen medidas para el uso correcto de plaguicidas en la 
producci&#243;n agropecuaria&#8221;, esta llevando a cabo   fiscalizaciones a nivel de campo de 
manera a notificar a aquellos productores que no cumplen con estas reglamentaciones a fin 
de evitar posibles contaminaciones por deriva a terceros.  
</p>
<p>197. Sobre el hecho si se han llevado a cabo estudios espec&#237;ficos para recolectar y 
analizar informaci&#243;n sobre los supuestos efectos nocivos a la salud de las personas y al 
medio ambiente producidos por el uso intensivo de agroqu&#237;micos en los campos de soja, el 
Gobierno informa que en los  procedimientos de campo realizados, constatamos de acuerdo 
a las evidencias agron&#243;micas, como ser tipo de productos aplicados, mecanismos de 
aplicaci&#243;n de plaguicidas, realizamos las notificaciones correspondientes  para  la 
implementaci&#243;n de las medidas correctivas seg&#250;n lo establecido en las disposiciones legales 
vigentes. 
</p>
<p>198. La fiscalizaci&#243;n realizada no tiene alcance de la comprobaci&#243;n de hechos derivados 
en da&#241;os medio ambientales, incluyendo la salud humana y animales, siendo estas 
afirmaciones competencias de otras entidades del estado. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>36</b>  
</p>
<p>199. Los afectados directos reciben la atenci&#243;n de las diferentes unidades sanitarias 
distribuidas por todo el pa&#237;s, siendo uno de los objetivos el registro de los diagn&#243;sticos 
m&#233;dicos relacionados con los efectos del uso de estos qu&#237;micos. Por otra parte, el 
Ministerio de Salud, ha convenido la tarea de expertos de la OPS que asesoran a la cartera 
sobre planes y estrategias relativos a las consecuencias que esta pr&#225;ctica produce en la salud 
humana. 
</p>
<p>200. No se cuenta con estudios espec&#237;ficos sobre los efectos nocivos al medio ambiente 
realizados por la SEAM. En ciertos casos, como en el de la presunta aplicaci&#243;n v&#237;a a&#233;rea de 
agroqu&#237;micos sobre comunidades ind&#237;genas de Itakyry, uno de los agentes fiscales 
presentes expres&#243; que tomaron muestras de agua y aparentemente tambi&#233;n de suelo para su 
posterior an&#225;lisis y utilizaci&#243;n como pruebas por parte de la fiscal&#237;a.  
</p>
<p>201. Sobre el hecho si se ha consultado a las comunidades afectadas y a expertos 
independientes sobre la expansi&#243;n del cultivo industrial de la soja, el gobierno informa que 
en la comunidad ind&#237;gena denominada KA AGUY ROKY, se realizo la primera 
verificaci&#243;n, en un primer momento encontramos una barrera en el que los nativos 
imped&#237;an paso a dicha comunidad. Nos acercamos al sitio en el que se encontraban 
apostados, para poder dialogar con ellos y expresarles el motivo de nuestra visita al lugar, 
mantuvimos conversaci&#243;n con el representante del grupo, el lider encargado Edelmiro 
Orrego, quien nos permiti&#243; el paso junto con representantes de la Secretaria del Ambiente a 
los efectos de proceder a la investigaci&#243;n de la causa de supuesta mala utilizaci&#243;n de 
plaguicidas. Es la metodolog&#237;a que com&#250;nmente utilizamos para proceder a atender a casos 
relacionados con comunidades ind&#237;genas.  
</p>
<p>202. El Gobierno informa que la Secretar&#237;a de la Ni&#241;ez y Adolescencia (SNNA) a trav&#233;s 
de la Regional de Alto Paran&#225; viene desarrollando acciones de desarrollo comunitario con 
los Pobladores de la Comunidad Ysat&#238; de los Mbya Guaran&#237; de Itakyry, una de las 
comunidades afectadas, por medio de los referentes de esta comunidad se ha generado 
v&#237;nculos con los pobladores de las dem&#225;s comunidades, y son visitados peri&#243;dicamente por 
los t&#233;cnicos y abogados de la misma, brindando todo tipo de apoyo en el marco de la 
medida de no innovar impuesta por el Juzgado que entiende en la causa.  
</p>
<p>203. Al inicio de la gesti&#243;n jurisdiccional, los ind&#237;genas miembros de las comunidades de 
Itakyry, han sido los protagonistas, siendo consultados para todos los pasos del manejo del 
expediente. En realidad, los ind&#237;genas permanecieron en su tierra ancestral gracias a su 
activa participaci&#243;n en base a su  derecho  a la libre determinaci&#243;n.    
</p>
<p>204. Durante la crisis planteada se adhirieron a la gesti&#243;n del Poder Ejecutivo en la  
defensa de los derechos ind&#237;genas,  articulaciones como la Coordinadora por la Autonom&#237;a 
de los Pueblos Ind&#237;genas, CAPI, la que present&#243; por su propia iniciativa una denuncia ante 
el Ministerio P&#250;blico. As&#237; mismo, la Coordinadora de ONGs al Servicio de los Pueblos 
Ind&#237;genas emiti&#243; un pronunciamiento a favor de las comunidades.  En el mismo contexto se 
pronunciaron la Organizaci&#243;n <i>Pojoaj&#250; </i>y la ONG Ambientalista Alter-Vida. 
</p>
<p>205. El Gobierno informa que en varias constituciones de fiscalizadores ambientales de la 
SEAM, realizadas para atenci&#243;n de denuncias sobre uso masivo de plaguicidas en soja, en  
el &#250;ltimo semestre de 2009, se hicieron reuniones con los pobladores denunciantes de 
manera a escuchar las inquietudes de los mismos con relaci&#243;n al cultivo extensivo de soja y 
las implicancias de su expansi&#243;n. La SEAM adem&#225;s tiene previsto hacer en la segunda 
semana de febrero, reuniones en 4 comunidades campesinas  de Alto Paran&#225; que est&#225;n 
rodeadas por sojales.  
</p>
<p>206. Adem&#225;s, se han tenido conversaciones permanentes con organizaciones sociales, 
campesinas en particular, comunidades ind&#237;genas, organizaci&#243;n ind&#237;genas, en donde se han 
discutido como enfrentar las consecuencias del cultivo extensivo de la soja y como 
consecuencia de las mismas se han llevado a cabo fiscalizaciones. Es importante aclarar </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>37 
</b></p>
<p>que la legislaci&#243;n vigente exige a la SEAM el desarrollo de  audiencias publicas en los 
casos de actividades de gran envergadura ( 1.000 Ha en adelante).  
</p>
<p>207. Sobre las medidas que se han tomado para asegurar que las escuelas rurales est&#233;n 
protegidas de los efectos nocivos del uso de agroqu&#237;micos en los campos aleda&#241;os y 
proteger el derecho a la educaci&#243;n de los ni&#241;os de las zonas afectadas con el cultivo de la 
soja, el Gobierno informa que entre los d&#237;as 6 y 7 de noviembre de 2009, se registraron 454 
consultas de la poblaci&#243;n expuesta al hecho denunciado. Del total de personas asistidas, los 
cuadros cl&#237;nicos fueron evaluados como leve y moderados. Se identificaron a 151 personas 
con s&#237;ntomas agudos compatibles con la exposici&#243;n a sustancias qu&#237;micas irritantes de la 
piel y mucosas con repercusi&#243;n sobre los sistemas gastrointestinal y respiratorio. En 11 de

<p>210. Por iniciativa de la Direcci&#243;n General y Escolar B&#225;sica del Ministerio de Educaci&#243;n 
y Culto, con fecha de 28 de mayo del 2009, El Ministro de Educaci&#243;n y Cultura Dr. Luis 
Alberto Riart, remiti&#243; a la C&#225;mara de Senadores un pronunciamiento ante la perspectiva de 
aprobaci&#243;n del anteproyecto, entonces de Ley, &#8220;De control de Productos Fitosanitarios de 
Uso Agr&#237;cola&#8221;, donde expresa su rechazo a la aprobaci&#243;n de dicho anteproyecto; seg&#250;n 
consta en el p&#225;rrafo que se transcribe a continuaci&#243;n: &#8220;Haci&#233;ndonos eco de los efectos 
perniciosos de la vigencia de la ley para el pa&#237;s, y concretamente las familias y los escolares 
de las zonas rurales, queremos dejar sentado en forma suficiente nuestro rechazo a la ley 
&#8220;De control de productos Fitosanitarios de Uso Agr&#237;cola&#8221; sin que se den las garant&#237;as

</p>
<p>211. La creaci&#243;n de una comisi&#243;n inter-direcciones del MEC, que estudi&#243; y elabor&#243; en el 
a&#241;o 2009 una propuesta de Reglamento para regular los procesos de apertura, habilitaci&#243;n,

<p>212. La puesta en ejecuci&#243;n en el a&#241;o en curso del Proyecto &#8220; &#193;rea de Ambiente Sano y 
No Violencia&#8221;  dise&#241;ado y gestionado por la Direcci&#243;n General de Educaci&#243;n Inicial y 
Escolar B&#225;sica del MEC con la cooperaci&#243;n de UNICEF Paraguay.  
</p>
<p>213. La necesidad de contar con un &#225;rea espec&#237;fica de trabajo dentro del Ministerio de 
Educaci&#243;n y Cultura en funci&#243;n al medio ambiente y la no violencia del ni&#241;o y la ni&#241;a se 
hace primordial, pues  tanto investigaciones como datos estad&#237;sticos de los diferentes entes 
nacionales, as&#237; como las organizaciones de la sociedad civil, han venido denunciando 
sistem&#225;ticamente la ausencia del cumplimiento de los derechos del ni&#241;o y la ni&#241;a en la 
protecci&#243;n de su integridad f&#237;sica y mental. 
</p>
<p>214. El Ministerio de Educaci&#243;n y Cultura como ente regulador de las pol&#237;ticas 
educativas del pa&#237;s, es corresponsable de las acciones tendientes a mejorar los sistemas de 
protecci&#243;n de la infancia ya que el sujeto principal y fin de su existencia son los ni&#241;os y 
ni&#241;as que viven, conviven y se forman en las diferentes modalidades educativas que tiene a 
su cargo. Ubicar al ni&#241;o y la ni&#241;a como centro de sus acciones y la promoci&#243;n de sus 
derechos como norte, son indicadores de que arribamos por buen camino. 
</p>
<p>215. Por ende,  el proyecto  pretende profundizar en las pr&#225;cticas  pedag&#243;gicas  que 
lleven a  lograr la concientizaci&#243;n de los diferentes actores educativos  hacia el respeto de 
los derechos del ni&#241;o y la ni&#241;a, y el seguimiento y efectiva soluci&#243;n de los casos de 
maltratos detectados, en colaboraci&#243;n de los actores sociales a nivel departamental y local.  
</p>
<p>216. El proyecto se compone de tres &#225;reas de acci&#243;n diferenciadas: Difusi&#243;n, Asesor&#237;a y 
seguimientos a los casos de denuncia y Informaci&#243;n y capacitaci&#243;n a recursos humanos de

Secretaria Nacional de la Ni&#241;ez y la Adolescencia seg&#250;n la Ley N&#186; 1680 &#8220;C&#243;digo de la 
Ni&#241;ez y la Adolescencia&#8221;, y la articulaci&#243;n de acciones vinculadas a la protecci&#243;n de 
derechos, y en particular, el derecho a la educaci&#243;n de ni&#241;os/as y adolescentes. 
</p>
<p>218. En cuanto a las investigaciones iniciadas en relaci&#243;n con las fumigaciones del

Gobierno informa los tramites y procesos que se fueron gestionados.  
</p>
<p>219. Entre los d&#237;as 6 y 7 de noviembre de 2009, se registraron 454 consultas de la 
poblaci&#243;n expuesta al hecho denunciado. Del total de personas asistidas, los cuadros 
cl&#237;nicos fueron evaluados como leve y moderados. Se identificaron a 151 personas con 
s&#237;ntomas agudos compatibles con la exposici&#243;n a sustancias qu&#237;micas irritantes de la piel y

n&#250;mero de familias y personas con riesgo de exposici&#243;n. El resultado de este relevamiento 
es una totalidad de 91 familias con un total de 419 personas. 
</p>
<p>222. El 19 de noviembre, en cumplimiento al plan de seguimiento, se constituyo en el 
lugar un equipo del Ministerio de Salud, de la Direcci&#243;n General de Asistencia a Personas 
Vulnerables y otro del Hospital Distrital de Itakyry. En la oportunidad se realizaron 
entrevistas a los pobladores y se completaron las im&#225;genes con nuevos testimonios que 
tambi&#233;n fueron editados en la pel&#237;cula mencionada anteriormente. 
</p>
<p>223. Actualmente funciona en la zona una Unidad de Salud Familiar, USF, con la 
contrataci&#243;n de seis funcionarios: dos m&#233;dicos, dos licenciadas en enfermer&#237;a y dos 
enfermeras auxiliares. Asimismo se adquiri&#243; una camioneta 4 x 4 cero kil&#243;metro para el 
acceso a todas las comunidades. El punto focal de la atenci&#243;n de las poblaciones ind&#237;genas 
es el Centro de Salud de Itakyry. 
</p>
<p>224. El Instituto Paraguayo del Ind&#237;gena, INDI, present&#243; ante el Ministerio P&#250;blico una 
denuncia concreta sobre coacci&#243;n y uso indebido de pesticidas. Esa denuncia viene 
siguiendo su proceso en la Fiscal&#237;a. La Fiscal&#237;a es el &#243;rgano encargado de impulsar las 
denuncias presentadas. El Instituto Paraguayo del Ind&#237;gena ha contratado un Abogado 
especialista, quien se encuentra a cargo del expediente. 
</p>
<p>225. En fecha 7 noviembre de 2009, ante la denuncia de que 5 comunidades Ava guaran&#237;, 
del Departamento de Alto Paran&#225;, Distrito de Itakyry, hab&#237;an sido rociadas, desde una 
aeronave, aparentemente con agroqu&#237;micos, presuntamente por colonos brasile&#241;os 
afincados en tierras colindantes a las tierras que &#233;stos poseen, lo que produjo efectos 
inmediatos en los miembros de las comunidades, se constituyeron en el lugar los Ministros 
del Ambiente, de Salud P&#250;blica y Bienestar Social, de Acci&#243;n Social, de la Ni&#241;ez y la 
Adolescencia, y el Vice Ministro de Asuntos Pol&#237;ticos del Ministerio del Interior. El 
Ministro de la Secretar&#237;a del Ambiente, estuvo acompa&#241;ado por funcionarios de la 
Instituci&#243;n, entre los que se encontraban la Directora Adjunta de Fiscalizaci&#243;n Ambiental 
Integrada, Abog. Miriam Romero, el Director de Asesor&#237;a Jur&#237;dica, Abog, Juan Bautista 
Rivarola C&#225;ceres, la Asesora del Ministro, Ing. Patricia Sacco, entre otros. 
</p>
<p>226. El hecho se produjo el d&#237;a anterior debido a que los colonos solicitaron a la Fiscal&#237;a 
del Crimen el desalojo por la fuerza de las comunidades ind&#237;genas. Ante la intervenci&#243;n del 
INDI, que certific&#243; que dichas tierras se encuentran en litigio ante la Justicia en la 
Jurisdicci&#243;n Civil, y que sobre las mismas pesan medidas de no innovar de hecho y de 
derecho a favor de las comunidades, en virtud a la ley 43/89 &#8220;Que Establece el R&#233;gimen de 
Regularizaci&#243;n de los Asentamientos de las Comunidades Ind&#237;genas&#8221;, se frustr&#243; el 
procedimiento fiscal, creando una situaci&#243;n de alta tensi&#243;n entre los colonos brasile&#241;os y 
los ind&#237;genas, que deriv&#243; en la reacci&#243;n violenta por parte de los primeros. 
</p>
<p>227. En la constituci&#243;n realizada por el Ministro y los funcionarios de la SEAM, se 
constat&#243; a simple vista que las propiedades colindantes con la poligonal de las tierras que se 
encuentran en posesi&#243;n de las comunidades ind&#237;genas, no cumpl&#237;an con las normativas  
exigidas para la utilizaci&#243;n de agroqu&#237;micos en producci&#243;n agr&#237;cola y que sus cultivos 
llegaban a pocos metros de las viviendas de las poblaciones ind&#237;genas, no respetando los 
100 metros de franja de protecci&#243;n que establece la resoluci&#243;n MAG 485/03 que debe 
existir entre cultivos objetos de aplicaci&#243;n de plaguicidas y asentamientos humanos, as&#237; 
como tampoco los colonos brasile&#241;os implantaron barreras vivas en sus parcelas con 
cultivos agr&#237;colas objeto de aplicaci&#243;n de plaguicidas, incumplimiento as&#237; el decreto 
2.048/04; en todos los casos, los sojales llegaban hasta la vera del camino, no observ&#225;ndose </p>

</p>
<p>ninguna plantaci&#243;n que reuniese los requisitos legales de protecci&#243;n. El d&#237;a de la 
constituci&#243;n estuvo presente, aunque no acompa&#241;o todo el recorrido, el Fiscal de Delitos 
Ambientales de Alto Paran&#225;, Abog. Gustavo Sosa. 
</p>
<p>228. Durante el recorrido de las tierras en litigio, se constat&#243; vegetaci&#243;n quemada, 
presumiblemente a consecuencia de aplicaciones de herbicidas. Seg&#250;n opiniones de 
funcionarios del ministerio p&#250;blico, se tomaron horas antes de la presencia de t&#233;cnicos de la 
SEAM en el lugar, muestras de agua y aparentemente tambi&#233;n de suelo para su posterior 
an&#225;lisis y utilizaci&#243;n como pruebas por parte de la fiscal&#237;a. Por este motivo, las muestras 
tomadas por t&#233;cnicos de la Secretar&#237;a del Ambiente no fueron analizadas. 
</p>
<p>229. Los t&#233;cnicos de la SEAM escucharon el testimonio de varios l&#237;deres de la 
comunidad donde se ratificaban que hab&#237;a sido lanzada una sustancia l&#237;quida de color 
blanco, que inmediatamente produjo efectos de hinchaz&#243;n en los ojos, dolores de est&#243;mago, 
v&#243;mitos, dolores de cabeza, y otros s&#237;ntomas propios de la intoxicaci&#243;n. Todos los 
testimonios eran homog&#233;neos y concordantes. 
</p>
<p>230. En los d&#237;as posteriores (10, 11, 12 y 13 de noviembre de 2009), la Direcci&#243;n de 
Fiscalizaci&#243;n Ambiental Integrada de la SEAM, procedi&#243; a realizar un relevamiento de la 
zona y como consecuencia del mismo se pudo constatar el incumplimiento de normativas 
ambientales, por parte de los agricultores colindantes, tanto brasile&#241;os como paraguayos, 
adem&#225;s de observarse producci&#243;n ganadera y cultivos de soja dentro de las tierras en litigio. 
Ninguno de los agricultores monitoreados ten&#237;a Licencia Ambiental, salvo el se&#241;or Alair 
Alfonso quien dijo que su licencia estaba en tr&#225;mite, hecho que se pudo corroborar 
posteriormente.  
</p>
<p>231. Como consecuencia de las intervenciones hechas por la Direcci&#243;n de Fiscalizaci&#243;n 
Ambiental Integrada de la SEAM, se han instruido sumarios administrativos en la Asesor&#237;a 
Jur&#237;dica de la SEAM a varias personas y proporciona informaci&#243;n detallada de los tr&#225;mites 
y procedimientos judiciales en proceso. 
</p>
<p>232. Finalmente, el Gobierno informa de varias medidas adoptadas por el Estado y que 
para el INDERT, algunas medidas adoptadas para proteger la salud y seguridad  de la 
poblaci&#243;n aleda&#241;a a los campos de soja, son las capacitaciones realizadas para las medidas 
de protecci&#243;n que deben realizar los asentados, para exigir el cumplimiento de la 
legislaci&#243;n tal como las exigencias de las franjas verdes para la protecci&#243;n en linderos con 
los campos de soja. Gracias a esta capacitaci&#243;n y la presencia de organizaciones, 
aumentaron las denuncias y exigencias a los productores.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>234. On 7 August 2009, the Special Rapporteur, together with the independent Expert on 
Minorities Issues sent a communication concerning Romani children who are allegedly 
denied their right to education free from discrimination as they are placed in &#8220;special 
schools&#8221; or classes for children with mental disabilities (despite not having any mental 
disability), or are segregated in Roma-only schools or classes.  
</p>
<p>235. According to the information received Romani children were being denied their 
right to education as they were placed in &#8220;special schools&#8221; or classes for children with 
mental disabilities (despite not having any mental disability), or they were segregated in 
Roma-only schools or classes. In both cases they study a lower curriculum in virtual </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>41 
</b></p>
<p>isolation from other pupils. Sub-standard education reduces future employment prospects 
and further education opportunities for the children and further contributes to the 
marginalization and poverty of Romani people.  
</p>
<p>236. It was reported that in 2006, only three per cent of Romani children reached 
secondary school, while only eight per cent enrolled in secondary technical schools. 
Although some measures have been taken by the authorities, the most important being the 
new Education Act passed in 2008 that bans all forms of discrimination, particularly 
segregation, this ban was not accompanied by any effective measures to ensure that it is 
implemented in practice.  
</p>
<p>237. It was further alleged that Romani children come in the majority from &#8220;settlements&#8221; 
and are identified as students from &#8220;socially disadvantaged environment&#8221;. Because of their 
social status, they are perceived as children with special educational needs, alongside 
&#8220;students with disabilities&#8221;. It is mentioned that the government&#8217;s Policy on the Roma 
minority includes a goal to differentiate Romani children from students with disabilities, 
requiring special upbringing and education. The Education Act 2008, however, fails to 
include this important distinction. The lack of a clear definition further contributes to the 
confusion and leaves school placement of Romani children susceptible to discrimination. 
</p>
<p>238. It was reported that the decisions to place children in special schools are made at the 
age of entry to compulsory education. The majority of Romani children are put at an 
immediate disadvantage because they usually do not speak Slovak and have not had the 
benefit of pre-school education. The tests used for assessments in Slovakia have been 
criticized as not being culturally neutral, and not suitable for Romani children. Parents often 
agree with such a placement because they know their children will experience less rejection 
and stereotyping from their non-Romani peers, parents or teachers. The right to education, 
including a prohibition of discrimination and segregation in education, is enshrined in many 
international and regional human rights standards and treaties to which Slovakia is a state 
party. 
</p>
<p>239. The source mentioned a judgment issued in 2007, by the European Court of Human 
Rights which ruled in the case of D.H. and Others v. the Czech Republic that segregating 
Roma students into special schools is a form of unlawful discrimination according to the 
European Convention on Human Rights. The placement of a disproportionate number of 
Romani children in special schools has also been considered a practice of racial segregation 
by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. In its review of 
Slovakia, the Committee expressed concern &#8220;at de facto segregation of Roma children in 
special schools, including special remedial classes for mentally disabled children.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>240. It was finally alleged that there is no effective independent complaints mechanism in 
Slovakia that parents can easily access if, for instance, their children are inappropriately 
placed in special schools. The State School Inspectorate, mandated to process individual 
complaints and petitions, although independent in its activities, cannot issue sanctions 
related to segregation. Unlike similar bodies in neighboring countries, the Slovak National 
Centre for Human Rights does not have authority to investigate individual complaints, to 
initiate its own investigations, or to recommend remedies in individual cases of violations 
of the right to education. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>241. By letter dated 5 October 2009, the Government informed that it disagreed with the 
statements stipulated in the communication sent, claiming that Roma children were being 
placed in special schools unreasonably or grounds of ethnicity.  
</p>
<p>242. The Government mentioned that the legal guardian of a child is obliged to sign the 
child up for compulsory school attendance in a primary school. The headmaster of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>42</b>  
</p>
<p>school will decide on admitting a child with special educational needs based on a written 
application y the legal guardian and a written opinion from the educational counselling and 
prevention facility. Before granting the child admission, the headmaster will inform the 
legal guardian about all the educational options available for his/her child. 
</p>
<p>243. Children and pupils are admitted to schools for children with health disabilities or 
pupils with health disabilities on the basis of their health disability with a view to 
determining their special educational needs. Naturally, multiple experts observe, assess and 
diagnose whether &#8220;clear signs of a mental handicap&#8221; are present or not: a physician, 
pedagogue, special pedagogue, psychologist, or therapeutic pedagogue. The written opinion 
of the educational counselling and prevention facility is drawn up with full responsibility 
after the consideration of all factors affecting the child&#8217;s psychological and personality 
development.  
</p>
<p>244. Furthermore, the Government informed that the details of the procedure by the 
acceptance of children and pupils to special schools are set out in the Decree of the 
Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic No. 322/2006 Coll. of 6 August 2008 on 
Special Schools, effective as of 1 September 2008.  
</p>
<p>245. Schools for children with health handicaps and pupils with health handicaps accept 
children or pupils with demonstrable health handicaps who, due to their health handicap 
cannot be successfully educated in a kindergarten or an elementary school, on the basis of 
diagnostic examinations with the consent of a parent or a natural person than the parent, 
who is the guardian or provides foster care to the child, on the basis of a court decision or 
with the consent of a representative of the facilities in which institutional care, educational 
measures, interim measure or protective education are provided.  
</p>
<p>246. Before the acceptance of a child or pupil with a health handicap into a school, the 
educational counselling and prevention facility shall perform a diagnostic examination of 
the pupil, which forms a part of the documentation considered in the decision on whether to 
accept the child or pupil to a school.  
</p>
<p>247. A child or pupil with a health handicap is accepted on the basis of his health 
handicap evidenced in a completed and confirmed form approved by the Ministry of 
Education of the Slovak Republic. This form also contains the report from the diagnostic 
examination with the determination of diagnosis, recommendations regarding the education 
and training of the child or pupil and for the child&#8217;s or pupil&#8217;s acceptance to or rejection 
from the respective school. A specialized physician for children and youth and a 
representative of the school founder may also be members of the acceptance commission.  
</p>
<p>248. The Government informed that a Test of Educational Capability of Socially 
Disadvantaged Children was developed, verified and standadised (April 2005) within the 
framework of the PHARE project (programme: Phare 2002/000.610-03, ECO; project: 
Phare SRO 103.01) entitled &#8220;Reintegration of Socially Disadvantaged Children from 
Special Schools into Standard Primary Schools&#8221;. It is a psychometric (screening and 
developmental) tool serving for objective and unbiased evaluation of the educational 
capability of children coming from a socially disadvantaged environment in order to ensure 
adequate consideration of their capabilities and realistic educational prospects. The test was 
developed by experts at the Research Institute for Child Psychology and Pathopsychology. 
The methodologies evolve and allow for increasing result precision.  
</p>
<p>249. Another reason for the higher proportion of children with mental handicaps among 
the Roma population, and the consequent higher numbers of Roma children placed in 
special schools, is the closed character of their communities, which causes a higher 
incidence of predispositions to transfer genes causing an unfavorable state of health of 
children, including mental disabilities. A vast majority of the children are placed in special 
schools legitimately. They are looked after by expert personnel (special pedagogues), </p>

<p>conditions exist for individual work (fewer children in one class), and the educational 
content is adequate to the pupils&#8217; capabilities. Pupils also have the possibility to acquire 
specialized education on a level corresponding to their abilities (certain study fields) 
</p>
<p>250. Only sporadic complaints are registered with regard to possible discrimination in the 
field of education. They mostly concern failures on the part of the relevant responsible staff 
of schools or school-founding authorities. However this should not be generalized as a 
structural failure of education system. In such cases, effective instruments exist in the form 
of school inspections and control carried out by the Regional School Authorities, which 
deal with individual cases. 
</p>
<p>251. Based on information from the Control Department of the Ministry of Education of 
the Slovak Republic (MoEdu) pertaining to the year 2008, it was discovered that four 
complaints concerned discrimination. Of the above, three complaints were related to 
discrimination on health-related grounds and inadequate treatment of pupils by pedagogue 
(emotional maltreatment, failure to observe procedures in the education of integrated 
pupils, humiliation and being offended in front of classmates). These were referred to the 
State School Inspection. One complaint concerned discrimination on ethnic grounds; the 
complaint was sent to the school-founding authority to make a decision. Since these 
complaints were referred to the competent authorities, the MoEdu Control Department did 
not assess as to whether they were justified or not.  
</p>
<p>252. The issue of placing Roma children in special schools was also the subject of a 
report by an NGO entitled &#8220;A Tale of Two Schools-Segregating Roma into Special 
Education in Slovakia&#8221;. The Regional School Office in Ko&#353;ice and the State School 
Inspection carried out controls in respect of the unjustified admittance of Roma pupils in 
the Primary Special School in Pavlovice nad Uhom. Conclusions were formulated and 
corrective action was taken. The Deputy Prime Minister of the Government for knowledge-
Based Society, European Affairs, Human Rights and Minorities, held two work meetings 
with the representatives of NGOs and other stakeholders, aimed at addressing the problem.  
</p>
<p>253. The Government considers the resolution of Roma issues as one of its priorities. The 
Government supports all development programs that aim to improve the life of Roma and 
the integration of the Roma community into society with an effective and target oriented 
use of sources in fields of education, culture, health and social care, infrastructure and 
housing. In the field of education, new laws, concepts and concrete measures have been 
adopted. In the field of the Roma issue in March 2008, the Government adopted the 
Medium-term Concept of Development of the Roma Ethnic Minority in the Slovak 
Republic SOLIDARITY-INTEGRITY-INCLUSION 2008-2013 (the &#8220;Medium-term 
Concept&#8221;), which is based on a analysis of previous government concepts. It defines current 
problems in the sphere of education, health, employment and housing and proposes relevant 
measures. The Government provided specific details on the Medium-term Concept and the 
measures proposed in the field of education of Roma children and pupils. One of the 
objectives of the concept is to lower the percentage of Roma children attending special 
elementary schools for pupils with mental disabilities.  
</p>
<p>254. The Government also informed that in May 2008 the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic adopted Act No.245/2008 Coll. on Education and Training (the School Act) and 
on amendments to certain acts. Pursuant to the School Act, education and training are based 
inter alia on the principle of prohibition of all forms of discrimination and especially of 
segregation. For the first time, children and pupils with special needs also include children 
and pupils from a socially disadvantaged environment. The Act defines theses as children 
and pupils living in an environment which, given its social, family, economic and cultural 
conditions, insufficiently stimulates the development of the mental facilities, including 
volitional and emotional capacities of the children and / or students, fails to encourage their </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>44</b>  
</p>
<p>socialization, and does not provide enough adequate stimuli for the development of their 
personality.  
</p>
<p>255. In order to provide for education pursuant to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child ( the task of general and local government bodies to establish conditions, under which 
children have equal access to education, with particular emphasis on groups disadvantaged 
in the educational system in view of their social and cultural specifics), and to the results of 
the PISA Studies (the level of education in the Slovak Republic in below the OECD 
average and it is strongly influenced by the socioeconomic background), help needed to be 
targeted and aimed at children from a socially disadvantaged environment.  
</p>
<p>256. If a child or pupil comes from a socially disadvantaged environment, systemic 
support of access to education is ensured (both in financial and institutional terms): free 
pre-school education starting from the age of 5, zero grades in primary schools, specialized 
classes in primary schools-a compensatory and development programme, a teacher 
assistant, a normative contribution per pupil coming from a socially disadvantaged 
environment, subsidies for meals and teaching aids, support for schools-development 
projects, the European Social Fund, etc. These measures are conceptual (the Concept of 
Upbringing and Education of Roma Children and Pupils Including the Development of 
Secondary and Tertiary Education approved by Government Resolution No. 206/2008) and 
address the reasons why Roma children are failing in primary schools and /or why they do 
not achieve educational capability.  
</p>
<p>257. At primary schools, a specialized class may be set up for pupils whose education 
requires a compensatory programme or a development programme and for pupils 
previously attending a school with as educational programme for pupils with health 
disabilities. Pupils are only assigned to the specialized class for the time necessary. No 
separate schools are set up for pupils from a socially disadvantaged environment.  
</p>
<p>258. The State School Inspection performs state oversight of the quality of pedagogical 
management, the quality of education and training, and the material and technical 
conditions, including practical teaching in schools and school facilities, in practical training 
centres, practical training facilities and in educational institutions. In the discharge of its 
functions, it monitors the compliance of the education and training programmes on the 
national and the school level with the training and education objectives and principles 
(including the observance of the prohibition of all forms of discrimination and segregation 
in particular), monitors and assesses the quality of education and training, and handles 
complaints and petitions. It submits regular annual report on the educational and training 
process to the Minister of Education.  
</p>
<p>259. On suspicion that the equal treatment principle in the educational and training 
process was violated on grounds of children and pupils belonging to the Roma ethnic 
group, a complaint may be filed with the Slovak National Centre for Human Rights. The 
centre offers free-of-charge legal assistance and consultancy with a view to addressing the 
problems related to the violation of the equal treatment principle. The observance of the 
equal treatment principle consist in the prohibition of discrimination on any grounds 
whatsoever and the exercise of rights and obligations in line with good morals, as well as 
the adoption of measures to protect against discrimination in accordance with the 
provisions of Act No. 365/2004 Coll. on equal treatment in certain areas and on the 
protection against discrimination (the &#8220;Anti-Discrimination Act&#8221;).

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>261. On 24 March 2009, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the 
right to non-discrimination in this context, the Independent Expert on the issue of human 
rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences sent an urgent 
communication regarding the revocation of licenses of 16 non-governmental organisations 
working in the region of Darfur, in Northern Sudan and in the Transitional Areas. Such a 
decision would have devastating consequences on the human rights of approximately 4.7 
million people affected by the conflict, particularly in the sectors of food, health, water, 
sanitation, adequate housing and education. Of this population approximately 2.7 million 
are internally displaced persons living in camps across the country.    
</p>
<p>262. According to the information received, on 5 March 2009, following the issuance of 
an arrest warrant against President Omar al-Bashir by the International Criminal Court, it 
was announced that the operations relating to humanitarian assistance and human rights 
work of these organisations were suspended. These organisations included 13 international 
non-governmental organisations, namely Action contre la Faim, Solidarit&#233;s, Save the 
Children UK and Save the Children US, M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res Holland and M&#233;decins 
sans Fronti&#232;res France, Care International, Oxfam GB, Mercy Corps, International Rescue 
Committee (IRC), Norwegian Refugee Council, Cooperative Housing Foundation and 
PADCO. In addition, the activities of three national organisations were also terminated, 
namely the Sudan Social Development Organization (SUDO), the Amel Centre for 
Treatment and Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence, and the Khartoum Centre for Human 
Rights. These 16 organisation employed nearly 6,500 national and international personnel, 
this constituting close to half of the workforce in Darfur. Eviction orders have reportedly 
been appealed (according to Sudanese law) by relief and humanitarian NGOs, while the 
closing down of local NGOs cannot be appealed according to the Humanitarian Act of 
</p><p>2006. Incidents of threats against NGO personnel were reported as well as systematic 
confiscation and seizure of property, including passports, computers, cars and confidential 
items, reportedly on the basis of an agreement signed by NGO personnel with the 
Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) stipulating that they have to hand their assets over to 
the State if they leave.  
</p>
<p>263. The impact would not only be limited to Darfur, but also the Three Transitional 
Areas and Eastern Sudan. According to estimates, 1.5 million beneficiaries no longer had 
access to health and nutrition services. Host and IDP populations were particularly affected. 
Water supply, sanitation and hygiene services provided by these NGOs to 1.16 million 
people have been interrupted (Blue Nile &#8211; 102,000; Eastern States &#8211; 50,000; and Darfur &#8211; 
1,007,000). Some 1.1 million people have stopped receiving general food distribution and 
the treatment of some 4,000 children for severe and moderate malnutrition over the next 
three months could be interrupted. In the Non-Food Item (NFI) and Emergency Shelter 
(ES) sector, 670,000 individuals are to be affected. Distributions of Non-Food Relief Items 
(which include cooking equipment and other basic household goods) and emergency shelter 
have ceased in 19 camps and locations in Darfur. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>46</b>  
</p>
<p>264. The longer term humanitarian consequences, such as depletion and shortages of food 
stocks and other assets and the upcoming rainy season, would reportedly have a serious 
impact on the ability of the communities concerned to have access to sufficient and 
adequate food.  
</p>
<p>265. On 8 March 2009, the decision to terminate the activities of the abovementioned 
organisations had started to show its effects. In some IDP camps in the Zalingei area, for 
example, the fuel for operation of the water pumps had begun to run low without an 
alternative option in place for its re-supply. Garbage had also started piling up inside these 
camps. Absence of water and a waste disposal system would have serious consequences on 
people&#8217;s health and nutrition. 
</p>
<p>266. Finally, disturbing reports of censorship, temporary newspaper suspensions, threats 
and arbitrary arrest and detention to prevent human rights defenders, journalists and 
members of opposition parties from freely expressing their opinions, were reported. 
Privately-owned print media reportedly continued to be subjected to daily censorship by 
officials of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) who may order the 
removal of any article from the following day&#8217;s paper. In response to the censorship there 
had been a number of protests by journalists. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations

<p>267. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received a reply from the Government 
regarding the above-mentioned communication.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>268. On 24 August 2009, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions sent a communication regarding the 
targeting and burning of schools, school closures, murder and mutilation of, and threats 
against, teachers and students in certain districts in Southern Thailand (Pattani, Yala, 
Narathiwat, and five districts of Songkhla). 
</p>
<p>269. According to the information received, for the past five years a separatist insurgency 
had raged in these four predominately Muslim provinces in Southern Thailand (Pattani, 
Yala, Narathiwat, and five districts of Songkhla). Security forces had allegedly struggled 
unsuccessfully to protect schools, teachers, and students against attacks by the insurgents 
with the result that schools had often been shut down in many districts or even entire 
provinces.  
</p>
<p>270. During the night of 4 January 2004, groups of separatist militants burned down 20 
government schools in Narathiwat in a series of near-simultaneous attacks. By 27 January 
2004, nearly 700 schools (out of the total 925) across the southern border provinces had to 
be shut down temporarily as a result of growing fears of insurgent attacks.  
</p>
<p>271. It was further reported that on 13 June 2007, militants burned down 11 schools in 
Yala province&#8217;s Raman district, apparently in retaliation for the murder of Abdulraman 
Sama, age 60, a respected Muslim religious teacher. More than 500 Muslim women and 
children blocked a highway in front of a mosque in Raman district in protest of his killing, 
accusing government security forces of responsibility. Fears of further reprisal attacks on 
schools led to the closure of 60 other schools. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>47 
</b></p>
<p>272. Over the past five years, there had also been many reported attacks on mosques and 
Muslim schools (ponoh). There had been no successful criminal investigations of these 
cases.  
</p>
<p>273. Separatist insurgents were increasingly attacking teachers. Since the beginning of 
the new school term in May 2009, five teachers had been killed by insurgents in the south. 
After each attack, schools in affected areas were closed down for security reasons. 
Hundreds of teachers have requested transfers from the region. On 19 May 2009, a teacher 
at Nikhom Pattana Park Tai School was reportedly shot dead as he was riding a motorcycle 
from his home to his school in Bannang Sta district of Yala province. On 2 June 2009, 
insurgents allegedly attacked a pickup truck transporting six teachers from their schools in 
Ja Nae district of Narathiwat province. Two Buddhist Thai teachers were singled out and 
killed: Atcharaporn Thepsorn, a teacher at Ban Dusung Ngor school who was eight months 
pregnant, and Warunee Navaka, a teacher at Ban Ri Nge School. 
</p>
<p>274. On 6 June 2009, insurgents killed Matohe Yama, a teacher at Ban Palukasamo in 
Bajoh district of Narathiwat province, and on 16 June 2009, insurgents shot dead Lekha 
Issara, a teacher at Ban Poh Maeng school, while she was riding on a motorcycle from 
home to work in Raman district of Yala province. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>275. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received a reply from the Government 
regarding the above-mentioned communication. 
</p>
<p><b>  United States of America 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>276. On 24 August 2009, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent a 
communication regarding the use of corporal punishment in public schools to discipline 
students with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>277. According to information received, corporal punishment is permitted in twenty 
states and hundreds of school districts allegedly make routine use of it to discipline pupils. 
It was alleged that the most common form of corporal punishment in these institutions is 
paddling, whereby students are repeatedly hit on the buttocks with a wooden board 
resembling a shaved-down baseball bat. Students have purportedly also been struck with 
other objects, such as rulers and toy hammers. Numerous reports of spanking, pinching, 
grabbing, bruising, beating and forceful restraint had also been received and must all 
equally be considered as corporal punishment. 
</p>
<p>278. Students with disabilities were allegedly subjected to corporal punishment at 
disproportionately high rates. Data received indicated that at least 41,972 students with 
disabilities received corporal punishment at least once in the 2006-2007 school year. The 
majority of these students are defined as disabled under the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act, while the remainder receive assistance under Section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act. The total number of pupils, with and without disabilities, subjected to 
this form of discipline in US public schools during the 2006-2007 school year was 223,190. 
Hence, students with disabilities made up 18.8 percent of those who received corporal 
punishment, despite constituting just 13.7 percent of the national student population. The 
figures were allegedly much higher in certain states and only reflect reported incidents. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>48</b>  
</p>
<p>279. Information received suggested that students with disabilities were frequently 
punished for behaviour related to their disabilities. Such practices may indicate that 
educators lack sufficient training on the nature of their pupils&#8217; disabilities and/or the best 
means by which to respond to possibly inappropriate behaviour related to these disabilities. 
In addition to causing immediate physical discomfort, numerous incidents of corporal 
punishment had allegedly resulted in lasting injuries and barriers to education. Students 
have been known to become angry, depressed and deeply reluctant to return to school 
following physical discipline in the classroom. Data received indicated that the threat of 
severe educational barriers was particularly high for children with disabilities whose 
medical conditions may be worsened as a direct consequence of corporal punishment. 
</p>
<p>280. Finally, it was alleged that parents are frequently not informed of the full extent of 
violence used against their children. Reporting was not mandated for many types of 
corporal punishment and school districts did not always choose to report incidents to the 
parents of a child that was physically disciplined. In the case of children with disabilities, 
the potential lack of information was higher as many children are unable to verbalise their 
experiences. Reports received suggested that parents who have attempted to engage in 
discussion with educators in response to violent discipline of their disabled child at school 
had often seen their concerns and complaints ignored. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>281. By letter dated 21 December 2009, the Government informed that in the United 
States, unless Federal law provides otherwise, education matters, including whether 
corporal punishment may be administered in schools, are considered to be matters 
controlled by State and local laws. In 1977, in Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651, 664, the 
U.S. Supreme Court rejected an argument that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against 
cruel and unusual punishment was applicable to corporal punishment inflicted by school 
administrators. The Court also held that a student's procedural due process rights are not 
violated by the administration of corporal punishment if the student has adequate post-
punishment remedies under State law. Id. at 672-80. Students who receive corporal 
punishment that is excessive or capricious may seek appropriate state-law criminal and civil 
relief. In addition, U.S. courts have recognized a constitutionally-protected interest of 
students to be free of corporal punishment that is excessive or arbitrary. Kirkland v. Greene 
County Board of Education, 347 F.3d 903 (11th Cir. 2003); P.B. v. Koch, 96 F.3d 1298 
(9th Cir. 1996); Moore v. Willis Independent School District, 233 F.3d 871 (5tn Cir. 2000); 
Saylor v. Board of Education of Harlan County, 118 F.3d 507 (6th Cir. 1997). 
</p>
<p>282. At the time of the Ingraham decision, only two of the 50 States prohibited corporal 
punishment in schools. Inrgaham, supra, at 662. Today, according to the Center for 
Effective Discipline, 30 States prohibit the use of corporal punishment in schools, while 20 
States still permit schools to administer corporal punishment in some form. Based on 
anecdotal information, within these States, some school districts have acted independently 
to prohibit corporal punishment in their schools, but we do not know how widespread these 
policies may be. For school year 1975-76, the U.S. Department of Education, based on a 
weighted sample of the nation's school districts made a statistical projection that 1,521,896 
children were subjected to corporal punishment in schools. For school year 2005-2006, the 
Department's statistical projection was that 223,190 children received corporal punishment 
in schools. Of the 223,190 projected to have received corporal punishment in schools in 
2005-2006, 41,972 were projected to be students with disabilities. Based on these data, in 
school year 2005-2006, approximately 0.63% of identified children with disabilities 
received corporal punishment. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>49 
</b></p>
<p>283. The Government further informed that it provides extensive protections for the 
rights of children with disabilities to a free, appropriate public education in settings to the 
maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the individual child in settings with their 
nondisabled peers. Federal law emphasizes the use of positive behavioral interventions and 
supports to address challenging behavior of children with disabilities in schools. State law, 
however, as noted above, controls whether school administrators may administer corporal 
punishment in schools, including corporal punishment for children with disabilities. As 
discussed below, remedies are available for violations of the rights of children with 
disabilities to a free, appropriate public education and for the administration of corporal 
punishment that is excessive or arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>284. The Government provided information regarding Federal Laws addressing the Right 
to Education for Children with Disabilities. Since 1975, a Federal law, now named the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1401 et seq., has required 
that the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, 
American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the elementary 
and secondary schools operated or funded by the Department of the Interior for Indian 
children on reservations, as well as the Freely Associated States of the Federated States of 
Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau, in exchange 
for funding for a portion of the costs of the program, ensure the provision of a free, 
appropriate public education to each child with a disability within their jurisdictions who, 
because of that disability needs special education and related services. Through the IDEA, 
eligible children are entitled to appropriate special education and related services and 
supplementary aids and supports generally from age three through age 21 or until they 
graduate from secondary school with a regular high school diploma or reach the maximum 
age for secondary school in the State, whichever comes first. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(1). In fall 
2007, the most recent year for which data are available, 6,718,203 children with disabilities 
aged three through 21 were served under the IDEA. 
</p>
<p>285. The IDEA requires that, to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the 
individual child, he or she is educated in regular classes with nondisabled children and that 
removal from regular classes occurs only when education for the child with a disability 
cannot be satisfactorily achieved in the regular setting. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(5). Appropriate 
services must be determined annually on an individual basis by considering the strengths of 
the child; the concerns of the parents for enhancing the education of their child; the 
academic, developmental and functional needs of the child; and periodically updated 
individual evaluations at a meeting involving the child's parents, one or more of the child's 
teachers and related service providers and school administrators, and, as appropriate, the 
child. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1414(d)(1)(B) and (3)(A).  
</p>
<p>286. Significantly, for a child whose behavior impedes the child's learning or the learning 
of others, the participants in this meeting must consider the use of positive behavioral 
interventions and supports and other strategies to address that behavior. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 
1414(d)(3)(B)(i). At the conclusion of this meeting, the team writes an individualized 
education program (IEP) that identifies the child's present levels of academic achievement 
and functional performance, including how the child's disability affects the child's 
involvement and progress in the general education curriculum; a statement of measurable 
annual academic and functional goals for the child; a description of how the child's progress 
toward those goals will be measured and when periodic reports to parents will be provided; 
a statement of the special education and related services and supplementary aids and 
services to be provided to, or on behalf of, the child; an explanation of the extent, if any, to 
which the child will not participate with nondisabled children in regular classes; a statement 
of any individually appropriate accommodations that are necessary to measure the 
academic achievement and functional performance of the child on State and school district-
wide assessments; the projected date for the beginning of services and the anticipated </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>50</b>  
</p>
<p>frequency, location, and duration of those services; and, for children beginning at least at 
age 16, appropriate measurable postsecondary goals and transition services needed to help 
the student reach those goals. 20 U.S.C &#167; 1414(d)(1)(A). 
</p>
<p>287. Both the IDEA and Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, 20 
U.S.C. &#167; 6301 et seq., the largest Federal grant program for elementary and secondary 
education, emphasize efforts to improve educational results for children with disabilities 
and close academic achievement gaps between children with and without disabilities. These 
laws promote high quality instruction by providing school staff with opportunities for 
professional development, requiring that staff be appropriately and adequately prepared and 
trained, and require that school districts and States be held accountable for the academic 
achievement of children with disabilities. 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1412(a)(14)-(16); 6311(b)(2); and 
</p><p>6319. (Under Title I, school districts and States are held accountable for the academic 
achievement of all students including children with disabilities.) 
</p>
<p>288. Through the IDEA, the U.S. Department of Education provides extensive support to 
State efforts to adopt research-based positive approaches for establishing the social culture 
and behavioral supports needed for all children in a school to achieve both social and 
academic success, primarily through research, technical assistance and professional 
development. For example, the Department funds the Center for Positive Behavioral 
Interventions and Supports (PBIS), which is designed to provide capacity-building 
information and technical assistance to States, school districts, and schools for identifying, 
adopting, and sustaining effective positive school-wide behavioral practices. In a study 
assessing the extent to which States are adopting research-based approaches to addressing 
student behavior, 38 of the 41 responding State educational agencies reported that they are 
implementing, in at least some sites, a positive behavior intervention approach with support 
from the PBIS Center. (&quot;Statewide Behavior Initiatives&quot; Project Forum, National 
Association of State Directors of Special Education, 2007.) The Department also 
encourages States and school districts to use available IDEA funds for professional 
development activities and for early intervening services, to implement school-wide 
programs of positive behavioral interventions and supports for children who need additional 
behavioral support to succeed in the general education environment. 
</p>
<p>289. The IDEA includes an extensive series of procedural safeguards designed to ensure 
that parents of children with disabilities may seek redress whenever they are concerned 
about the identification, evaluation, educational placement, or any matter related to the 
provision of a free, appropriate public education to their child. These safeguards include 
written prior notice to the parents whenever the school district proposes or refuses to 
initiate or change the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child or the 
provision of a free, appropriate education to the child; an opportunity for mediation; an 
opportunity to present a due process complaint with respect to any matter relating to the 
identification, evaluation, educational placement, or the provision for a free appropriate 
public education to the child; and for an impartial due process hearing on any of those 
matters. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(b), (e), and (f)-(i)(1). Failure to consider the need for positive 
behavioral interventions and supports for a child whose behavior interferes with learning 
and failure to implement those positive behavioral interventions and supports, for example, 
could be redressed through filing a due process complaint. If a parent is still dissatisfied 
after a due process hearing decision and its administrative appeal, if available in that State, 
the parents may appeal that decision to Federal or State court. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(2)-(3). 
During the pendency of a due process hearing or appeals, the child must remain in the 
educational placement he or she was in at the beginning of the case, unless the parent and 
school district agree otherwise. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(j). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>51

<p>290. Through regulation, the U. S. Department of Education also requires States to offer a 
more informal complaint process, through which any individual or organization may file a 
written, signed complaint with the State educational agency alleging a violation of any 
requirement of the IDEA. 34 CFR &#167;&#167;300.151-300.153. Under these procedures the State 
must issue a written decision addressing each allegation of the complaint within 60 calendar 
days, unless the time is extended for extraordinary circumstances with respect to the 
particular complaint or the parties agree to an extension of time to engage in mediation or 
other alternative dispute resolution. 
</p>
<p>291. The IDEA also includes procedures concerning the administration of discipline to 
children with disabilities. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(k). These procedures, however, are directed 
primarily at ensuring that children with disabilities are not removed on a long-term basis 
through discipline from their regular educational environment for behavior that is a 
manifestation of their disability and for ensuring the provision of appropriate services, in 
another setting, to these children with disabilities who are appropriately removed on a long-
term basis for disciplinary reasons from their regular educational environment. For 
example, if a school is proposing to remove a child from his or her regular placement for 
more than 10 school days, within 10 school days of that decision the child's IEP team must 
meet to review all relevant information and assess whether the child's behavior was a 
manifestation of the child's disability. If it is determined to be a manifestation, the IEP team 
must conduct a functional behavioral assessment of the child and implement a behavioral 
intervention plan for the child or review and revise an existing plan. 20 U.S.C. &#167; 
1415(k)(1)(E) and (F). Failure to comply with a behavioral intervention plan, for example, 
by substituting corporal punishment for some other response to inappropriate behavior 
described in that plan, would be a violation of the IDEA and redress could be sought 
through the mechanisms described previously. 
</p>
<p>292. The Government further informed that two other Federal civil rights laws, Section 
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (Section 504), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 794, and 
Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12131, are also 
relevant to the issue of public education for children with disabilities. Section 504 prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities conducted by, or 
receiving financial assistance from, Federal agencies; Title II of the ADA prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of disability in State and local government services. A child is 
protected by these laws if the child has a physical or mental impairment that substantially 
limits a major life activity, has a record of a substantially limiting impairment, or is 
regarded as having a substantially limiting impairment, including children who have a 
disability within the meaning of Section 504 and Title II but who may not be eligible for 
IDEA services. 
</p>
<p>293. The discrimination prohibited by these laws includes denying any qualified child 
with a disability a free appropriate public education, including an appropriate education that 
is provided in the least restrictive environment appropriate for the child. Under these laws, 
an appropriate education is defined as the provision of regular or special education and 
related aids and services that are designed to meet the individual educational needs of 
students with disabilities as adequately as the needs of non-disabled students are met and 
that adhere to other specific procedures. 34 C.F.R. &#167; 104.33(b)(1). For example, a failure to 
respond to disruptive behavior by a child consistent with the positive behavior interventions 
and supports included in the child's IEP could constitute a violation of Section 504 and 
Title II of the ADA. Similarly, administering corporal punishment to children with 
disabilities and some other discipline to children without disabilities also could be a 
violation of Section 504 and Title II of the ADA. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>52</b>  
</p>
<p>294. Section 504 regulations require school districts to establish and implement 
procedural safeguards with respect to the identification, evaluation, or educational 
placement of students protected by Section 504. This system of procedural safeguards 
includes notice, an opportunity for parents or guardians to examine relevant records, an 
impartial hearing with the opportunity for participation by parents or guardians and by 
counsel, and a review procedure. See 34 C.F.R. &#167; 104.36. In addition, complaints alleging 
violations of Section 504 and Title II of the ADA in elementary and secondary education 
may be filed with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). When 
OCR receives a complaint, OCR evaluates the complaint and investigates if appropriate. 
Pursuant to both statute and regulation, OCR is obligated to resolve civil rights violations 
by voluntary and informal means, if possible. If negotiation and resolution methods fail, 
OCR issues a violation letter of findings and again attempts to negotiate a settlement 
agreement to correct the violations. If compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, 
OCR cap seek compliance through an administrative hearing process or through referring 
cases to the U.S. Department of Justice for enforcement through litigation. Additionally, 
individuals who believe they have been intentionally discriminated against in violation of 
these laws may bring an action in federal court for appropriate relief, including monetary 
damages. 
</p>
<p>295. Regarding the facts alleged in the communication sent, the Government replied that 
it could only respond to the accuracy of the numbers and percentages of children who were 
subjected to corporal punishment that are cited in the paragraph of your letter that starts on 
the bottom of page 1 and carries over to the top of page 2, and cap confirm that the numbers 
and percentages cited appear to be from or based on the U. S. Department of Education's 
Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC). (The CRDC is conducted as a weighted sample of 
approximately 6,000 of the more than 16,000 school districts in the United States. Based on 
the data collected from that sample, the Department develops statistical projections for 
States and for the United States as a whole. The statement in the information that these data 
concern the 2006-2007 school year is not accurate, however. Although the data was 
submitted to the Department in the 2006-2007 school year, the data represent the 
Department's projections for the 2005-2006 school year. 
</p>
<p>296. On September 11, 2009, the U.S. Department of Education proposed to expand its 
existing collection of data regarding corporal punishment and students with disabilities by 
proposing to collect that data disaggregated by race/ethnicity, Limited English Proficient 
status, and sex, consistent with the corporal punishment data collection for students without 
disabilities. The Department's proposal regarding this and other revisions to the CRDC are 
now being considered in a public comment period that concluded on November 10, 2009. 
The Government had no further information on the accuracy of the remaining facts alleged 
in the summary of the case. 
</p>
<p>297. The Government further mentioned that the U.S. Department of Education's OCR 
does receive some complaints alleging disability discrimination related to corporal 
punishment. As described previously, when OCR receives a complaint, OCR evaluates the 
complaint and investigates if appropriate. There are a number of different ways in which a 
complaint can be resolved. This includes OCR finding that a civil rights violation has 
occurred, or finding insufficient evidence of non-compliance with applicable civil rights 
laws, or dismissing a complaint due to, for example, lack of subject matter jurisdiction. As 
noted previously, if compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, OCR can seek 
compliance through the administrative hearing process or through referring cases to the 
U.S. Department of Justice for enforcement through litigation. The Government further 
provided some examples of complaints received and investigated. </p>

<p>298. Finally, the Government informed that the inquiries specific about the use of 
corporal punishment in schools have been limited to the collection of data regarding the use 
of corporal punishment in public schools through the CRDC and in the investigation of 
complaints alleging that the use of corporal punishment violates Federal civil rights laws, as 
mentioned previously, and also provided examples of efforts made by State and local 
authorities to adopt research-based positive approaches for establishing the social culture 
and behavioral supports needed for all children in a school to achieve both social and 
academic success, primarily through funding research, technical assistance, and 
professional development activities.

reply.
