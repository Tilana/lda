General Assembly in its resolution 40/33 on 29 November 1985, the United Nations Rules for 
the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty and the United Nations Guidelines for the

resolutions 45/112 and 45/113 on 14 December 1990 and the Guidelines in matters involving 
child victims and witnesses of crimes, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>all resolutions of the Council, the Commission on Human Rights, the 
General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council relevant to the subject, including 
Human Rights Council resolution 7/29 of 28 March 2008, Commission resolution 2004/43

</p>
<p> <i>Noting with interest</i> the adoption by the Human Rights Committee of general comment

and the adoption by the Committee on the Rights of the Child of general comment No. 10 on 
children&#8217;s rights in juvenile justice (CRC/C/GC/10),  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>the efforts made by the Secretary-General on improving the coordination 
of United Nations activities in the field of administration of justice, the rule of law and juvenile 
justice, in particular his reports on the enhancement of support by the United Nations for the rule 
of law (A/61/636), his guidance notes on a United Nations approach to rule of law assistance and 
on the United Nations approach to justice for children,  
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with interest</i> the relevant work of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in 
the administration of justice, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with satisfaction</i> the work of the Interagency Panel on Juvenile Justice and its 
members, including the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the Office of the United Nations </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/L.15

</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the 
United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research, the United Nations Development 
Programme, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child and various non-governmental organizations, in particular their coordination in providing 
technical advice and assistance in juvenile justice, and the active participation of civil society in 
its respective work, 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful</i> of the importance of ensuring respect for the rule of law and human rights in the 
administration of justice, in particular in post-conflict situations, as a crucial contribution to 
building peace and justice, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that an independent and impartial judiciary, an independent legal profession 
and the integrity of the judicial system are essential prerequisites for the protection of human 
rights and for ensuring that there is no discrimination in the administration of justice, 
</p>
<p><i> Aware</i> of the need for special vigilance with regard to the specific situation of children, 
juveniles and women in the administration of justice, in particular while deprived of their liberty, 
and their vulnerability to various forms of violence, abuse, injustice and humiliation, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that the best interests of the child must be a primary consideration in all 
decisions concerning deprivation of liberty, and in particular that depriving children and 
juveniles of their liberty should be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest 
appropriate period of time, in particular before trial, and the need to ensure that, if they are 
arrested, detained or imprisoned, children should be separated from adults, to the greatest extent 
feasible, unless it is considered in the child&#8217;s best interest not to do so, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that the best interests of the child should also be a primary consideration in 
relation to the question of whether and how long children of imprisoned mothers should stay 
with them in prison, and emphasizing the responsibility of the State to provide adequate care for 
the women in prison and their children, </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/L.15

</p>
<p> 1.<i> Welcomes</i> the latest report of the Secretary-General submitted to the Human Rights 
Council on human rights in the administration of justice, including juvenile justice 
(A/HRC/4/102); 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Reaffirms</i> the importance of the full and effective implementation of all 
United Nations standards on human rights in the administration of justice; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon </i>Member States to spare no effort in providing for effective legislative, 
judicial, social, educative and other relevant mechanisms and procedures, as well as adequate 
resources, to ensure the full implementation of those standards, and invites them to take into 
consideration the issue of human rights in the administration of justice in the universal periodic 
review procedure; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Invites </i>Governments to include in their national development plans the 
administration of justice as an integral part of the development process, and to allocate adequate 
resources for the provision of legal aid services with a view to the promotion and protection of 
human rights, and invites the international community to respond favourably to requests for 
financial and technical assistance for the enhancement and strengthening of the administration of 
justice, including juvenile justice;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Stresses</i> the special need for national capacity-building in the field of the 
administration of justice, in particular to establish and maintain stable societies and the rule of 
law in post-conflict situations, through reform of the judiciary, the police and the penal system, 
as well as juvenile justice reform; </p>
<p> 6. <i>Invites </i>Governments to provide for training, including anti-racist, multicultural and 
gender-sensitive and child rights training, in human rights in the administration of justice, 
including juvenile justice, for all judges, lawyers, prosecutors, social workers, immigration and 
police officers and other professionals working in the field of administration of justice, including 
personnel deployed in international field presences; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Recognizes</i> that every child and juvenile in conflict with the law must be treated in a 
manner consistent with his or her rights, dignity and needs, in accordance with international law, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/L.15 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>including relevant international standards on human rights in the administration of justice, and 
calls on States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to abide strictly by its 
principles and provisions and to improve the status of information on the situation of juvenile 
justice; 
</p>
<p> 8.<i> Notes</i> the concern of the Committee on the Rights of the Child that, in all regions of 
the world and in relation to all legal systems, the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child relating to the administration of juvenile justice are in many instances not reflected in 
national legislation or practice, and welcomes the fact that the Committee makes concrete 
recommendations concerning the improvement of national juvenile justice systems, including the 
implementation of juvenile justice legislation;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Encourages </i>States that have not yet integrated children&#8217;s issues in their overall rule 
of law efforts to do so and to develop and implement a comprehensive juvenile justice policy to 
prevent and address juvenile delinquency as well as with a view to promoting, inter alia, the use 
of alternative measures, such as diversion and restorative justice, and ensuring compliance with 
the principle that deprivation of liberty of children should only be used as a measure of last resort 
and for the shortest appropriate period of time, as well as to avoid, wherever possible, the use of 
pretrial detention for children; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of including rehabilitation and reintegration strategies for 
former child offenders in juvenile justice policies, in particular through education programmes, 
with a view to their assuming a constructive role in society; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Urges</i> States to ensure that, under their legislation and practice, neither capital 
punishment nor life imprisonment without the possibility of release is imposed for offences 
committed by persons under 18 years of age; 
</p>
<p> 12.<i> Invites </i>Governments, relevant international and regional bodies, national human 
rights institutions and non-governmental organizations to devote greater attention to the issue of 
women and girls in prison, including issues relating to the children of women in prison, with a 
view to identifying and addressing the gender-specific aspects and challenges related to this 
problem; </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/L.15 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Emphasizes </i>that, when sentencing or deciding on pretrial measures for a pregnant 
woman or a child&#8217;s sole or primary carer, priority should be given to non-custodial measures, 
bearing in mind the gravity of the offence and after taking into account the best interest of the 
child;  
</p>
<p> 14.<i> Welcomes</i> the important activities of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the United Nations 
Development Programme in the field of administration of justice, in particular juvenile justice, 
and invites States, upon their request, to benefit from technical advice and assistance in juvenile 
justice provided by the relevant United Nations agencies and programmes, in particular the 
Interagency Panel on Juvenile Justice, in order to strengthen national capacities and 
infrastructures in the field of the administration of justice, in particular juvenile justice; </p>
<p> 15. <i>Calls upon</i> relevant special procedures of the Council to give special attention to 
questions relating to the effective protection of human rights in the administration of justice, 
including juvenile justice, and to provide, wherever appropriate, specific recommendations in 
this regard, including proposals for advisory services and technical assistance measures; </p>
<p> 16.<i> Calls upon</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to reinforce 
advisory services and technical assistance relating to national capacity-building in the field of the 
administration of justice, in particular juvenile justice, taking into account, inter alia, the Nairobi 
Declaration of October 2008 on the role of national human rights institutions in the 
administration of justice, adopted at the ninth international conference of the International 
Coordinating Committee of national human rights institutions;  
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Calls upon</i> the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner to strengthen system 
wide coordination in this area further, including by providing assistance to national human rights 
institutions in implementing the Nairobi Declaration and by further supporting the Interagency 
Panel on Juvenile Justice in its work to respond favourably to requests for technical assistance in 
the field of juvenile justice; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/L.15 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to submit a report to the Council at its 
thirteenth session on the latest developments, challenges and good practices in human rights in 
the administration of justice, including juvenile justice and conditions for women and children in 
detention, as well as in activities undertaken by the United Nations system as a whole; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to report to the Council at its thirteenth session on 
the implementation of the present resolution; 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Decides </i>to continue its consideration of this issue under the same agenda item in
