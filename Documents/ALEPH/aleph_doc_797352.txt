Sandstorm
Gold Acquires
NSR Royalty
From Solitario
and Ely Gold
Vancouver,
British
Columbia,
June 11,
2012 –
Sandstorm
Gold Ltd.
(“Sandstorm”
or the
“Company”)
(TSX-V:SSL)
is pleased to
announce
that it has
acquired a
2.4% net
smelter
returns royalty
(“NSR”) on the
Mt. Hamilton
gold project
(“Mt.
Hamilton”)
from Solitario
Exploration &
Royalty Corp.
(“Solitario”)
(NYSE
MKT:XPL;
TSX:SLR)
and Ely Gold
& Minerals
Inc. (“Ely
Gold”) (TSX-
V:ELY). Mt.
Hamilton is
located in
Nevada,
U.S.A. and is
held by Mt.
Hamilton LLC
(“MH-LLC”)
which is 80%
owned by
Solitario and
20% owned
by Ely Gold.
As
consideration,
Sandstorm will
make an
upfront cash
payment to
MH-LLC of
US$6 million
upon signing
the
agreement
and a future
cash
remittance of
US$4 million
on January
15, 2013. If
MH-LLC
enters into a
gold stream
agreement
with
Sandstorm
that has an
upfront
deposit of no
less than
US$30 million,
MH-LLC will
have the
option, for a
period of 30
months, to
repurchase
up to 100% of
the NSR for
US$12 million.
In addition,
MH-LLC has
provided
Sandstorm
with a right of
first refusal on
any future
royalty or gold
stream
financing for
the Mt.
Hamilton
project. “Using
a small
amount of
cash on
hand, we
have secured
a royalty on
an excellent
project and
we are well
positioned to
complete a
gold stream
as Mt.
Hamilton
progresses to
the
construction
stage”, said
Sandstorm
President &
CEO Nolan
Watson.
“Solitario has
been
successful in
developing
the asset to
date and we
believe there
is significant
upside
potential.”
About Mt.
Hamilton The
Mt. Hamilton
gold project is
located in
White Pine
County,
Nevada,
U.S.A.
Solitario
released a
feasibility
study in
February
2012 showing
favourable
economics for
an open pit
operation with
heap leach
extraction.
Once in
operation, the
mine is
expected to
produce
48,000
ounces of
gold and
330,000
ounces of
silver per year
over an 8
year period,
with excellent
potential to
add additional
resources and
extend the
mine life.
