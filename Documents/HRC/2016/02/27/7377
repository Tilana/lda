<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to General 
</p>
<p>Assembly resolution 69/190, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to 
</p>
<p>submit a report on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran to the 
</p>
<p>Assembly at its seventieth session and an interim report to the Human Rights Council at its 
</p>
<p>twenty-eighth session. The present interim report provides information on progress made in 
</p>
<p>the implementation of resolution 69/190, focusing on the concerns identified therein. 
</p>
<p>2. The report draws upon observations made by the United Nations human rights treaty 
</p>
<p>monitoring bodies, the special procedures of the Human Rights Council and various United 
</p>
<p>Nations entities. It also refers to information from official State media and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>3. Since the most recent report of the Secretary-General submitted to the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly (A/69/306), the application of the death penalty, including in relation to political 
</p>
<p>prisoners and juvenile offenders, has continued at a very high rate. Reports of the arbitrary 
</p>
<p>detention and prosecution of journalists, human rights defenders and women rights activists 
</p>
<p>have continued. Individuals have increasingly been targeted for their alleged contacts with 
</p>
<p>United Nations human rights mechanisms, and members of minority groups have continued 
</p>
<p>to face persistent discrimination and persecution. Women&#8217;s rights remain a priority 
</p>
<p>concern, particularly underage marriages and the underrepresentation of women in the 
</p>
<p>labour force and in decision-making positions.  
</p>
<p>4. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran continued to engage constructively 
</p>
<p>with the United Nations treaty bodies, and recently submitted its periodic reports to the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC/C/IRN/1) and the Committee on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities (CRPD/C/IRN/1). The Government also engaged substantively 
</p>
<p>with the universal periodic review for its second cycle review. Despite these developments, 
</p>
<p>none of the special procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights Council, including the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, has 
</p>
<p>been admitted to the country. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Overview of the situation of human rights in the Islamic 
</b></p>
<p><b>Republic of Iran  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Death penalty  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Use of the death penalty  
</b></p>
<p>5. The Secretary-General continues to express his alarm at the increasing number of 
</p>
<p>death sentences handed down and executions carried out in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
United Nations human rights mechanisms have repeatedly and consistently expressed their 
</p>
<p>great concern at this persistent trend, and have urged the Government to end executions. A 
</p>
<p>total of 41 of the 291 recommendations made to the Islamic Republic of Iran during its 
</p>
<p>second cycle of universal periodic review concerned the death penalty (A/HRC/28/12). 
</p>
<p>6. On 28 October 2014, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>publicly expressed serious concern at the large number of executions in the Islamic 
</p>
<p>Republic of Iran, and called upon the authorities to immediately institute a moratorium on </p>


<p>the death penalty. At least 500 people are believed to have been executed from January to 
</p>
<p>November of 2014, with some sources suggesting a considerably higher number.1  
</p>
<p>7. In their comments on the present report, the Iranian authorities stressed that the 
</p>
<p>death penalty was only considered for the most serious crimes, including drug trafficking, 
</p>
<p>which is often accompanied by acts of terrorism, and that no political prisoner had been 
</p>
<p>executed. They also pointed out that defendants were granted all due process guarantees 
</p>
<p>during their trial, including access to a lawyer and the right to appeal. International human 
</p>
<p>rights bodies, including the Human Rights Committee (see A/50/40, para. 449), have 
</p>
<p>determined that drug-related offences do not meet the threshold of the most serious crimes 
</p>
<p>for which the death penalty may be applied under international law. At least seven 
</p>
<p>individuals were also reportedly executed in political cases and non-violent economic 
</p>
<p>crimes following proceedings that reportedly did not comply with international norms 
</p>
<p>regarding fair trial and due process provided for in article 14 of the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights, to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a State party.  
</p>
<p>8. In the majority of cases that involve capital punishment, due process guarantees 
</p>
<p>were often violated in proceedings that fell short of international fair trial standards. This 
</p>
<p>raises concern about the potential for wrongful conviction, which is unavoidable even for 
</p>
<p>the most advanced and established judicial system.2 In the light of these concerns, the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General reiterates his call upon the Iranian authorities to restrict the use of and/or 
</p>
<p>abolish the death penalty in law and practice, in particular when the judicial system is 
</p>
<p>failing to guarantee international fair trial standards (see A/69/ 306, para. 9). 
</p>
<p>9. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has argued that the &#8220;special 
</p>
<p>circumstances&#8221; and the &#8220;existing threats from the sharp rise in the production of narcotics 
</p>
<p>in the regions&#8221; near the State&#8217;s borders necessitate its resort to the death penalty. According 
</p>
<p>to the Government, drug-related offences amount to more than 80 per cent of overall 
</p>
<p>executions (see A/C.3/69/9, annex). On 7 November 2014, however, Mohammad Javad 
</p>
<p>Larijani, Head of the High Council for Human Rights of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
</p>
<p>acknowledged the need for amendments to the law on narcotics, stating that this could be 
</p>
<p>the first step in bringing down the high number of executions.3 In December 2014, the Head 
</p>
<p>of the Judiciary, Sadeq Amoli Larijani, also acknowledged the need for amendments to 
</p>
<p>anti-narcotic laws, recognizing that they had not proved effective in the fight against drug-
</p>
<p>trafficking.4 The Secretary-General welcomes this acknowledgment within the judiciary 
</p>
<p>that the death penalty is not effective in the deterrence of drug-related crimes. He notes the 
</p>
<p>efforts made by the State to combat drug trafficking, and urges the Government to work 
</p>
<p>with the United Nations to find effective alternative strategies to address this problem. 
</p>
<p>10. The Secretary-General is also concerned about a number of death penalty cases with 
</p>
<p>a political dimension. On 20 July 2014, Arzhang Davoodi, an author and poet, was 
</p>
<p>allegedly sentenced to death on the charge of <i>moharebeh</i> (enmity against God) in 
</p>
<p>connection with his alleged membership in and support for an Iranian dissident group.5 He 
</p>
<p>was reportedly arrested in 2003 and sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment on charges of 
</p>
<p>spreading propaganda against the system and establishing and directing an organization 
</p>
<p>opposed to the Government. In August 2012, the Revolutionary Court reportedly 
</p>
<p>introduced the charge of <i>moharebeh</i>, for which he was sentenced to death. He was 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 At least 318 people were reportedly executed for drug-related execution in the first 11 month of 2014.

 5 Amnesty International, Iranian writer sentenced to death: Arzhang Davoodi, 24 July 2014.  </p>


<p>allegedly subjected to prolonged solitary confinement and torture. Reportedly, neither Mr. 
</p>
<p>Davoodi nor his attorney was present during the trial at which he was sentenced to death. 
</p>
<p>The case is currently under consideration, given that the Supreme Court overruled the 
</p>
<p>judgement and ordered a retrial. Furthermore, Hamed Ahmadi, Kamal Malaee, Jahangir 
</p>
<p>Dehghani and Jamshed Dehghani, all members of the Kurdish community, were at 
</p>
<p>imminent risk of execution at the end of the period under review. They were reportedly 
</p>
<p>convicted in 2010 on charges of <i>moharebeh</i> and <i>mofsed fel-arz</i> (corruption on earth) 
</p>
<p>following trials that fell short of international fair trial standards.6 The authorities asserted 
</p>
<p>that these individuals were involved in terrorist activities and were sentenced to death on 
</p>
<p>the charges of membership in a terrorist group and carrying out armed attacks against the 
</p>
<p>military establishment. 
</p>
<p>11. On 25 October 2014, Reyhaneh Jabbari, who had been sentenced to death for the 
</p>
<p>alleged murder of Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi, a former employee of the Iranian 
</p>
<p>Intelligence Ministry, was executed despite repeated appeals by various United Nations 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms. Ms. Jabbari reportedly stabbed Mr. Sarbandi after he allegedly 
</p>
<p>attempted to assault her sexually. Ms. Jabbari maintained that her actions had been in self-
</p>
<p>defence. Serious concerns were raised about due process in this case, in particular that her 
</p>
<p>conviction had been allegedly based on confessions made under duress and that the court 
</p>
<p>had apparently failed to take all relevant circumstantial evidence into account.  
</p>
<p>12. In their comments on the present report, the authorities disputed the allegation of 
</p>
<p>sexual assault and stressed that the judgement had been issued after all legal remedies were 
</p>
<p>exhausted and that due process guarantees had been respected by the judiciary. In order to 
</p>
<p>prevent the execution, the authorities stayed the execution twice to allow the two families to 
</p>
<p>reach a settlement. On 31 October 2014, the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
</p>
<p>participating in the second cycle of the universal periodic review argued that Ms. Jabbari 
</p>
<p>had been hanged pursuant to the <i>qisas</i> (retribution in kind) system under Islamic criminal 
</p>
<p>law, according to which the closest relatives of the victim determine whether the death 
</p>
<p>penalty should be carried out (A/HRC/28/12, para. 134). It added that the judiciary had 
</p>
<p>persistently attempted to persuade the victim&#8217;s son to forgive the perpetrator, but he had 
</p>
<p>refused, largely on account of media propaganda. The Iranian authorities consider <i>qisas</i> to 
</p>
<p>be a private right of the victim&#8217;s relatives that cannot be overruled by the judiciary; the 
</p>
<p>right under international law to seek pardon or to have the sentence commuted is thereby 
</p>
<p>denied to defendants.  
</p>
<p>13. The high incidence of public executions remains a concern. Indeed a spike in 
</p>
<p>executions was reported in 2014; at least 50 public executions were reportedly carried out 
</p>
<p>from January to the end of November, with the majority reportedly attended by a large 
</p>
<p>crowd, including minors. Footage of executions is reportedly broadcast by the media, a 
</p>
<p>practice that until 2014 was banned (A/HRC/22/48, para. 19). The authorities argue that 
</p>
<p>public executions are aimed at deterring crimes, and that only a few cases have caused 
</p>
<p>public outrage. The argument that public executions are an effective crime deterrent, 
</p>
<p>however, disregards the deleterious effect on people, in particular children, who witness 
</p>
<p>such scenes.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Execution of juvenile offenders  
</b></p>
<p>14. While the Islamic Penal Code, which came into force in June 2013, creates a more 
</p>
<p>favourable environment for the implementation of juvenile justice standards for children in 
</p>
<p>conflict with the law, it does not preclude juvenile executions fully. At least 160 juvenile 
</p>
<p>offenders were reportedly on death row as at December 2014. According to the Special 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 OHCHR, &#8220;Iran: Execution of juvenile offenders breaches international law &#8211; Pillay&#8221;, 26 June 2014. </p>


<p>Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, eight 
</p>
<p>individuals below the age of 18 at the time of their offence were reportedly executed in 
</p>
<p>2014 (A/69/356, para. 7). 
</p>
<p>15. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and several special 
</p>
<p>procedures mandate holders have frequently communicated their concerns to the 
</p>
<p>Government on this issue. They stressed that any judgements imposing the death penalty on 
</p>
<p>persons under the age of 18 and the implementation of such judgements were incompatible 
</p>
<p>with the State&#8217;s international obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. On 26 June 2014, the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner publicly expressed concern at the persistent execution of juvenile offenders, 
</p>
<p>and stressed that, regardless of the circumstances of the crime, the execution of juvenile 
</p>
<p>offenders was clearly prohibited by international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>16. While not denying the execution of juveniles convicted under the age of 18, the 
</p>
<p>Iranian authorities reported that the judiciary had shown a high degree of leniency and 
</p>
<p>flexibility in juvenile cases, and had established a working group to help to prevent juvenile 
</p>
<p>executions, including by encouraging the families of victims and perpetrators to reach a 
</p>
<p>settlement, and offering financial aid (A/C.3/69/9, annex). On 11 November 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Deputy Chief of the Judiciary for Cultural Affairs pointed out that, although persons below 
</p>
<p>the age of 18 could not be executed in the Islamic Republic of Iran, if a person was 
</p>
<p>convicted of murder, the execution would be carried out after the person turned 18.7
 
This 
</p>
<p>stance runs counter to international human rights standards, which impose an absolute ban 
</p>
<p>on the execution of persons who were under 18 at the time of their offence.  
</p>
<p>17. During its first universal periodic review, the Islamic Republic of Iran accepted a 
</p>
<p>recommendation to consider the abolition of juvenile executions.8 The Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>renews his call to the Government to halt the execution of juvenile offenders and to 
</p>
<p>undertake a special review of the cases of children on death row with a view to commuting 
</p>
<p>or quashing their death sentences. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Reprisals against activists cooperating with the United Nations  
</b></p>
<p>18. Allegations of reprisals against individuals because of their cooperation or for 
</p>
<p>establishing contacts with the United Nations human rights mechanisms or representatives 
</p>
<p>remain a cause for great concern. In 2014, special procedures mandate holders constantly 
</p>
<p>raised cases of reprisals against individuals who had collaborated with the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>particularly the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic 
</p>
<p>of Iran. Of the 29 communications transmitted to the Iranian authorities from January to 
</p>
<p>November 2014, four communications related to cases of acts of reprisal, double the 
</p>
<p>number seen the previous year. In their comments on the present report, the Iranian 
</p>
<p>authorities stated that no individual had been prosecuted because of their contact with 
</p>
<p>United Nations human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>19. On 2 June 2014, Saeed Shirzad, a human rights activist and member of the Society 
</p>
<p>for Defending Street and Working Children, was reportedly arrested at his workplace by 
</p>
<p>officials from the Ministry of Intelligence. He was allegedly held at the detention facility of 
</p>
<p>the Ministry before being transferred to Evin prison in Tehran. He reportedly spent the first 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 Tasnim news, 11 November 2014 (available from www.tasnimnews.com/home/single/554662).  
</p>
<p> 8 With regard to the present report, the authorities stated that the new Islamic Penal Code provided 
</p>
<p>more favourable treatment for juvenile offenders: in cases not involving <i>qisas</i>, article 89 of the Code 
</p>
<p>commuted punitive measures for minors between 15 to 18 years to, for example, incarceration in a 
</p>
<p>correction centre, a short prison term or a pecuniary fine. </p>


<p>two months of detention in solitary confinement, with no contact permitted with his family 
</p>
<p>or a lawyer. Although no indictment had been issued against Mr. Shirzad, on 18 August, he 
</p>
<p>was reportedly verbally informed of his charges, which included association and collusion 
</p>
<p>against national security, propaganda against the system and cooperation with the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dr. 
</p>
<p>Mohammad Ali Taheri, the founder of the Erfan-e-Halgheh (inter-universalism) spiritual 
</p>
<p>group who is currently serving a five-year prison sentence handed down in October 2011 
</p>
<p>on charges of insulting Islamic sanctities, reportedly faced additional charges and 
</p>
<p>intensified pressure on his family for sending a letter to the Special Rapporteur. Following 
</p>
<p>the publication of the letter in June 2014 in which Dr. Taheri described the abuse 
</p>
<p>committed in prison, the authorities reportedly detained his wife from 2 July 2014, for two 
</p>
<p>weeks, and laid new charges against Dr. Taheri.  
</p>
<p>20. Mohammad Reza Pourshajari (also known as Siamak Mehr), was reportedly arrested 
</p>
<p>on 30 September 2014 and charged with acts against national security, propaganda against 
</p>
<p>the system, of attempting to leave the country illegally, and contact with the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran and with anti-
</p>
<p>revolutionary organizations. He had been released on 23 August after having served a four-
</p>
<p>year prison term for propaganda against the State, insulting the Supreme Leader and 
</p>
<p>defamation of Islam.  
</p>
<p>21. The Secretary-General encourages the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
</p>
<p>to protect individuals from all act of reprisal, and to investigate and ensure accountability 
</p>
<p>for all cases of intimidation and reprisal. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Situation of women  
</b></p>
<p>22. The Secretary-General welcomes the gains made in higher education and health for 
</p>
<p>women, as well as the efforts to integrate women in the socioeconomic sphere. Some of the 
</p>
<p>positive steps taken include the establishment of a foundation for entrepreneurial 
</p>
<p>development of women and cooperatives to alleviate poverty and female groups that assist 
</p>
<p>female heads of households and provide self-employment loans and grants to women (see 
</p>
<p>A/C.3/69/9, annex). In their comments on the present report, the Iranian authorities pointed 
</p>
<p>out that measures to promote the political and socioeconomic status of women had been 
</p>
<p>taken. They included the appointment of women affairs advisers to all ministries and 
</p>
<p>governmental organizations, the establishment of a women and children&#8217;s rights protection 
</p>
<p>centre in the judiciary, the appointment of female advisers to family courts, legislative 
</p>
<p>reforms that promote the status of women and the creation of special funds in the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Justice for female victims of violence. 
</p>
<p>23. Despite the above-mentioned achievements, women only account for 16 per cent of 
</p>
<p>the labour force (A/69/356, para. 64). According to the Global Gender Gap Index for 2014 
</p>
<p>of the World Economic Forum, the Islamic Republic of Iran ranked no. 137 out of 142 
</p>
<p>countries. Furthermore, men earn 4.8 times more than women (A/69/356, para. 67). With 
</p>
<p>regard to women in ministerial positions, the Index ranked the Islamic Republic of Iran no. 
</p>
<p>105 out of 142 countries, and there are few women in managerial or decision-making roles 
</p>
<p>(A/69/356, para. 69) &#8211; despite the emphasis that article 3 of the Charter of Women&#8217;s Rights 
</p>
<p>and Responsibilities in the Islamic Republic of Iran places on the right of women to equal 
</p>
<p>wages, privileges and work conditions. The draft comprehensive population and family 
</p>
<p>excellence plan, reportedly currently being considered by parliament, would further restrict 
</p>
<p>the participation of women in the labour force. Preference for employment opportunities 
</p>
<p>would be given, in order, to men with children, men without children, then lastly to women 
</p>
<p>with children. Furthermore, teaching positions in higher education and research institutions 
</p>
<p>would be reserved for qualified married applicants (A/69/356, para. 70). </p>


<p>24. According to article 1117 of the Civil Code, a husband may prevent his wife from 
</p>
<p>occupations or technical work deemed incompatible with family interests or his own 
</p>
<p>dignity or that of his wife.9 The law may even prevent women from pursuing artistic 
</p>
<p>activities. For instance, on 30 September 2014, the Head of the Family of Martyrs and 
</p>
<p>Veterans Association filed a suit against the Minister for Cultural Affairs for allowing 
</p>
<p>women to sing solo in concerts.10 
 
</p>
<p>25. The Secretary-General welcomes the efforts made by the Islamic Republic of Iran to 
</p>
<p>combat violence against women, which is critical to their ability to participate in civil, 
</p>
<p>political, economic, development, educational, social and cultural life. The Government is 
</p>
<p>reportedly supports research projects that analyse the causes and motives for gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence and is working to develop preventative strategies (see A/C.3/69/9, annex). The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran found 
</p>
<p>that 66 per cent of women had reportedly experienced domestic violence (A/69/356, para. 
</p>
<p>18).  
</p>
<p>26. Section 2 of the Charter of Women&#8217;s Rights and Responsibilities in the Islamic 
</p>
<p>Republic of Iran stresses the right to be aware of the appropriate criteria for choosing a 
</p>
<p>spouse, and also the right to become acquainted with that person before marriage. Despite 
</p>
<p>this assertion, child marriage remains prevalent in the country. The legal age of marriage 
</p>
<p>for girls is only 13, and some as young as 9 years of age may be married with the 
</p>
<p>permission of the court. In 2011, about 48,580 girls between the age of 10 and 14 were 
</p>
<p>married; and in 2012, there were at least 1,537 girls under the age of 10 who were 
</p>
<p>reportedly married (A/69/356, para. 40).
  
</p>
<p>27. Child marriage is a violation of human rights that put women and girls at risk of 
</p>
<p>physical, psychological, economic and sexual violence and can lead to a range of poor 
</p>
<p>health and social outcomes and other negative consequences, including early pregnancy and 
</p>
<p>high rates of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. The lack of legal protection and 
</p>
<p>safe houses for women to seek refuge forces them to live in situations of abuse, which may 
</p>
<p>lead them to commit acts of violence. In 2010, for example, Razieh Ebrahimi was 
</p>
<p>reportedly convicted of killing her husband when she was 17 years old. She was reportedly 
</p>
<p>married at the age of 14, gave birth to a child at 15, and was reportedly subjected to 
</p>
<p>physical and psychological abuse from her husband. She reportedly admitted to have killed 
</p>
<p>her husband while he was asleep. Her request to the Supreme Court for a retrial was 
</p>
<p>reportedly declined; her execution could now be carried out at any time. Furthermore, laws 
</p>
<p>continue to allow for marital or spousal rape and discriminate between men and women 
</p>
<p>with regard to the spouse&#8217;s ability to initiate and complete divorce. A woman is required to 
</p>
<p>prove that a significant threat has been made to her life in order to be able to file for divorce 
</p>
<p>(A/60/356, para. 19). Such laws make it difficult for women to escape domestic violence 
</p>
<p>and to protect themselves from any real and immediate risk to life or integrity.  
</p>
<p>28. Nationality laws in the Islamic Republic of Iran do not grant women equal rights 
</p>
<p>when transferring their nationality to their children. According to the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as at January 2015, there were more 
</p>
<p>than 950,000 refugees from Afghanistan and 32,000 from Iraq living in the country.11

<p>Iranian women who marry men from Iraq or Afghanistan are unable to pass on their Iranian 
</p>
<p>nationality to their children, who thereby risk becoming stateless. Gender-discriminatory 
</p>
<p>nationality laws often lead to the statelessness of women and children, or to situations 
</p>
<p>where a woman, her children or husband are deprived of the nationality of the country 
</p>
<p>where they reside.12  
</p>
<p>29. On 20 June 2014, Ghocheh Ghavami, a British-Iranian woman, was reportedly 
</p>
<p>arrested and subsequently convicted to a year of imprisonment and a two-year travel ban 
</p>
<p>for protesting peacefully against a State ban on Iranian women attending male volleyball 
</p>
<p>and football games in a stadium.13 She was reportedly held for 41 days in solitary 
</p>
<p>confinement and charged with propaganda against the establishment and attending 
</p>
<p>gatherings and demonstrations against the system.14 On 22 September, the Public 
</p>
<p>Prosecutor dismissed claims that Ms. Ghavami had been detained for attending a sport 
</p>
<p>event, explaining that she had been arrested because of her activities against the 
</p>
<p>establishment and for her links with satellite channels, including BBC Persian.15 She was 
</p>
<p>later released on bail for an amount equivalent to $37,000.  
</p>
<p>30. Women in the Islamic Republic of Iran are required to observe Islamic dress code in 
</p>
<p>public places. The parliament reportedly recently approved a plan &#8220;on the protection of 
</p>
<p>promoters of virtue and preventers of vice&#8221;, which would increase checks on improper 
</p>
<p>veiling. In their comments on the present report, the Iranian authorities reported that the 
</p>
<p>plan had been sent back to the parliament by the Guardian Council after it found 14 
</p>
<p>paragraphs in conflict with the Constitution. The morality police strictly monitor all public 
</p>
<p>places, including vehicles, and take action against those who do not adhere to the morality 
</p>
<p>codes. Women who appear without an Islamic <i>hijab</i> risk arrest and imprisonment of 
</p>
<p>between 10 days and two months, or a fine of up to 500,000 rials. Approximately 30,000 
</p>
<p>women were reportedly arrested between 2003 and 2013, with many others subjected to 
</p>
<p>expulsion from university or banned from entering public spaces, such as parks, cinemas, 
</p>
<p>sport facilities, airports and beaches.16  
</p>
<p>31. The acid attacks in October 2014 against six women for allegedly wearing improper 
</p>
<p><i>hijab</i> in Isfahan, Kermanshah and Tehran highlights the risks to health and safety run by 
</p>
<p>women.17 The incidents drew considerable attention both domestically and internationally, 
</p>
<p>with concerns being were expressed that the attacks might be linked to the approval of the 
</p>
<p>plan on the protection of promoters of virtue and preventers of vice. On 22 October, 
</p>
<p>security forces reportedly attacked with batons protestors who had gathered in front of the 
</p>
<p>parliament to denounce the acid attacks.18 Journalists and activists were detained, including 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12  In their comments on the present report, the Iranian authorities pointed out that a law adopted in 2006 
</p>
<p>provides that children born in the Islamic Republic of Iran from a marriage of an Iranian woman with 
</p>
<p>a foreign man could be granted Iranian nationality if they had no criminal or national security-related 
</p>

<p>32. The Secretary-General urges the Islamic Republic of Iran to review critically the 
</p>
<p>plan on the protection of promoters of virtue and preventers of vice, which may allow 
</p>
<p>individuals to target women who are dressed in a manner deemed unconventional. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Restrictions on freedoms of expression and of peaceful assembly  
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>33. The continued crackdown on media professionals, the pervasive restrictions on 
</p>
<p>freedom of opinion and expression, including the closure of newspapers and magazines, 
</p>
<p>and the ongoing monitoring, filtering and blocking of websites that carry political news and 
</p>
<p>analysis raise great concern. Individuals who have expressed their views on social media or 
</p>
<p>appeared in videos have been targeted and prosecuted. Some 5 million websites are 
</p>
<p>currently blocked, and the Government is reportedly planning to implement &#8220;smart 
</p>
<p>filtering&#8221;, which would further restrict content on the Internet (A/69/356, para. 22). The 
</p>
<p>creation of a &#8220;national Internet&#8221;, announced in 2006, would further restrict users&#8217; access to 
</p>
<p>the global Internet.20 On 21 September, the Prosecutor General urged the Minister for 
</p>
<p>Communication and Information Technology to immediately block messaging services 
</p>
<p>such as Viber, Tango and WhatsApp, which, he claimed, were being used to disseminate 
</p>
<p>derogatory remarks about the Supreme Leader.21 According to a report on the website of the 
</p>
<p>news agency Khabaronline (www.khabaronline.ir), on 12 September the Head of the State 
</p>
<p>cyber-police force warned that private messages on Viber and WhatsApp could be 
</p>
<p>monitored and that persons circulating &#8220;insulting comments&#8221; about the Supreme Leader and 
</p>
<p>other officials would be &#8220;dealt with&#8221; accordingly. 
</p>
<p>34. On 18 September, six individuals were reportedly arrested in May 2014 for making 
</p>
<p>a YouTube video that showed them dancing to the popular song &#8220;Happy&#8221; were sentenced to 
</p>
<p>prison terms ranging from six months to a year, and to 91 lashes. They were reportedly 
</p>
<p>convicted of participating in the production of a &#8220;vulgar video clip&#8221; and of &#8220;illicit relations&#8221; 
</p>
<p>between group members. Although the sentences were suspended for three years, they now 
</p>
<p>risk arrest again should they commit an offence.  
</p>
<p>35. In November 2014, the Supreme Court reportedly upheld the death penalty sentence 
</p>
<p>for Soheil Arabi, for &#8220;insulting the Holy Prophet&#8221; in several Facebook posts.22 The 
</p>
<p>authorities pointed out that Mr. Arabi&#8217;s case was currently being reviewed and the sentence 
</p>
<p>was yet to be finalized. Eight individuals, including a British national, were sentenced to a 
</p>
<p>combined 123 years in prison on charges that included blasphemy, propaganda against the 
</p>
<p>Government and insulting the Supreme Leader on Facebook (A/69/356, para. 27).  
</p>
<p>36. Freedom of information and expression is of paramount importance for every 
</p>
<p>society; the prosecution of individuals for expressing their views on social networks not 
</p>
<p>only silences legitimate peaceful expression but pushes society towards self-censorship. 
</p>
<p>The Secretary-General urges the authorities to promote and protect the right of individuals 
</p>
<p>to express themselves freely, and to refrain from any sanction that contravenes international 
</p>
<p>human rights law.

<p>37. While a number of journalists were freed in the latter months of 2014, a large 
</p>
<p>number of journalists remain jailed. National security, espionage, propaganda against the 
</p>
<p>system and insulting the Supreme Leader are some of the chargesfrequently invoked for the 
</p>
<p>arrest and prosecution of journalists. 38. For instance, Serajeddin Mirdamadi, who 
</p>
<p>returned to the Islamic Republic of Iran following the election of President Rouhani, was 
</p>
<p>reportedly sentenced to six years of imprisonment on charges of propaganda against the 
</p>
<p>system and crimes against national security. His sentence was reduced to three years on 
</p>
<p>appeal.23 Jason Rezaian, a journalist with the <i>Washington Post</i>, in detention since July 
</p>
<p>2014, reportedly had his detention extended for 60 days in November.24 The authorities 
</p>
<p>reported that Mr. Rezaian was facing espionage charges and that his case was currently 
</p>
<p>being investigated by the Prosecutor&#8217;s office. Mr. Rezaian was arrested together with his 
</p>
<p>wife, Yeganeh Salehi, also a journalist. Ms. Yeganeh was, however, released on bail after 
</p>
<p>60 days in detention.25 In an interview, Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani stated that Mr. 
</p>
<p>Rezaian had been arrested for his involvement in activities that breached the security of the 
</p>
<p>State.26 The arrest, detention and prosecution of journalists constitute a severe violation of 
</p>
<p>the right to freedom of expression and breach the international obligations of the Islamic 
</p>
<p>Republic of Iran under article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Freedom of assembly  
</b></p>
<p>38. On 31 October 2014, in his statement to the Human Rights Council, Dr. Mohammad 
</p>
<p>Javad Larijani reported on the proactive role played by more than 17,000 civil society 
</p>
<p>groups in the Islamic Republic of Iran in the promotion and protection of human rights. He 
</p>
<p>also stated that more than 230 political parties, 400 trade unions and specialized 
</p>
<p>associations, as well as 60 religiously affiliated societies, were active in the country.  
</p>
<p>39. Human rights defenders, lawyers, students and women rights activists, journalists 
</p>
<p>and trade unionists, however, continue to face restrictions, arrest, conviction and 
</p>
<p>imprisonment for exercising their rights to freedom of association and freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression and opinion. The authorities have not yet lifted the ban on the activities of the 
</p>
<p>Workers&#8217; Union of the Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company, the Sugar Cane Workers&#8217; Union 
</p>
<p>of the Haft Tapeh Sugar Cane Company and the Teachers&#8217; Association. Union activists are 
</p>
<p>often subjected to politically motivated prosecution and unfair trials. More than a dozen 
</p>
<p>activists are currently held in prison for merely exercising their right to peaceful assembly 
</p>
<p>and association. The leaders of the Green Movement, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, and Mehdi 
</p>
<p>Karoubi, have been under house arrest since 2011, with no formal charges ever brought 
</p>
<p>against them, for staging a rally in solidarity with protesters in Egypt. Another worrying 
</p>
<p>development is a new bill, made public early in 2014, on the activities of political parties 
</p>
<p>which, if passed, would prohibit parties from activities until they obtain a permit from a 
</p>
<p>five-member commission comprising representatives of the judiciary, parliament and the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of the Interior (see A/69/356, paras. 38-39). It also requires political parties to 
</p>
<p>notify the Ministry at least 72 hours in advance of any gathering or demonstration.

<p><b> E. Situation of human rights defenders and activists  
</b></p>
<p>40. The Secretary-General remains concerned at the shrinking space for human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, who continue to risk harassment, intimidation, arrest and prosecution for 
</p>
<p>defending rights and speaking up against violations and abuse. In certain cases, the 
</p>
<p>authorities have invoked national security-related charges against individuals for merely 
</p>
<p>expressing their opinion and for participating in peaceful assemblies. Lawyers and human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders associated with the Centre for Human Rights Defenders (founded by Nobel 
</p>
<p>Laureate Shirin Ebadi), the Committee for the Defence of Political Prisoners in Iran, the 
</p>
<p>Committee of Human Rights Reporters and individual lawyers representing clients in 
</p>
<p>sensitive cases have in particular been attacked. This not only endangers their physical 
</p>
<p>integrity but also undermines their work as human rights defenders and instils fear in 
</p>
<p>society.  
</p>
<p>41. On 8 August 2014, a group of special procedures mandate holders publicly 
</p>
<p>expressed their dismay at the escalating trend of arrest and sentencing of individuals 
</p>
<p>exercising their rights to freedoms of expression and opinion, peaceful assembly and 
</p>
<p>association.27 They noted the arrest and sentencing of at least 36 individuals, many of whom 
</p>
<p>human rights activists, between 22 May and 8 August, in connection with their activities or 
</p>
<p>for expressing their opinion on social media websites. Some had also been charged for 
</p>
<p>&#8220;gathering and colluding against national security&#8221; following their participation in peaceful 
</p>
<p>assemblies, then sentenced to prison terms ranging from six months to more than 20 years. 
</p>
<p>One individual was sentenced to 50 lashes, and another to death. Many of the trials had 
</p>
<p>been marred by procedural irregularities, including deprivation of legal representation and 
</p>
<p>exclusion from attending one&#8217;s own sentencing. 
</p>
<p>42. On 18 October 2014, the Iranian Bar Association, allegedly under pressure from the 
</p>
<p>Deputy Prosecutor of Tehran, the Head of the Evin prison court and the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Intelligence, reportedly imposed a three-year professional ban on Nasrin Sotoudeh, an 
</p>
<p>internationally recognized human rights activist and recipient of the European Parliament&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>2012 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, after revoking her lawyer license. Ms. 
</p>
<p>Sotoudeh, who had been released on 18 September 2013 after having served half of a six-
</p>
<p>year sentence imposed on charges of acting against national security, not wearing a <i>hijab</i> 
</p>
<p>during a videotaped message, propaganda against the system and membership of the Centre 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights Defenders, was not allowed to present a defence during the hearing at 
</p>
<p>which the sanctions were decided, in contravention of the Basic Principles on the Role of 
</p>
<p>Lawyers, in particular principles 27 to 29 thereof The decision came despite the fact that, in 
</p>
<p>September 2014, the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal had reportedly revoked a 10-year 
</p>
<p>professional ban previously imposed on her. On 25 October, Ms. Sotoudeh was reportedly 
</p>
<p>briefly arrested by security forces after returning from a protest against the acid attacks on 
</p>
<p>women. On 8 November, Nargis Mohammadi, also a prominent human rights activist, was 
</p>
<p>reportedly summoned to Evin prison court for interrogation, which lasted for six hours. She 
</p>
<p>is currently at liberty but risks arrest. 
</p>
<p>43. The ongoing harassment of and professional ban on human rights activists and 
</p>
<p>lawyers, who are instrumental in representing their clients and safeguarding the rule of law, 
</p>
<p>is a setback for the country as a whole.

<p><b> F. Treatment of religious and ethnic minorities 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Secretary-General remains concerned at reports about the situation of religious 
</p>
<p>and ethnic minorities, which continue to endure abuses and discrimination. The President 
</p>
<p>and other high-profile officials have publicly pledged to ensure equality, to uphold freedom 
</p>
<p>of belief and religion, to extend protection to all religious groups and to amend legislation 
</p>
<p>that discriminates against minority groups. In their comments on the present report, the 
</p>
<p>Iranian authorities pointed out that the Constitution provides equal rights to all and that no 
</p>
<p>person is prosecuted on the basis of their affiliation to a particular religious or ethnic 
</p>
<p>minority group. 
</p>
<p>45. The above-mentioned commitments have not, however, been translated into results, 
</p>
<p>and discrimination against ethnic and religious groups persists in law and practice 
</p>
<p>(A/69/306, para. 40). Members of ethnic and religious minority groups continue to face 
</p>
<p>persecution, including arrest and imprisonment, the denial of economic opportunities, 
</p>
<p>expulsion from educational institutions, deprivation of the right to work, and closure of 
</p>
<p>businesses and the destruction of religious sites, such as cemeteries and prayer centres. 
</p>
<p>Individuals seeking greater recognition for their cultural and linguistic rights risk facing 
</p>
<p>harsh penalties, including capital punishment.  
</p>
<p>46. Reports of incitement targeting the Baha&#8217;i faith and its adherents, and the destruction 
</p>
<p>of sites of religious and cultural value, such as cemeteries, are of serious concern. In a press 
</p>
<p>statement issued on 4 September 2014, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief urged the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to take urgent action to stop 
</p>
<p>the destruction of a Baha&#8217;i cemetery in Shiraz by Revolutionary Guards. He stressed that 
</p>
<p>attacks on Baha&#8217;i cemeteries were in violation of the freedom of religion or belief, because 
</p>
<p>they were an essential part of how people exercise and manifest their right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief and their significance goes beyond their physical presence.28 In their 
</p>
<p>comments on the present report, the Iranian authorities pointed out that burial in the 
</p>
<p>cemetery had been banned since 1981 and that a substitute cemetery had been designated 
</p>
<p>for Baha&#8217;is in Shiraz. They added that the destruction of the cemetery was based on public 
</p>
<p>health reasons, not to denigrate the Baha&#8217;i faith.  
</p>
<p>47. In his most recent report to the General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran reported on the arrest, detention 
</p>
<p>and prosecution of Christians, Sufi or Dervish Muslims and Sunni Muslims for organizing 
</p>
<p>religious meetings or activities. He noted that, of 150 Sunni Muslims currently detained, the 
</p>
<p>majority had been charged with serious security offences, and at least 49 Protestant 
</p>
<p>Christians were being detained for their involvement in informal house churches (A/69/356, 
</p>
<p>paras. 47-53).  
</p>
<p>48. At the end of the period under review, 33 members of the Kurdish community were 
</p>
<p>reportedly on death row after having been sentenced to death on national security-related 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 28 In August 2014, Revolutionary Guards in Shiraz reportedly vandalized and desecrated an old Baha&#8217;i 
</p>
<p>cemetery, where approximately 950 Baha&#8217;is were buried. They allegedly erected a sign at the 
</p>

</p>
<p>against national security, &#8220;corruption on earth&#8221; and &#8220;enmity against God&#8221;. Serious concerns 
</p>

</p>
<p>detention, they were allegedly torture and ill-treated, held for several months in solitary 
</p>

</p>
<p>have been a minor at the time of his alleged crime, and eight were at risk of imminent
