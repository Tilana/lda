<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This addendum to the report of the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography contains, on a country-by-country basis, summaries of 
individual cases and general situations transmitted to Governments between 16 June 2009 
and 23 November 2010, as well as replies received between 16 June 2009 and 23 January 
</p><p>2011.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur recalls that in transmitting communications, she does not 
make any judgment concerning the merits of the cases.  
</p>
<p>3. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur transmitted ten 
communications to the Governments of nine countries: Bangladesh, India, Kazakhstan, 
Mexico, Nepal, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, United States of America and Uzbekistan. 
Five responses to these communications were received. Eight of the communications were 
sent jointly with other Special Procedures mandate holders, including the Special 
Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, 
including its causes and consequences. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur regrets that some Governments failed to respond and thanks 
those which took the time and made the effort to provide replies, which are reflected and 
summarized in the present report. 
</p>
<p>5. For reasons of confidentiality, privacy and protection, the names of victims appear 
only in initials in this report.  The Special Rapporteur has also used initials for certain other 
persons concerned in order to minimise the risk of possible further victimization.  
Moreover, with a view to preserve the presumption of innocence, only initials are used for 
the names of alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>6. This report contains individual cases and general situations related to the mandate of 
the Special Rapporteur, including allegations related to the sale of children, trafficking of 
children for sexual exploitation, child pornography, and other forms of child sexual 
exploitation.  
</p>
<p>7. In framing her interventions in these cases, the Special Rapporteur is guided by the 
legal framework and principles set out in the Convention on the rights of the child, and in 
its Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. She 
frequently cites articles 19, 34 and 35 of the Convention on the rights of child. Article 19 
provides that States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and 
educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, 
injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including 
sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has 
the care of the child. Article 34 provides that states Parties must undertake to protect the 
child from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse, and article 35 of the Convention on 
the rights of the child, which provides that States Parties shall take all appropriate national, 
bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction of, the sale of or traffic in 
children for any purpose or in any form.  
</p>
<p>8. She also frequently cites articles 2 and 3 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
on the rights of the child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, 
which, respectively, define the concepts covered under the treaty, and impose the obligation 
on States Parties to criminalize or penalize these activities. Furthermore, she is guided by 
article 9 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the rights of the child on the sale of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>children, child prostitution and child pornography, regarding preventive measures and the 
obligation of States to ensure access to procedures for compensation for damages suffered. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Summary of communications on alleged human rights 
violations sent and responses received

<p><b> A. Bangladesh 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication of 15 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>10. On 15 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of slavery and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
sent a letter of allegation regarding information received concerning an estimated 70,000 
child bonded labourers who worked in the so-called &#171; rat mines &#187; of Jaintia Hills, which is 
located in the North Eastern State of Meghalaya, India. 
</p>
<p>11. According to information received, an estimated 70,000 bonded child labourers from 
Nepal and Bangladesh worked at the so-called &#8220;rat mines&#8221; of Jaintia Hills, Meghalaya 
State, India. The mines are reportedly known as such, because of the narrow and crude 
holes dug into the hills where only children can pass. It is estimated that about 40,000 
children from Bangladesh and 30,000 children from Nepal worked at the mines. In most 
cases, the children are allegedly purchased by middlemen or abducted or sold by gangs in 
Nepal and Bangladesh to the mining mafia in Meghalaya. The children were allegedly sent 
to the mines after their parents accepted money from middlemen engaged in child 
trafficking. The price for a child varies from 50 to 75 US dollars. It is claimed that 
everyday, trucks transporting coal to Bangladesh returned with children, who are lured into 
the mining industry with the promise of better wages and living conditions. The children 
were in debt bondage situations, as they are not paid for their work in some cases so that 
they repay with their labour the price for which they were bought.  In other cases, the 
children were given half wage compared to adults, which left them with very little money 
to survive on as expenses for their good are deducted from their wages.  
</p>
<p>12. The working conditions at the mines were allegedly hazardous, unhygienic, cruel 
and inhuman. The children were threatened not to disclose their identity to anyone they 
meet and they have no freedom to move from the premises of the mines. The working hours 
were long and the children have no rest from the day break to the nightfall. They had no 
means to communicate with the outside world, let alone their families. The children are not 
provided with any safety equipment and are only given shovels or pickaxes to extract coal 
or limestone. Further, it appears that deaths of children were common due to the unsafe 
working conditions at Jaintia Hills and often remain unreported. According to the 
information received, human skeletons were recovered beneath a pile of coal in the mine in 
Jaintia Hills and it has been verified that they were the remains of children who lost their 
lives due to suffocation in the mine shafts or in other accidents during the mining 
operations.  
</p>
<p>13. The information received also suggests that the children lived in very poor 
conditions. They reportedly lived in huts made with plastic sheets and there are no proper 
sanitary facilities. There was a lack of safe drinking water and proper sewage system. 
Although many people fell ill due to the poor living conditions, there were no medical 
facilities available near the mines.  
</p>
<p>14. It is alleged that girls were also often bought by the owners of the &#8220;rat mines&#8221; and 
subject to sexual exploitation. They were exploited not only by mine owners, but also 
managers, other older workers and even truck drivers. There is also information suggesting 
that some children were trafficked further from the mines to the cities for sexual 
exploitation.  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteurs sought a verification of the allegations from the 
Government, including details of actions or investigations undertaken to identify the 
Bangladeshi children working at the &#8220;rat mines&#8221; and to verify their working conditions; </p>

information on policies and the preventive and awareness-raising measures undertaken to 
prevent human trafficking, sale of children and sexual exploitation of children in 
Bangladesh; information on whether the victims or the families of the victims have access 
to adequate procedures of compensation for damages from those legally responsible for the 
trafficking in children, the sale of children, sexual exploitation of children, and the use of 
bonded labour; and details on any cooperation arrangements with the Indian authorities to 
facilitate the rapid identification of the Bangladeshi children working at the &#8220;rat mines&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Response and observations 
</b></p>
<p>16. On 29 October 2010, the Government responded that the contents of the 
communication had been duly noted and forwarded to the concerned authorities in 
Bangladesh for necessary inquiry and actions. Since then, the Special Rapporteur has not 
received a follow-up response, and invites the Government of Bangladesh to keep her 
informed of developments regarding these allegations.  
</p>
<p><b> B. India  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication of 15 October 2010

</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteurs sought a verification of the facts from the Government, 
including details of actions or investigations undertaken to identify the children working at 
the &#8220;rat mines&#8221; and to verify their working conditions; investigations carried out in relation 
to individuals who are implicated in trafficking or selling the children to the &#8220;rat mines&#8221; 
and keeping them in bonded labour; information on whether the Government of Meghalaya 
has fully considered the use of child labour at the &#8220;rat mines&#8221; in drafting mining policies; 
information on policies and the preventive and awareness-raising measures undertaken to 
combat human trafficking, sale of children and sexual exploitation of children in India; 
information on whether the victims or the families of the victims have access to adequate 
procedures of compensation for damages from those legally responsible for the trafficking 
in children, the sale of children, sexual exploitation of children, and the use of bonded 
labour; and details on any cooperation arrangements with the Nepalese or Bangladeshi 
authorities to facilitate the rapid identification of the children working at the &#8220;rat mines&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Observations 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received a reply from the Government of 
India to her letter of 15 October 2010, and invites the Government to provide her with 
information regarding the allegations set out in her letter. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Communication of 8 April 2010 
</b></p>
<p>24. On 8 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding acts of intimidation 
and threats against Mr. A.S. and members of an NGO. A.S. is a prominent human rights 
defender and the president of the NGO, which works on issues of forced prostitution and 
trafficking in Uttar Pradesh. A.S. is also the member of the Central Advisory Committee on 
Combating Child Prostitution and Trafficking of Women and Children of the Government 
of India and of the State Monitoring Committee for the abolition of child prostitution and 
the exploitation of women. Guria has been running a tuition centre for 16 years in the 
Panchayat Bhawan community centre in Shivdaspur, Uttar Pradesh.  
</p>
<p>25. According to the information received, on 25 March 2010, at approximately 4pm, a 
group of individuals entered the tuition centre run by the NGO in Shivdaspur, verbally 
abused staff present at the premises and threatened to kill them. They also threatened the 
NGO staff members that &#8220;they would break the arms and legs of anyone who attempted to 
continue teaching the children there&#8221;. They have also told staff members to warn A.S. not 
to enter the area or he will face dire consequences. The assailants subsequently locked the 
premises of the tuition centre making it inaccessible for evening classes. On 29 March 
2010, at approximately 1pm, staff members of the NGO discovered that the door of the 
centre had been broken down, leaving the centre unprotected. On 5 April 2010, a group of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>individuals again entered the centre while the evening tuition was ongoing, ransacked the 
centre, beat staff members and tore their clothes. The incidents were reported to the 
Manduadih police station and to the Deputy Inspector General of the police in Varanasi.  
</p>
<p>26. Concern is expressed that the intimidation of and threats against A.S. and other staff 
members of the NGO  may be related to their legitimate activities in defense of human 
rights, in particular in fighting against the sexual exploitation of women and children in 
Uttar Pradesh.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur sought a verification of the allegations from the 
Government, including details of any investigation, judicial or other inquiries carried out in 
relation to the case and details of any prosecutions which have been undertaken, and any 
sanctions which may have been imposed on the alleged perpetrators.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Response and observations 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of India for its response of 13 
December 2010, in which it informed that it had examined the complaint and found that the 
matter actually pertained to a property dispute which was later resolved amicably on 19 
April 2010.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Responses of the Government to previous communications 
</b></p>
<p>29. By letter dated 14 July 2009, the Government of India replied to the communication 
sent by the Special Rapporteur on 21 January 20091 regarding the case of a 16 year-old who 
was allegedly kidnapped, abused and sold to a brothel to work as prostitute and that despite 
her repeated complaints following her escape two years later, no police investigation has 
been undertaken. In response, the Government stated that the matter was investigated in 
March 2007 and a charge sheet was produced in the court in June 2007.  Upon the return of 
L in June 2008, the matter was investigated and the victim&#8217;s testimony against A.B. was 
recorded and filed in the court.  According to the Government, the matter was<i> sub judice 
</i>and a petition to obtain non-bailable warrants against the accused was under the 
consideration at the time of the reply.   
</p>
<p>30. By letter dated 4 June 2010, the Government of India replied to the communication 
sent by the Special Rapporteur on 21 January 20092 regarding the case of a 15-year-old girl 
who was allegedly kidnapped and trafficked into sexual exploitation. In response, the 
Government stated that the subject was rescued following a raid carried out jointly by the 
police and members of a local NGO on 30 August 2008 and handed over to her parents 
following a medical examination. Owing to the subject&#8217;s background, the charge-sheet 
against the accused was strengthened by adding charges under the relevant sections of the 
SC/ST Act and the charge-sheet filed in the court on 23 October 2008. The auto-rickshaw 
driver G, too was arrested on 10 October 2008 and sent to jail. The matter is currently <i>sub-
judice</i>. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Observations 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur remains interested in receiving further information about 
these two cases, including the outcome of the trial which was proceeding at the time of the 
reply.

<p><b> C. Kazakhstan 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication of 20 October 2009  
</b></p>
<p>32. By letter dated 20 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with Special 
Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government of Kazakhstan concerning an Uzbek boy who was trafficked to Kazakhstan to 
work in a forced labour situation and whose whereabouts were unknown.  
</p>
<p>33. According to the information received, B.I., aged 17, is a resident of the Khiva town 
of the Khorezm region, Uzbekistan.  In May 2008, B.I. and four young Uzbek men were 
recruited by B.B., a citizen of Uzbekistan aged 56, to travel to Kazakhstan as labor 
migrants.  B.B. promised them and their parents that he would take care of their 
employment in Kazakhstan.  He also assured them that being the oldest in the group, he 
would look after the young men during their stay in Kazakhstan.  
</p>
<p>34. Upon their arrival in Kazakhstan, the young men were taken to a house of N.M., 
located in Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast.  B.B. received $5,000 from N.M. in 
exchange of the young men and handed over their passports to N.M. before he disappeared.  
The young men were forced to carry out a variety of work in N.M.&#8217;s house, including 
construction work.  They were forced to work under harsh conditions and without 
appropriate food and compensation.  Approximately two months after the young men left 
for Kazakhstan, B.B. appeared in Khiva.  B.I.&#8217;s mother went to see B.B. to ask how her son 
was.  B.B. assured the mother that all the young men were well and that they would soon be 
sending money they earned in Kazakhstan.  However, B.I.&#8217;s mother never heard from her 
son, as all the young men were not given any opportunity to contact their families in 
Uzbekistan.  The young men except B.I. eventually managed to escape the house and return 
to Khiva. 
</p>
<p>35. In December 2008, B.I.&#8217;s mother lodged an appeal to the Department of Internal 
Affairs in the Khiva district and to the Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan in 
Uzbekistan to search for her son.  However, she did not receive any responses from the 
authorities.  Concerned for her son&#8217;s safety and desperate to find him, she travelled to 
N.M.&#8217;s house in Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast on 12 June 2009.  When she arrived at 
N.M.&#8217;s house, he shouted at her in the Kazakh language, throwing the passports of the 
young Uzbek men who were forced to work in his house.  He told her that B.I. was taken 
by a Police Major from Shimkent city in Yuzhno-Kazakhstanskaya oblast. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteurs asked the Government to verify the accuracy of the facts 
alleged in the summary. They also requested the Government to provide the full details of 
any actions or measures undertaken to identify the whereabouts of B.I. and to ensure his 
safety and protection.  They further asked whether complaints were lodged by or on behalf 
of the alleged victims against N.M.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteurs also requested the Government to provide the details of any 
actions taken against N.M. in his alleged involvement in the crime of trafficking as well as 
the details of any actions taken to ascertain the identity of the Police Major and his role in 
the trafficking and disappearance of B.I., and in particular whether B.I. was being held in 
captivity by him. 
</p>
<p>38. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to provide the 
details, and where available the results, of any other investigation, judicial or other inquiries 
which may have been carried out in relation to this case.  They also requested information 
on the details of any measures or actions undertaken by the Embassy of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan in Uzbekistan in response to the appeal submitted by B.I.&#8217;s mother and whether </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>the victims or the families of the victims had access to adequate procedures of 
compensation for damages from those legally responsible.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteurs asked for information on the current policies and the 
preventive and awareness raising measures taken to tackle the issue of human trafficking in 
Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast, Kazakhstan. They also asked information on whether 
law enforcement agencies, especially the Police, Immigration, Border Guards and Labour 
Inspectors, had received appropriate training on identification of victims of trafficking and 
protection of their human rights. Finally, the Special Rapporteurs requested the 
Government to provide statistical information on prosecution of cases of trafficking in 
court, including the number of cases in which conviction was secured.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Response  
</b></p>
<p>40. On 20 December 2009, the Government replied to the communication sent on 20 
October 2009, highlighting that the internal affairs organs of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
were conducting investigations in order to ascertain the facts regarding the economic 
exploitation of a citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan by N.M., a citizen of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan. With a view to making a thorough and objective appraisal of the evidence and 
issuing a procedural ruling, the Office of the Procurator and the Department of Internal 
Affairs of the province of Kyzylorda were preparing a request to the law enforcement 
agencies of the Republic of Uzbekistan that they question B.I. in order to fully clarify the 
circumstances of the case. 
</p>
<p>41. The Government also highlighted that the Criminal Police Committee of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kazakhstan received an application from a human rights 
group based in Khorezm for assistance in the search for B.I. It further added that the 
internal affairs agencies of Kazakhstan spearheaded the hunt for the missing person by 
undertaking criminal investigations and inquiries, and medical establishments likewise 
made some checks in an endeavour to establish his whereabouts. 
</p>
<p>42. In its response, the Government informed that pursuant to paragraph 27 of the 
Instruction concerning a unified procedure for conducting interstate searches for persons, 
which was approved by the decision of the Council of Ministers of Internal Affairs of the 
States Parties of the Commonwealth of Independent States of 7 September 2007, the above-
mentioned application was forwarded to the Central Department for Criminal Investigation 
and Counterterrorism of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Uzbekistan with a view to 
initiating investigations and an international search for B.I. It further highlighted that the 
staff of the internal affairs agencies of Kazakhstan again contacted the human rights group 
in order to exchange information on B.I&#8217;s whereabouts. According to the letter from the 
human rights group dated 3 December 2009, B.I. was then at home. 
</p>
<p>43. The Government also informed that in May 2008, B.B. approached N.M. in order to 
propose the services of his 10-person &#8220;team&#8221; to work on building sites &#8211; to which N.M. 
agreed. In June 2008, B.B. and his building team, minus B.I. who was then at another 
N.M.&#8217;s building site, received the sum of US$3,000 and vanished without completing the 
building. B.I. stayed on for two to three months.  
</p>
<p>44. During that time, he regularly spoke to his parents by telephone. He received food 
and clothing and did odd jobs. They did not subject him to pressure or force. In the autumn 
of 2008, B.I. left the house and did not return. N.M. tried in vain to find him. In the spring 
of 2009, B.I&#8217;s mother came to the town of Kyzylorda to search for her son. On meeting her, 
N.M. explained that B.I. had worked for him and lived at his house, but that he did not 
possess any information regarding his current whereabouts. B.I. did not lay a complaint 
with law enforcement agencies regarding any unlawful actions on the part of N.M or </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>officials of the Department of Internal Affairs of South Kazakhstan or the province of 
Kyzylorda.  
</p>
<p>45. The Government also provided information and contact details of the Police Major 
and highlighted that no information was available about any investigations, judicial or other 
inquiries in relation to this case. According to information supplied by the Embassy of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan in Uzbekistan, it did not receive any complaints or applications 
from B.I.&#8217;s mother, or anyone else, in connection with this case at any point in 2008. 
</p>
<p>46. The Government also referred to some of the provisions of the code of criminal 
procedure, notably article 163 and 162, paragraphs 1 and 2 and described the governmental 
structure in place to deal with human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>47. In its response, the Government also highlighted that it was gradually implementing 
plans to combat and prevent crimes related to human smuggling and have launched 
information campaigns to counter human trafficking.  It further informed that in 2009, as a 
result of the latest steps, anti-trafficking units initiated criminal proceedings in 265 cases. 
The Government also provided extensive information on the activities and programmes 
being implemented in its territory. 
</p>
<p>48. Finally, the Government informed that according to the statistical data supplied by 
the Legal Statistics Committee and in particular by the Office of the Procurator General on 
enforceable sentences for crimes under article 128 of the Criminal Code (human 
trafficking), the number of convictions was as follows: in 2007, three persons; in 2008, five 
persons; and in the first nine months of 2009, five persons. The number of convictions for 
crimes under article 133 of the Criminal Code (trafficking in minors) was as follows: in 
2007, three persons; in 2008, one person; and in the first nine months of 2009, six persons. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Mexico 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication of 30 September 2009 
</b></p>
<p>49. By letter dated 30 September 2009, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur trafficking in persons, especially women and children, sent an urgent appeal to 
the Government of M&#233;xico concerning children missing from Mexican care institutions run 
by a Christian organization called &#8220;Iglesia Restaurada Cristiana&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>50. According to the information received, <b>J.C.C.B. </b>(10 years old), <b>A.G.C.B. </b>(13 years 
old); and <b>D.L.B.H.</b> (12 years old), were missing from the institution named &#8220;Centro de 
Adaptaci&#243;n e Integraci&#243;n Familiar A.C.&#8221; (&#8220;CAIFAC&#8221;), located in San Nicol&#225;s de los Garza, 
Nuevo Le&#243;n, M&#233;xico.  <b>I.M.C.M.</b> (10 years old when entering the centre in 2007), <b>J.A. </b>(1 
year old when entering the centre in 2007) and the brothers <b>A.I.J.O.</b>, <b>N.I.J.O.</b> and 
<b>H.M.J.O. </b>(respectively 15, 13 and 11 years old when entering the centre in 2006), were 
missing from the institution &#8220;Casitas del Sur&#8221; in San Pedro M&#224;rtir and in San Miguel 
Xicot&#233;ncatl, in Tlalpan, Distrito Federal.  
</p>
<p>51. Concerning the situation occurring in CAIFAC, J.C.C.B. and A.G.C.B. had been in 
the custody of this centre since they were 1 year old and 2 years old respectively. Their 
mother was very poor and did not have any means to support her children, except to beg on 
the street.  P.M., the director of CAIFAC, found them on the street and offered to take the 
children, assuring the mother that she could go and visit them anytime.  Similarly, 
D.L.B.H.&#8217;s mother did not have any financial resources to support her. Thus she left 
D.L.B.H. with CAIFAC in 2006, so that she could be properly taken care of.   
</p>
<p>52. The whereabouts of the children were unknown.  The mothers saw their children last 
in July 2008 and had been denied access to them since then, despite their requests on 
several occasions.  In December 2008, the mothers of the children presented a complaint </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>against CAIFAC before the &#8220;Agencia del Ministerio P&#250;blico Especializado en Justicia 
Familiar&#8221; (the District Attorney&#180;s Office Specialized on Family Justice) for denying access 
to their children. While the District Attorney&#8217;s Office apparently interviewed P.M., the said 
Office did not order CAIFAC to allow the mothers to see their children.   
</p>
<p>53. There were concerns with respect to the welfare of these children, particularly in 
light of the allegation that B.C.B.H., who is D.L.B.H&#8217;s sister, and other children in the 
custody of CAIFAC were locked in a wardrobe with their hands tied and forced to eat 
rotten food as a punishment, after B.C.B.H. unsuccessfully attempted to escape from 
CAIFAC.  
</p>
<p>54. Concerning the situation occurring in Casitas del Sur, Distrito Federal, it was 
reported that the children held in that centre had been subjected to ill-treatment. In 
particular, they were allegedly beaten, left without food for 1 or 2 days, closed in dark 
rooms or in closets for up to 2 days, and prevented from seeing their parents. 
</p>
<p>55. Following an order of apprehension issued by a local judge, 116 children were 
rescued from two institutions in San Pedro M&#224;rtir and in San Miguel Xicot&#233;ncatl, in 
Tlalpan on 29 January 2009. However, 11 minors were missing from these centers, 
including the five minors mentioned above. Their parents or family members had 
previously gotten back the legal custody on the children through a judicial order, but the 
director of the centre, E.C.M., had repeatedly refused to hand over the children. She told the 
father of the three missing brothers A.I.J.O., N.I.J.O. and H.M.J.O., that he would not get 
his children back and asked him to sign papers that authorized her to adopt his children, 
which he refused to do. The whereabouts of the missing children were still unknown.  
</p>
<p>56. According to the father, his three sons were initially handed to a temporary centre of 
the Procuradur&#237;a general de Justicia del Distrito Federal (PGJDF), the Public Prosecution 
Office of the Federal District. However, later on the parents realized that two weeks later 
their children were transferred to Casitas del Sur, without their consent and without being 
informed of the transfer. Also, the father applied for permission to visit his children, but he 
was not allowed to do so for 6 months because the granting of the authorization was 
delayed by the responsible officers of Agency 5-B of the PGJDF, who also refused to give 
him information about his children. The responsibilities of these two PGJDF officers in 
delaying the visits and withholding information, and of the director and attorney of the 
PGJDF centre, in relation to the transfer of the children to Casitas del Sur, had still not been 
clarified. 
</p>
<p>57. It was reported that the care institutions founded by &#8220;Iglesia Restaurada Cristiana&#8221;, 
including CAIFAC and &#8220;Casitas del Sur&#8221;, have been implicated in the disappearance of 
children across Mexico. Moreover, according to testimonies of some of the children who 
have been rescued from the &#8220;Casitas del Sur&#8221;, a man accompanied by foreigners repeatedly 
came to the centre and took away children who never came back. Also according to a 
former member of the &#8220;Iglesia Restaurada Cristiana&#8221;, the disappearance of minors has been 
a reality for many years because the members of the congregation &#8220;Iglesia Restaurada 
Cristiana&#8221; were just taking some children of their liking without papers or following any 
adoption procedures.  
</p>
<p>58. In this connection, the &#8220;Subprocuradur&#237;a de Investigaci&#243;n Especializada en 
Delincuencia Organizada&#8221; (the Agency of Specialized Investigation on Organized 
Delinquency, under the umbrella of the Federal Attorney&#8217;s Office) commenced 
investigation of the case for the crime of organized delinquency and trafficking.  On 16 
August 2009, a Federal Judge signed an order of apprehension against three individuals &#8211; 
namely, the director of &#8220;Casitas del Sur&#8221;, the preacher of &#8220;Iglesia Restaurada Cristiana&#8221;, 
and an English teacher.  The order against P.M. was issued but not executed, as she 
apparently fled the country.  According to the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, these individuals </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>were suspected of trafficking and executing an illegal transfer of children to overseas 
without the consent of their parents.  In particular, they were implicated in the 
disappearance and trafficking of 14 children, including the three above named children 
missing from CAIFAC. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteurs asked the Government whether the facts alleged in the 
summary were accurate.  The Special Rapporteurs then requested full details of the 
progress of the prosecutions undertaken against E.C., A.E.C.C., L.A.C., and P.M.  They 
also requested the Government to provide details, and where available results, of any other 
investigation, judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to this 
case, including in relation to officers of the PGJDF.   
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteurs further requested full details of any action undertaken to 
verify whether the children were in the custody of CAIFAC or Casitas del Sur, or, if they 
were missing, to identify the whereabouts of the missing children.  They also requested 
information on: the preventive measures taken to ensure that competent oversight of care 
institutions for minors in Mexico was exercised (including regular controls of the facilities 
and verifications that visits by parents were regularly allowed) in order to ensure the safety 
and protection of children in the custody of these institutions; measures or steps taken to 
ensure that parents and legal guardians were provided with appropriate assistance in raising 
children in a manner which respects and promotes the rights of children as enshrined in the 
CRC; and the current policies and the preventive and awareness raising measures taken to 
tackle the issue of human trafficking and sale of children in Mexico. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteurs finally asked the Government to indicate whether the 
families of the victims had access to adequate procedures of compensation for damages 
from those legally responsible. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Observations  
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Mexico has not provided a 
reply to the communication to date and calls upon the Government to provide information 
as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Nepal 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication of 15 October 2010 
</b></p>
<p>63. On 15 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of slavery and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
sent a letter of allegation regarding information received concerning an estimated 70,000 
child bonded labourers who worked in the so-called &#171; rat mines &#187; of Jaintia Hills, which is 
located in the North Eastern State of Meghalaya, India. 
</p>
<p>64. According to information received, an estimated 70,000 bonded child labourers from 
Nepal and Bangladesh worked at the so-called &#8220;rat mines&#8221; of Jaintia Hills, Meghalaya 
State, India. The mines are reportedly known as such, because of the narrow and crude 
holes dug into the hills where only children can pass. It is estimated that about 40,000 
children from Bangladesh and 30,000 children from Nepal worked at the mines. In most 
cases, the children were allegedly purchased by middlemen or abducted or sold by gangs in 
Nepal and Bangladesh to the mining mafia in Meghalaya. The children were allegedly sent 
to the mines after their parents accepted money from middlemen engaged in child 
trafficking. The price for a child varies from 50 to 75 US dollars. It is claimed that 
everyday, trucks transporting coal to Bangladesh return with children, who were lured into 
the mining industry with the promise of better wages and living conditions. The children </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>were in debt bondage situations, as they were not paid for their work in some cases so that 
they repay with their labour the price for which they were bought.  In other cases, the 
children were given half wage compared to adults, which left them with very little money 
to survive on as expenses for their good were deducted from their wages.  
</p>
<p>65. The working conditions at the mines were allegedly hazardous, unhygienic, cruel 
and inhuman. The children were threatened not to disclose their identity to anyone they 
meet and they had no freedom to move from the premises of the mines. The working hours 
were long and the children had no rest from the day break to the nightfall. They had no 
means to communicate with the outside world, let alone their families. The children were 
not provided with any safety equipment and were only given shovels or pickaxes to extract 
coal or limestone. Further, it appears that deaths of children were common due to the unsafe 
working conditions at Jaintia Hills and often remained unreported. According to the 
information received, human skeletons were recovered beneath a pile of coal in the mine in 
Jaintia Hills and it had been verified that they were the remains of children who lost their 
lives due to suffocation in the mine shafts or in other accidents during the mining 
operations.  
</p>
<p>66. The information received also suggests that the children lived in very poor 
conditions. They reportedly lived in huts made with plastic sheets and there were no proper 
sanitary facilities. There was a lack of safe drinking water and proper sewage system. 
Although many people fell ill due to the poor living conditions, there were no medical 
facilities available near the mines.  
</p>
<p>67. It is alleged that girls were also often bought by the owners of the &#8220;rat mines&#8221; and 
subjected to sexual exploitation. They were exploited not only by mine owners, but also 
managers, other older workers and even truck drivers. There is also information suggesting 
that some children were trafficked further from the mines to the cities for sexual 
exploitation.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteurs sought a verification of the allegations from the 
Government, including details of actions or investigations undertaken to identify the 
Nepalese children working at the &#8220;rat mines&#8221; and to verify their working conditions; 
investigations carried out in relation to individuals who are implicated in trafficking or 
selling the Nepalese children to the &#8220;rat mines&#8221; and keeping them in bonded labour; 
information on policies and the preventive and awareness-raising measures undertaken to 
prevent human trafficking, sale of children and sexual exploitation of children in Nepal; 
information on whether the victims or the families of the victims have access to adequate 
procedures of compensation for damages from those legally responsible for the trafficking 
in children, the sale of children, sexual exploitation of children, and the use of bonded 
labour; and details on any cooperation arrangements with the Indian authorities to facilitate 
the rapid identification of the Nepalese children working at the &#8220;rat mines&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Observations 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received a reply from the Government of 
Nepal to her letter of 15 October 2010, and invites the Government to provide her with 
information regarding the allegations set out in her letter. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Pakistan 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication of 9 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p>70. By letter dated 9 February 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur trafficking in persons, especially women and children, sent a letter of allegation </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>to the Government concerning 988 Pakistani children who were previously trafficked to the 
United Arab Emirates as child camel jockeys and have not received compensation to date. 
</p>
<p>71. According to information received, Rahimyar Khan District of Punjab Province, 
Pakistan, is said to be the leading source district for children who were trafficked for the 
purpose of camel racing in the Gulf States.  According to the research conducted by an 
international NGO in June 2004, it was estimated that approximately 15,000 children from 
the Rahimyar Khan District were trafficked as camel jockeys to the Gulf States, most 
notably to the United Arab Emirates (&#8220;UAE&#8221;).  It was reported that most of the children 
were sold to traffickers by their parents, who were very poor and lured to promises that 
their children would earn significant profits for their families as camel jockeys.  Reports 
also indicated that there were other groups of individuals who kidnapped children and sold 
them to the trafficking mafia.  The trafficked children were reportedly treated in an 
inhumane manner and suffered from physical injuries as well as from psychological trauma.  
They were kept in camel farms for 24 hours a day and were not allowed to leave the farms 
except when they took the camels out for exercise.  The living conditions in the farms were 
harsh in that the children slept on the ground and were poorly fed so that their weight was 
kept under 20 kilograms, which is deemed as the maximum optimal weight for camel 
jockeying.  They were also often subject to sexual abuse and beating, including electric 
shocks.  They were made to work from dawn until dusk, and constantly faced risks of death 
or serious injuries during the race.   
</p>
<p>72. Since 2005, the UAE intensified its efforts in eradicating the use of child camel 
jockeys and signed an agreement with United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (&#8220;UNICEF&#8221;) on 7 
May 2005 to repatriate child camel jockeys to their country of origin and to assist in their 
rehabilitation and reintegration.  With respect to the former child camel jockeys from 
Pakistan, the Ministry of Interior of the UAE and the Overseas Pakistani Division of the 
Ministry of Labour, Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis of the Republic of Pakistan 
reportedly established a Claims Settlement Facility in accordance with the Memorandum of 
Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) on 25 April 2007 to hear and determine individual claims of 
physical and non-physical injury by former child camel jockeys.  The Claims Settlement 
Facility is administered by an Administrative Board, which consists of two members 
appointed by the Government of Pakistan and one appointed by the Ministry of Interior of 
the Government of the UAE.   
</p>
<p>73. According to the information received, the Claims Settlement Facility allegedly 
failed to provide former child camel jockeys with compensation.  Firstly, it was alleged that 
the former child camel jockeys were not well-informed about the existence of the Claims 
Settlement Facility.  A newspaper notice about the offer of financial relief to former child 
camel jockeys by the Government of the UAE reportedly appeared in Daily Khabrian in 
Multan on 13 May 2008 and on 23 June 2008, and in Daily Dawn in Lahore on 24 June 
2008 respectively.  It was alleged that these notices did not serve their purpose, as most of 
the former child camel jockeys are illiterate and live in remote areas where these 
newspapers do not reach.  Secondly, while the Administrative Board was required under the 
MOU to designate one or more NGO(s) to extend legal or other assistance to the claimants 
to submit claims, the Administrative Board assigned the tasks to the Child Protection and 
Welfare Bureau of the Government of Punjab, whose officers were allegedly not properly 
trained to assist the claimants.  There were allegations that the officers failed to consider 
claims in light of all evidence available.  According to the information received, there are 
currently 988 former child camel jockeys whose claims are still pending and have not been 
provided compensation.   
</p>
<p>74. On 18 September 2009, a complaint about the ineffectiveness of the Claims 
Settlement Facility was submitted to the Secretary of the Social Welfare and Women 
Development Department, Government of Punjab, Lahore.  The complaint was also </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>reportedly submitted to the following Ministries and Government departments on 28 
September 2009:  
</p>
<p> (a) The Secretary, Ministry of Labour &amp; Overseas Pakistanis, Government of 
Pakistan, Islamabad; 
</p>
<p> (b) The Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad; 
</p>
<p> (c) The Secretary, Ministry of Social Welfare &amp; Special Education, Government 
of Pakistan, Islamabad;

<p> (f) The Secretary, Home Department, Government of Punjab, Lahore; and  
</p>
<p> (g) The Director General, Child Protection &amp; Welfare Bureau, Government of 
Punjab, Lahore.  
</p>
<p>75. It was alleged that these Ministries and Government departments have not taken any 
action about the complaint. 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteurs asked whether the facts alleged in the summary were 
accurate and requested the Government to provide information on the status of claims 
submitted on behalf of the 988 former child camel jockeys concerned in this case.  The 
Special Rapporteurs asked whether the claims have been considered by the Claims 
Settlement Facility and if they have been refused, asked the Government to explain grounds 
on which the claims were refused. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteurs further requested full statistical information on the 
compensation process, including the number of claims which have been submitted to the 
Claims Settlement Facility, the number of claims which have been accepted, the amount of 
disbursement made to date, and how these disbursements have reached the former child 
camel jockeys.  The Special Rapporteurs also requested information on: measures taken to 
ensure that only the child camel jockey victims benefited from the Claims Settlement 
Facility;  awareness-raising efforts undertaken to inform former child camel jockeys of the 
existence of the Claims Settlement Facility; any measures undertaken to rehabilitate and 
reintegrate the former child camel jockeys who have been repatriated to Pakistan; NGO(s) 
who were in partnership with the government in relation to extending legal or other 
assistance to the claimants in respect of the Claims Settlement Facility for the former child 
camel jockey victims; and any measures undertaken to ensure that the former child camel 
jockeys will not be re-trafficked or be subject to other forms of exploitation.

<p><b> 2. Observations 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Pakistan has not provided a 
reply to the communication to date and continues to receive information that the children 
concerned still have not been provided any compensation.  The Special Rapporteur calls 
upon the Government to provide information on the questions raised in the communication 
as soon as possible.   </p>

<p><b> 1. Communication of 9 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p>79. By letter dated 9 February 2010, Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, sent a letter of 
allegation to the United Arab Emirates concerning 988 Pakistani child camel jockeys who 
were previously trafficked to the United Arab Emirates and who have not been provided 
with compensation to date.   
</p>
<p>80. According to the information received, Rahimyar Khan District of Punjab Province, 
Pakistan, is said to be the leading source district for children who were trafficked for the 
purpose of camel racing in the Gulf States.  According to the research conducted by an 
international NGO in June 2004, it was estimated that approximately 15,000 children from 
the Rahimyar Khan District were trafficked as camel jockeys to the Gulf States, most 
notably to the United Arab Emirates.  It was reported that most of the children were sold to 
traffickers by their parents, who were very poor and lured to promises that their children 
would earn significant profits for their families as camel jockeys.  Reports also indicated 
that there were other groups of individuals who kidnapped children and sold them to the 
trafficking mafia.  The trafficked children were reportedly treated in an inhumane manner 
and suffered from physical injuries as well as from psychological trauma.  They were kept 
in camel farms for 24 hours a day and were not allowed to leave the farms except when 
they took the camels out for exercise.  The living conditions in the farms were harsh in that 
the children slept on the ground and were poorly fed so that their weight was kept under 20 
kilograms, which is deemed as the maximum optimal weight for camel jockeying.  They 
were also often subject to sexual abuse and beating, including electric shocks.  They were 
made to work from dawn until dusk, and constantly faced risks of death or serious injuries 
during the race.   
</p>
<p>81. Since 2005, the Government reportedly intensified its efforts in eradicating the use 
of child camel jockeys and consequently signed an agreement with United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (&#8220;UNICEF&#8221;) on 7 May 2005 to repatriate child camel jockeys to their 
country of origin and to assist in their rehabilitation and reintegration.  With respect to the 
former child camel jockeys from Pakistan, the Ministry of Interior of the UAE and the 
Overseas Pakistani Division of the Ministry of Labour, Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis 
of the Republic of Pakistan reportedly established a Claims Settlement Facility in 
accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) on 25 April 2007 to hear 
and determine individual claims of physical and non-physical injury by former child camel 
jockeys.  The Claims Settlement Facility is administered by an Administrative Board, 
which consists of two members appointed by the Government of Pakistan and one 
appointed by the Ministry of Interior of the Government of the UAE.   
</p>
<p>82. According to the information received, the Claims Settlement Facility allegedly 
failed to provide former child camel jockeys with compensation.  Firstly, it was alleged that 
the former child camel jockeys were not well-informed about the existence of the Claims 
Settlement Facility.  A newspaper notice about the offer of financial relief to former child 
camel jockeys by the Government of the United Arab Emirates reportedly appeared in 
Daily Khabrian in Multan on 13 May 2008 and on 23 June 2008, and in Daily Dawn in 
Lahore on 24 June 2008 respectively.  It was alleged that these notices did not serve their 
purpose, as most of the former child camel jockeys are illiterate and live in remote areas 
where these newspapers do not reach.  Secondly, while the Administrative Board was 
required under the MOU to designate one or more NGO(s) to extend legal or other 
assistance to the claimants to submit claims, the Administrative Board assigned the tasks to 
the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau of the Government of Punjab, Pakistan, whose 
officers were allegedly not properly trained to assist the claimants.  There were allegations </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>that the officers failed to consider claims in light of all evidence available.  According to 
the information received, there are currently 988 former child camel jockeys whose claims 
are still pending and have not been provided compensation.  Thirdly, the Claims Settlement 
Facility was to be terminated upon distribution of the awards in the manner determined by 
the Administrative Board in accordance with section 6 of the MOU.  However, the 
Government allegedly terminated the Claims Settlement Facility already on 31 March 2009 
without providing compensation to the 988 claimants concerned. 
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteurs asked the Government to verify whether the facts alleged 
in the summary of the case were accurate.  The Special Rapporteurs also inquired about the 
status of claims submitted on behalf of the 988 former child camel jockeys concerned in 
this case and whether the claims have been considered by the Claims Settlement Facility.  If 
they have been refused, the Special Rapporteurs sought explanations from the Government 
on the grounds on which the claims were refused. 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteurs also requested full statistical information on the 
compensation process, including the number of claims which have been submitted to the 
Claims Settlement Facility, the number of claims which have been accepted, the amount of 
disbursement made to date, and how these disbursements have reached the former child 
camel jockeys.  Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs requested information on: measures 
taken to ensure that only the child camel jockey victims benefit from the Claims Settlement 
Facility; awareness-raising efforts undertaken to inform former child camel jockeys of the 
existence of the Claims Settlement Facility; any bilateral support provided to the 
Government of Pakistan to facilitate the rehabilitation and reintegration of the former child 
camel jockeys who have been repatriated to Pakistan.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. Observations 
</b></p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received a reply fromm the Government 
of the United Arab Emirates to her letter of 9 February 2010, and invites the Government to 
provide her with information regarding the allegations set out in her letter. 
</p>
<p><b> H. United States of America 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication of 14 January 2010 
</b></p>
<p>86. On 14 January 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication concerning 
allegations of State inaction with regard to 6 year-old A-L.M.A.K-P., who was reportedly 
suffering physical and sexual abuse, neglect and possible exploitation in pornography, by 
her father and his friends, since June 2008.  
</p>
<p>87. According to information received, A-L.M.A.K-P. lived with her father, Dr. M.H.P. 
in Washington, DC. M.H.P. isolated the child and kept her in an unkempt one room 
apartment with a queen size bed, no windows, and isolated stairs that lead to her bedroom. 
She was prevented from having contact with other children outside of school, and had been 
isolated from her extended family, friends and religious community.  
</p>
<p>88. It is alleged that at least four reports to the Washington DC Child and Family 
Services Agency (CFSA) were made by three professionals disclosing their respective 
suspicions that A-L.M.A.K-P. was being neglected and physically and sexually abused after 
assessing all medical records, school records and other information. The CFSA is mandated 
by law to investigate, protect and provide services for abused and neglected children. Dr. 
L.S., a child psychologist, stated her opinion on 14 August 2008 that there was clinical 
evidence suggesting that A-L.M.A.K-P. was being sexually abused.  On April 20, 2009, Dr. 
J.S. reported her suspicions that the child is a victim of sexual abuse and physical and 
medical neglect.  Dr. R.S. also stated in his affidavit of 15 April 2009 that the child was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>suffering from neutropenia and had not been receiving adequate treatment. In fact, Dr. R.S. 
previously made a report in October 2008 regarding inadequate follow-up of her 
neutropenia, further to which allegedly no thorough investigation occurred.  Additional 
medical documentation indicated a possible diagnosis of oral and genital herpes.   
</p>
<p>89. According to information received, the CFSA refused to provide reasons for not 
conducting thorough investigations of these allegations.  The mother of the child, Dr. A.K. 
had filed a &#8220;freedom of information act request&#8221; requesting all documentation relating to A-
L.M.A.K-P. and/or Dr. A.K. from the CFSA. The CFSA denied the request, so Dr. A.K. 
had since appealed that denial to the Washington DC&#8217;s Mayor&#8217;s office. 
</p>
<p>90. Furthermore, A-L.M.A.K-P. was allegedly being exploited by her father and his 
friends and colleagues, through use in pornography and other forms of sexual exploitation. 
A-L.M.A.K-P. had been visited by a social worker and a special police detective but 
according to information received, the child was not identified by such authorities as being 
isolated, nor suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, nor a potential victim of 
pornography.  
</p>
<p>91. According to information received, Dr. A.K. had filed complaints to the Police of 
Washington, DC and to the Child and Family Services Agency, Washington, DC without 
having received any information on progress or status of such complaints. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Response and observations 
</b></p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its response of 3 March 2010, 
provided through the Child and Family Services Agency of the Government of the District 
of Columbia. The Government stated that since there are cases pending in the Superior 
Court where Dr. A.K. is suing for custody, and in the Court of Appeal where she is 
pursuing her Freedom of Information Act request, it is limited in what it can discuss in this 
matter. The Government also stated that it cannot comment on the contents or findings of 
the investigation due to the confidentiality laws of the district of Columbia. However, the 
Government stated that the &#8220;mandated reporters&#8221; mentioned in the letter of the Special 
Rapporteur had no contact with the child and that CFSA did conduct a thorough 
investigation of the allegations on multiple occasions. It added that the allegations of 
medical neglect and sex abuse have been lodged by the mother in multiple jurisdictions 
including Maryland, Virginia, New York and the District of Columbia. A parent may obtain 
copies of the investigation summaries if they are founded or inconclusive but not if 
unfounded as those reports are expunged from the Child Protection Registry. Further, the 
Government stated that the child has no contact with the mother because a court order from 
the Commonwealth of Virginia prohibits it. 
</p>
<p>93. The Government stated that the letter is the first mention of any allegation that   A-
L.M.A.K-P. was being exploited by her father and his friends and colleagues through use in 
pornography and other forms of sexual exploitation. The Government added that the mother 
had not provided any evidence of such practices to any authority in the District of 
Columbia, and noted that any new allegations of facts that support any claim of child abuse 
or neglect should be conveyed to the CFSA hotline at (202)671&#8211;SAFE(7233).

<p><b> 1. Communication of 20 October 2009 
</b></p>
<p>94. By letter dated 20 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, sent a letter of allegation to the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>Government of Uzbekistan concerning the Uzbek boy who has been trafficked to 
Kazakhstan to work in a forced labour situation and whose whereabouts were unknown.  
</p>
<p>95. According to the information received, B.I., aged 17, is a resident of the Khiva town 
of the Khorezm region, Uzbekistan.  In May 2008, B.I. and four young Uzbek men were 
recruited by B.B., a citizen of Uzbekistan aged 56, to travel to Kazakhstan as labor 
migrants.  B.B. promised them and their parents that he would take care of their 
employment in Kazakhstan.  He also assured them that being the oldest in the group, he 
would look after the young men during their stay in Kazakhstan.    
</p>
<p>96. Upon their arrival in Kazakhstan, the young men were taken to a house of N.M., 
located in Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast.  B.B. received $5,000 from N.M. in 
exchange of the young men and handed over their passports to N.M. before he disappeared.  
The young men were forced to carry out a variety of work in N.M.&#8217;s house, including 
construction work.  They were forced to work under harsh conditions and without 
appropriate food and compensation.  Approximately two months after the young men left 
for Kazakhstan, B.B. appeared in Khiva.  B.I.&#8217;s mother went to see B.B. to ask how her son 
was.  B.B. assured the mother that all the young men were well and that they would soon be 
sending money they earned in Kazakhstan.  However, B.I.&#8217;s mother never heard from her 
son, as all the young men were not given any opportunity to contact their families in 
Uzbekistan.  The young men except B.I. eventually managed to escape the house and return 
to Khiva.        
</p>
<p>97. In December 2008, B.I.&#8217;s mother lodged an appeal to the Department of Internal 
Affairs in the Khiva district and to the Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan in 
Uzbekistan to search for her son.  However, she did not receive any responses from the 
authorities.  Concerned for her son&#8217;s safety and desperate to find him, on 12 June 2009, she 
travelled to N.M.&#8217;s house in Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast by her own means.  When 
she arrived at N.M.&#8217;s house, he shouted at her in the Kazakh language, throwing the 
passports of the young Uzbek men who were forced to work in his house.  He told her that 
B.I. was taken by a Police Major from Shimkent city in Yuzhno-Kazakhstanskaya oblast.       
</p>
<p>98. It was reported that B.B. has deceived a number of individuals from the Khorezm 
region in a similar manner and the Department of Internal Affairs in the Khiva district 
commenced criminal proceedings against him under Article 135 of the Uzbek Criminal 
Code (Human Trafficking).  However, B.B. had not been apprehended and the whereabouts 
of B.I. were unknown.     
</p>
<p>99. The Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to verify the accuracy of the 
facts alleged in the summary. They also asked the Government to provide full details of: 
any actions or measures undertaken to identify the whereabouts of B.I. and to ensure his 
safety and protection, and the progress of the prosecution undertaken against B.B.  Further, 
they requested the Government to provide the details, and where available the results, of 
any other investigation, judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in 
relation to this case.   
</p>
<p>100. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to provide 
information on the measures taken to ensure rehabilitation and reintegration of the four 
young Uzbek men who managed to escape from the house of N.M.. They also requested the 
Government to indicate whether the victims or the families of the victims had access to 
adequate procedures of compensation for damages from those legally responsible.  
</p>
<p>101. Finally, the Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to provide information 
on the current policies and the preventive and awareness raising measures taken to tackle 
the issue of human trafficking in Uzbekistan and on what action were being taken by the 
Government to address the root causes of trafficking such as poverty and high youth 
unemployment. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.1

</p>
<p><b> 2. Response 
</b></p>
<p>102. By letter dated 25 November 2009, the Government of Uzbekistan responded to the 
Special Rapporteurs' communication of 20 October 2009.  The Government responded that 
the investigative section of the Department of Internal Affairs of Khiva district instituted 
criminal proceedings against B.B..  The investigation revealed that B.B. deceived B.I. and 
other citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan by promising monthly wages of US$500 and 
taking them to the Kyzyl-Ordinsk province of the Republic of Kazakhstan where he forced 
them to work in various places without pay.  
</p>
<p>103. The Government also informed that on 8 November 2009, B.B. was arrested and 
placed in remand centre No. 6 in Urgench. Criminal proceedings were instituted against 
B.B. on 8 November 2009 and investigations were still continuing. It was ascertained that 
B.I. returned to Uzbekistan on 8 November 2009 and he was living with his parents in the 
district of Khiva.    
</p>
<p>104. The Government informed that it was taking steps to improve national legislation to 
counter and combat this kind of criminal activity.  For example, the Act on countering the 
trafficking in persons was adopted on 17 April 2008 and the definition of the term 
&#8220;trafficking in persons&#8221; contained therein is consonant with that set forth in article 3 of the 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and 
Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime.   
</p>
<p>105. In its response, the Government highlighted that pursuant to this law, the 
presidential decree of 8 July 2008 approved a national plan of action to boost the 
effectiveness of the fight against trafficking in persons for the period 2008&#8211;2010.  The 
presidential decree established the Republican Interdepartmental Commission to Counter 
Trafficking in Persons, which is a coordination body consisting of the heads of government 
bodies and community organizations, including the Ministries of Internal Affairs, Foreign 
Affairs, Justice, the Economy, Finances, Health and Labour and Social Welfare, the 
National Security Service, the State Customs Committee, the Women&#8217;s Committee, the 
National Human Rights Centre, the Human Rights Commissioner of the Oliy Majlis 
(ombudsman), the Mahalla Foundation, the Central Council of the Kamolot youth 
movement and the Ijtimoii Fikr public opinion research centre. Local interdepartmental 
commissions to counter the trafficking in persons were set up in all regions of the country.   
</p>
<p>106. The Government informed that as part of the implementation of the law and the 
national plan, the Cabinet adopted a resolution on the establishment of a national 
rehabilitation centre to assist and protect victims of human trafficking.  The construction of 
the centre was almost complete and the centre was equipped with necessary equipment to 
provide the victims with effective medical, psychological, legal and social support.  
</p>
<p>107. The Ministry of Internal Affairs established a special unit to counter human 
trafficking on 26 February 2004.  The Ministry of Internal Affairs formulated and issued 
guidelines on the investigation of offences linked to human trafficking. In accordance with 
the 2008&#8211;2010 national plan of action to combat trafficking in persons, sociological and 
criminological surveys of problems connected with human trafficking were constantly 
conducted in conjunction with the Ijtimoii Fikr centre and the Manaviyat Va Marifat social 
centre. Special investigative units were also set up in the Republic of Karakalpakstan, in the 
provinces and in the municipality of Tashkent for the thorough investigation of offences 
related to the trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>108. In its response, the Government also informed that in order to stop clandestine 
labour migration, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare provided advice on the labour 
and migration laws in common destination countries at the Centre for Pre-departure 
Adaptation and Training and the Agency for Foreign Labour Migration.  The Ministry also </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>actively conducted information campaigns through television advertisements, banners, 
posters, theatre plays, publications, seminars and conferences. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Observations  
</b></p>
<p>109. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the detailed response provided by the 
Government and commends its efforts in successfully prosecuting the perpetrator and 
identifying whereabouts of B.I. who was missing at the time.  The Special Rapporteur 
would appreciate further information on measures implemented by the Government to 
ensure rehabilitation and reintegration of the children concerned upon their return to 
Uzbekistan.  The Special Rapporteur also remains interested in receiving information on 
measures undertaken by the Government to address the root causes of sale of children and 
trafficking, such as poverty and high youth unemployment.
