<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its twenty-second session from 4 to 15 
</p>
<p>May 2015. The review of Croatia was held at the 13th meeting, on 12 May 2015. The 
</p>
<p>delegation of Croatia was headed by the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
</p>
<p>Foreign and European Affairs, Vesna Pusi&#263;. At its 17th meeting, held on 15 May 2015, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group adopted the report on Croatia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Croatia: Bangladesh, Brazil and the former 
</p>
<p>Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following documents 
</p>
<p>were issued for the review of Croatia: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report (A/HRC/WG.6/22/HRV/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) (A/HRC/WG.6/22/HRV/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR (A/HRC/WG.6/22/HRV/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Mexico, the 
</p>
<p>Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
</p>
<p>Ireland and the United States of America was transmitted to Croatia through the troika. 
</p>
<p>These questions are available on the extranet of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of delegation, the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and 
</p>
<p>European Affairs, said she was proud of the progress made by Croatia in the human rights 
</p>
<p>area and was conscious that making progress was a continuous task. She pointed out that 
</p>
<p>the level of protection and the scope of definition of human rights was a basic test for any 
</p>
<p>State of its efficiency and functionality, highlighting especially minority rights, which could 
</p>
<p>be seen as reflecting the overall status of human rights in a country. Emphasis was placed 
</p>
<p>on the need for constant interaction between the State and civil society. The legislative and 
</p>
<p>institutional framework for the protection of human rights in Croatia was based on the 
</p>
<p>National Programme for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 2013&#8211;2016. 
</p>
<p>Croatia had four ombudswomen, one for human rights, one for women&#8217;s rights, one for the 
</p>
<p>rights of children and one for the rights of persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>6. The Minister highlighted, among other the issues, free legal aid, the rights of persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities, social rights, the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex 
</p>
<p>persons, national minorities, anti-discrimination, ethnic discrimination (specifically against 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups), hate crime, war crimes, the issue of missing persons, displaced persons 
</p>
<p>and human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>7. Concerning free legal aid, the new Free Legal Aid Act has two segments, one on 
</p>
<p>primary legal aid in the form of advice, which can be provided to everybody regardless of 
</p>
<p>income, and the other on secondary legal aid,  which is provided in cases before the court, 
</p>
<p>depending on the material status and assets of the citizen. Secondary legal aid can only be </p>


<p>provided by lawyers. Aid for victims of domestic violence is universally accessible without 
</p>
<p>an &#8220;income census&#8221; (information on income).  
</p>
<p>8. On the issue of the efficiency of the judiciary, the backlog of cases had decreased 
</p>
<p>from 1.6 million cases in 2004 to 579,032 cases as of May 2015. Although more effort was 
</p>
<p>needed, it was highlighted that the improvement was due, in particular, to specialized 
</p>
<p>courts. The reform of the courts and the public attorney&#8217;s system, the reduced number of 
</p>
<p>courts and public attorney offices, the introduction of information technology, including the 
</p>
<p>assignment of cases and a simpler misdemeanour procedure had also contributed to the 
</p>
<p>increased efficiency. 
</p>
<p>9. Croatia was still dealing with the consequences and the human rights challenges of 
</p>
<p>the war, even though the war had ended in 1995, just as every society had to deal with the 
</p>
<p>consequences and the brutalization that happen during war. Croatia had four specialized 
</p>
<p>courts, in its four biggest cities, with jurisdiction over war crimes. With regard to the 
</p>
<p>previous practice of sentencing people in absentia, all of those cases were being reviewed 
</p>
<p>and individuals who had been sentenced in absentia could request that their specific case be 
</p>
<p>reviewed. There were 16 cases before the European Court of Human Rights regarding war 
</p>
<p>crimes. In 3 of those cases, the Court had ruled in favour of the plaintiff, stating that the 
</p>
<p>procedures had indeed not been conducted as they should have; in another 3 cases, the 
</p>
<p>Court had reconfirmed the procedure and verdict by the Croatian court; and 10 cases had 
</p>
<p>been dismissed by the Court. That data reflect positively on the functioning, efficiency and 
</p>
<p>procedural correctness of the Croatian specialized courts. With regard to the prosecution for 
</p>
<p>war crimes, from 1992 to the end of 2014 proceedings were initiated against 3,553 persons, 
</p>
<p>of whom 589 were convicted and 220 were undergoing additional investigations.  
</p>
<p>10.  With regard to the issue of sexual violence during the war, a new bill would 
</p>
<p>recognize the rights of rape victims during the war, including the right to compensation.  
</p>
<p>11. The rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons were 
</p>
<p>extremely important and significant progress had been made since the first gay pride parade 
</p>
<p>was held in Zagreb 12 years previously, in a precarious atmosphere. Pride parades had 
</p>
<p>become a celebration of freedom rather than a struggle. In Split, the Government reacted to 
</p>
<p>the violence that had occurred during the first gay pride parade by having five government 
</p>
<p>ministers and the mayor of Split march in the following year&#8217;s parade. Not only through 
</p>
<p>legislation but also by leading by example, the State showed that it had a role to play in 
</p>
<p>defending human rights. The law on registered partnerships allowed lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
</p>
<p>transgender and intersex partners to have all the same rights as married couples except the 
</p>
<p>right to adopt children.  
</p>
<p>12. In Croatia, over 20 national minorities were recognized by the Constitution. The 
</p>
<p>status of Serbs and Roma was underlined. Information was shared on the constitutional 
</p>
<p>provisions for the protection of human rights of national minorities, including the eight 
</p>
<p>seats reserved in the parliament for ethnic minorities, which had great influence, since they 
</p>
<p>could make or break a government. Roma were seen as actively making an important 
</p>
<p>contribution to society. Among the achievements was the fact that Romany was being 
</p>
<p>taught at Zagreb University and that a Romany-Croatian dictionary had been published. 
</p>
<p>The land where Roma settlements were built has been legally registered and over 1,500 
</p>
<p>illegally built Roma houses had been legalized. Funds had been provided by the State. The 
</p>
<p>Roma had also started the Roma National Council. Moreover, plans had been announced to 
</p>
<p>build new schools in two communities with a high Roma population, ensuring better 
</p>
<p>conditions and facilitating integration.  
</p>
<p>13. Minorities represented 3.5 per cent of State employees, a figure that would have to 
</p>
<p>improve.  </p>


<p>14. It was noted that quotas worked and that a system of quotas for women had been 
</p>
<p>applied first in the local elections and would be applied in the upcoming parliamentary 
</p>
<p>elections. Croatia had a modified proportional system of representation; the country was 
</p>
<p>divided in 10 electoral districts, from each of which 14 members of parliament were 
</p>
<p>elected. Six of the 14 candidates in each list would have to be women. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>15. During the interactive dialogue, 68 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>16. Trinidad and Tobago noted with satisfaction that since the first cycle of the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review in 2010 Croatia had made several improvements to its legal and 
</p>
<p>institutional framework in the area of human rights. It also welcomed the broad scope of the 
</p>
<p>National Programme for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 2013&#8211;2016. 
</p>
<p>17. Turkey applauded the efforts of Croatia to improve the institutional and legal 
</p>
<p>framework and to contribute to the overall well-being and harmony of diverse communities. 
</p>
<p>It noted with satisfaction steps taken to combat corruption, appreciating the range of 
</p>
<p>policies and programmes on the rights of the child, and encouraged strengthening the anti-
</p>
<p>discrimination dimension. It appreciated efforts to prevent violence against women and to 
</p>
<p>improve women&#8217;s general standing and self-esteem. 
</p>
<p>18. Ukraine appreciated the consultations with different stakeholders and civil society in 
</p>
<p>the preparation of the national report. It acknowledged steps taken by Croatia since the first 
</p>
<p>cycle of the universal periodic review and commended the adoption of the Law on 
</p>
<p>Protection from Domestic Violence and the National Strategy of Protection against Family 
</p>
<p>Violence 2011&#8211;2016, and encouraged the effective implementation of those important 
</p>
<p>documents. It recognized the steps taken to improve the health-care system, particularly for 
</p>
<p>children. 
</p>
<p>19. Germany encouraged Croatia to continue on the path of improving human rights and 
</p>
<p>cooperating with neighbouring countries and with civil society. It noted shortcomings with 
</p>
<p>regard to the duration of judicial trials and in the area of non-discrimination of women and 
</p>
<p>minorities, in particular the Serb minority and the Sinti and Roma communities. Germany 
</p>
<p>was also concerned about discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and 
</p>
<p>intersex persons. 
</p>
<p>20. The United States of America hoped Croatia would continue to serve as a model in 
</p>
<p>respecting human rights, which is key to democratic development and economic growth. It 
</p>
<p>commended the leadership shown by Croatia on women&#8217;s issues as a chair of the Equal 
</p>
<p>Futures Partnership, a multilateral initiative, and steps taken to address trafficking in human 
</p>
<p>beings. It expressed concern about discrimination and violence against women and girls, 
</p>
<p>against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons and against ethnic 
</p>
<p>minorities, particularly Serbs and Roma. It commended the robust structure for addressing 
</p>
<p>human trafficking and urged for more implementation efforts. 
</p>
<p>21. Uruguay welcomed the plan on the deinstitutionalization and transformation of 
</p>
<p>social welfare homes and on legal persons performing social welfare activities for 2011&#8211;
</p>
<p>2016. It welcomed the entry into force of the Law on Protection of Persons with Mental 
</p>
<p>Disorders and encouraged Croatia to continue the work in relation to people with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, particularly people with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities.  
</p>
<p>22. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela commended the efforts in the implementation 
</p>
<p>of the recommendations of the first cycle. It welcomed the National Programme for the 
</p>
<p>Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 2013&#8211;2016 and noted that Croatia had </p>


<p>demonstrated progress in awareness-raising on minorities and vulnerable groups. It also 
</p>
<p>welcomed the National Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons, and the promotion of gender 
</p>
<p>equality and political participation of women.  
</p>
<p>23. Albania<b> </b>congratulated Croatia for the significant steps taken to follow up on the 
</p>
<p>recommendations since the first cycle, emphasizing the strengthening of the institutional 
</p>
<p>and legal framework and raising public awareness regarding minorities and vulnerable 
</p>
<p>groups. It also noted the commitment to proceed to the ratification of the International 
</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the fact that 
</p>
<p>Croatia had actively supported the drafting of the Optional Protocol to the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>24. Algeria<b> </b>noted with satisfaction the establishment of national programmes in the 
</p>
<p>areas of health care, the protection of children and prevention from violence within the 
</p>
<p>family. It also welcomed the existence of such mechanisms as the ombudspersons for 
</p>
<p>children, for gender equality and for persons with disabilities, as well as cooperation with 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>25. Angola<b> </b>welcomed efforts undertaken by Croatia to promote and protect women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights, in particular by adopting the law and national policy for gender equality. It 
</p>
<p>encouraged the Government of Croatia to continue implementing measures to combat 
</p>
<p>discrimination through the National Programme for the Protection and Promotion of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>26. Argentina congratulated Croatia on the establishment of the Action Plan for the 
</p>
<p>Employment of National Minorities in Public Administration Bodies 2011&#8211;2014. It also 
</p>
<p>noted efforts to combat human trafficking by harmonizing national legislation with 
</p>
<p>international norms. It encouraged Croatia to push forward with the additional measures 
</p>
<p>mentioned in its national report.  
</p>
<p>27. Armenia<b> </b>appreciated the steps taken to combat trafficking in women and children, 
</p>
<p>cooperation with civil society on this issue as well as awareness-raising initiatives through 
</p>
<p>the media and trainings. It noted efforts to protect the rights of national minorities and 
</p>
<p>promote inter-ethnic tolerance; however, it also noted that the concerns and issues of 
</p>
<p>national minorities were not sufficiently represented. 
</p>
<p>28. Australia acknowledged efforts to address gender-based discrimination and domestic 
</p>
<p>violence. Australia also noted reports of continued societal discrimination against minority 
</p>
<p>groups, including in education, employment, housing and health care.  
</p>
<p>29. Austria noted the measures taken to reduce overcrowding in detention centres and to 
</p>
<p>improve health care for persons deprived of their liberty. It noted the concerns expressed by 
</p>
<p>the Committee against Torture and the Committee on the Rights of the Child about the lack 
</p>
<p>of legal safeguards for these persons and prolonged pretrial detention, particularly for 
</p>
<p>children. Austria also expressed concern about reports of police officers being inadequately 
</p>
<p>trained to respond to domestic violence and of victims sometimes being arrested and 
</p>
<p>charged along with the perpetrators.  
</p>
<p>30. Benin<b> </b>appreciated the efforts made by Croatia since the first cycle and welcomed the 
</p>
<p>ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect 
</p>
<p>to Intercountry Adoption and the adoption of the protocol on procedures relating to acts of 
</p>
<p>sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>31. Bosnia and Herzegovina noted the concerns expressed by the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that, of the Serb minority returnees, 15 per cent 
</p>
<p>did not have access to potable running water, 33 per cent lived in villages without paved 
</p>
<p>roads and 40 per cent did not have access to public transportation. It also noted the high </p>


<p>unemployment rate (68 per cent) among minority returnees. It also noted that minority 
</p>
<p>returnees faced problems regarding their right to a pension.  
</p>
<p>32. Brazil commended Croatia for strengthening its national legal and institutional 
</p>
<p>human rights framework through the entry into force, in 2011, of the Act on the 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman, which also performs the functions of a national preventive mechanism, and 
</p>
<p>the Act on Professional Rehabilitation and Employment of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>33. Bulgaria commended the implementation of key strategic documents and efforts to 
</p>
<p>combat hate crime, ensure free legal aid and improve education on human rights. It 
</p>
<p>appreciated concrete measures taken to strengthen the effectiveness of its efforts to protect 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights and combat domestic violence. Bulgaria noted the adoption of some 
</p>
<p>progressive legislation on gender-based violence. It acknowledged the efforts within the 
</p>
<p>national preventive project entitles &#8220;Living without violence&#8221;, which involves different 
</p>
<p>stakeholders including police and non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>34. Canada welcomed the support of Croatia for the 2010 universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>recommendation to take measures to eliminate discrimination against the Roma 
</p>
<p>community. Canada expressed concern about reports that Roma are often unable to access 
</p>
<p>State services because they lack legal status inside the country.  
</p>
<p>35. Chile commended the commitment to human rights and the ratification of human 
</p>
<p>rights treaties. It welcomed the adoption of laws on discrimination against national 
</p>
<p>minorities, gender equality and the right to legal assistance. It highlighted the entry into 
</p>
<p>force of the Act on the Ombudsman in 2011. It also commended the establishment of an 
</p>
<p>office to promote gender equality. 
</p>
<p>36. With regard to the rights of persons with disabilities, the head of the Croatian 
</p>
<p>delegation emphasized deinstitutionalization as the leitmotif of current policies and said 
</p>
<p>that this was a process for people with both physical and mental disabilities. A number of 
</p>
<p>institutions that used to be centres where people with disabilities lived had been 
</p>
<p>transformed to provide outpatient services within the community. People with disabilities 
</p>
<p>had achieved integration through assisted living, among other means, and children with 
</p>
<p>disabilities had achieved integration by attending regular schools. Assistance was provided 
</p>
<p>where it was necessary. People with mental and intellectual disabilities specifically were 
</p>
<p>being integrated, including by having voting rights. A measure introduced in order to 
</p>
<p>further facilitate the employment of persons with disabilities stipulated that every company 
</p>
<p>with more than 20 employees had to employ at least one person with disabilities; that figure 
</p>
<p>increased as the number of employees increased.  
</p>
<p>37. Concerning the questions about domestic violence, changes had been made to the 
</p>
<p>Criminal Code, namely the stipulation that domestic violence was a criminal offence. Dual 
</p>
<p>arrests (the arrest of the victim and the perpetrator) were no longer happening. Information 
</p>
<p>was provided on the measures in place during and after the proceedings to separate the 
</p>
<p>perpetrator from the victim and the home. Croatia had 19 safe houses for victims of 
</p>
<p>domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>38. On the fight against corruption, Croatia had taken a bold and controversial step in 
</p>
<p>prosecuting and investigating officials at the highest levels in order to address the issue at 
</p>
<p>the highest possible levels. The anti-corruption strategy for 2015&#8211;2020, which had been 
</p>
<p>adopted in February 2015, had been developed in a participatory manner: over 40 
</p>
<p>participants took part in designing it, including non-governmental organizations.  
</p>
<p>39. On gender equality, the pervasive, covert discrimination against women in the area 
</p>
<p>of employment was noted. To eliminate the disadvantage faced by women seeking 
</p>
<p>employment, paternity leave had been introduced.  </p>


<p>40. Croatia had spent 5&#8211;6 billion euros on housing some 354,000 returnees, of whom 
</p>
<p>about 130,000 were ethnic Serbs. Through the housing programme, 149,887 persons had 
</p>
<p>been provided with houses and others with the material to restore their houses or were 
</p>
<p>housed in another way. Some 480 people were still without a house or had the status of 
</p>
<p>refugees. Regarding abandoned property given for use to other persons, all but 13 cases 
</p>
<p>have been resolved, of which 7 were in the process of being resolved.  
</p>
<p>41. China commended Croatia for its constructive engagement with the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review. It also commended the adoption of the new Free Legal Aid Act, the Social 
</p>
<p>Welfare Act 2014 and the four-year national policy for gender equality, to further improve 
</p>
<p>and protect women&#8217;s rights to employment and health and to prevent domestic violence. It 
</p>
<p>welcomed efforts on Roma rights and on developing the national strategy for Roma 
</p>
<p>inclusion for 2013&#8211;2020. 
</p>
<p>42. Costa Rica commended Croatia for the progress made towards a fairer society in 
</p>
<p>terms of access to power and for the law on gender equality, which promotes the 
</p>
<p>participation of women elected to office.<b> </b>Costa Rica urged Croatia to strengthen human 
</p>
<p>rights education programmes through the Croatia national programme.  
</p>
<p>43. Cuba<b> </b>appreciated the implementation of the National Programme for Protection and 
</p>
<p>Promotion of Human Rights 2013&#8211;2016 and the National Policy for Gender Equality 2011&#8211;
</p>
<p>2015; the establishment of the National Committee to Combat Violence in Sport; the 
</p>
<p>adoption of the new Law on the Position and Jurisdiction of Courts and Law Jobs and the 
</p>
<p>Jurisdiction of State Prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>44. Cyprus commended measures taken by the Government of Croatia to implement its 
</p>
<p>international human rights obligations. It particularly welcomed the initiatives undertaken 
</p>
<p>for the promotion of the rights of women and children, as well as measures taken for the 
</p>
<p>elimination of all forms of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>45. The Czech Republic welcomed the delegation of Croatia and thanked it for its 
</p>
<p>national report and appreciated the response to some of the advance questions. 
</p>
<p>46. Egypt acknowledged positive developments in institutional and legislative reforms 
</p>
<p>and policy implementation. It welcomed the efforts to eliminate sexual violence, combat 
</p>
<p>hate speech, enhance the availability and quality of legal aid in the context of the judicial 
</p>
<p>system, upgrade the national human rights institution and combat and prevent torture and 
</p>
<p>ill-treatment in detention centres. Egypt commended the strides made in ensuring better 
</p>
<p>representation of women in public and political life. 
</p>
<p>47. Estonia noted the progress in the area of human rights and in the implementation of 
</p>
<p>most recommendations and commended Croatia for implementing the policy suggestions 
</p>
<p>made during the previous review. Estonia welcomed the entry into force of the Act on the 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman and the adoption of the acts on asylum and anti-discrimination, among others. 
</p>
<p>It acknowledged the ongoing endeavours to promote gender equality and stop 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women.  
</p>
<p>48. France welcomed the ratification of the Hague Convention in December 2013 and 
</p>
<p>efforts to grant to the victims of sexual violence during the 1991&#8211;1995 war the status of 
</p>
<p>civilian victims of the conflict. France wished to know about measures to prevent and 
</p>
<p>suppress hate speech and punish threats against journalists. 
</p>
<p>49. Georgia welcomed the ratification of the Convention on the Reduction of 
</p>
<p>Statelessness and commended Croatia for its efforts to strengthen human rights protection 
</p>
<p>at the national level. Georgia asked Croatia to provide information on how the correctional 
</p>
<p>measures had been implemented towards juvenile criminal offenders. It noted the steps 
</p>
<p>taken in respect of juvenile pretrial detention. </p>


<p>50. The United Kingdom noted the adoption of progressive legislation on civil 
</p>
<p>partnerships, the implementation of the national strategy for Roma inclusion and the 
</p>
<p>constitutional law on minorities. It recognized the work of the ombudsperson for disabled 
</p>

</p>
<p>70. The Philippines was encouraged by the national policy for gender equality, which,

</p>

</p>
<p>views towards victims of trafficking among professionals, it was interested in learning more 
</p>
<p>about public awareness activities targeting doctors, prosecutors and judges to better 
</p>
<p>understand the situation of these victims. It noted the National Strategy on the Rights of

</p>

</p>
<p>enjoy equal access to education.

</p>
<p>challenging and that Croatia had received the lowest number of asylum seekers in the

</p>
<p>89. In concluding remarks, the head of the Croatian delegation touched upon a number 
</p>
<p>of issues raised by the delegates. Four conventions (the International Convention for the 
</p>
<p>Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure, the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
</p>
<p>Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic 
</p>
<p>Violence) were at different stages of ratification. Concerning the International Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 
</p>
<p>Croatia, as a State member of the European Union, adhered to the common policy on 
</p>
<p>migration and would, therefore, continue functioning within that framework. Moreoaver, 
</p>
<p>Croatia had provided a ship as part of European efforts to save refugees in the 
</p>
<p>Mediterranean. 
</p>
<p>90. On the issue of trafficking in human beings, the important challenges of such 
</p>
<p>trafficking were addressed. Education and training efforts such as seminars on recognizing 
</p>
<p>cases of human trafficking and awareness-raising programmes were taking place. Since 
</p>
<p>Croatia had been identified as a country of both origin and destination, especially during the 
</p>
<p>tourist season, emphasis had been placed on training police officers, border guards and 
</p>
<p>communities.  
</p>
<p>91. Concerning the issue of children in prisons, delegates were informed that there were 
</p>
<p>currently 65 children in different forms of detention, correctional institutions or juvenile 
</p>
<p>prisons. Pretrial detention was being reduced to the shortest possible period and took place 
</p>
<p>in secured educational facilities where continual psychological, social and health care was 
</p>
<p>being provided.  
</p>
<p>92. On the overcrowding of prisons, an issue from 2010, delegates were informed that, 
</p>
<p>by introducing probation for minor offences and community work instead of prison 
</p>
<p>sentences, Croatian prisons now held a population (3,800 prisoners) that was slightly below 
</p>
<p>capacity (3,900 prisoners).  
</p>
<p>93. Concerning language and, specifically, the use of Cyrillic script for the Serb 
</p>
<p>minority, Croatian law prescribed that when 30 per cent or more of a community was 
</p>
<p>composed of a minority, that group had the right to use its language and script. The 
</p>
<p>Government had implemented that law not only in areas where the situation was not very 
</p>
<p>controversial but also where it was controversial, as in Vukovar, which had been 
</p>
<p>completely destroyed during the war and still nursed very deep wounds. The Government 
</p>
<p>was fighting opposition to the law in that town and had called for cross-border cooperation, 
</p>
<p>especially with Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, on raising awareness of the importance 
</p>
<p>of minority languages in those sensitive areas.  
</p>
<p>94. On pensions for returnees, it was clarified that returnees had pensions. The 
</p>
<p>unresolved issue concerned the pensions of those who had not returned and who remained 
</p>
<p>outside Croatia; the issue was under review and a solution was being sought, also with the 
</p>
<p>Government of Serbia. 
</p>
<p>95. On the issue of missing persons, there were still 1,590 such persons, of whom 930 
</p>
<p>were ethnic Croats and 660 ethnic Serbs; almost all of them were from Croatia. Serbia and 
</p>
<p>Croatia, including the heads of the respective delegations personally, were working together 
</p>
<p>on the issue. </p>


<p>96. On hate crimes, information was provided on the protocol on acting in hate crime 
</p>
<p>incidents and on the statistics. In 2014, the police identified 22 cases of hate crime 
</p>
<p>incidents, while the prosecutor&#8217;s office acted in 60 such cases. Of those cases, 12 were 
</p>
<p>solved, 6 with in a conviction; the others were still being processed. 
</p>
<p>97. On the independence of judiciary, the Croatian judiciary was completely 
</p>
<p>independent of the State and the Government. That was not enough, however, as the 
</p>
<p>judiciary also needed to be independent from any other influence outside of the law and the 
</p>
<p>rules of procedure and had to function to the highest standards. It was something that 
</p>
<p>Croatia was working on.  
</p>
<p>98. The head of the Croatian delegation concluded by thanking the President of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council and the delegates for the discussion and the recommendations and 
</p>
<p>for raising important issues.
