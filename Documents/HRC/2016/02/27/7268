<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management 
</p>
<p>and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes in accordance with Council resolution 
</p>
<p>27/23.  
</p>
<p>2. Hazardous substances and wastes are a public health issue of global concern. 
</p>
<p>Pollution is the largest cause of premature death in low- and middle-income countries.1 Air 
</p>
<p>pollution alone kills over 7 million people per year.2 One quarter of the global burden of 
</p>
<p>disease and more than one third of the burden among children are due to environmental 
</p>
<p>determinants.3 Non-communicable diseases that might be related to hazardous substances, 
</p>
<p>among other causes, include cancer, heart and lung disease, mental disabilities, obesity, 
</p>
<p>diabetes and more.4 Costs related to increased health care and reduced productivity, among 
</p>
<p>other effects of pesticide misuse, can exceed the amount of official development assistance 
</p>
<p>received by some countries, for example in sub-Saharan Africa.5  
</p>
<p>3. Mismanagement and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes can have 
</p>
<p>profound impacts on all human rights. Information is crucial to preventing human rights 
</p>
<p>violations resulting from exposure to hazardous substances and wastes; crucial information 
</p>
<p>on hazardous substances and wastes is, however, frequently unavailable and inaccessible.6  
</p>
<p>4. The life cycle includes the extraction of oil, gas, metals, minerals and other natural 
</p>
<p>resources, followed by the processing and synthesis of these raw materials into substances 
</p>
<p>that are then used to produce a range of industrial chemicals, mixtures and materials, which 
</p>
<p>may contain hazardous substances. Thousands of hazardous substances, mixtures and 
</p>
<p>materials are then used in various industries to manufacture everyday goods and for 
</p>
<p>industrial practices. For example, hazardous substances are used by the agriculture industry 
</p>
<p>as pesticides, the garment industry to produce leather and textiles, the electronics industry 
</p>
<p>to manufacture mobile phones, computers and televisions among others. Hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances are constituents of cosmetics, building materials, household cleaners, and other 
</p>
<p>consumer products. Throughout the life cycle, wastes and other by-products are generated, 
</p>
<p>often hazardous themselves.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur has held a broad consultative process with States, 
</p>
<p>international organizations, civil society organizations, national human rights institutions 
</p>
<p>and other stakeholders. He received 48 responses to a questionnaire inviting various

</p>
<p>6. The present report focuses on the human rights implications of information 
</p>
<p>throughout the life cycle of hazardous substances and wastes. It discusses the types of 
</p>
<p>information that are required to understand these substances better in order to prevent and 
</p>
<p>mitigate their impact in the realization of human rights. In addition, it aims at identifying 
</p>
<p>challenges and obstacles to the realization of the right to information in this context. First, 
</p>
<p>the report introduces the right to information from an international human rights law 
</p>
<p>perspective and its relevance throughout the life cycle of hazardous substances, including a 
</p>
<p>summary of information gaps. Secondly, it provides an analysis of the duties of States to 
</p>
<p>realize the right to information on hazardous substances and wastes, followed by a 
</p>
<p>description of the corollary responsibilities of businesses. The present report concludes with 
</p>
<p>a summary and recommendations for stakeholders.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Importance of information on hazardous substances 
and wastes 
</b></p>
<p>7. Information is critical to the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental to good 
</p>
<p>governance. Information about hazardous substances is essential to prevent risks, mitigate 
</p>
<p>harms, conduct focused research on safer alternatives, provide treatment and remedy, and 
</p>
<p>ensure transparency, participation and consent in decision- and policymaking.  
</p>
<p>8. Information from the scientific community continues to unearth a broad range of 
</p>
<p>adverse health impacts that are linked to various hazardous substances. For example, 
</p>
<p>research shows that daughters of women with above-average levels of one hazardous 
</p>
<p>substance during pregnancy have a fourfold increase in the risk of breast cancer later in 
</p>
<p>life.8 It has been estimated that 62 per cent of the total production of industrial substances 
</p>
<p>are toxic.9 The ongoing human exposure to toxic and otherwise hazardous chemicals is 
</p>
<p>estimated to carry tremendous costs for public resources, public health and society at 
</p>
<p>large.10 However, the actual extent of the impacts of hazardous substances remains largely 
</p>
<p>unknown.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Global challenge of information on substances and wastes 
</b></p>
<p>9. Securing adequate information on the risks of hazardous substances and wastes has 
</p>
<p>been an incessant global challenge. In 1992, the United Nations Conference on 
</p>
<p>Environment and Development identified two major problems linked to hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances: (a) the lack of sufficient scientific information for the assessment of risks on a 
</p>
<p>great number of substances; and (b) the lack of resources for the assessment of chemicals 
</p>
<p>where information is available.11 In 2001, the European Commission reiterated that the lack 
</p>

<p>of knowledge about the impact of many chemicals on human health and the environment 
</p>
<p>was a cause for concern.12  
</p>
<p>10. In 2006, stakeholders of the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals 
</p>
<p>Management acknowledged that there is a lack of clear, accessible, timely and appropriate 
</p>
<p>information on chemicals for ready use by local populations.13 To address that global 
</p>
<p>challenge, the global community adopted the Dubai Declaration on International Chemicals 
</p>
<p>Management, in paragraph 21 of which stakeholders pledged to facilitate public access to 
</p>
<p>appropriate information and knowledge on chemicals throughout their life cycle, including 
</p>
<p>the risks that they pose to human health and the environment.  
</p>
<p>11. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the current patchwork of global treaties for 
</p>
<p>chemicals and wastes does not sufficiently require countries to generate and assess 
</p>
<p>information on the production, use or release of potentially hazardous substances for 
</p>
<p>numerous purposes, including in relation to their obligation to respect and protect human 
</p>
<p>rights and to mitigate the negative impacts of these substances on the human rights of 
</p>
<p>individuals and communities. Furthermore, there is no global system to generate or share 
</p>
<p>missing information among all countries. This major shortcoming has resulted in a lack of 
</p>
<p>available information; inability to access information; and not-so-useful information, 
</p>
<p>particularly with respect to the dangers confronting those who are most at risk of harm from 
</p>
<p>hazardous substances and wastes. There remain grave information gaps on numerous 
</p>
<p>substances that are used, produced, released and disposed as waste by industrial and 
</p>
<p>governmental activities.14  
</p>
<p>12. Information gaps appear to be largest in non-members of the Organization for 
</p>
<p>Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Non-OECD members may often have 
</p>
<p>fewer resources for generating and assessing information about hazardous substances, and 
</p>
<p>may also be simultaneously experiencing large increases in the production, import, use and 
</p>
<p>release of hazardous substances and wastes in their territories.15  
</p>
<p>13. Substances have repeatedly come onto the market, often resulting in widespread 
</p>
<p>human exposure, only to be removed later because of evidence of harm or unreasonable 
</p>
<p>risk emerging. While concerns about toxic chemicals and other hazardous substances are 
</p>
<p>growing, the United Nations Environment Programme states that, of the tens of thousands 
</p>
<p>of chemicals on the market, only a fraction has been thoroughly evaluated to determine 
</p>
<p>their effects on human health and the environment.16

<p> 14 These include, for example: (a) the number and amount produced and used around the world; 
</p>
<p>(b) hazardous properties, for example the ability to cause cancer, damage reproductive systems or 
</p>
<p>interfere with hormone systems; (c) incidence of adverse effects linked to individual substances and

</p>

</p>
<p>rules and regulations; and (n) information on amounts of waste generated and where it is disposed.

<p>14. In some countries, businesses are not required to produce any information to 
</p>
<p>determine the safety of a chemical before production by workers and use in products sold to 
</p>
<p>consumers, such as toys and furniture. For 85 per cent of tens of thousands of new 
</p>
<p>substances, regulators in one country did not receive any toxicity data from the chemical 
</p>
<p>manufacturer when they were notified of the intent to manufacture the new substance.17  
</p>
<p>15. Loopholes in laws intended to prevent the use of hazardous substances in food have 
</p>
<p>been exploited by businesses, adding newly developed chemical additives to food without 
</p>
<p>government oversight or public access to the information about the identity or safety of the 
</p>
<p>substance. For illustration, businesses in the United States of America have &#8220;found their 
</p>
<p>chemicals safe for use in food despite potentially serious allergic reactions, interactions 
</p>
<p>with common drugs, or proposed uses much greater than company-established safe 
</p>
<p>doses&#8221;.18 In addition, pesticides have been used before required information is available to 
</p>
<p>completely assess their safety for workers, local communities and consumers.
19
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16. Despite ongoing exposure of children and adults to hazardous substances in 
</p>
<p>cosmetics, food, toys, furniture, electronics, building materials and other common, 
</p>
<p>everyday items, information provided to consumers on the hazardous substances present in 
</p>
<p>these items &#8220;covers too few substances and does not reach everyone who needs information 
</p>
<p>to make active choices and assess and handle risks&#8221;.20  
</p>
<p>17. Excessive and unjustified claims of confidentiality have kept information about the 
</p>
<p>risks of hazardous substances secret, and &#8220;far in excess of what is needed to protect trade 
</p>
<p>secrets&#8221;.21 Approximately 15,000 of over 24,000 new substances developed since 1982 
</p>
<p>cannot be meaningfully identified by the public as having known or unknown risks. 22  
</p>
<p>18. In the case of the tragedy in Bhopal, India, where thousands lost their lives and tens 
</p>
<p>of thousands have been born into a toxic environment, Union Carbide Corporation 
</p>
<p>(acquired by the Dow Chemical Company) admitted that one highly hazardous gas was 
</p>
<p>released, but did not provide information about other pollutants released. This information 
</p>
<p>is necessary to understand the magnitude of impacts due to the industrial accident and to 
</p>
<p>ensure effective remedy.  
</p>
<p>19. Furthermore, settlement agreements for alleged harm with broad confidentiality 
</p>
<p>provisions can prevent timely action to avoid additional harm and hinder access to an 
</p>
<p>effective remedy for other victims, particularly those who do not have the resources for 
</p>
<p>legal counsel.

<p>20. In the context of people harmed by pollution resulting from extractive industries, the 
</p>
<p>unavailability or unreliability of baseline information has been a recurring challenge. 
</p>
<p>Baseline information about the presence of hazardous substances in air, water and soil are 
</p>
<p>important to understand the cause and effect of industrial activity and to ensure access to 
</p>
<p>justice and to an effective remedy for victims whose rights may have been violated. In 
</p>
<p>addition, some have voiced a concern that information generated has a bias to emphasize 
</p>
<p>high levels of naturally occurring toxic metals to neutralize pollution concerns and 
</p>
<p>responsibility for wrongdoing. Furthermore, examination of the provided information 
</p>
<p>through independent experts is often missing.  
</p>
<p>21. Regarding hazardous waste, there is no clear, global overview of the volume of 
</p>
<p>hazardous waste generated, the exact sources of or destinations for the waste, the hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances present, or methods of handling.23 Unfortunately, it is often only after people 
</p>
<p>suffer adverse effects that the illegal dumping of toxic waste is uncovered. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights implications of the right to information on hazardous 
</b></p>
<p><b>substances and wastes 
</b></p>
<p>22. The right to information is a right in and of itself and one of the rights upon which 
</p>
<p>free and democratic societies depend (see E/CN.4/2000/63, para. 42). The right to 
</p>
<p>information derives from the right to freedom of expression and the right to take part in 
</p>
<p>public affairs stipulated in articles 19 and 25 respectively of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights. Similar provisions are also found in several international and 
</p>
<p>regional human rights instruments, as well as in national constitutions and laws. According 
</p>
<p>to the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression, this right encompasses the right of individuals to request and receive 
</p>
<p>information of public interest and information concerning themselves that may affect their 
</p>
<p>individual rights (see A/68/362, para. 19). 
</p>
<p>23. Concerns have been raised that, in many countries, people lack basic information 
</p>
<p>about and influence over the quality of their drinking water, the air they breathe, the land 
</p>
<p>they live on and the food they eat (see ECE/MP.PP/2014/27/Add.1, para. 16). In this 
</p>
<p>context, better access to information can enable the exercise of economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights, including the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
</p>
<p>health, the right to food, the right to safe drinking water and sanitation, and the right to a 
</p>
<p>healthy environment.  
</p>
<p>24. Information is a precondition for the realization of several civil and political rights. 
</p>
<p>In the context of hazardous substances and wastes, information gaps create a fundamental 
</p>
<p>impediment to realizing the right to free, active and meaningful public participation by 
</p>
<p>individuals and communities to decide what risks they are willing to accept. Principle 10 of 
</p>
<p>the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development explicitly clarifies that 
</p>
<p>information on hazardous materials and activities is necessary to ensure participation of all 
</p>
<p>to achieve the best possible outcome on environmental issues.24  
</p>
<p>25. For numerous people who die prematurely because of hazardous substances every 
</p>
<p>year, information on risks, mitigation measures and safer alternatives can help prevent harm 
</p>
<p>and save lives, implicating the right to life.

<p>26. Furthermore, information gaps regarding hazardous properties, uses and exposure to 
</p>
<p>hazardous substances, together with latency periods, genetic variation, lifestyle choices and 
</p>
<p>other variables, create a complex array of uncertainties and unknowns that can obstruct 
</p>
<p>access to an effective remedy for victims.  
</p>
<p>27. Meaningful consent relies upon and cannot be achieved without information. Under 
</p>
<p>article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, people have the right 
</p>
<p>not to be subjected without free consent to medical or scientific experimentation, which 
</p>
<p>includes human exposure to substances the potential adverse effects of which are unknown. 
</p>
<p>In the context of hazardous substances, lack of information, together with a lack of consent 
</p>
<p>to be exposed to substances and their risks, directly affect this right. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>protecting the ability of individuals to exercise consent to having hazardous substances 
</p>
<p>enter their bodies is indivisible, interdependent and interrelated to numerous human rights, 
</p>
<p>including, among others, the right to self-determination, human dignity and health, as well 
</p>
<p>as freedom from discrimination (see A/64/272, para. 19, and E/C.12/2000/4, para. 8).  
</p>
<p>28. Indigenous peoples have the right to give their free, prior and informed consent 
</p>
<p>about the exploitation of resources on their land and about the storage and disposal of 
</p>
<p>hazardous substances in their lands or territories, and other rights that require information 
</p>
<p>about hazardous substances.25 
</p>
<p>29. Access to information is necessary to evaluate the implications of hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances with respect to groups that are at higher risk of harm from hazardous substances. 
</p>
<p>Low-income or minority communities, indigenous peoples and other groups may be 
</p>
<p>disproportionately at risk of adverse impacts owing to higher levels of exposure.  
</p>
<p>30. Children are particularly at risk of serious and irreversible effects from exposure to a 
</p>
<p>myriad of hazardous substances in their homes, schools and playgrounds. Children are 
</p>
<p>often exposed to higher levels of hazardous substances than adults and this exposure comes 
</p>
<p>during critical periods of development, when children are at greatest risk of adverse impacts 
</p>
<p>from carcinogens, hormone disrupting chemicals, mutagens, reproductive toxicants and 
</p>
<p>other hazardous substances.  
</p>
<p>31. Workers are also exposed to above-average levels of hazardous substances, with 
</p>
<p>regular reports of inadequate training and adverse health impacts from preventable 
</p>
<p>accidents and occupational exposure. Workers have the right to remove themselves from 
</p>
<p>situations they believe are hazardous, which is contingent on information about the known 
</p>
<p>and unknown risks of the substances to which they are exposed.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Normative content of the right to information on hazardous substances 
</b></p>
<p><b>and wastes 
</b></p>
<p>32. International human rights standards together with international chemical standards 
</p>
<p>can serve to clarify the normative content of the right to information on hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances and wastes. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the right to information on 
</p>
<p>hazardous substances and wastes would require that relevant information be available, 
</p>
<p>accessible and functional, in a manner consistent with the principle of non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it needs to be ensured that people who may be exposed to hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances and wastes are aware that they have a right to information and understand its 
</p>
<p>relevance.

<p><b> 1. Availability 
</b></p>
<p>33. Information is available when current reliable information has been generated and 
</p>
<p>collected in a manner adequate to assess the magnitude of potential adverse impacts on the 
</p>
<p>rights of people from hazardous substances and wastes. Necessary information on 
</p>
<p>hazardous substances and wastes can include, for example, their intrinsic hazards and 
</p>
<p>properties, actual and potential uses and releases, as well as protective measures and 
</p>
<p>regulations. It also includes details about the amounts of substances present in people and 
</p>
<p>their environments compared with risks, and the prevalence of adverse impacts linked to 
</p>
<p>hazardous substances, such as cancer, impaired brain function, heart disease and other non-
</p>
<p>communicable diseases.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Accessibility  
</b></p>
<p>34. Information about hazardous substances and wastes is accessible when everyone can 
</p>
<p>seek, obtain, receive and hold available information, unless there is an overriding legitimate 
</p>
<p>public-interest justification for non-disclosure. Information must be both physically and 
</p>
<p>economically accessible, and there must be public awareness about its availability and how 
</p>
<p>to make use of the information. Information is physically accessible when information is 
</p>
<p>provided in a timely manner, either in response to public inquiries or when the information 
</p>
<p>holder or information generator actively disseminates information.26 The information 
</p>
<p>requested should be provided and made available to the requester in a timely manner. In 
</p>
<p>addition, information should be physically accessible at the time of purchase and when 
</p>
<p>using a product containing hazardous substances. To be economically accessible, the cost 
</p>
<p>of accessing information should be kept at a minimum, possibly charging only the cost 
</p>
<p>incurred for reproduction of information.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Functionality  
</b></p>
<p>35. Information should be fit for its intended purpose. Making information available or 
</p>
<p>accessible does not necessarily make it functional. In order to fulfil the criteria of 
</p>
<p>availability and accessibility, information should be functional. Information about 
</p>
<p>hazardous substances is not functional unless it works to prevent harm, to enable 
</p>
<p>democratic decision-making, and to ensure accountability, access to justice and an effective 
</p>
<p>remedy.  
</p>
<p>36. To be functional, information should be scientifically accessible, imparting 
</p>
<p>knowledge with a reasonable degree of effort on the part of the intended user. Certain 
</p>
<p>professionals will always require substantially more technical information about hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances and wastes than potentially affected consumers and community members. For 
</p>
<p>example, the technical information about hazardous substances appropriate for regulators 
</p>
<p>and researchers is not user-friendly for consumers at the point of purchase. Technicalities 
</p>
<p>must be translated into a language that is functional, to enable individuals and groups of 
</p>
<p>individuals to make informed choices. In doing so, underlying data from which conclusions 
</p>
<p>are drawn should be accessible to ensure the veracity of such conclusions. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Non-discrimination and equality 
</b></p>
<p>37. Non-discrimination is a pillar of human rights law. In relation to information, it is 
</p>
<p>essential to ensure that the risks presented by hazardous substances and wastes be made 
</p>
<p>compliant with this principle. Disaggregated and specialized information is required to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 26 For instance, article 49, paragraph 2, of the Georgian Law on Nuclear and Radiation Safety stipulates 
</p>
<p>that the population of Georgia despite its civil status has a right to receive timely information about 
</p>
<p>the nuclear and radiation situation. </p>


<p>understand and prevent disproportionate implications and impacts of hazardous substances 
</p>
<p>and wastes on individuals and specific population groups, including different ages, 
</p>
<p>incomes, ethnicities, genders as well as minorities and indigenous peoples. The right to 
</p>
<p>information should be implemented with particular care so that no one is excluded through 
</p>
<p>direct or indirect discrimination, particularly through the imposition of unreasonable 
</p>
<p>eligibility conditions or inattention to their particular circumstances. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Limitations to the right to information on hazardous substances 
</b></p>
<p><b>and wastes 
</b></p>
<p>38. Confidentiality claims must be legitimate in accordance with international human 
</p>
<p>rights standards. Under the principle of maximum disclosure there is a presumption that all 
</p>
<p>information held by public bodies should be subject to disclosure, subject to a narrow set of 
</p>
<p>public-interest limitations. To this end, the right to information is subject to certain 
</p>
<p>legitimate, public-interest limitations in accordance with article 19 (3) of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Any limitation must be provided by law; it must be 
</p>
<p>to protect the rights or reputation of others or to protect national security, public order, 
</p>
<p>public health or morals; and it must be proved to be necessary and to be no more restrictive 
</p>
<p>than is required to achieve the purported aim (see A/HRC/14/23, paras. 72&#8211;87).  
</p>
<p>39. An analysis of relevant human rights provisions indicates several common criteria, 
</p>
<p>namely, conformity with the law, principle of legitimacy, principle of proportionality and 
</p>
<p>necessity, reasonable purpose and objective and protection of the right of others (see 
</p>
<p>A/68/362, para. 51). Grounds for refusal of access to information should be interpreted in a 
</p>
<p>restrictive way, taking into account the public interest served by disclosure. The balancing 
</p>
<p>of interests is widely established under national and international laws. It is not legitimate 
</p>
<p>to limit access to information because the information seeker did not provide an interest or 
</p>
<p>reasons for the request to access information.27  
</p>
<p>40. It is generally acknowledged that there is an overriding public interest in the 
</p>
<p>disclosure of information concerning serious violations of human rights and humanitarian 
</p>
<p>law (see A/68/362, para. 37). Article 6 of the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility 
</p>
<p>of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally 
</p>
<p>Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms expressly provides that everyone 
</p>
<p>has the right to information regarding human rights violations. Countries have laws to 
</p>
<p>override confidentiality claims in cases where the information requested relates to human 
</p>
<p>rights violations or is relevant to investigate, prevent or avoid violations thereof.  
</p>
<p>41. Among the types of information that should never be confidential is information 
</p>
<p>about systematic or widespread human right violations, and information about other 
</p>
<p>violations of human rights that would prevent accountability, meaningful public 
</p>
<p>participation or access to an effective remedy (ibid.). The potential for the mismanagement 
</p>
<p>of hazardous substances and wastes to lead to systematic or widespread human rights 
</p>
<p>violations is widely known.  
</p>
<p>42. To this end, certain types of information about hazardous substances cannot be 
</p>
<p>legitimately claimed as confidential. It is not legitimate to claim that public health and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 27 UNEP, <i>Guidelines for the Development of National Legislation on Access to Information, Public 
</i></p>
<p><i>Participation and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters</i> (2010), guideline 1;<i> Claude Reyes et al. 
</i></p>
<p><i>v. Chile</i>, Series C No. 151, 19 September 2006, Inter-American Court of Human Rights; and the 
</p>
<p>Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice 
</p>
<p>in Environmental Matters, art. 4, para. 1 (a).  </p>


<p>safety information on hazardous substances is confidential. There is widespread recognition 
</p>
<p>that health and safety information should not be confidential, and States have legally 
</p>
<p>binding obligations to this end.28  
</p>
<p>43. The interpretation of what constitutes health and safety information varies. The 
</p>
<p>Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants provides implicit and non-
</p>
<p>exhaustive guidance as to what constitutes health and safety information, by virtue of what 
</p>
<p>is necessary to implement the Convention. Health and safety information necessary to 
</p>
<p>implement the Convention includes: chemical identity, physical properties, information 
</p>
<p>about the ability of the substance to travel across borders in wind and water, and evidence 
</p>
<p>of adverse effects to human health29 such as cancer and other non-communicable diseases. 
</p>
<p>In addition, the Convention compels the disclosure of information on the use of substances 
</p>
<p>eligible for listing under the Convention, otherwise the use of such substances may be 
</p>
<p>prohibited.  
</p>
<p>44. Secondly, emissions of hazardous substances into the environment and the unsound 
</p>
<p>disposal of waste is public health information that should only in very rare circumstances 
</p>
<p>be confidential. For example, Spain does not allow for emissions reported under its 
</p>
<p>Pollutant Release and Transfer Register to be claimed as confidential.30 This information is 
</p>
<p>necessary to assess the potential for human exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, 
</p>
<p>inextricable from protecting human rights.  
</p>
<p>45. Recurring challenges to realizing the right to information in the context of hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances are exceptions for commercial secrets. The refusal to disclose information 
</p>
<p>because it would adversely affect the value of intellectual property or the confidentiality of 
</p>
<p>commercial businesses or industrial information is not legitimate if it may hamper public 
</p>
<p>health or the overall public interest.31 According to one Government&#8217;s self-assessment, the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;current process for handling confidential business information requests is weighted toward 
</p>
<p>the protection of industry information rather than public access&#8221;,32 contrary to the intent of 
</p>
<p>the law. It is not legitimate to protect a competitive advantage of businesses that create risks 
</p>
<p>to public health and other public interests. Under the World Trade Organization&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights the disclosure of 
</p>
<p>certain types of health and safety information is unobjectionable &#8220;except where necessary 
</p>
<p>to protect the public&#8221;.33  
</p>
<p>46. The Economic Commission for Europe Convention on Access to Information, 
</p>
<p>Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters 
</p>
<p>does allow for the protection of intellectual property and commercial information, but not if 
</p>
<p>the information sought concerns emissions into the environment. In interpreting the 
</p>
<p>supremacy of the public interest in information about emissions into the environment over 
</p>
<p>confidentiality claims under the Convention, a General Court of the European Union held 
</p>
<p>in 2013 that:

<p>if the institution concerned receives an application for access to a document, it must 
</p>
<p>disclose it where the information requested relates to emissions into the 
</p>
<p>environment, even if such disclosure is liable to undermine the protection of the 
</p>
<p>commercial interests of a particular natural or legal person, including that person&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>intellectual property.
34
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>47. The General Court mentions that &#8220;an overriding public interest in disclosure exists 
</p>
<p>where the information requested relates to emissions into the environment&#8221;.35 The Court&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>decision reversed the European Commission&#8217;s refusal to grant access to information about 
</p>
<p>the widely used pesticide glyphosate, which was categorized as probably carcinogenic to 
</p>
<p>humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health 
</p>
<p>Organization (WHO) in 2015.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Implementation of the right to information on hazardous 
substances and wastes 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Obligations of States 
</b></p>
<p>48. States are the primary duty-bearers to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, and 
</p>
<p>are bound to take all the steps necessary to ensure the right to information with respect to 
</p>
<p>the adverse impacts of hazardous substances and wastes. States must ensure that related 
</p>
<p>information is available, accessible and functional for everyone. This obligation not only 
</p>
<p>requires States to refrain from interfering with the distribution and the free flow of 
</p>
<p>information but also requires States to provide or make information public with or without 
</p>
<p>request (see general comment No. 34 of the Human Rights Committee on the freedoms of 
</p>
<p>opinion and expression, para. 19).  
</p>
<p>49. The obligation to implement the right to information on hazardous substances and 
</p>
<p>wastes stems from various rights including those rights that are implicated through adverse 
</p>
<p>impacts of hazardous substances and wastes and rights that specifically stipulate the 
</p>
<p>obligation of States to provide access to information. For example, in the context of the 
</p>
<p>right to the highest attainable standard of health, as the right is an inclusive right extending 
</p>
<p>to underlying determinants of health such as access to health-related education and 
</p>
<p>information, access to information is an essential feature of the right itself and of an 
</p>
<p>effective health system (see A/HRC/7/11, para. 40). Twenty years after principle 10 of the 
</p>
<p>Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, at the United Nations Conference on 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Development in 2012, stakeholders made a number of appeals to improve 
</p>
<p>transparency, access to information and public participation.36 Good governance and a truly 
</p>
<p>sustainable economy require the informed involvement of members of the public, be it in 
</p>
<p>their role as voters, consumers or shareholders (ECE/MP.PP/2014/27/Add.1).

 35 Ibid., para. 37. 
</p>
<p> 36 General Assembly resolution 66/288, para. 43. Today, the Convention on Access to Information, 
</p>
<p>Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters and the Kiev 
</p>
<p>Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers remain the only legally binding instruments 
</p>
<p>established to implement principle 10 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.  </p>


<p><b> 1. To generate, collect, assess and update 
</b></p>
<p>50. To respect, protect and fulfil human rights, States have a duty to investigate the 
</p>
<p>actual and potential human rights impacts of hazardous substances and wastes throughout 
</p>
<p>their life cycle. As such, States have a duty to generate, collect, assess and update 
</p>
<p>information on hazardous substances and wastes. Substances must be assessed for: (a) their 
</p>
<p>hazardous properties, such as the ability to cause cancer or explode; (b) the likelihood of 
</p>
<p>exposure, including for those at risk of disproportionate levels of exposure; (c) the risk of 
</p>
<p>harm; and (d) options available to prevent harm.  
</p>
<p>51. This duty needs to be carried out regularly, systematically and with special attention 
</p>
<p>given to continuing innovation in the development of new substances with unique risks, and 
</p>
<p>information being generated about the risks of hazardous substances. Because neither 
</p>
<p>industry nor science is static, States must continue to perform this duty diligently, as close 
</p>
<p>as possible to the pace of scientific advancements. An example of this duty is found under 
</p>
<p>article L124&#8211;7 of the French Environment Code which calls on the public authorities to 
</p>
<p>make sure that the information about the environment that they have collected is precise 
</p>
<p>and up to date and can enable comparison. 
</p>
<p>52. States have a duty to ensure that information about public health and other public 
</p>
<p>interests is available to individuals, and that each person can exercise his or her human right 
</p>
<p>to information. For example, the European Court of Human Rights held that the State had 
</p>
<p>breached its duty to provide &#8220;essential information that would have enabled [the nearby 
</p>
<p>community] to assess risks they and their families might run if they continued to live at 
</p>
<p>Manfredonia, a town particularly exposed to danger in the event of an accident at [the 
</p>
<p>chemical] factory&#8221;.37 Significantly, the State was not in possession of the information.38  
</p>
<p>53. While many countries do not have specific domestic legislation or policies in place 
</p>
<p>to ensure that a minimum amount of critical information is generated, collected, assessed 
</p>
<p>and updated on the properties, uses and fate potentially of all hazardous substances, certain 
</p>
<p>States have taken action individually and jointly to address the information gaps that 
</p>
<p>prevent States from assessing actual and potential human rights impacts from hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances and wastes. The OECD Mutual Acceptance of Data system and high production 
</p>
<p>volume chemicals programme helped to generate, collect and assess information on the 
</p>
<p>most widely used hazardous substances and wastes efficiently and through international 
</p>
<p>cooperation.  
</p>
<p>54. The European Union has led efforts to generate, collect and assess information on 
</p>
<p>the hazardous properties and uses of approximately 30,000 industrial substances. Under the 
</p>
<p>2006 European Union Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and 
</p>
<p>Restriction of Chemicals, businesses must provide States with a minimum amount of 
</p>
<p>information on the hazardous properties of industrial chemicals produced or imported at or 
</p>
<p>above one ton per year. If information is not available, it must be generated by businesses 
</p>
<p>that wish to register the substance for use. Reporting requirements under the Regulation, 
</p>
<p>where information about hazardous industrial substances must flow up and down the value 
</p>
<p>chain, to and from chemical manufacturers and downstream users, help to ensure that 
</p>
<p>substances are being used safely and information is updated. 
</p>
<p>55. In the aftermath of the tragedy in Bhopal, several countries adopted laws to generate, 
</p>
<p>assess and update information about the risk of large-scale chemical accidents and regular 
</p>
<p>industrial emissions of hazardous substances. In some countries, local governments are

<p>required to plan for emergencies involving hazardous substances, and communities have a 
</p>
<p>&#8220;right to know&#8221;39 about hazardous substances in their vicinity. The European Union&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Seveso Directive was updated in 2012 to improve access to information. The new Seveso 
</p>
<p>(III) Directive recognizes the duty of European Union member States to &#8220;make information 
</p>
<p>available on where to find information on the rights of persons affected by a major 
</p>
<p>accident&#8221;, 40 in addition to the duty to actively disseminate and update this information. 
</p>
<p>56. To generate information on regular releases or disposal of hazardous substances 
</p>
<p>from stationary industrial sources into air, water and land, several countries have 
</p>
<p>established toxics release inventories or pollutant release and transfer registers. Today, 
</p>
<p>many of these systems are established according to the Kiev Protocol on Pollutant Release 
</p>
<p>and Transfer Registers. Pollutant release and transfer registers are effective for furthering 
</p>
<p>environmental democracy, through encouraging the active participation of all interested 
</p>
<p>stakeholders in processes that contribute to better decision-making, planning and 
</p>
<p>implementation of policies and programmes at all levels. All these systems include the 
</p>
<p>generation of updated information on the release of hundreds of hazardous substances and 
</p>
<p>the availability of information through map-based or other database search functions.  
</p>
<p>57. States have recognized the importance of measuring the amounts of hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances in people, also referred to as &#8220;biomonitoring&#8221;. Biomonitoring studies can 
</p>
<p>provide important information to prevent harm, data points for cause and effect, and 
</p>
<p>evidence of the efficacy of measures being taken to reduce exposure to hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances. Some studies have shown that over 500 different hazardous substances are 
</p>
<p>found in adults and over 200 in children.41 Although less biomonitoring information is 
</p>
<p>available from developing countries, &#8220;it is reasonable to conclude that to the extent that 
</p>
<p>people are exposed to the same chemicals, the results will be similar&#8221;.42 While certain 
</p>
<p>countries and international organizations have taken initiatives, biomonitoring is 
</p>
<p>underutilized around the world.  
</p>
<p>58. States are also investigating epidemiological information on adverse effects linked 
</p>
<p>to hazardous substances and wastes. Numerous States have cancer registries, which &#8220;play 
</p>
<p>an important role in research into the cause of cancer&#8221;.43  
</p>
<p>59. However, despite this progress there remain serious information gaps and obstacles 
</p>
<p>to generating, collecting, assessing and updating information gaps.  
</p>
<p>60. In one country, the paradoxical situation exists where a State must have information 
</p>
<p>that an &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; risk of harm exists before it can compel businesses to generate 
</p>
<p>substantial amounts of missing information to assess whether such a risk exists.44 It is 
</p>
<p>important to have a minimum amount of information for all substances to ensure the safe 
</p>
<p>use of hazardous substances and to avoid situations where one hazardous substance is 
</p>
<p>substituted with a different hazardous substance of equal or even greater concern. And 
</p>
<p>where laws exist, challenges have emerged with the enforcement of these laws. For 
</p>

<p>pollutant release and transfer registers are not in place in many countries. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. To effectively disseminate information 
</b></p>
<p>61. States have a duty to effectively disseminate information to everyone who may be 
</p>
<p>adversely affected by the production, storage, use, release and disposal of hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances and wastes. This includes the obligation to communicate information both 
</p>
<p>actively and on demand, as well as to make information functional.  
</p>
<p>62. Over 100 countries have laws reflecting the duty to provide information that is held 
</p>
<p>by public authorities on request, subject to certain exceptions and limitations.46 In these 
</p>
<p>countries, applicants are often entitled to obtain information within a specific time frame 
</p>
<p>and without specifying the reasons for the request.  
</p>
<p>63. States have a duty to actively disseminate information to businesses, governmental 
</p>
<p>authorities and the public, which is necessary to protect individuals and communities from 
</p>
<p>the negative impact of hazardous substances on their health and well-being. In addition to 
</p>
<p>jurisprudence articulating this duty in the context of various human rights,47 States have 
</p>
<p>acknowledged within a global policy framework that public awareness is a basic need for 
</p>
<p>decision-making, including products and articles containing hazardous substances.48  
</p>
<p>64. Informing consumers about hazardous substances in products has been a challenge. 
</p>
<p>To help realize the right of consumers to know whether they are buying products with 
</p>
<p>hazardous substances, States have created mechanisms to enable consumers to request 
</p>
<p>information from companies. Article 33 of the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, 
</p>
<p>Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals gives European consumers the right to ask 
</p>
<p>whether consumer articles contain certain types of hazardous substances. In addition, 
</p>
<p>labelling requirements enable consumers to understand quickly which hazardous substances 
</p>
<p>are present or may have been during production. The Government of the United Kingdom 
</p>
<p>of Great Britain and Northern Ireland operates a web-based environmental information 
</p>
<p>service called &#8220;What&#8217;s in your backyard?&#8221; that enables members of the public to find 
</p>
<p>information on hazardous substances waste on a local basis by entering their postcode.49 In 
</p>
<p>addition, Denmark&#8217;s Environmental Protection Agency website has a selection of &#8220;green 
</p>
<p>tips&#8221; for consumers, especially on chemicals in products. Furthermore, major hospitals in 
</p>
<p>Copenhagen have national poison hotlines, which provide information on chemicals in 
</p>
<p>relation to poisoning and mainly household, domestic accidents involving chemicals.  
</p>
<p>65. In addition to government initiatives, mobile phone applications such as ToxFox &#8212; 
</p>
<p>which checks whether cosmetic products contain hazardous substances &#8212; are available to 
</p>
<p>help consumers have access to information at the point of purchase, thereby empowering 
</p>
<p>them.50 At the global level, UNEP is leading the &#8220;chemicals in products&#8221; project to increase

<p>the availability of and access to information on the use of chemicals throughout the life 
</p>
<p>cycle of certain types of products.  
</p>
<p>66. Although efforts are being made, public access to information about hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances and wastes remains limited around the world.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. To identify and inform those at risk of disproportionate impacts 
</b></p>
<p>67. In order to protect those most at risk, States must ensure that disaggregated 
</p>
<p>information is available and accessible regarding the risks of hazardous substances to 
</p>
<p>various population groups, such as children or pregnant women. Similarly, the information 
</p>
<p>should be monitored and disaggregated by sex and population group, such as workers in 
</p>
<p>industries with exposure to hazardous substances, low-income communities, indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples or minorities, or other groups who are at high risk of adverse impacts. In addition, 
</p>
<p>States must ensure information flows effectively to communities at risk to enable them to 
</p>
<p>be aware of risks and options to prevent harm. 
</p>
<p>68. Recently the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States released high-
</p>
<p>resolution maps that show disproportionate emissions in certain regions and locales in its 
</p>
<p>territory. Such high-resolution data, coupled with population data can help States identify, 
</p>
<p>investigate and mitigate disproportionate impacts on low-income, minority and other 
</p>
<p>communities. Disaggregated information on adverse effects linked to hazardous substances, 
</p>
<p>such as cancer, can help to identify those at risk of disproportionate impacts, and help to 
</p>
<p>provide an effective remedy. In addition, biomonitoring initiatives can also help to provide 
</p>
<p>disaggregated information, for example on hazardous substances in mother&#8217;s breast milk 
</p>
<p>passed onto children. 
</p>
<p>69. To help overcome the challenge of making information accessible to workers and 
</p>
<p>others at risk, a long-standing tool nationally and internationally is classification and 
</p>
<p>labelling. These laws help to ensure businesses, workers and the public have access to 
</p>
<p>information about the risks associated with hazardous substances in the workplace. To this 
</p>
<p>end, States have pledged to implement &#8220;hazard communication mechanisms&#8221;,51 such as the 
</p>
<p>Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, and to use 
</p>
<p>safety data sheets. Training of workers is required for these tools to work effectively.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. To ensure confidentiality claims are legitimate 
</b></p>
<p>70. Ensuring the legitimacy of confidentiality claims is an inherent challenge given that 
</p>
<p>the information to be scrutinized for legitimacy is secret. Secrecy serves as a barrier to 
</p>
<p>accountability, remedy and democratic decision-making by consumers and communities. It 
</p>
<p>can also prevent international cooperation from tackling the global challenge of managing 
</p>
<p>hazardous substances and wastes. Given the challenges described above, increased 
</p>
<p>vigilance is required on the part of States to protect against illegitimate confidentiality 
</p>
<p>claims.  
</p>
<p>71. Several international agreements on hazardous substances stipulate that health and 
</p>
<p>safety information about hazardous substances should not be considered as confidential.52 
</p>
<p>In line with the obligations under these international treaties, States must ensure that 
</p>
<p>confidentiality claims are legitimate to protect and realize human rights. When a State 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 51 SAICM, Overarching Policy Strategy (see footnote 13 above), para. 15 (b) (ii).  
</p>
<p> 52 See, for example, article 17 of the Minamata Convention on Mercury stipulating that information on 
</p>
<p>the health and safety of humans and the environment shall not be regarded as confidential; and 
</p>
<p>article 9 (5) of the Stockholm Convention stipulating that information on health and safety of humans 
</p>
<p>and the environment shall not be regarded as confidential. </p>


<p>imposes restrictions on the exercise of freedom of expression which encompasses the right 
</p>
<p>to seek and receive information, these may not put in jeopardy the right itself (see general 
</p>
<p>comment No. 34, para. 21). 
</p>
<p>72. States have taken various steps to help ensure the legitimacy of confidentiality 
</p>
<p>claims with respect to hazardous substances and wastes. States have clarified that that 
</p>
<p>information should be disclosed despite confidentiality of business information in cases 
</p>
<p>where a substance is a hazardous chemical substance53 and environmental information 
</p>
<p>should not be rendered confidential.54  
</p>
<p>73. To ensure access to an effective remedy for unjustified claims of confidentiality, 
</p>
<p>States have implemented appeals mechanisms. Either an administrative appeals body or 
</p>
<p>courts, or a combination of the two, are used by States. For example, in Mexico an 
</p>
<p>administrative body (Federal Institute for Access to Information) handles appeals in the 
</p>
<p>event of a denial. France and the United Kingdom also use administrative bodies for this 
</p>
<p>purpose. The Republic of Korea and Ukraine allow appeals through the courts, and the 
</p>
<p>United States uses administrative bodies for the first appeal, followed by the courts for 
</p>
<p>further appeals.  
</p>
<p>74. Despite clarifying statements, appeals mechanisms and global agreement that health 
</p>
<p>and safety information about hazardous substances should not be confidential, there remain 
</p>
<p>serious problems with the confidentiality of information not serving the public interest by 
</p>
<p>preventing access to health and safety information about hazardous substances and wastes.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. To engage in international cooperation to help make information available 
</b></p>
<p><b>and accessible 
</b></p>
<p>75. Under numerous legal instruments, States have a duty to engage in international 
</p>
<p>cooperation to protect human rights, which includes efforts to protect human rights from 
</p>
<p>impacts resulting from the misuse of hazardous substances and wastes. International trade 
</p>
<p>in hazardous substances, whether as chemical products or as constituents of articles and 
</p>
<p>waste, is accelerating driven in large part by globalization. Furthermore, many of the 
</p>
<p>challenges to States to protect those within their territory from hazardous substances result 
</p>
<p>from actions or inactions abroad, such as the export of products containing hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances or the release of hazardous substances that can travel long distances through 
</p>
<p>wind, water and food sources.  
</p>
<p>76. Lists of hazardous substances and information-sharing about their potential uses 
</p>
<p>help to enable international cooperation on hazards and potential risks, particularly useful 
</p>
<p>for countries with limited resources and businesses that prefer to avoid using or selling 
</p>
<p>products with hazardous substances. The Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed 
</p>
<p>Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade 
</p>
<p>could be particularly useful in this respect. 
</p>
<p>77. In many ways, including some described above, States have cooperated with one 
</p>
<p>another to share information over the past several years. However, economic interests 
</p>
<p>continue to create obstacles for sharing information on hazardous substances and wastes 
</p>
<p>internationally.

<p><b> B. Responsibilities of businesses  
</b></p>
<p>78. Businesses have a responsibility to respect human rights. The Guiding Principles on 
</p>
<p>Business and Human Rights elaborate on existing standards and practices for States and 
</p>
<p>businesses.55 Businesses have a responsibility to respect, at a minimum, all internationally 
</p>
<p>recognized human rights.  
</p>
<p>79. Under the Dubai Declaration on International Chemicals Management, chemical 
</p>
<p>manufacturers and other industries committed themselves &#8220;to respecting human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms&#8221;,56 which includes the right to information.  
</p>
<p>80. Virtually every industry and business sector is linked to the production, use, release 
</p>
<p>or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes up and down the value chain. The failure of 
</p>
<p>governments to require a minimum level of health and safety information on industrial 
</p>
<p>chemicals introduced into the flow of commerce has exposed downstream businesses to 
</p>
<p>numerous risks from selling products containing hazardous substances, including the 
</p>
<p>potential for substantial legal liability and reputational risks, as well as the costs of clean-up 
</p>
<p>and other necessary protection measures.  
</p>
<p>81. In order to meet their responsibility to respect human rights, businesses should have 
</p>
<p>a policy commitment to respect human rights, a process for human rights due diligence, and 
</p>
<p>a process to enable an effective remedy for human rights impacts they cause or to which 
</p>
<p>they contribute.57  
</p>
<p>82. Information-related obstacles are one of the most significant challenges confronting 
</p>
<p>victims who seek an effective remedy for human rights violations they suffer from 
</p>
<p>hazardous substances and wastes. In performing human rights due diligence, businesses 
</p>
<p>should identify, prevent, mitigate and account for how they address their adverse human 
</p>
<p>rights impacts.58 The concept of human rights due diligence requires more than compliance 
</p>
<p>with existing laws for hazardous substances and wastes. The due diligence process should 
</p>
<p>include, inter alia, assessments of actual and potential impacts and communicating 
</p>
<p>information about how actual and potential impacts are mitigated and addressed.59  
</p>
<p><b> 1. To identify and assess adverse impacts 
</b></p>
<p>83. When conducting due diligence, businesses should identify and assess actual and 
</p>
<p>potential adverse human rights impacts with which they may be involved either through 
</p>
<p>their own activities or as a result of their business relationships.60  
</p>
<p>84. A fundamental challenge for all businesses is that &#8220;understanding of health impacts 
</p>
<p>of [hazardous substances] remains limited&#8221;.61 This is a crucial element relevant to all 
</p>
<p>businesses in order to ensure they are carrying out their due diligence process. For 
</p>
<p>substances where hazards are understood, ensuring that these substances are used safely is 
</p>
<p>another substantial challenge for businesses.  
</p>
<p>85. Consensus has grown that greater responsibility should lie with businesses to make 
</p>
<p>information available about the risks and impacts of hazardous substances. In 2006, States 
</p>

<p>and industry stressed the responsibility of industry to make available to stakeholders such 
</p>
<p>data and information on health and environmental effects of chemicals as are needed.62  
</p>
<p>86. In identifying and assessing adverse impacts, ensuring the integrity of information 
</p>
<p>about hazardous substances has been a reoccurring challenge. In some cases, scientists may 
</p>
<p>not have disclosed financial ties with chemical manufacturers and other possible conflicts 
</p>
<p>of interest when making statements as &#8220;independent&#8221; scientific experts. In other cases, the 
</p>
<p>integrity of pollution sampling and information monitoring has been of concern.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. To effectively communicate information  
</b></p>
<p>87. There is a shared responsibility between businesses that supply and use hazardous 
</p>
<p>substances to communicate information to determine risks and prevent harm.63 According 
</p>
<p>to the principles adopted by the American Chemistry Council, companies throughout the 
</p>
<p>chain of commerce should be responsible for providing necessary hazard, use, and exposure 
</p>
<p>information.64  
</p>
<p>88. Businesses have a responsibility to publicly communicate information about the 
</p>
<p>risks created by their activities and how they mitigate and address both actual and potential 
</p>
<p>human rights impacts with which they might be involved,65 including businesses that use, 
</p>
<p>produce and release hazardous substances. As indicated by Guiding Principle 21, these 
</p>
<p>communications should:  
</p>
<p>(a) Be of a form and frequency that reflect an enterprise&#8217;s human rights impacts 
</p>
<p>and that are accessible to its intended audiences;  
</p>
<p>(b) Provide information that is sufficient to evaluate the adequacy of an 
</p>
<p>enterprise&#8217;s response to the particular human rights impact involved;  
</p>
<p>(c) In turn not pose risks to affected stakeholders, personnel or to legitimate 
</p>
<p>requirements of commercial confidentiality.  
</p>
<p>Information about these measures should flow among businesses, as well as from 
</p>
<p>businesses to governmental authorities and the public.  
</p>
<p>89. Businesses have a responsibility to provide any and all information necessary to 
</p>
<p>respect human rights affected by hazardous substances. To this end, emissions to the 
</p>
<p>environment should not be considered confidential.66 The Zero Discharge of Hazardous 
</p>
<p>Chemicals (ZDHC)67 industry initiative sees a system like the one of pollutant release and 
</p>
<p>transfer registers as one &#8220;that would meet one of the ZDHC key principles of engaging

<p>90. Businesses are increasingly disclosing the ingredients of products they make and 
</p>
<p>sell. This not only helps to meet their responsibility to consumers and communities, but 
</p>
<p>also helps to ensure that adverse impacts do not result from improper disposal or reuse.  
</p>
<p>91. While some consumer products provide limited access to information about 
</p>
<p>hazardous substances (or the absence of a few hazardous substances in their products), 
</p>
<p>there are serious deficiencies in the amount and type of information consumers have 
</p>
<p>regarding the hazardous chemicals present in products they use. Critically, there is a deficit 
</p>
<p>of information about actual and potential impacts of hazardous substances. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>information is missing about the adverse human rights impacts from hazardous substances 
</p>
<p>implicated in the production of consumer products. There is also a lack of information 
</p>
<p>about the actual and potential impacts after products are discarded for recycling or disposal.  
</p>
<p>92. Businesses also have a responsibility to communicate information to individuals or 
</p>
<p>groups at disproportionate risk of adverse impacts.69 In general, but especially for children, 
</p>
<p>local communities in high-risk areas and others at risk of disproportionate impacts, it is not 
</p>
<p>sufficient to simply identify the name of the hazardous substance. It is essential to explain 
</p>
<p>and create awareness about what harm may result. This concept has been adopted for 
</p>
<p>tobacco products, where packages do not identify the hazardous substance, but rather 
</p>
<p>cancer and other adverse effects. However, for cosmetics and other consumer products with 
</p>
<p>substances listed, often only the substance is listed (some of which may be masked by 
</p>
<p>generic terms such as &#8220;fragrance&#8221;), not the potential adverse effect. And of course, most 
</p>
<p>products do not contain their constituent substances at all, including hazardous substances.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. To engage in cross-border cooperation  
</b></p>
<p>93. The ongoing expansion of supply chains and business relationships around the world 
</p>
<p>&#8212; resulting in increased production, use and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes 
</p>
<p>in countries with limited capacity to ensure their safe use and disposal &#8212; heightens the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of businesses to ensure their products do not cause or contribute to human 
</p>
<p>rights violations because of hazardous substances, both at home and abroad.70 
</p>
<p>94. Businesses need to have appropriate tracking mechanisms in place to ensure that 
</p>
<p>actual and potential human rights impacts are addressed, whether they cause or contribute 
</p>
<p>to these impacts.71  
</p>
<p>95. When information is submitted to one State about the health and safety of any 
</p>
<p>substance, it should be in the public domain. Whether or not a country has identical, 
</p>
<p>appropriate or reliable systems to protect confidentiality is not pertinent when it comes to 
</p>
<p>health and safety information about hazardous substances and wastes, because this should 
</p>
<p>not be confidential.  
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>principle of non-discrimination.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>People have a right to know whether they are being exposed to hazardous 
</b></p>
<p><b>substances. Yet, whether on consumer products or food, information is not available 
</b></p>
<p><b>or accessible. Over the past several decades, tens of thousands of different hazardous 
</b></p>
<p><b>substances have been used by businesses with inadequate information on their 
</b></p>
<p><b>properties and uses, as well as their fate as waste, to assess their impacts on human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights. The right of victims to an effective remedy, the right to meaningful 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation, the right not to be subject to experimentation without consent, the right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the highest attainable standard of health and several other human rights have all 
</b></p>
<p><b>been frustrated by large information gaps throughout the life cycle of substances and 
</b></p>
<p><b>wastes.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Today, information is neither available nor accessible about, inter alia, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>safety of tens of thousands of chemicals on the market; the potential sources of 
</b></p>
<p><b>exposure to substances with known and unknown hazards; the amount of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>exposure to hazardous substances; and the impacts of exposure to a large number of 
</b></p>
<p><b>hazardous substances starting from conception. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>To protect human rights affected by hazardous substances, States are duty-
</b></p>
<p><b>bound to generate, collect, assess and update information; effectively communicate 
</b></p>
<p><b>such information, particularly to those disproportionately at risk of adverse impacts; 
</b></p>
<p><b>to ensure confidentiality claims are legitimate; and to engage in international 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation to ensure that foreign Governments have the information necessary to 
</b></p>
<p><b>protect the rights of people in their territory.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>In discharging their duty to conduct human rights due diligence, businesses are 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible for identifying and assessing the actual and potential impacts of 
</b></p>
<p><b>hazardous substances and wastes, either through their own activities or as a result of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their business relationships; to communicate information to other businesses, 
</b></p>
<p><b>governments and the public effectively.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>In the light of these observations, the Special Rapporteur offers the following 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To ensure information is available:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) States must generate, collect, assess and update information about the

<p><b>properties, uses, emissions and the fate of hazardous substances and wastes 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary for assessing actual and potential impacts on human rights, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right to life and health;

<p><b>(ii) States should ensure that individuals and communities, especially those

</b></p>
<p><b>including the adverse effects that may result from exposure. Better use of 
</b></p>
<p><b>biomonitoring information, in conjunction with disease registers, should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>made, particularly for those at high risk of adverse impacts;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Businesses should undertake robust human rights due diligence for

<p><b>activities, including identifying and assessing adverse impacts that may result 
</b></p>
<p><b>therefrom; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Where States require businesses to help generate, collect, assess and 
</b></p>
<p><b>update information about hazardous substances and wastes, they must ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that adequate and appropriate mechanisms are in place to ensure the integrity </b></p>


<p><b>of the information generated and assessments performed, through government 
</b></p>
<p><b>oversight, the involvement of third parties, or some combination thereof to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure the reliability of information. Direct or indirect financial ties and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflicts of interest must be disclosed; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) States should ensure that reliable baseline information is generated for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the presence of hazardous substances in air, water and soil that may be released 
</b></p>
<p><b>by extractive or other industrial activities before such activities begin; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vi) Where information is unavailable, States should make the public aware 
</b></p>
<p><b>of missing information and exercise caution to prevent possible adverse impacts 
</b></p>
<p><b>while information is generated, collected and assessed; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To ensure information is accessible:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) States must actively inform the public of the risks of hazardous 
</b></p>
<p><b>substances and wastes, including those at risk of disproportionate impacts. 
</b></p>
<p><b>States should ensure that people have access in adequate languages and formats 
</b></p>
<p><b>to information on specific adverse impacts of hazardous substances released 
</b></p>
<p><b>into their environment and in everyday products;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) States must immediately communicate to the public imminent threats to 
</b></p>
<p><b>public health and the environment. States should ensure that all information 
</b></p>
<p><b>that would enable the public to prevent harm is disseminated. Businesses whose 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities result in imminent threats must convey to the government authorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the public a threat to public health or the environment, providing full 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to information about risks, impacts and mitigation measures; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) States should create a centralized system that is physically and 
</b></p>
<p><b>economically accessible regrouping all relevant information on hazardous 
</b></p>
<p><b>substances and wastes and its impact on human health and the environment, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including concerns raised with national and subnational authorities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>businesses;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) States and businesses should be guided by the principle of full disclosure, 
</b></p>
<p><b>allowing secrecy only when the necessity and legitimacy of confidentiality are 
</b></p>
<p><b>proved. States must require that claims of confidentiality be justified and 
</b></p>
<p><b>periodically resubstantiated. Grounds for the refusal of access to information 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be interpreted in a restrictive way, taking into account the public interest 
</b></p>
<p><b>served by disclosure. If information exempted from disclosure can be separated 
</b></p>
<p><b>out without prejudice to the confidentiality of the information exempted, public 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities must disseminate the remainder of the information requested  
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) States should ensure any limitations to the right of access to information 
</b></p>
<p><b>on hazardous substance and wastes should be in conformity with the law, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>principle of proportionality and necessity, reasonable purpose and objective 
</b></p>
<p><b>and protection of the right of others; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vi) Information relevant to the protection of and respect for human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>should never </b>be considered &#8220;confidential&#8221; or &#8220;secret&#8221;<b>. Health and safety 
</b></p>
<p><b>information about hazardous substances and wastes should not be confidential, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including emissions into the environment, toxicity studies and chemical 
</b></p>
<p><b>identity; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vii) States and businesses should provide an exhaustive list of information or 
</b></p>
<p><b>types of information that is not publicly accessible but provided to 
</b></p>
<p><b>governments, including the reason for non-disclosure;  </b></p>


<p><b>(viii) States should improve the traceability of the human rights impacts of 
</b></p>
<p><b>hazardous substances and wastes in the global supply chain. Businesses should 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that information on human rights impacts of hazardous substances and 
</b></p>
<p><b>wastes flows up and down the supply/value chain, including between operations 
</b></p>
<p><b>in foreign countries; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ix) States must ensure that court proceedings and settlement agreements on 
</b></p>
<p><b>alleged impacts of hazardous substances and wastes do not have confidentiality 
</b></p>
<p><b>attached;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(x) States must ensure access to an effective remedy and have a grievance 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanism for individuals to appeal against denials of access to information;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To ensure information is functional: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) States must ensure that information is presented in a form that allows 
</b></p>
<p><b>the recipient to protect, respect, fulfil and enjoy human rights;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) States must ensure that all necessary information is available and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessible to ensure access to an effective remedy and meaningful public 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Businesses should communicate information to Governments, and be 
</b></p>
<p><b>subject to regulation and strict guidelines about information. Businesses should 
</b></p>
<p><b>also communicate to the public relevant information about hazardous 
</b></p>
<p><b>substances in their supply chains and products in a user-friendly format;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) States and businesses should publish information in the languages of 
</b></p>
<p><b>linguistic minorities and indigenous peoples, and pay special attention in 
</b></p>
<p><b>providing information to those most at risk; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) To ensure non-discrimination in the generation, collection or production 
</b></p>
<p><b>of information: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) States must ensure disaggregated information is available on actual and 
</b></p>
<p><b>potential impacts to those at heightened risk of adverse impacts due to their 
</b></p>
<p><b>proximity or geographic location, physical conditions, economic status, 
</b></p>
<p><b>occupation, gender or age;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) States must ensure that information is available and accessible on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>risks of childhood exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, paying close 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention to pre and postnatal periods; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) To increase international and cross-border cooperation:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) States should create a global database of information on hazardous 
</b></p>
<p><b>substances and wastes, including a repository of intrinsic properties, uses, 
</b></p>
<p><b>protective measures and regulations/restrictions and other information 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary to protect human rights from hazardous substances; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) States should implement the Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights with special attention to hazardous substances and wastes, particularly 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the responsibility of the chemical manufacturers to realize the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>information; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) States should accelerate the implementation of the Rotterdam 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous 
</b></p>
<p><b>Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, develop Pollutant Release and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Transfer Registers, and implement the Globally Harmonized System of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Classification and Labelling of Chemicals;  </b></p>


<p><b>(iv) States should ensure that foreign governments have access to all 
</b></p>
<p><b>available health and safety information about hazardous substances and wastes 
</b></p>
<p><b>that may be produced, released, used or transported abroad. 
</b></p>
