<p><i>Summary</i> 
 The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants conducted an official 
visit to South Africa from 24 January to 1 February 2011, where he visited Pretoria, 
Johannesburg, Musina and Cape Town, and met with Government ministers, Members 
of Parliament, officials of central and provincial governments, the United Nations 
country team, lawyers, academics and members of civil society organizations, as well as 
with migrants in South Africa. 
</p>
<p> While recognizing that the Government has taken measures to protect migrants, 
such as the regularization process of Zimbabweans present in the country, has started to 
address the xenophobic attacks directed against migrants in townships and to alleviate 
the impact of the recent economic crisis, the Special Rapporteur noted that other 
challenges are still to be addressed.  In addition, the integration of migrants into society 
is hampered by the absence of a comprehensive immigration policy and the lack of 
regional and multilateral agreements. 
</p>
<p> In this context, the Special Rapporteur makes a number of recommendations for 
the Government, including the need to develop thorough data and statistics based on the 
demand for the labour force, the arrest and detention of foreign nationals, access of 
migrants to social services, in particular health care, and the situation of unaccompanied 
foreign children, all in the context of the absence of a comprehensive immigration policy

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Jorge Bustamante, 
conducted an official visit to South Africa from 24 January to 1 February 2011, at the 
invitation of the Government. In Pretoria, Johannesburg, Musina and Cape Town, the 
Special Rapporteur met with Government ministers, Members of Parliament, officials of 
central and provincial governments, the United Nations country team, lawyers, academics 
and members of civil society organizations, as well as with migrants. He also visited the 
Lindela repatriation centre and the Beitbridge border facility, and met with migrant 
associations.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to the Government for its 
cooperation, as well as to the various organizations that provided support for his mission, in 
particular the Regional Office for Southern Africa of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, the International Organization for Migration, the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and South African civil society for their support 
for his mission. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background: the migration phenomenon in South 
Africa 
</b></p>
<p>3. In terms of numbers, internal migration is the most significant form of movement. 
Since the end of apartheid and the increased integration of the economy with its neighbours, 
international migration has also posed challenges to Government planning, service 
provision and social cohesion.1 Although the scale of migration and its impact vary, 
Gauteng Province receives the greatest number of migrants from other provinces, while the 
Eastern Cape loses the most people to other provinces. Despite its impressive dimensions, 
migration is often less important than other population dynamics. Between 2001 and 2007, 
for example, while 74 per cent of population growth in Gauteng was due to natural growth 
(the difference between the birth and death rate of people already living in the province), 26 
per cent was due to migration; only 3 per cent of total growth was due to cross-border 
migration. Cross-border labour migration between South Africa and its neighbours dates 
back to the mid-nineteenth century, when the South African diamond and gold mining 
industries were founded and the country began to move towards a modern industrial 
economy.  
</p>
<p>4. A significant proportion of citizens from neighbouring States has migrated to South 
Africa, many to work. Cross-border migration has taken various forms. At one end of the 
spectrum is the highly regulated and formalized mine contract labour system; at the other, 
various kinds of informal or unregulated movements across borders. South Africa has 
received both kinds of migrants for decades. Commercial farmers also relied heavily on 
outside labour, much of it irregular. The recent crisis in Zimbabwe led to a new wave of 
movements to South Africa. Migration from Zimbabwe has been around three times greater 
than that from Mozambique during the civil war. This crisis of migration into South Africa 
is a direct product of the crisis in Zimbabwe. From 1994 to July 2008, South Africa 
</p>

</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>deported 1.7 million undocumented migrants to neighbouring States, such as Mozambique, 
Zimbabwe and Lesotho. In 2006 alone, 260,000 migrants were arrested and deported.2  
</p>
<p>5. The lack of reliable statistics regarding international migration, however, allows for 
rumours and assumptions to take hold. It is estimated that there are approximately between 
1.6 and 2 million foreign citizens in South Africa, the majority of them Zimbabweans, 
including people with valid permits, asylum-seekers and undocumented migrants,3 or 3 to 4 
per cent of the total population - a figure considerably lower than other African countries 
and countries of destination for migrants. Contrary to popular belief therefore, migration is 
far less numerically significant. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework for the protection of 
the human rights of migrants  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>6. South Africa is party to a number of core international human rights treaties, in 
particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, as well as the optional protocols to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>7. South Africa is yet to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families, the International Convention for the Protection of 
all Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture. 
</p>
<p>8. South Africa has ratified the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 
protocol thereto, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime, the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, 
Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime, and the Migration for Employment Convention (Revised), 1949 (No. 97) 
and the Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, 1975 (No. 143) of the 
International Labour Organization (ILO). 
</p>
<p>9. Since joining the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1994, South Africa has 
adhered to the OAU Charter and to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. 
Finally, the Protocol on the Facilitation of Movement of Persons of the Southern African 
Development Community (SADC) (to which South Africa is a party) envisages the 
progressive facilitation of movement in the SADC region through the introduction of free 
visas and the right of the region&#8217;s citizens to work and establish themselves freely.

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p><b> B. National legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Policy and legislation 
</b></p>
<p>10. The constitutional guarantees of human rights and the legal framework governing 
asylum are widely considered to be progressive. 
</p>
<p>11. Legislation regulating migration issues includes the Refugees Act (1998), the 
Immigration Act (2002) (last amended in 2004), the Immigration Regulations (2005), the 
Criminal Procedure Act (Act No. 51 of 1977), the Defence Act (Act No. 42 of 2002) and 
the Child Care Act (1983) for minors. 
</p>
<p>12. The Refugees Act (1998) sets out the procedures for applying for and the granting of 
refugee status. Condition no. 9 of the asylum-seeker permit allows asylum-seekers to work 
and study while their applications are pending, although it may take up to six months for an 
application for political asylum to be processed. This state of affairs raises questions about 
the welfare of applicants in the interim, and could encourage asylum-seekers to resort to the 
underground economy or even crime.  
</p>
<p>13. Immigration issues are governed by the Immigration Act of 2002 (&#8220;the Act&#8221;, last 
amended in 2004), which regulates the provision to issue permits for skilled migrants, 
students, tourists and other categories of permanent and temporary migrants by the 
Department of Home Affairs. It is worth noting that, since 2009, South Africa has entered 
into bilateral agreements with all neighbouring countries, whereby citizens are eligible for a 
free visa to enter South Africa for periods of up to 30 days. Such a visa does not include the 
right to work or to seek employment.  
</p>
<p>14. The Immigration Act also aims at establishing a system of immigration control, 
which would ensure that permanent residence permits are issued as expeditiously as 
possible and on the basis of simplified procedures and reasonable criteria. It also aims at 
taking into consideration the contribution of foreigners to the South African labour market, 
which should not have an adverse impact on existing labour standards and the rights and 
expectations of South African workers. The Act also regulates the arrest and deportation of 
undocumented migrants.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Illegal foreigners and detention 
</b></p>
<p>15. According to section 49 of the Immigration Act, it is an offence to enter or remain in 
the country without a proper permit or papers. Anyone who fails to produce valid 
documents entitling them to be in the country can be arrested by an immigration officer or a 
member of the police without a warrant, for purposes of identification (sect. 41). Section 34 
of the Act provides for the arrest, detention and deportation of &#8220;illegal foreigners&#8221;. An 
illegal foreigner is defined under section 1 as &#8220;a foreigner who is in the Republic in 
contravention of this Act.&#8221; According to the Act, an immigration officer may declare any 
person an illegal foreigner if that particular officer is not satisfied that he or she is a citizen, 
a permanent resident or a temporary resident under the Act. Section 32(2) of the Act 
requires that anyone declared an illegal foreigner be deported.  
</p>
<p>16. Under the Immigration Regulations (2005), an illegal foreigner may be issued a 
&#8220;Form 20&#8221; exempting them from arrest and detention pending the outcome of a status 
application. A person may be detained on &#8220;reasonable grounds&#8221; for up to 48 hours while his 
or her status is investigated. After being declared an illegal foreigner by an immigration 
officer, he or she may be detained for up to 30 days without a warrant. For detentions 
lasting longer than 30 days, the immigration officer must obtain a warrant from a 
magistrate&#8217;s court. The warrant may extend the detention for a maximum period of 90 days.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>17. Following arrest, most illegal foreigners are sent to detention centres, pending 
deportation. An asylum-seeker whose application is rejected may lodge an appeal within 30 
days, but will remain in detention until the appeal is finalized, a process that can take more 
than a year. Asylum-seekers are only released once they are granted refugee status.4  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Minors  
</b></p>
<p>18. Section 28(2) of the Constitution provides that the child&#8217;s best interests are &#8220;of 
paramount importance in every matter concerning the child&#8221;. According to section 29(2) of 
the Refugees Act, &#8220;the detention of a child must be used only as a measure of last resort and 
for the shortest appropriate period of time.&#8221; The Immigration Regulations stipulate that 
detained minors should be kept separately from adults and in accommodation appropriate to 
their age and that unaccompanied minors should not be detained (article 1(d) of annex B to 
regulation 28(5)). The Child Care Act requires that children be brought before a children&#8217;s 
court to determine if they are in need of care.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Asylum-seekers and refugees 
</b></p>
<p>19. The status of asylum-seekers and refugees is distinct from that of persons deemed 
illegal foreigners, and is governed separately by the Refugees Act, although the Special 
Rapporteur did note that this distinction is sometimes subject to confusion and 
misinterpretation. An asylum-seeker who enters South Africa must present him or herself to 
one of the country&#8217;s six refugee reception offices to apply for refugee status. Section 6 of 
the Act requires that the latter be interpreted and applied with due regard to instruments of 
international human rights protection. This approach is in conformity with the Constitution, 
which requires that the Bill of Rights be considered in the light of the State&#8217;s international 
obligations. Section 21(4) of the Refugees Act demarcates the boundary between the 
Immigration Act and the Refugees Act, stating that no proceedings may be instituted or 
continued against a person for being an &#8220;illegal foreigner&#8221; if that person has either made an 
application for asylum or has been recognized as a refugee. Where the Refugees Act 
applies, the provisions of the Immigration Act should not be employed. The Refugees Act 
contains its own measures for enforcement, including detention. According to the Refugees 
Act, a refugee or an asylum-seeker can only be detained if his or her permit has been 
removed, and even then, he or she must be brought before a high court judge to determine if 
further detention is reasonable and justifiable.5 Accordingly, the Immigration Act cannot be 
applied to individuals whose status falls under the provisions of the Refugees Act.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Other arrest procedures  
</b></p>
<p>20. The Criminal Procedure Act (Act No. 51 of 1977) allows for the arrest and detention 
of &#8220;prohibited persons&#8221;, a category of persons different from those deemed &#8220;illegal 
foreigners&#8221;. In the area of border control, arrest and detention is governed by the Defence 
Act No. 42 of 2002. While domestic law enables other law enforcement agencies to be 
involved in immigration enforcement, only immigration officers are empowered under the 
Immigration Act to declare someone an illegal foreigner and to effect their deportation from 
the country. In the normal course of events, a police officer, an immigration officer or a 
member of the National Defense Force patrolling the border may, on reasonable grounds, 
request a person to identify as a citizen, a permanent resident or a temporary resident. The 
person may be detained for up to 48 hours while their status is verified, provided that there 
are reasonable grounds for such detention. 
</p>
<p>  
 4 Applications may only be lodged with a designated refugee reception centre. For this reason, 
</p>
<p>applications cannot be lodged at the Lindela facility.

</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>21. The procedure for extraditing asylum-seekers and refugees is governed by the 
Extradition Act of 1962, which provides for the arrest of fugitives and subsequent inquiry 
by a magistrate and, if necessary, an order to surrender by the Minister for Justice and 
Constitutional Development. If, however, the Department of Home Affairs decides to grant 
asylum to a fugitive, the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development cannot 
order the arrest of that person.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Constitutional and legal guarantees 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur was informed of the strong constitutional and legal 
guarantees that protect all persons in South Africa against deprivation of liberty and the 
progressive enumeration of social and economical rights, which prohibits discrimination in 
access to public services such as health care, education and social security.  
</p>
<p>23. The Constitution is the supreme law in South Africa. In the preamble, it 
acknowledges the injustices of the past and dedicates the nation to building a democratic 
and open society. The Constitution contains 14 chapters and 7 schedules. Chapter 2 (sects. 
7-39) contains the Bill of Rights, which is regarded as one the most progressive of the 
world. Most of its provisions apply to all persons in the country, whether they are citizens 
or not or have legal status of stay or residence. In particular, section 9, the provision 
guaranteeing equality of all persons, states that: 
</p>
<p> (a) Everyone is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection and 
benefit of the law;  
</p>
<p> (b) Equality includes the full and equal enjoyment of all rights and freedoms. To 
promote the achievement of equality, legislative and other measures designed to protect or 
advance persons or categories of persons disadvantaged by unfair discrimination may be 
taken;  
</p>
<p> (c) The State may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone 
on one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or 
social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, 
language and birth. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the rights protected and guaranteed to all 
in the Bill of Rights, which he found to be comprehensive and covering all issues relevant 
to the protection of migrants, in particular the right to freedom and security of the person 
(sect. 12), the prohibition of slavery, servitude or forced labour (sect. 13), freedom of 
employment and fair labour practices (sects. 22-23), the right of all to adequate housing 
(sect. 26), to health care, food, water and social security services (sect. 27) and education 
(sect. 29), and the protection of children (sect. 28). The State has the obligation to take 
reasonable legislative and other measures, within available resources, to achieve the 
progressive realization of each of these rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Absence of anti-immigrant stance in political discourse 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur noted the absence of anti-immigrant sentiment in political 
discourse. He welcomes the Government&#8217;s handling of previous episodes of xenophobic 
violence, noting in particular that the organization of the FIFA World Cup took place in 
2010 without any major incident, as had been feared.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur was informed of several laws that prohibit discrimination 
and make it an aggravating circumstance for the purpose of sentencing, such as the Unfair 
Discrimination Act (2000). He also noted initiatives taken by various authorities, such as 
the social dialogue on the promotion of tolerance and diversity, an initiative developed by 
the Department of Home Affairs, and the parliamentary task teams on migration, 
xenophobia and refugees, formed by the Portfolio Committee of Home Affairs and 
comprising elected representatives from the National Assembly, which have engaged in the 
promotion of the economic, justice and human rights of migrants and marginalized 
communities. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur was informed that a hate crime bill was currently being 
prepared by the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, in charge of 
drafting bills proposed by the Government. The bill would strengthen the measures already 
contained in the Constitution and other applicable laws to address violence against foreign 
nationals (including asylum-seekers and refugees), and would expressly criminalize 
violence committed against individuals or their property on the basis of a person&#8217;s race, 
nationality, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity (&#8220;hate crime&#8221;). This 
would follow the introduction in 2009of a law combating human trafficking, currently 
tabled in Parliament. In the meantime, plans for a potential law against smuggling are still 
being prepared. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Initiative to regularize Zimbabwean nationals 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur was informed of a recent initiative to allow the 
regularization of Zimbabwean nationals, which had been extended together with a 
moratorium on repatriations and plans to consider such an initiative to other neighbouring 
countries. On 3 April 2009, the Department of Home Affairs announced its intention to 
grant Zimbabweans in South Africa a 12-month &#8220;special dispensation permit&#8221; on the basis 
of the Immigration Act, section 31 (2)(b). The permit grants the right to legally live and 
work in the country. As complementary measures, a moratorium on deportations and a 90-
day free visa for Zimbabweans entering South Africa were brought in in May 2009. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur was able to witness the effects of this initiative first-hand at 
the Beitbridge border crossing in Musina. The regularization of Zimbabwean migration is 
consistent with internationally agreed policies on managing migration and has been 
presented as one of the key goals of the current administration. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that the set of policies regularizing 
movement between South Africa and Zimbabwe is a positive shift towards a more rational, 
coherent and regionally beneficial approach to migration management. He noted that 
previous approaches to managing Zimbabwean migration (including the asylum system and 
widespread arrest and detention) did not address the nature or scale of movement, and thus 
resulted in high levels of irregular migration, rights abuses and negative consequences for 
South Africa. 
</p>
<p>31. The introduction of special temporary permits to manage complex mixed migration 
is increasingly common internationally. South Africa should receive recognition and 
support for adopting this policy, given the widespread interest in supporting regional 
stability and Zimbabwean reconstruction. Regularizing movement between South Africa 
and Zimbabwe will help to achieve the development goals of the Southern Africa region by 
facilitating efforts to combat corruption, protect labour standards, improve the economy and 
fight crime. While the free visa and special dispensation permit is insufficient to achieve 
these broader policy aims on its own, these challenges would be much more difficult to 
tackle without the effective implementation of these policies. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur also noted that the above policies have not led to an increase 
in the overall volume of migration from Zimbabwe to South Africa. Of the range of legal 
policy options available to regularize movement between Zimbabwe and South Africa, the 
proposed special dispensation permit is the most appropriate to the context (the need of 
Zimbabweans to work and to move freely between countries), besides being the easiest to 
implement. 
</p>
<p>33. As the Special Rapporteur was able to see first-hand, many Zimbabweans move 
frequently between the two countries, often to buy and resell food and goods to support 
their families remaining in Zimbabwe. Large segments of the Zimbabwean population and 
economy have been supported for years through remittances from South Africa. Such 
transfers have been beneficial in supporting the most vulnerable women, children and 
elderly persons left behind in Zimbabwe.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that the special dispensation permits are 
more likely to facilitate the return of Zimbabweans home than provide an incentive to 
remain in South Africa, because people can return to Zimbabwe for short periods to assess 
the stability and economic opportunities of the country without fearing to lose their ability 
to earn a livelihood in South Africa. There is evidence that migrants who feel threatened 
through deportation and a lack of legal options for movement are more likely to stay in a 
foreign country, despite the extreme hardships, since return without alternatives for a 
known livelihood is too risky. Furthermore, they can gradually invest the money earned in 
South Africa to re-establish themselves and develop a livelihood in Zimbabwe. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Major challenges in the protection of the human rights of 
migrants  
</b></p>
<p>35. Despite the positive measures recently taken at the national level, the Special 
Rapporteur found that challenges are still to be addressed by the Government, particularly 
that of effectively protecting the human rights of migrants. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Absence of a clear and comprehensive immigration policy 
</b></p>
<p>36. Although South Africa is part of the SADC Protocol on the Facilitation of the 
Movement of Persons, the Special Rapporteur noted the absence of an institutional strategy 
for this region on migration. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>37. South Africa is an attractive destination for Africans from all over the continent, 
lured by work in mines, farms and homes. Although there are no exact figures available, the 
Government often cites an estimate of between 4 and 8 million immigrants in the country at 
any given time. Statistical sources suggest that about 1.5 million of these are Zimbabwean 
nationals.6  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur believes that a clear and comprehensive immigration policy 
is necessary. Although he was pleased to note that some measures to manage migration 
flows have been taken, they mostly affect Zimbabwean nationals, who currently represent 
the largest group of migrants residing in South Africa.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur did, however, note certain flaws in the above initiative. 
Permits are issued under the Immigration Act and allow Zimbabwean nationals to apply for

<p>permits to work, study and or conduct business. However, the deadline for application for 
these special permits was 31 December 2010. The relatively short period of time that the 
Zimbabweans were given to apply for this dispensation, combined with additional 
requirements of a Zimbabwean passport and support for the application from the employer, 
educational institute or proof of registration of business7 made it difficult for them to apply 
in time. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Zimbabwe Documentation Process has 
witnessed shortfalls in its application and management, resulting in overly-high demands 
on Home Affairs offices and in deficiencies in the queuing and application system. The 
delays in the process and the brief period allocated to it seem to be the greatest obstacles 
encountered.8 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the fact that the Department of Home Affairs 
has attempted to simplify the documentation process, particularly for those who had good 
reason for not being able to apply by the deadline; he did, however, hear of complaints 
about the implementation and management processes of this initiative.9 By the time the 
shortcomings of the documentation process were discovered, many people had already 
returned to Zimbabwe to apply for passports, as the few Zimbabwean consulates were often 
unable to issue the required documentation. 
</p>
<p>41. These shortcomings highlight the absence of a clear and comprehensive immigration 
policy applicable to all foreign nationals in the country, covering all categories of migrants. 
Such a policy would also need to create and maintain the necessary conditions for the 
successful integration of migrants into South African society.  
</p>
<p>42. In order to achieve such a comprehensive policy, covering the flow of labour 
migration and with a human rights-based approach, a regional approach could be developed 
with SADC member States. 
</p>
<p>43. The absence of a comprehensive immigration policy with regard to labour demands 
was also illustrated in 2008 and 2009, during the violent anti-foreigner riots that took place 
throughout the country. The tensions were fuelled by the economic crisis, which affected 
the most vulnerable, and the fierce competition for employment between South African 
nationals and foreigners, who were seen as &#8220;stealing&#8221; the few jobs available by accepting 
lower wages and poor working conditions. In other areas, riots were reported in townships 
where foreign nationals had established small businesses with highly competitive practices, 
often driving their South African competitors out of business. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur was informed of the violence that took place in late 2009 in 
the De Doorns and Worcester communities in the municipality of Breede Valley (Western 
Cape), where many migrant workers were employed by contractors in the agriculture 
industry, often at wages and conditions in conflict with labour laws. The Special 
Rapporteur, who visited the region and met with the municipal authorities, was informed 
that, at the height of the violence, an estimated 3,000 migrant workers, mostly from 
Zimbabwe, had to be displaced for their own safety.10 Although at the time of the visit the 
situation was again calm, the tension remained and the municipal authorities had difficulties

<p>in addressing the needs of these communities, in particular their access to water and 
sanitation and the delivery of social services, such as health and education. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur believes that serious incidents that took place throughout the 
country in 2008 and 2009 demonstrate the need to develop a comprehensive immigration 
policy at a regional level, and that the absence of such a policy will only exacerbate existing 
tensions with the different communities, which could escalate into violence once again. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Lack of data and statistics 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern at the absence of thorough data and 
statistics concerning not only the migrants present in the country but also the needs of the 
labour market and demand for the services of migrant workers.  
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur noted the difficulties in the collection and analysis of data 
and statistics relating to migration. On many occasions, existing administrative data and 
disaggregated statistics were not available or up to date. Data on the entry and exit of 
foreigners and on residence permits, among other types of information, were difficult to 
update, although new databases were being integrated into the Department of Home Affairs 
management system. Beyond the efforts to compile more thorough data on the entry and 
exit of migrants, a clear distinction should be made between immigration control and crime 
prevention. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur noted that other departments, especially those in charge of 
the labour market and those providing social services, had not collected data systematically 
and comprehensively, and that statistics on labour demand remained unavailable. The 
Special Rapporteur was also informed that general population surveys and censuses were 
conducted at intervals that were too distant and that the questions asked relating to labour 
and migration issues were not collected during them.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur believes that only with clear and disaggregated statistics will 
the South African authorities be able to have a clearer picture of their foreign population 
and the needs of migrant workers for their economy, and be able to make plans accordingly.  
</p>
<p>50. The absence of data was particularly relevant when the Special Rapporteur was 
informed on several occasions that foreign workers, especially Zimbabweans, accept 
employment for lower wages and longer working hours, in conditions often in contradiction 
with labour laws, and that labour brokers and contractors tend to give preference to these 
groups to the detriment of nationals, who are already faced with high unemployment and 
the effects of the economic crisis. These allegations could not, however, be corroborated by 
clear and concise evidence owing to the absence of relevant data and statistics. The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates the need to document labour migration in the different sectors of the 
economy with data and statistics, so that the real situation can be identified and to ensure 
compliance with labour laws and standards. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur encourages measures at the regional level, such as within 
SADC, in order to measure statistics on the labour demand, which is the driving force 
behind economic migration, and to better regulate the supply of labour migrants with the 
needs of the region. This will help to identify current and projected labour supply shortages 
and surpluses by economic sector, occupation, region and province, and differentiate 
between labour shortages that are structural from those that are seasonal or otherwise 
temporary, which is crucial for the design and implementation of effective labour migration 
policies. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Arrest and detention of foreign nationals 
</b></p>
<p>52. The constitutional order includes administrative and judicial safeguards on 
detention. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to see that a new legal framework regarding 
the arrest and detention of immigrants was introduced after 1994. The new framework 
includes the Immigration Act of 2002, the Refugee Act of 1998 and, in the areas of border 
control, detention and arrest, the Defence Act of 2002. The Special Rapporteur noted that, 
although this legal framework exists de jure, it has yet to be fully implemented by the 
Department of Home Affairs, which oversees key issues relating to immigration. The 
Special Rapporteur found that both undocumented and documented foreigners fell outside 
the existing legal framework.11 As a result, detention remains the primary tool of 
immigration enforcement. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur regrets that shortcomings in the manner in which migrants 
are treated by the Department of Home Affairs remain. First of all, the Special Rapporteur 
believes that there are flaws in the Immigration Act with regard to what constitutes an 
&#8220;illegal foreigner&#8221;. As mentioned above, any immigration officer who has &#8220;reasonable 
grounds&#8221; to think that a migrant is in the country in contravention with the Act can detain a 
migrant. However, the &#8220;reasonable grounds&#8221; standard is not clearly defined, either in the 
actual framework or by jurisprudence. As the decision to detain is often left to the 
immigration officer&#8217;s own judgement based on what he deems &#8220;reasonable grounds&#8221;, many 
migrants who are picked up as &#8220;illegal foreigners&#8221; actually do possess papers entitling them 
to be in the country legally. A weak legal framework is unfavourable, because it can easily 
lead to differences in practice, as well as arbitrary and unlawful detentions. The Special 
Rapporteur would welcome a rewording of the Immigration Act so that it provides clearer 
standards and policies with regard to what qualifies as an &#8220;illegal foreigner&#8221; and on which 
grounds he or she can be detained.  
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur also noted certain practices of concern in the enforcement of 
the Immigration Act, as he was informed of cases where police officers and even members 
of the military assist with immigration enforcement. Any illegal immigrant arrested by 
military or police forces must be handed over to an immigration officer; those seeking 
asylum are transported to a designated refugee reception centre. Immigrants may be 
detained overnight until the offices of the Department of Home Affairs open (such as in the 
case of the Musina detention centre situated on the Zimbabwean border). Border control, 
arrest and detention are also governed by section 18 (1)(d) of the Defence Act, as South 
African law enables other law enforcement agencies, such as the police or the military, to 
be involved in immigration enforcement. The Immigration Act is clear, however, on the 
fact that only immigration officers are empowered to declare someone an &#8220;illegal 
foreigner&#8221; and to effect their deportation.  
</p>
<p>55. The Immigration Act allows &#8220;illegal foreigners&#8221; to be detained for a period up to a 
maximum period of 120 days. The Department of Home Affairs has, on numerous 
occasions, defended both the legality and the necessity of detention beyond this 120-day 
period. The Act, however, makes no provision for situations in which the detainee cannot 
be deported within 120 days. The Special Rapporteur was informed that these individuals 
fall into a legal limbo without governing framework or legal recourse, despite the fact that 
the Supreme Court of Appeal, in the case <i>Arse v Minister of Home Affairs and Others</i>, 
clearly stated that individuals being detained as illegal foreigners may not be held for more 
than 120 days (although this case did not apply to requests for asylum received after the 
individual concerned had already been detained in view of deportation).  
</p>
<p>  
 11 Lawyers for Human Rights,<i> &#8220;</i>Monitoring Immigration Detention in South Africa&#8221; (see footnote 4) . </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>56. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur noted inconsistencies in the application of 
frameworks regarding the right of migrants to apply for an asylum visa. Reportedly, many 
immigration officers tend to favour the procedures of the Immigration Act that only require 
a written warrant to extend detention, rather than the more protective procedures of the 
Refugee Act that only allows detention if the detainee&#8217;s permit has been revoked (under the 
Immigration Act). The Department of Home Affairs has defended the necessity to detain 
asylum-seekers, on various grounds: (a) asylum-seekers who allow their permits to expire 
become illegal foreigners; (b) when someone ceases to be an asylum-seeker following the 
initial rejection of his or her claim, regardless of any ongoing appeals; (c) an asylum-seeker 
permit merely allows an individual to &#8220;sojourn&#8221; in the country; nothing prevent this sojourn 
from taking place in detention; and (d) an asylum-seeker permit issued or renewed from 
detention does not entitle an individual to be released from detention. In the case of <i>Arse v 
Minister of Home Affairs and Others</i>, the Supreme Court of Appeal rejected all of these 
views and stated that an individual remained an asylum-seeker throughout the appeal and 
review process, and that the granting of a permit to an &#8220;illegal foreigner&#8221; rendered that 
person an asylum-seeker. The Department of Home Affairs therefore cannot detain an 
asylum-seeker regardless of where that person is in the application or appeal process. This 
view was later applied by the High Court to the case of <i>Amadi v Minister of Home Affairs</i> 
of 12 January 2010<i>. </i>The Special Rapporteur believes that the Department of Home Affairs 
should clarify this legal framework, in particular its enforcement and use, and clearly 
separate between the two different groups of migrants.  
</p>
<p>57. Apart from the weaknesses in the legal framework, the Special Rapporteur found 
that the biggest challenge was the absence of monitoring and oversight in existing 
procedures with regard to immigration, including detention. While the detention of other 
categories of detainees is supervised by the Judicial Inspectorate for Correctional Services 
under the control of the Inspecting Judge, persons detained under the Immigration Act do 
not benefit from such oversight. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur found the practice of outsourcing the management of the 
Lindela Immigration Detention Centre to a private corporation unusual. Although at the 
time of his visit the Centre seemed properly run and managed, concerns could be raised 
about the accessibility of persons detained and awaiting repatriation to be able to claim 
asylum or protection under the Refugee Act, especially if contact with Home Affairs 
officials is limited, given that interactions take place with the private company managing 
the facility.12 The Special Rapporteur also heard complaints about the lack of access to 
health care and to a culturally appropriate diet to detainees, and reminds the Government 
that, as mentioned in previous reports, detention of irregular migrants should only be used 
as a last resort, and that migrants should not be treated like criminals.  
</p>
<p>59. With regard to the Lindela Immigration Detention Centre, the Special Rapporteur 
recalls that that the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, in its report on its visit to South 
Africa in 2005, expressed concern at the situation of foreigners detained under immigration 
laws, as the procedure did not make it possible to effectively challenge the lawfulness of 
detention and places the burden on the person concerned to prove the right to remain in the 
country. Legal aid was not available for immigration matters, and the conditions of 
detention in the Centre did not meet international standards.13 Six years later, those 
concerns remain. The Special Rapporteur would therefore welcome more cooperation with 
civil society so as to allow monitoring visits to detention centres. Also, he calls upon the

</b></p>
<p>Government of South Africa to end all arbitrary and unlawful detention and to improve the 
conditions at detention facilities.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Access to health care 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur was informed that migrants often find it difficult to have 
access to adequate health-care services. The difficult material conditions in which migrants 
are generally forced to live, including overcrowding, poor nutrition, insufficient ventilation, 
lack of sanitation and little access to clean water, demand that adequate access to health-
care services be ensured, especially since such services are guaranteed to all by the 
Constitution and national laws. As a country of internal and cross-border migration inside a 
region of high population mobility and a high prevalence of communicable diseases, the 
Special Rapporteur believes that the Government should develop, implement and monitor a 
national response to migration and health.  
</p>
<p>61. Although the Special Rapporteur was pleased to note that the National Health Act 
and the Constitution guarantee access to life-saving care to everyone, regardless of a 
person&#8217;s immigration status, he also noted difficulties regarding the delivery of any health 
care that went beyond life-saving care. In South Africa, different categories of regional 
migrants are granted different rights to free public health-care services. According to 
national legislation, refugees and asylum-seekers should be treated as South African 
citizens in their access to free public health care,14 whereas other non-citizens, such as those 
with work or study permits, usually have to pay a &#8220;foreign fee&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur 
appreciates the efforts made to provide a legal framework to secure the right to health of 
migrants; nonetheless, different laws and guidelines seem to have led to confusion with 
regard to which framework should apply. For this reason, the Special Rapporteur calls upon 
the Government to take all feasible measures to transform guidelines and protective policies 
into effective practices.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur encourages South Africa to take the lead within the South 
African region, for example within SADC, to finalize, ratify and implement a regional 
framework for communicable diseases and population mobility. The implementation of the 
recommendations made in World Health Assembly resolution WHA61.17, on the health of 
migrants, is also important. In the resolution, the Assembly called upon Member States to, 
inter alia, promote migrant-sensitive health policies, establish an information system in 
order to assess and analyse trends in migrants&#8217; health, and promote equitable access to 
health promotion, disease prevention and care for migrants. The Special Rapporteur fully 
supports the resolution and would welcome the implementation of its recommendations by 
the Government of South Africa.  
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the many difficulties for migrants in their 
access to health-care services, even though the National Department of Health and its 
provincial counterparts have issued clear directives to ensure equal access of all to 
appropriate treatment. He is especially concerned about access to antiretroviral treatment 
for HIV-positive persons and those with AIDS. Although the national strategic plan for the 
period 2007-2011 on this issue specifically includes non-citizen groups, they are often met 
with xenophobic attitudes from health-care staff when they request access to treatment. 
Some have even reported being denied treatment simply because they were foreigners. In 
addition to xenophobic attitudes, the Special Rapporteur also noted severe practical 
challenges. Clinics are often distant from the areas where migrants usually reside. Those in 
</p>
<p>  
 14 Jo Vearey, &#8220;Migration and health delivery systems in Southern Africa&#8221;, <i>Openspace</i>, vol. 3, No. 3 
</p>
<p>(October 2010). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>detention at correctional facilities or awaiting deportation have complained about not being 
given the appropriate treatment. Another challenge is that translation is not provided, which 
sometimes makes it impossible for migrants to receive treatment. The Government should 
therefore fully implement its national strategic plan and ensure equality and non-
discrimination against marginalized groups, such as refugees, asylum-seekers and foreign 
migrants.  
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur heard testimonies in this regard when he visited the Lindela 
repatriation centre. He therefore urges the Government of South Africa to provide adequate 
health care and to comply and carry out national policies and guidelines, including for 
migrants in detention.  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur also heard complaints in relation to access to health care for 
migrant workers and their families. He was informed that emergency health care in public 
hospitals is guaranteed for all, regards of a person&#8217;s legal status. Reports showed, however, 
that practices differ according to the province, municipality or hospital involved. As 
mentioned above, full implementation of the right to health care, including national 
frameworks, policies and guidelines, as well as international instruments to ensure health 
care for all those in need, regardless of migratory status, is therefore needed.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Unaccompanied foreign children 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur was informed about the situation of unaccompanied migrant 
children. Statistical sources suggest that, in Musina, there are 600 unaccompanied children, 
and that, in Johannesburg, as at September 2009, at least 150 unaccompanied minors were 
staying at the Central Methodist church. Many of these minors were boys, and the majority 
came from neighbouring countries such as Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and 
Zimbabwe. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur was informed that children migrate to South Africa for 
various reasons, including the death of parents or a dying parent to care for. The desire to 
flee from war or lack of access to basic services, or to seek better opportunities for work or 
education were also common reasons.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government of South Africa to investigate 
into and to provide information on the situation of unaccompanied minors in the country. In 
his call, he underlines the vital importance of implement existing frameworks and policies 
regarding minors, as children left to them selves are extremely vulnerable and at a much 
higher risk of communicable diseases, psychosocial trauma, abuse and exploitation, 
including exploitative forms of labour and commercial sex work.  
</p>
<p>69. According to the South African Children&#8217;s Act (38/2005), unaccompanied minors 
may very well be &#8220;children in need of care and protection&#8221;; as such, they are eligible to the 
same level of protection as South African children. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to 
note that foreign children were protected under other South African laws as well. However, 
he regrets that this framework is yet to be fully implemented and urges the Government to 
strengthen measures and legislation against child labour. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur found that one of the biggest challenges facing minors was 
the lack of education. He was informed that some children who migrate to South Africa had 
not attended school for a long time and therefore had great difficulty in adjusting and 
attending school. Another reason for not attending school was that children had to work to 
support themselves or other family members. The Special Rapporteur underlines the 
obligation undertaken by South Africa to guarantee the right to education for everyone in 
both national and international instruments. Furthermore, he encourages the Government to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>improve the situation of unaccompanied minors residing in the country, and provide them 
with the rights to which they are entitled. </p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern about the lack of information on the 
situation of unaccompanied children. To date, there are no exact figures on, for example, 
how many minors actually live in the country, where they reside or what their main 
challenges are. The Special Rapporteur therefore encourages the Government of South 
Africa to provide accurate data regarding the situation of children as well as on the 
measures taken to ensure their rights. Another concern relating to the lack of information is 
the fact that many children enter South Africa without documents, which makes it even 
more difficult for them to receive adequate help in health care, schooling and living 
conditions.  The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to provide information on how 
many minors are undocumented and to facilitate providing them with legal documents.  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of South Africa about the principle 
of non-deportation of unaccompanied children, underlined on many previous occasions, 
and about the particularly vulnerable situation of children, who often have nothing to return 
to in their country of origin. Furthermore, children should be repatriated only if it is in their 
best interest, namely, for the purpose of family reunification and after due process of law. 
Finally, the Special Rapporteur recalls that, in previous reports,15 he called for the need to 
protect children in the context of migration, and especially migrant children moving across 
borders, with practical recommendations for consideration and action by States and other 
stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of South Africa for its 
invitation and for facilitating the visit, which allowed him to conduct meetings with all 
the authorities requested, civil society and the United Nations country team, as well as 
to conduct interviews with migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. Despite the efforts 
made to protect migrants, including by providing assistance to migrants and their 
families, and recognizing that South Africa has taken measures to protect migrants, 
such as the process of regularizing Zimbabwean migrants, addressing the xenophobic 
attacks against migrants in townships and striving to alleviate the impact of the recent 
economic crisis, the Special Rapporteur noted that a number of challenges still need to 
be addressed, in particular the absence of a clear and comprehensive immigration 
policy, the lack of data and statistics, the question of detention of foreign nationals, 
access to health-care services and the situation of unaccompanied foreign children. In 
this context, the Special Rapporteur makes the recommendations below. 
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> With regard to the legislative, institutional and policy framework, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that the Government of South Africa ratify:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (as soon as the legal implications of 
such ratification have been addressed);  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</b>  
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>75.<b> South Africa should proceed with the adoption and implementation of a 
comprehensive immigration policy at the national level, guided by international 
human rights law and standards. Such a policy would encompass: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The recognition of migrants as part of South African society, providing a 
vision on how to integrate them into the society and how to guarantee the effective 
protection of their rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The establishment of long-term measures designed to create the 
conditions necessary for this integration to become a reality; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The promotion of public mass-media campaigns and educational 
programmes, which would, in particular, focus on positive values that migrants bring 
to the host society in economic, social and cultural terms. In this context, the 
Government should give a voice to migrants to express their views and their 
experience.  
</b></p>
<p><b>The development of such a comprehensive immigration policy at the national level 
should also encompass a policy framework for social cohesion and the integration of 
all migrants. 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government, in cooperation with 
relevant international organizations and United Nations agencies, to improve data 
collection and statistical analysis in relation to aspects of immigration and out-
migration. Only with a thorough collection of data and clear statistics about migration 
in the labour market will the South African authorities be able to have a clearer 
picture of their foreign population and the needs of migrant workers for their 
economy, and be able to plan accordingly for them.  
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to introduce as soon as 
possible the hate crime bill, which is currently being finalized by the Department of 
Justice and Constitutional Development, given the fact that general provisions 
included in the Constitution and the Criminal Code are not effective enough in 
protecting migrants from discrimination based on nationality. Migrant communities 
should be consulted and encouraged to participate in the process of elaboration of this 
law. The law should, in particular: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Make any act of violence against individuals or property on the basis of a 
person's race, nationality, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity 
(&#8220;hate crime&#8221;) an aggravating circumstance; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Provide effective resources and training for police, justice and other 
relevant officials to ensure the successful implementation of the provisions of the law, 
including training on detecting, recording and prosecuting hate crimes, as well as 
monitoring any trends in them. 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> In addition to specific legislation, additional measures should be taken, such as: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Strengthening the response of police and justice authorities to ensure 
that perpetrators of hate crimes and police profiling of foreign nationals are held 
accountable;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The development of measures to monitor cases of hate crimes against 
foreign nationals by using police and justice statistics as a means of monitoring trends 
of such crimes and the response of police and justice authorities to these cases (with 
statistics on, inter alia, the number of arrests, the number of offenders prosecuted and 
the number convicted);  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The establishment of a visible and accessible mechanism whereby 
members of the public can report cases of violence against foreign nationals as a 
means of providing more effective police responses to mob violence against foreign 
nationals;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The establishment of a permanent body in the office of the Presidency to 
ensure effective coordination of different Government department programmes on 
social cohesion, addressing xenophobia, police profiling and tackling hate crimes. 
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> With regard to the arrest and detention of foreign nationals, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that the Government, in particular the Department of Home 
Affairs, revise the Immigration Act in order to provide clearer standards and policies 
with regard to what qualifies as an &#8220;illegal foreigner&#8221; and on which grounds he or she 
can be detained.  
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The Special Rapporteur also reiterates the call made by the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention concerning persons detained under immigration legislation, and 
urges the Government to take the appropriate measures to allow detained illegal 
foreigners to challenge their detention and thus exercise all the rights guaranteed by 
the Constitution. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends in particular that foreigners detained 
under the Immigration Act in the custody of the Department of Home Affairs also 
benefit from the oversight of the Judicial Inspectorate for Correctional Services under 
the control of the Inspecting Judge and have access to the same complaint 
mechanisms as of detainees serving sentences or awaiting trial. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> The Special Rapporteur commends the Government of South Africa for the 
regularization exercise for Zimbabweans living in the country (Special Dispensation 
Permits), which allowed many to apply for a legal residence permit. This measure 
represents a positive shift towards a rational, coherent and regionally beneficial 
migration management approach, and should be extended on a regional basis with 
other SADC Member States.  
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to define a clearer appeal 
procedure and inform rejected applicants of this possibility. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> Regarding access to health services, the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
the Government carry out and comply with the existing national framework as well as 
with policies and national guidelines, regardless of a person&#8217;s legal status in the 
country. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> In addition, the Special Rapporteur calls upon the  
Government to implement fully the recommendations made in World Health 
Assembly resolution WHA61.17, as well as to ensure equal practices and access for 
everyone to health services and treatment, regardless of a person&#8217;s legal status or 
location. 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> The Special Rapporteur highlights the importance of an adequate legal 
framework for the protection of the rights of all children in the context of migration 
and the need to mainstream a child rights-based approach into migration 
programmes and policies. He encourages better collection of data at the national level 
and more thorough research on unaccompanied or separated children. He also recalls 
general comment No. 6 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child on the treatment 
of unaccompanied and separated children, in which the Committee provided useful 
guidance on the protection of the rights of unaccompanied migrant children.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.4

</p>
<p>87.<b> The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that migrant children, 
especially those that are unaccompanied, are most exposed to the worst forms of child 
labour and, in this context, recalls the relevance of the International Labour 
Organization Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the 
Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, 1999 (No. 182) and relevant 
Recommendation No. 190, and their implementation framework. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> Finally, the Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of South Africa, in 
its implementation of programmes, to provide unaccompanied migrant children with 
comprehensive support and protection, including means to identify those who are 
vulnerable and in need of international protection. Protection services should include 
access to food, health care and legal advice; support for return to the community of 
origin; professional and vocational training; and the pursuit of durable solutions in 
the case of refugee children. These programmes should also include reproductive 
sexual health awareness and training to address psychological trauma.
