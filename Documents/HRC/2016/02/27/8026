<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 13 September 2012, at its twenty-first session, the Human Rights Council, 
pursuant to Council decision 18/118, held a panel discussion on the issue of intimidation or 
reprisal against individuals and groups who cooperate or have cooperated with the United 
Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights. In decision 
18/118, the Council also requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) to liaise with relevant special procedures, States and other 
stakeholders, including relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, with a view to 
ensuring their participation in the panel discussion. The Office was also requested to 
prepare the present summary. 
</p>
<p>2. The panel discussion provided a multi-stakeholder perspective on the issue of 
reprisals and intimidation, illustrating how various bodies and mechanisms witnessed 
reprisals and responses to such acts. Through an exchange of views and experience, the 
panel aimed to (a) draw the attention of the international community to the issue of alleged 
reprisals and intimidation against persons who seek to cooperate or have cooperated with 
the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights; (b) 
share experiences and perspectives on ways to address this disturbing practice and assess 
responses to it; (c) contribute to the development of a consolidated and coherent approach 
by the Human Rights Council and the United Nations in general by discussing concrete 
steps that States, the United Nations, the Council and its mechanisms could take to 
strengthen the response to reprisals, in both preventing reprisals and responding 
appropriately to cases that have already occurred. 
</p>
<p>3. The meeting was chaired by the Vice-President of the Human Rights Council, 
Ambassador Andras Dekany, the Permanent Representative of Hungary. The panel 
discussion was moderated by the Chair of the Board of the International Service for Human 
Rights, Mehr Khan Williams, and opened by the Secretary-General, and the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights. The panellists were Deputy State Secretary for 
Global Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Szabolcs Tak&#225;cs; the 
Chairperson of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures, Michel Forst; the 
Chairperson of the Committee against Torture, Claudio Grossman; and Hassan Shire 
Sheikh Ahmed, Executive Director of the East and Horn of Africa Human Rights 
Defenders Project. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Statements by the Secretary-General, the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights and the President of 
the Human Rights Council, and contributions of panellists 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Secretary-General  
</b></p>
<p>4. The Secretary-General, in his opening remarks delivered via video message, defined 
reprisals as one of the challenges faced by the Human Rights Council and the United 
Nations as a whole. He reminded the Council that the Secretaries-General of the 
Organization had reported regularly on alleged reprisals against those who cooperate with 
the United Nations in the field of human rights. He highlighted various forms of reprisals, 
underlining that they were only the &#8220;tip of the iceberg&#8221; given that, understandably, far too 
many people are scared to report reprisals aimed at silencing them. </p>


<p>5. The Secretary-General stressed the fact that States had a responsibility to respect 
human rights and protect those who advocate for fundamental rights; when they failed to do 
so, the United Nations had to stand up and speak out.  
</p>
<p>6. Recalling the action that he called for in his report, the Secretary-General welcomed 
the initiatives taken by various bodies and mechanisms to respond to reprisals, and praised 
the active role played by the President of the Human Rights Council in this regard. He 
expressed the hope that the panel would act as a catalyst for robust and coordinated action 
throughout the United Nations system to systematically condemn and respond to 
persecution and intimidation. 
</p>
<p><b> B. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>7. The High Commissioner stressed the fact that reprisals should not take place, as the 
United Nations could not work without the cooperation of the people it was supposed to 
serve. As demonstrated by the leadership of the Secretary-General, the whole of the United 
Nations takes reported incidents of reprisals very seriously. 
</p>
<p>8. The High Commissioner emphasized that the cooperation of individuals and groups 
with the United Nations in the field of human rights in a free and safe manner was key to 
ensuring an efficient and results-oriented approach to the promotion and protection of 
human rights. Several key documents called for and praised this cooperation; for example, 
the 2005 World Summit Outcome1 reaffirmed the importance of civil society in the work of 
the United Nations. She illustrated how cooperation with civil society was crucial for 
human rights bodies and mechanisms &#8211; OHCHR, the Human Rights Council, the special 
procedures, the universal periodic review, the commissions of inquiry, the treaty bodies &#8211; 
and in accordance with their respective mandates.  
</p>
<p>9. Despite the unequivocal recognition of the need and also the right of civil society to 
participate, reprisals and intimidations continue to be reported. The High Commissioner 
noted that reprisals could take many forms; people could be threatened or harassed by 
Government officials, including through public statements by high-level authorities. 
Associations and non-governmental organizations might see their activities monitored or 
restricted. Smear campaigns against those who cooperated with the United Nations might 
be organized. Threats could be made via phone calls, text messages or even direct contacts. 
People could also be arrested, beaten or tortured, or even killed. 
</p>
<p>10. Referring to the report of the Secretary-General in which he deeply regretted the 
lack of accountability for the majority of reported cases of reprisals,2 the High 
Commissioner regretted that responses by States had been far from sufficient. She added 
that the Human Rights Council should do more, and highlighted the need for more coherent 
and solid strategies to put an end to reprisals. Such strategies should draw on all available 
sources and actors. She concluded that reprisals were not only unacceptable; they were also 
ineffective, because, ultimately, freedom would always prevail and information would 
always find its way to the outside world.  
</p>
<p><b> C. President of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Vice-President of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador Andras Dekany, who 
chaired the meeting, delivered a message on behalf of the President of the Council. In her 
</p>
<p>  
 1 General Assembly resolution 60/1. 
 2 A/HRC/21/18, para. 72. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/34/ 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>capacity as President, her task was to ensure that the Council proceeds with the appropriate 
level of dignity and respect in its work to promote and protect human right. This implied 
that Members of the Council and all observers, including non-governmental organizations, 
had to be able to contribute freely to the Council&#8217;s work. Unfortunately, incidents of 
</p>
<p>harassment of civil society representatives had been brought to the attention of the 
President and to which she had to react, including through public statements, meetings and 
exchange of letters with the delegations concerned. Such actions were consistent with the 
outcome of the review of the Council3 and necessary to preserve its credibility.  
</p>
<p>12. The President emphasized that the fact that the Human Rights Council as a whole 
tackled this issue now more concretely through the present panel and reacted to 
unacceptable acts of reprisals or intimidation was an achievement in itself. The Council 
should remain a place where all voices, even dissenting ones, may be heard, and it had the 
responsibility to ensure that all individuals participating in its meetings and cooperating 
with it remained secure. The President recalled that the Council had called upon all States 
to desist from intimidation or reprisals directed at individuals or organizations participating 
in Council sessions, and expressed the hope that dialogue would constitute the preferred 
tool to address problems when divergent views arose.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Chair of the Board of the International Service for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Chairperson of the Board of the International Service for Human Rights, Mehr 
Khan Williams, moderated the panel. In her introductory remarks, she thanked the Human 
Rights Council for convening such an important discussion. She also thanked Member 
States who had played a key role in pushing for action against reprisals. She emphasized 
the fact that increasing cross-regional awareness and concern about reprisals was very 
encouraging, and that civil society organizations were particularly grateful for the personal 
attention paid to the issue by the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner. 
</p>
<p>14. Ms. Williams identified three issues at stake. First and foremost, the safety of those 
that cooperate, or seek to cooperate, with the United Nations human rights system had to be 
confident that the United Nations and concerned States would do all they could to afford 
swift protection to them when they engaged with the United Nations. Second, Member 
States had the greatest responsibility to ensure the protection of human rights defenders; 
States who committed or tolerated such acts showed contempt for the work of the 
Organization, and could be in breach of their obligations under the Charter of the United 
Nations. Third, the United Nations had a special ethical responsibility to ensure adequate 
protection to those who engaged with its representatives; when people were afraid to speak 
up because of fear of reprisal, the work of the United Nations was undermined.  
</p>
<p>15. Ms. Williams underlined the encouraging efforts made by the Human Rights 
Council to address reprisals, in particular the preventive measures taken by the President by 
drawing States' attention to situations that might constitute a threat to individuals 
cooperating with the Council and its mechanisms. The proactive role of the President 
should be standard protection practice for future Presidents.  
</p>
<p>16. Nonetheless, Ms. Williams regretted the fact that some States continued to use 
reprisals to silence the voice of non-governmental organizations, another form of which 
being to exclude them from cooperating with the United Nations because the NGO 
Committee of the Economic and Social Council delayed or applied criteria selectively for 
assessing and renewing applications submitted by non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>  
 3 A/HRC/RES/16/21, para.30 </p>


<p>According to the Secretary-General, criteria for consultative status must be applied in a 
&#8220;transparent and fair manner&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>17. The moderator expressed the hope that the panel would identify the distinct yet 
complementary roles of different actors in the system &#8211; the United Nations, States, the 
Human Rights Council and its President, the special procedures, the treaty bodies, national 
human rights institutions and civil society itself &#8211; and formulate clear expectations in 
relation to each of them. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Deputy State Secretary for Global Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign 
</b></p>
<p><b>Affairs of Hungary 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Deputy State Secretary for Global Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
Hungary, Szabolcs Tak&#225;cs, observed that the present discussion was timely, since the 
number of cases of reprisal or intimidation against individuals and groups cooperating with 
the United Nations seemed to be on the rise. Hungary had always taken a strong stand 
against threats and reprisals against those who cooperated with the United Nations. In the 
past 22 years, Hungary had sponsored or initiated resolutions and decisions adopted by the 
Human Rights Council4, and previously by the Commission of Human Rights, on this issue. 
He highlighted in particular Council decision 18/118, in which it strongly rejected any act 
of intimidation and reprisal in line with the outcome of the review of the Council. The main 
thrust of the decision was to provide the Council with an opportunity under agenda item 5 
to address a sensitive yet crucially important issue, decided to convene the present panel 
discussion. 
</p>
<p>19. Mr. Tak&#225;cs welcomed the firm engagement of the Secretary-General, the High 
Commissioner and the President of the Human Rights Council, and added that the 
credibility and everyday functioning of the entire United Nations system was at stake. In 
that context, he referred to cases of intimidation and reprisal for cooperating with the 
Secretary-General, the Security Council, United Nations peacekeeping missions, OHCHR, 
the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations, the Human Rights Council, 
the Commission on the Status of Women, the special procedures, the treaty bodies and the 
universal periodic review mechanism, as contained in the most recent report of the 
Secretary-General5.  
</p>
<p>20. Mr. Tak&#225;cs stressed that it was now up to Member States to address the above-
mentioned phenomenon by addressing impunity and ensuring accountability. In conclusion, 
Mr. Tak&#225;cs expressed the hope that the panel discussion would highlight the importance of 
the issue at hand and provide innovative and future-oriented solutions with the aim of 
stopping and preventing acts of intimidation or reprisal as a consequence of cooperation 
with the United Nations in the field of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Chairperson of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Chairperson of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures, Michel 
Forst, underscored the fact that acts of intimidation and reprisal were constant subjects of 
concern and discussion for the special procedures. It had been discussed in depth at the 
most recent annual meeting of special procedures, including during meetings with the 
President of the Human Rights Council, States, non-governmental organizations and 
</p>
<p>  
 4 See in particular resolution A/HRC/RES/12/2. 
 5 A/HRC/21/18. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/34/ 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>national human rights institutions. In that context, he recalled the deep emotion and 
indignation among mandate holders when certain cases were discussed. These cases were 
known and had been reported on in the reports of special procedures mandate holders, the 
report of the Secretary-General and communications from non-governmental organizations. 
Special procedures mandate holders noted that it was primarily the responsibility of States 
to respond to allegations of threats and to take steps to protect witnesses. On too many 
cases, the impression was that the States concerned did not take any real action. The 
decisive role of national human rights institutions, including in the physical protection of 
witnesses, was recalled. With the President of the Council, the idea of having an annual 
dedicated session of the Council on the issue of reprisals was discussed. Mr. Forst 
expressed the hope that such an idea would be supported during the panel discussion.  
</p>
<p>22. Mr. Forst shared some of the existing measures developed by special procedures, 
individually and jointly, to address reprisals. Some of them had devoted an annual report to 
this issue. Others had decided to systematically include information on reprisals in their 
reports. Others still collected information and reacted appropriately to individual cases. Mr. 
Forst also informed participants that, in the light of the greater number and severity of cases 
documented, special procedures were currently considering various measures; for example, 
the manual of operations of the special procedures could be revised to include a specific 
chapter on the question of reprisals as well as practical recommendations addressed to all 
mandate holders. The training of new mandate holders on this matter should also continue.  
</p>
<p>23. With regard to recommendations, Mr. Forst shared some personal ideas for further 
discussion. In his views, any reprisal against a witness cooperating with a mandate holder 
should be treated as an attempt to undermine the mandate holder himself or herself, and 
consequently called for a rapid and systematic response from States Members of the Human 
Rights Council. Furthermore, the Chairperson of the Coordination Committee should be 
able to intervene immediately and publicly in cases of intimidation or reprisal brought to 
his or her attention by a mandate holder. Benefits could be gained from sharing the 
experience of other institutions that have developed expertise or programmes to protect 
witnesses, in particular the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>24. Given that reprisals were often reported during country visits, Mr. Forst presented 
several ideas to be considered in that context, such as treating information relating to the 
agenda of the visit and the list of civil society contacts with the appropriate confidentiality 
in order to minimize the risk of reprisal, or sharing meeting plans with local human rights 
experts to assess beforehand the risk of witnesses being targeted. When facing allegations 
of reprisal, States concerned should be reminded of their obligations with regard to 
protection. The information could also be shared with the United Nations field presence, 
national human rights institution and diplomatic missions as appropriate; when possible, 
regional intergovernmental organizations could also be involved. 
</p>
<p>25. Mr. Forst also called for more systematic follow-up on cases raised in the 
communications and reports of special procedures, including through contact with the 
relevant missions. He concluded by proposing that a cross-regional group of States could 
decide to work together and act in the face of reprisals. They could take joint initiatives for 
witness protection by means of, inter alia, concrete asylum measures, temporary shelter or 
shelter in diplomatic missions. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Chairperson of the Committee against Torture 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Chairperson of the Committee against Torture, Claudio Grossman, stated that 
the legitimate ambition that all had was not only to refrain from being silent with regard to 
reprisals, but to be far more ambitious and far-reaching in our aims, and create a positive 
environment to ensure that human rights policies were developed. The first step was to </p>


<p>combat reprisals, but the overall aim was to ensure that anybody who wished to participate 
and to express ideas for a better world based on human rights would be free to do so. In this 
context, Mr. Grossman recalled that human rights involved actively promoting 
participation.  
</p>
<p>27. With regard to reprisals in the experience of the Committee against Torture and 
other treaty bodies, the forms observed included death threats, kidnapping, abduction, 
inhuman and degrading treatment and arbitrary detention. All of these manifestations 
attacked the idea of the inviolability of individuals. Mr. Grossman also mentioned what he 
described as more sophisticated methods used against those who tried to cooperate with the 
United Nations, such as criminal investigation inquiries, harassment, defamation, slander 
and the misuse of national laws with the aim of preventing human rights defenders from 
making their contribution to society. He also made reference to legislation that limits the 
possibility of registering as an organization with the purpose of achieving human rights 
objectives, or the decision to arbitrarily remove authorization for such registration. 
Restrictions also related to the transfer of funds. As stated in the Committee&#8217;s most recent 
</p>
<p>annual report, this was very much part and parcel of the culture of impunity, as there was 
often no accountability. Mr. Grossman also highlighted the gender dimension of the issue, 
and referred to situations where communities did not accept the active involvement of 
women in promoting human rights. He also raised the particular situation of attacks against 
journalists as a way to undermine freedom of expression and to intimidate people who wish 
to uphold human rights.  
</p>
<p>28. Mr. Grossman explained some of the techniques used by treaty bodies to address 
reprisals. These included country reports, concluding observations containing specific 
recommendations, confidential visits, individual communications, general comments and 
follow-up activities. The prevention of and responses to reprisals were also discussed in the 
context of the treaty body strengthening process. 
</p>
<p>29. With regard to recommendations, Mr. Grossman encouraged States to establish focal 
points at the national level to deal with reprisal-related issues. He added that it was 
important to ensure the clear criminalization of exacerbating circumstances when human 
rights defenders were the subject of criminal activity. Criticizing public authorities should 
also be decriminalized. Mr. Grossman also suggested that a study be carried out on good 
practices in addressing reprisals (such as legislation, registration, training or cooperation 
with civil society). This could take the form of a clearing house mechanism to receive and 
distribute information on good practices. Mr. Grossman concluded by emphasizing that it 
was important not only to prevent reprisals, but also to create an environment in which 
everybody was able to enjoy and uphold human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Executive Director of the East and Horn of Africa Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Defenders Project 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Executive Director of the East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders 
Project, Hassan Shire Sheikh Ahmed, welcomed the convening of the panel, which was 
particularly timely. Since its establishment in 2005, the Human Rights Defenders Project 
had assisted hundreds of human rights defenders at risk, some of whom had faced 
intimidation or reprisals as a direct result of their cooperation with the United Nations. 
Reprisals had long-standing consequences for the individuals affected, most tragically in 
the case of assassinations; others had been forced to flee their countries for their own 
safety. As the secretariat to a network of human rights organizations, the Human Rights 
Defenders Project facilitated the attendance and participation of human rights defenders in 
the work of the Human Rights Council.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/34/ 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>31. Mr. Shire Sheikh Ahmed emphasized that primary responsibility for responding to 
acts of intimidations and reprisals lay with the State, which should conduct investigations, 
persecute perpetrators and offer remedies to victims. However, this obligation had rarely 
been fulfilled. Therefore practical responses to assist victims had been developed within 
civil society, drawing largely on the work of existing organizations and networks that 
supported human rights defenders who faced threats as a result of their work, such as 
temporary evacuation and relocation, trial observation, legal assistance, practical security 
measures as well as public and private advocacy to raise awareness of violations or to seek 
solutions through private dialogue. These were equally relevant in cases of reprisal 
specifically related to cooperation with the United Nations. These responses were, however, 
limited when States were unwilling or unable to intervene positively. In this context he 
pointed out the contribution of networks in responding to and preventing reprisals. 
</p>
<p>32. With regard to recommendations, Mr. Shire Sheikh Ahmed highlighted two main 
areas for concrete action; in sustained follow-up on cases, and in the promotion of greater 
coordination and cooperation for both the prevention and responses to cases of intimidation 
and reprisal. Regarding follow-up, the issue should be discussed on a regular and timely 
basis by the Human Rights Council. The report of the Secretary-General on reprisals should 
be presented in an annual dedicated discussion during a Council session. This would give 
States concerned the opportunity to give feedback on the steps that they have taken to 
investigate and take appropriate action in response to allegations. Furthermore it was 
important that cases were not allowed to drop off the agenda simply because there has been 
no response to communications or other follow-up by the States concerned. Reference 
should therefore continue to be made in the report of the Secretary-General each year to any 
allegations that remain unresolved. If there were no substantive updates to be made on 
cases, they could be listed in an annex. In addition, an accurate and accessible record of the 
status of cases could be established through a central database or online registry managed 
by OHCHR, which would log communications sent, responses received or other follow-up 
actions. Lastly States concerned should be encouraged to provide information to the Human 
Rights Council on the status of investigations or prosecutions of allegations contained in 
the report of the Secretary- General. 
</p>
<p>33. With regard to the promotion of coordination and cooperation between different 
protection stakeholders, a number of bodies had made commitments to support human 
rights defenders, and there was a possibility for greater coordination to maximize individual 
actors&#8217; protection effects. The European Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders 
offered possibilities for further engagement for the protection of individuals and 
organizations that have faced reprisals for their cooperation with the United Nations human 
rights system. Furthermore European Union delegations and missions of Member States in 
third countries had a range of tools at their disposal to intervene in support of affected 
individuals, including in their dialogues with States. These should be further explored and 
used. Lastly greater coordination between those stakeholders who could provide practical 
and emergency assistance to those who have been the targets of reprisals would enable a 
more holistic response. This could include, inter alia, non-governmental organizations, 
OHCHR and its field presences, and third-country shelter houses. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Summary of the discussion 
</b></p>
<p>34. Those participating in the discussion represented Argentina, Australia, Austria, 
Bahrain, Belarus, Chile, China, Cuba, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, France, 
Honduras, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Morocco, Norway, Paraguay, Poland, Qatar, the Republic 
of Korea, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, </p>


<p>Switzerland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States 
of America, Uruguay and the European Union. 
</p>
<p>35. Also participating in the dialogue were the national human rights institution of 
Ecuador (Defensor del Pueblo de Ecuador) via a video message, and non-governmental 
organizations, namely, the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues in a joint 
statement, Amnesty International, the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, Lawyers&#8217; 
</p>
<p>Rights Watch Canada and Civicus &#8211; World Alliance for Citizen Participation.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Issues raised by stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>36. Most delegations thanked OHCHR and Hungary, as the main sponsor of Human 
Rights Council decision 18/118, for convening the panel discussion. The delegations also 
thanked the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for their firm stance on 
reprisals. They also praised the role played by the President of the Council.  
</p>
<p>37. All participants strongly condemned all acts of reprisal and intimidation for 
cooperating with the United Nations in the field of human rights, stressing that such acts 
should be prohibited and prevented. They affirmed that the issue should be a priority for the 
Human Rights Council and deserved its full and continuous attention. Some participants 
specifically referred to cases included in the report of the Secretary-General6 or provided 
testimonies on alleged cases of reprisals. Several States stressed the crucial importance of 
cooperating with civil society and that nobody should be harassed or intimidated for using 
his or her right to engage with the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>38. Delegations emphasized that there was a need to strengthen the response to reprisals, 
both in terms of prevention and in responding appropriately to cases that have already 
occurred. Several recommendations were made in this regard. 
</p>
<p>39. Focusing on measures to be taken at the national level, many participants stressed 
that the primary responsibility to protect those cooperating with the United Nations lay with 
States, which should guarantee the security of persons who decide to cooperate with the 
international human rights system. States should take the measures necessary to create 
social, economic, political and other conditions, as well as legal guarantees required for all 
persons under its jurisdiction to enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms and for 
intimidation and reprisals not to happen. All States should condemn reprisals 
unambiguously and act resolutely to prevent, address and end them. 
</p>
<p>40. Several participants insisted that there should be no impunity for such acts. States 
concerned should investigate without delay and in an impartial manner any alleged act of 
intimidation or reprisal and report back to the Human Rights Council. All perpetrators 
should be brought to justice. States should provide victims with appropriate remedies. 
Likewise, reprisals committed by non-State actors should also be investigated and the 
perpetrators should be held accountable first and foremost by the Government concerned. 
</p>
<p>41. Some States referred to various measures taken to protect human rights defenders, 
such as national protection programmes or the European Union Guidelines on Human 
Rights Defenders. 
</p>
<p>42. Some States referred to international human rights instruments, in particular the 
provisions relating to reprisals, and called on States to implement them. Similarly, the 
universal ratification and implementation of international human rights instruments should 
be promoted. 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/34/

<p>43. Several speakers stated that the international community had the responsibility to 
address the issue of intimidation and reprisals in a swift and effective manner. In this 
context, the need for a combined response from the State at the national level, but also from 
the international community and the mechanisms it has created, was raised. The 
international community must also ensure that effective measures were in place to protect 
victims when the State failed or was unable to do so. In that connection, the need for the 
international community to conceive means of protection in the event that the State did not 
have the capacity to fulfil its function of protection of civil society was pointed out. 
</p>
<p>44. According to several States, the approach of the international community to acts of 
reprisal should be coherent and systematic. Such acts should be condemned publicly every 
time they occur, including by using means of communications. It was also proposed that the 
international community should use all tools at its disposal, from early warning measures 
and preventive action in accordance with the State&#8217;s responsibility to protect, through to all 
</p>
<p>tools available from the United Nations human rights system. 
</p>
<p>45. Participants also made recommendations for representatives and mechanisms of the 
United Nations, in particular human rights bodies. Although enhanced coordination among 
human rights mechanisms was welcome, more concerted effort and coordinated action of 
the United Nations bodies and mechanisms were needed. According to some delegations, 
concentrated pressure from the entire international community could contribute to the 
elimination of such cases, which should not be only condemned in speeches, but also 
systematically addressed within the framework of the universal periodic review, treaty 
bodies or special procedures in the course of their communications with States. 
</p>
<p>46. According to several delegations, more should be done to ensure that the United 
Nations addressed cases of reprisal in a unified and coordinated manner. In this context, the 
appointment of a mediator or ombudsman by the Secretary-General or the High 
Commissioner was proposed. The mediator would act as a focal point of the United Nations 
system and will be seized of all allegations of intimidation and reprisals. He or she would 
follow all allegations of reprisals, in close cooperation with the human rights mechanisms, 
by contacting the relevant Governments. The mediator would follow the case until its 
satisfactory outcome, and should also propose and coordinate technical assistance to help 
States to establish national programmes for witnesses and victims that denounce reprisals. 
</p>
<p>47. It was also suggested to explore the question of whether acts of intimidation or 
reprisal carried out or tolerated by a Government against individuals and groups 
cooperating with the United Nations in the field of human rights constituted breaches of the 
State&#8217;s legal obligations as a Member of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>48. Many delegations underlined the specific role that the Human Rights Council should 
play. In that connection, several recommendations were made. According to several 
delegations, the condemnation of reprisals in the outcome of the review of the Human 
Rights Council had opened a new chapter, as the Council was united in its clear 
condemnation of such acts. Participants emphasized that the Council should take its 
responsibility to ensure that all those willing to cooperate with it and its mechanisms could 
do so without fear of reprisal. Delegations stated that it was a question of credibility and a 
matter of ethics. The Council should ensure that it had effective mechanisms to react to and 
follow up on any case of reprisal. 
</p>
<p>49. Referring to the central role of the Human Rights Council in ensuring accountability 
for reprisals and intimidation, some delegations noted that the Council had this role both 
with regard to the individuals and groups concerned, but also to the institutional integrity of 
the Council and of the United Nations. In this connection, all credible allegations of 
intimidation or reprisal for engaging with the United Nations human rights machinery must 
be brought to the urgent attention of the Council. </p>


<p>50. Some participants more specifically pointed out that the Human Rights Council 
should also carefully guarantee the implementation of existing norms with regard to 
defenders, in particular the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, 
Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 
</p>
<p>51. In the view of many speakers, whenever a credible allegation was made, the Human 
Rights Council must demand that States ensure prompt, impartial, transparent and effective 
investigation of any alleged reprisal and that perpetrators are held to account. Any 
Government concerned must report to the Council in plenary session on measures taken to 
investigate, the outcome of investigations and any prosecution and provision of reparation 
to victims, in line accordance with Council resolution 12/2. 
</p>
<p>52. The Human Rights Council should also support efforts by United Nations bodies, 
including its own mechanisms, to prevent and address instances of reprisal or intimidation, 
in accordance with Council resolution 12/2. 
</p>
<p>53. Many delegations stressed that the issue of intimidation and reprisals should be 
discussed on a regular and timely basis by the Human Rights Council. The report of the 
Secretary-General on reprisals should be presented in an annual dedicated discussion by the 
Council. This would give States concerned the opportunity to provide feedback on the steps 
that they have taken to investigate and take appropriate action in response to allegations. In 
that context, the Council should explore the possibility of using the general debate under 
item 5 to address cases of reprisal.  
</p>
<p>54. It was also proposed that, when a State was responsible for committing a pattern of 
intimidation and reprisals, reconsideration of the State&#8217;s membership in the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council should be automatically triggered, and that such information should inform future 
elections for Council membership. 
</p>
<p>55. Many delegations praised the firm stance taken by the President of the Human 
Rights Council. In that connection, it was stressed that all future Presidents should speak 
against reprisals at every Council session, and in particular at the sessions of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review, on the basis of the examples set by the last two 
Council Presidents. 
</p>
<p>56. Many participants in their interventions addressed the particular role of the 
Secretary-General and the High Commissioner. Their firm stance and engagement against 
reprisals was fully supported and seen as an important contribution to creating awareness of 
the extent of the problem, in particular by means of annual reports on this issue. In this 
connection, speakers underlined the fact that States should look carefully at the report of the 
Secretary-General and follow up on the allegations it contained. 
</p>
<p>57. The report of the Secretary-General was praised as an important tool in the 
prevention of and fight against reprisals. Some delegations welcomed in particular the 
inclusion of a section focused on the follow-up to previous cases. Delegations emphasized 
that the report should receive appropriate attention and follow-up from States and the 
Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>58. Some delegations noted that facts relating to acts of reprisal and intimidation should 
be established on the basis of objective and reliable information from credible sources that 
were duly cross-checked to the greatest extent possible. In this connection, States 
concerned should be consulted when an allegation of reprisal was made. It should be 
ensured that information from all sides was gathered and analysed, thereby avoiding a 
unilateral approach. Sources of information should be varied, and not only based on media 
reports. Some other States raised concern at some of the information contained in the report 
of the Secretary-General, which they saw as unconfirmed and unsubstantiated. They also </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/34/ 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>raised questions in relation to the selective list of States mentioned in the report. Concern 
was expressed at the tendency to manipulate human rights mechanisms for political 
purposes. 
</p>
<p>59. A proposal was made that the review of all policies and practices of the United 
Nations and mechanisms with regard to reprisals should be done in an objective and 
impartial manner and in consultation with States. 
</p>
<p>60. It was also suggested that the United Nations should train both its own staff and 
special procedures mandate holders in fact-finding methods that avoid unnecessary risks for 
witnesses, given the fact that unskilled fact-finding techniques might exacerbate the 
dangers posed to witnesses.  
</p>
<p>61. Many delegations referred to human rights mechanisms. Appreciation was expressed 
for the work done by special procedures in relation to reprisals. Joint actions and statements 
of special procedures, including with regional bodies, were encouraged. It was also stressed 
that information on visits of the human rights mechanisms should be widely promoted and 
distributed to ensure that all sectors of society were informed about visits. It was also 
proposed that special procedures mandate holders receive training on dealing with issues 
relating to reprisals. 
</p>
<p>62. Delegations also referred to the universal periodic review as a useful means to 
address allegations of reprisal in a robust and consistent manner. It could play a role in 
monitoring allegations of reprisal. 
</p>
<p>63. With regard to treaty bodies, some of the specific measures that they had developed 
to address cases of reprisal or intimidation were mentioned, in particular the creation by the 
Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment of a specific working group to examine this issue and joint 
statements with other human rights bodies.  
</p>
<p>64. Participants stressed the view that treaty bodies should address acts of reprisal in a 
systematic and consistent manner, including by considering acting through other relevant 
bodies and mechanisms, such the special procedures or OHCHR. This issue could be 
further discussed in the context of the treaty body strengthening process. 
</p>
<p>65. Reference to regional bodies was also made. Some delegations believed that 
cooperation with regional bodies was important, given that they also had developed specific 
measures and mechanisms to address reprisals; they should therefore be involved when 
appropriate.  
</p>
<p>66. Many delegations emphasized the crucial role played by civil society and the fact the 
United Nations could not function properly without them. A few other delegations, while 
acknowledging the important role of civil society and human rights defenders in raising 
awareness about human rights, stressed that cooperating with the United Nations did not 
give additional rights and that equality before the law should be guaranteed.  
</p>
<p>67. Delegations underlined the essential role of non-governmental organizations in 
drawing attention to the report of the Secretary-General and the e-mail address on which 
allegations of reprisal could be reported to OHCHR, as well as in reaching out to human 
rights defenders to submit information with their informed consent. It was noted that non-
governmental organizations should continue to raise the issue of reprisals and demand more 
effective responses. 
</p>
<p>68. With regard to the participation of civil society representatives, support was 
expressed for the position of the Secretary-General that the criteria for consultative status 
for non-governmental organizations must be applied in a &#8220;transparent and fair manner&#8221;. </p>


<p>69. National human rights institutions were also mentioned as key actors in responding 
to reprisals at the national level. Their role included not only raising awareness of the issue 
and related advocacy to convince States to put an end to reprisals, but also offering physical 
protection to those at risk.  
</p>
<p>70. It was explained that regional networks of national human rights institutions had 
developed practices and expertise to address and respond to reprisals that should also be 
supported.  
</p>
<p>71. With regard to follow-up, delegations stressed that these exchanges of views should 
continue and be extended to other human rights forums to ensure a coordinated and 
coherent approach to reprisals. It was also suggested that all proposals made during the 
panel discussion should be compiled into a draft set of guiding principles as a basis for 
follow-up discussion.  
</p>
<p>72. Participants were of the view that the holding of the panel discussion and the 
commitments made by States and other stakeholders in this context was a highlight to take 
forward. Its conclusions should be shared with a view to maximizing protection measures 
for individual actors. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Responses of panellists and concluding remarks by the moderator 
</b></p>
<p>73. The panellists were provided with an opportunity to respond to two sets of questions 
raised by Member States and non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>74. Szabolcs Tak&#225;cs emphasized the fact that anyone who cooperated with the United 
Nations could be targeted, although human rights defenders were more often victims of 
reprisals. He highlighted recent European Union initiatives aimed at protecting human 
rights defenders as good practices that could be replicated, such as by appointing liaison 
officers for human rights defenders in diplomatic missions and having regular meeting with 
them; sending observers to attend trials involving human rights defenders, diplomats 
attending workshops and training sessions organized by non-governmental organizations; 
issuing emergency visas and providing human rights defenders in danger with shelter, with 
particular reference to the International Cities of Refuge Network (ICORN) programme, 
which comprises a network of 40 host cities providing shelter in the European Union. To 
increase protection of persons or groups cooperating with the United Nations system, one 
first and important step could be to ensure that all practical information on addressing acts 
of reprisal or intimidation, including how to submit a reprisal case is readily available on 
the OHCHR website. In addition, as pointed out during the discussion, a central registry of 
cases of reprisal could be established to ensure proper follow-up, welcoming in this context 
the follow-up section of the report of the Secretary-General. This central registry would 
also facilitate cooperation among international and regional organizations.  
</p>
<p>75. As proposed in the report of the Secretary-General, strengthened judicial efforts 
should be combined with immediate, concrete measures to assist victims. For example, any 
public official who makes an official statement that puts human rights defenders at risk 
should be held accountable. In the interest of adequate prevention, all those cases should be 
investigated immediately, and Governments could inform the Human Rights Council about 
the results. The establishment of national witness protection programmes should be 
encouraged, and Governments that require such a programme should seek technical 
assistance from OHCHR. Mr. Tak&#225;cs also emphasized the important role played by 
politicians and other opinion leaders, given that public condemnation of acts of reprisal or 
intimidation is essential to ensure thorough national investigation and transparent reporting. 
Reprisals committed by non-State actors should also be investigated and perpetrators held 
to account, first and foremost by the Government concerned. It was also important that all </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/34/ 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>Governments extend a standing invitation to the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders and cooperate fully with her. Lastly, the Human Rights Council 
should explore the possibility of using the general debate under item 5, to address the issue 
of reprisals. The universal periodic review mechanism should also be considered in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>76. Michel Forst stressed that the panel discussion had been a success on which future 
discussions and action on this issue could be built. Responding to comments, he recalled 
that special procedures mandate holders met regularly with a multitude of interlocutors &#8211; 
such as civil society representatives, activists, policemen, judges and detainees &#8211; and 
stressed that there was no hierarchy among them. One of the risks would indeed be to have 
a specific category of defenders deserving special protection, and another that did not. All 
persons had to be treated in the same manner and receive the same protection. In this 
context, the proposal to have a mediator appointed by the United Nations was very 
interesting, and Mr. Forst hoped that the idea could be discussed further. He supported the 
idea of establishing national focal points. In this connection, he reiterated the view that 
national human rights institutions could play a major role in the protection of individuals 
who were subjected to threats and harassment, as well as in convincing States to put an end 
to such harassment. Emphasizing that the recommendations made during the debate related 
to practical as well as political measures, Mr. Forst stated that although practical measures, 
such as shelter provision or emergency visas, were useful, political responses were even 
more important because they could ensure that people who had been threatened could enjoy 
the right to live peacefully in their country without threats, and also that the perpetrators of 
such threats would be brought to justice.  
</p>
<p>77. Claudio Grossman stated that he would report on the discussion to the meeting of 
treaty bodies Chairpersons to examine how treaty bodies could address acts of reprisal or 
intimidation further. In this context, he referred to the working group on reprisals 
established by the Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, indicating that the possibility of creating a working 
group for all treaty bodies could be considered. With regard to the question of whether new 
legislation was needed, Mr. Grossman stated that some human rights instruments contained 
specific articles requesting State parties to take all appropriate measures to ensure that 
individuals under their jurisdiction were not subjected to ill-treatment or intimidation as a 
consequence of communicating with the monitoring body of the said instrument. In reply to 
comments that the information provided by human rights defenders was not always 
accurate, he clarified that, if States felt accusations were unfounded, they should have the 
opportunity to rebut them. The veracity of the information provided by those cooperating 
with the United Nations was not, however, the issue to be considered in this context. 
Whether the information provided by those cooperating with the Organization was correct 
or not was not a reason to subject them to acts of reprisal, such as torture or assassination. 
Their safety and the safety of their families should never be put in question. Mr. Grossman 
reiterated his view that States should contemplate the idea of an internal focal point that 
could act as an interlocutor should there be indices, suspicion or actions that could be 
qualified as an act of reprisal. He concluded that greater harmonization and coordination 
between various actors, particularly with regional organisations and bodies, should also be 
pursued.  
</p>
<p>78. Hassan Shire Sheikh Ahmed stated that the holding of the panel discussion was 
extremely important and its outcome should be shared with all stakeholders to maximise 
their cooperation and the impact of their respective actions. He reiterated the importance of 
ensuring appropriate follow-up to cases of intimidation and reprisals. He highlighted the 
commitments made by States and other stakeholders during the discussion and the need for 
further cooperation among all actors. In this connection, cooperation with regional human 
rights mechanisms should be explored further. He referred in particular to the mechanisms </p>


<p>of the African human rights system and to the fact that the African Commission on Human 
and Peoples&#8217; Rights had started to hear cases of reprisals reported by non-governmental 
organizations. Mr. Shire Sheikh Ahmed reiterated the need for greater cooperation between 
stakeholders in terms of protection for those who cooperate with the United Nations, and he 
encouraged the sharing of best practices in this regard.  
</p>
<p>79. Mehr Khan Williams, as moderator, thanked the conveners of the panel and the 
participants for what had been a useful and encouraging session conducted in a positive 
way, allowing all to discuss a critical issue. She also thanked the Secretary-General, the 
High Commissioner and her Office, whose support had been indispensable, as well as her 
fellow panellists for the relevant and important comments that they had contributed to the 
discussion. The concrete proposals made in the course of the discussion should be recorded 
and discussed, thereby helping the Human Rights Council to address the problem in the 
future. She stressed that the primary responsibility to protect civil society actors rested with 
States, and that it was important for them not only to address the allegations of reprisals 
but, more importantly, also to create a climate in which such incidents could no longer 
occur. Many good suggestions had been made about enhancing cooperation, and they 
should be taken seriously. More importantly, the Council should continue to discuss this 
issue, as it was only through the exchange of views, clarity and the sharing of good 
information and practices that progress could be made.
