<p><b>Introduction 
</b> 
1. This addendum to the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights aspects of 
the victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children contains, on a country by 
country basis, summaries of urgent appeals and letters of allegation sent from 1 January 2006 
to 31 December 2006 by the Special Rapporteur to Governments on individual cases and 
general situations of concern to her. It also includes summaries of Government replies 
received from 1 January 2006 to 31 January 2007. Government replies received after 31 
December 2006 will be included in the next report of the Special Rapporteur to the Human 
Rights Council.  
 
2. Statistics on the number of communications sent and Government replies received, the 
number of joint urgent appeals and letters of allegations sent, the number of communications 
sent by geographical region, and the number of joint communications sent with different 
mandate holders, are represented in tables in the next section of the report. 
 
3. The Special Rapporteur identifies individual cases and general situations of concern to 
her mandate with reference to the definition of trafficking in persons contained in the Protocol 
to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
(Trafficking Protocol). Article 3 of the Protocol defines trafficking in persons as follows: 
 
For the purposes of this Protocol: 
 
(a) &#8220;Trafficking in persons&#8221; shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, 
harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of 
coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of 
vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a 
person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall 
include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual 
exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the 
removal of organs; 
 
(b) The consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation set forth 
in subparagraph (a) of this article shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth in 
subparagraph (a) have been used; 
 
(c) The recruitment, transportation, trans, harbouring or receipt of a  child for the purpose 
of exploitation shall be considered &#8220;trafficking in persons&#8221; even if this does not involve any of 
the means set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article; 
 
(d) &#8220;Child&#8221; shall mean any person under eighteen years of age. 
 
4. The Special Rapporteur acts on information she receives from victims directly, from 
individuals acting on behalf of the victims, from non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 4 
</p>
<p>well as United Nations bodies. She recalls that in transmitting urgent appeals and letters of 
allegations, she does not make any judgement concerning the merits of the cases, nor does she 
necessarily support the opinions and activities of the persons on behalf of whom she 
intervenes. 
</p><p> 
5. All of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communications were sent jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, the Special Rapporteur 
on the human rights of migrants, as well as with the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders. As of 31 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur 
had sent 27 communications and as of 31 January 2007 she had received 14 replies from 
concerned Governments. She expresses her appreciation for the 14 timely replies, but regrets 
that 13 Governments failed entirely to respond and that some of those Governments that did 
respond did so only selectively. The Special Rapporteur will send reminders to those 
Governments who are still to respond to her communications, as well as follow-up letters to 
those Governments who the Special Rapporteur deems have provided insufficient information 
in their replies or from whom she wishes to obtain further clarifications on the relevant 
concerns raised.  
 
 
 
6. The communications sent within this reporting period concerned mainly women and 
children, but also to a lesser extent men. Communications regarding men concerned 
trafficking for purposes of forced labour, particularly in factories, ranching, deforestation, 
agriculture, logging and charcoal production. Trafficking of women mainly concerned 
trafficking for forced labour, particularly in factories and domestic work, and also trafficking 
for forced marriage and for purposes of sexual exploitation including in conditions of slavery 
and debt bondage. Trafficking of children concerned situations of forced labour in quarries, 
agricultural plantations and domestic work, as well as forced begging; cases regarding 
children also concerned sexual exploitation. A number of communications also addressed 
factors that cause or exacerbate trafficking in persons such as corruption, unemployment, 
situations of conflict, human rights violations, discrimination, poverty, lack of access to 
education, discriminatory norms and policies as well as inadequate labour laws, particularly 
vis-&#224;-vis migrant workers. 
 
7. For reasons of confidentiality, privacy and protection, the names of individual victims 
appear in initials in this report; the full names were, however, provided in the actual letters 
sent to Governments. The Special Rapporteur has also used initials for certain other persons 
concerned in order to minimise the risk of possible further victimization in their regard. 
Moreover, with a view to preserve the presumption of innocence, the same procedure has 
been adopted by the Special Rapporteur with regards to alleged perpetrators. </p>

8. Con carta de fecha 25 julio 2006, la Relatora Especial, juntamente con el Relator 
Especial sobre los derechos humanos de los migrantes, transmiti&#243; al Gobierno una carta de 
alegaciones acerca de la situaci&#243;n de trabajadores migrantes bolivianos objeto de trata de 
personas en Argentina. 
 
9. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, en octubre de 2005, 17 trabajadores bolivianos 
habr&#237;an sido liberados de una f&#225;brica textil en Buenos Aires, propiedad del Sr. J.C.S.N. &#201;stos 
habr&#237;an presentado una demanda contra el Sr. J.C.S.N. por trata y por trabajo forzoso. 
 
10. Se informa del hecho que el Sr. J.C.S.N., tambi&#233;n de nacionalidad boliviana, habr&#237;a 
prometido pagar a los trabajadores por prenda producida. Sin embargo, una vez en las 
maquilas, se habr&#237;an visto forzados a trabajar hasta 17 horas al d&#237;a y recibir&#237;an el equivalente 
a 6,50 d&#243;lares de los Estados Unidos de Am&#233;rica como un &#8220;anticipo&#8221;. 
 
11. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, los trabajadores testificaron que el Sr. J.C.S.N. les 
amenazaba, les privaba de sus documentos y restring&#237;a su libertad de movimiento, incluso 
llegando a encerrarles en la f&#225;brica, con la intenci&#243;n de mantenerlos trabajando contra su 
voluntad. Asimismo, la comida s&#243;lo se proporcionaba a los empleados, es decir, los adultos 
deb&#237;an compartir su comida con sus hijos. Algunos trabajadores habr&#237;an informado de que les 
imped&#237;an llevar a sus hijos al colegio o al m&#233;dico, ya que ello causar&#237;a &#8220;interferencias con la 
producci&#243;n&#8221;. 
 
12. Se informa asimismo del hecho de que el 9 de noviembre de 2005, el juez O. 
sobresey&#243; el caso contra el Sr. J.C.S.N. y su esposa argumentando que no hab&#237;a pruebas 
suficientes para demostrar que los trabajadores hab&#237;an estado bajo servidumbre. Del mismo 
modo, habr&#237;a alegado que carec&#237;a de jurisdicci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con violaciones de derecho 
laboral. Ello a pesar del hecho de que ocho antiguos empleados y vecinos habr&#237;an prestado 
declaraci&#243;n contra el Sr. J.C.S.N. Estos testigos tambi&#233;n confirmaron que la polic&#237;a acud&#237;a 
regularmente a la f&#225;brica para tomar un porcentaje de los beneficios. 
 
13. De acuerdo con la Cooperativa de Trabajo 20 de Diciembre, cuatro de los 17 
trabajadores migrantes habr&#237;an sido amenazados personalmente o por tel&#233;fono antes de que 
J.C.S.N. fuera puesto en libertad por el juez. La Cooperativa aleg&#243; tambi&#233;n que la polic&#237;a 
habr&#237;a intimidado a los testigos y les habr&#237;a ofrecido sobornos para intentar que cambiaran sus 
testimonios.  
 
14. Se estima que decenas de miles de personas podr&#237;an estar trabajando en condiciones 
similares en maquilas en la ciudad de Buenos Aires y sus alrededores. S&#243;lo en el distrito 
Parque Avellaneda de la capital, se estima que existen unas 40 peque&#241;as maquilas, y cada una 
de ellas emplear&#237;a entre 15 y 30 personas.  
 
15. Aunque los trabajadores bolivianos son los m&#225;s afectados, paraguayos, argentinos y 
peruanos tambi&#233;n estar&#237;an en riesgo de este tipo de explotaci&#243;n, en especial en las f&#225;bricas de 
producci&#243;n de calzado. </p>

16. Los Relatores Especiales llamaron la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno sobre el Protocolo para 
prevenir, reprimir y sancionar la trata de personas, especialmente mujeres y ni&#241;os, que 
complementa la Convenci&#243;n de las Naciones Unidas contra la Delincuencia Organizada 
Transnacional y en particular sobre su art&#237;culo 6 denominado &#8220;Asistencia y protecci&#243;n a las 
v&#237;ctimas de la trata de personas&#8221;. Asimismo, llamaron la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno sobre los 
Principios y Directrices recomendados sobre los derechos humanos y la trata de personas 
(E/2002/68/Add.1) y en particular sobre el Principio 9 que establece que se proporcionar&#225; 
asistencia jur&#237;dica y de otra &#237;ndole a las v&#237;ctimas de la trata de personas mientras duren las 
acciones penales, civiles o de otra &#237;ndole contra los presuntos tratantes. Finalmente, 
recordaron el Pacto Internacional de derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos que establece en el inciso <i>a</i> 
del p&#225;rrafo 3 de su art&#237;culo 8 que &#8220;Nadie ser&#225; constre&#241;ido a ejecutar un trabajo forzoso u 
obligatorio&#8221; y el art&#237;culo 4 del Convenio N.&#186; 29 de la Organizaci&#243;n Internacional del Trabajo 
(OIT), relativo al trabajo forzoso u obligatorio, de 1930, que determina que las autoridades 
competentes no deber&#225;n imponer o dejar que se imponga el trabajo forzoso u obligatorio en 
provecho de particulares, de compa&#241;&#237;as o de personas jur&#237;dicas de car&#225;cter privado. 
 
17. Los Relatores Especiales adem&#225;s instaron al Gobierno a que protegiera los derechos 
humanos de las personas afectadas y adoptara todas las medidas necesarias a investigar, 
procesar e imponer las sanciones necesarias a cualquier persona responsable de las 
violaciones alegadas y a que tomara las medidas necesarias para evitar que se repitan estos 
hechos.

<p><b>Comunicaciones recibidas 
</b> 
18. Con carta de fecha 17 noviembre 2006, el Gobierno transmiti&#243; la siguiente 
informaci&#243;n con relaci&#243;n a la situaci&#243;n de los trabajadores migrantes bolivianos objeto de 
trata de personas en Argentina. 
 
19. En primer lugar, el Gobierno de Argentina confirm&#243; que en relaci&#243;n con el caso que 
involucra a la f&#225;brica textil del se&#241;or J.C.S.N., tal como lo se&#241;alaron los Relatores Especiales, 
el mismo fue sobrese&#237;do por en la causa que lo involucraba, en fecha 9 de noviembre de 2005.  
 
20. El Gobierno inform&#243; de que a ra&#237;z de episodios ocurridos en Buenos Aires, que 
pusieron en evidencia situaciones de trata de personas y de discriminaci&#243;n de miembros de la 
colectividad boliviana, la Secretar&#237;a de Derechos Humanos del Ministerio de Justicia cre&#243; el 
Observatorio de Derechos Humanos destinado a la colectividad boliviana residente en la 
Rep&#250;blica Argentina y que tiene como objetivo realizar acciones coordinadas, destinadas a 
monitorear junto con la Rep&#250;blica de Bolivia la situaci&#243;n de los migrantes, dise&#241;ar planes de 
acci&#243;n y programas tendientes a garantizar el conocimiento de los derechos que los amparan y 
regularizar la situaci&#243;n migratoria de los miembros de la colectividad. Esta iniciativa fue 
coordinada con el gobierno de la Rep&#250;blica de Bolivia. 
 
21. El Gobierno not&#243; que una proporci&#243;n alta de los migrantes bolivianos carece de una 
documentaci&#243;n adecuada, lo que dificulta conocer el n&#250;mero exacto de la poblaci&#243;n migrante 
radicada en el pa&#237;s. Por distintos factores, esta poblaci&#243;n es muy vulnerable al accionar de 
redes que los captan para trabajar en condiciones inhumanas, configurando en algunas 
situaciones verdaderos casos de reducci&#243;n a la servidumbre y trata. El Proyecto Hacia un Plan 
Nacional contra la Discriminaci&#243;n, aprobado por Decreto N.&#186; 1086/05 contiene un cap&#237;tulo 
sobre migrantes que describe los problemas que tiene la colectividad boliviana. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 9 
</p>
<p> 
22. El Gobierno inform&#243; de que, a partir de la intervenci&#243;n de distintas entidades 
gubernamentales, se ha detectado que existen situaciones similares de trata con fines de 
explotaci&#243;n laboral de migrantes, particularmente de nacionalidad boliviana, en otros 
establecimientos de la industria de la indumentaria, y probablemente en la producci&#243;n 
frutohort&#237;cola. El incendio en un establecimiento clandestino en el mes de marzo de 2006 
puso en evidencia que existe una red importante de talleres clandestinos que ocupan mano de 
obra en condiciones de sobreexplotaci&#243;n, y en algunos casos configuran situaciones de trata. 
El Gobierno asegur&#243; que este episodio dio lugar a una fuerte intervenci&#243;n coordinadora del 
Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires y el Ministerio de Trabajo, Empleo y Seguridad 
Social, tanto para inspeccionar establecimientos, como para clausurarlos y asistir a las 
v&#237;ctimas. Inform&#243; tambi&#233;n que la clandestinidad de estos establecimientos constituye un 
obst&#225;culo para perseguir el delito. 
 
23. El Gobierno afirm&#243; que la protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos es uno de los pilares de 
las pol&#237;ticas de Estado del Gobierno y que por lo tanto la lucha contra la trata de personas es 
una de sus prioridades. Asegur&#243; que es por esto que el Estado argentino ha asumido diversos 
compromisos internacionales, tanto a nivel de las Naciones Unidas, como de la Organizaci&#243;n 
de los Estados Americanos (OEA), como del Mercado Com&#250;n del Sur (MERCOSUR). El 
Gobierno explic&#243; que como producto de estos compromisos y de la actuaci&#243;n en casos 
concretos se tiene hoy un diagn&#243;stico bastante detallado de la situaci&#243;n de trata en el pa&#237;s, y 
una mayor claridad sobre el <i>modus operandi</i> para actuar contra ella; y que es por esto que 
pareciera que se han incrementado los casos, cuando en realidad es que empieza a salir a la 
luz una situaci&#243;n existente previamente, pero que ahora tiene respuesta desde el Estado. 
 
24. A partir de la casu&#237;stica, el Gobierno de la Rep&#250;blica de Argentina ha podido 
identificar distintas formas de trata de personas. Explic&#243; que en todos los casos se est&#225; frente a 
redes de personas que hacen de la captaci&#243;n, transporte, acogida y explotaci&#243;n de otros seres 
humanos una actividad habitual con el objetivo de obtener ingentes ganancias. Constituyen un 
elemento de corrupci&#243;n y debilitamiento de las instituciones del Estado que deber&#225; ser tratado 
con toda la rigurosidad que corresponde. Reconoci&#243; que en la Rep&#250;blica de Argentina existe 
tanto trata interna, como se verifica trata internacional, y que en el segundo caso, es un pa&#237;s de 
origen, tr&#225;nsito y destino de trata de personas, desde y hacia distintos Estados. 
 
25. Entre las medidas concretas tomadas por el Estado de Argentina para prevenir y luchar 
contra la trata de personas, el Gobierno se&#241;al&#243; la participaci&#243;n en el debate internacional y 
regional, y adopci&#243;n de compromisos, mediante la ratificaci&#243;n del Protocolo para prevenir, 
reprimir y sancionar la trata de personas, especialmente mujeres y ni&#241;os, y la participaci&#243;n 
activa en el &#225;mbito internacional y regional en el combate de la trata de personas y la 
asistencia y protecci&#243;n a las v&#237;ctimas.  
 
26. A nivel regional, Argentina particip&#243; en la Reuni&#243;n de altas autoridades nacionales en 
materia de trata de personas, celebrada entre el 14 y el 17 de marzo de 2006 en Isla Margarita 
(Rep&#250;blica Bolivariana) de Venezuela. En el marco del MERCOSUR tambi&#233;n existen varias 
iniciativas y compromisos relativos al combate de la trata. En su 19.&#170; reuni&#243;n, los Ministros 
del Interior del MERCOSUR y pa&#237;ses asociados firmaron un acuerdo 
(MERCOSUR/RMI/ACUERDO N.&#186; 01/06) por el cu&#225;l se comprometen a desarrollar un plan 
de acci&#243;n del MERCOSUR para la lucha contra la trata de personas.

<p>27. El Gobierno inform&#243; adem&#225;s sobre qu&#233; acciones concretas estaban siendo 
desarrolladas, destinadas a crear un &#225;mbito de coordinaci&#243;n interinstitucional con 
incumbencias sobre el tema, armonizar la legislaci&#243;n interna con los compromisos asumidos, 
generar un programa integral de asistencia y protecci&#243;n de las v&#237;ctimas y desarrollar 
estrategias de instalaci&#243;n de la problem&#225;tica, de capacitaci&#243;n de funcionarios p&#250;blicos y 
organizaciones sociales, y prevenci&#243;n. En el marco del Plan de Acci&#243;n del MERCOSUR, se 
ha creado, en el &#225;mbito del Ministerio del Interior, una Subdirecci&#243;n de Inteligencia Criminal, 
que tiene entre sus tareas la investigaci&#243;n de los mecanismos criminales que adopta la trata de 
personas en la Argentina. Tambi&#233;n funciona en el &#225;mbito del mismo Ministerio el Programa 
de la V&#237;ctimas contra las Violencias, desde el cual se convoca a las otras instituciones del 
Estado, para coordinar enfoques y acciones.  
</p><p> 
28. Por otra parte, el Gobierno inform&#243; de la discusi&#243;n en la Honorable C&#225;mara de 
Senadores del Proyecto de Ley que tipifica el delito de trata de personas y le da estatus de 
delito federal, incluyendo un programa de asistencia y protecci&#243;n de las v&#237;ctimas con un 
enfoque integral, multidisciplinario y de derechos humanos. No obstante de lo cual, el 
Gobierno se&#241;ala que existen en el C&#243;digo Penal actual figuras que integran la del delito de 
trata de personas y pueden utilizarse para la persecuci&#243;n del delito y penar a los perpetradores.  
 
29. La Ley de Migraciones N.&#186; 25.875, sancionada en 2004, que sienta las bases 
estrat&#233;gicas en materia migratoria desde un enfoque de derechos humanos, integraci&#243;n y 
movilidad de los migrantes, tambi&#233;n incorpora en su texto, entre los agravantes de los delitos 
al orden migratorio, cuando el tr&#225;fico ilegal de personas se hubiera realizado con el objeto de 
prostituci&#243;n, o hubiera puesto en peligro la vida, salud o la integridad de los migrantes, o 
cuando la v&#237;ctima sea menor de edad (art&#237;culo 121). 
 
30. El Gobierno destac&#243; adem&#225;s acciones de sensibilizaci&#243;n y capacitaci&#243;n desarrolladas 
por la Secretar&#237;a de Derechos Humanos del Ministerio de Justicia y Derechos Humanos con 
funcionarios y en particular con funcionarios policiales. Parte de esta tarea se realiza en 
articulaci&#243;n con el Programa Nacional de Capacitaci&#243;n Policial que desarrolla la Secretar&#237;a de 
Seguridad Interior del Ministerio de Interior. Tambi&#233;n se ha contado con el apoyo de la 
Agencia Espa&#241;ola de Cooperaci&#243;n Internacional en este sentido. 
 
31. Se ha desarrollado el concepto de prevenci&#243;n primaria, que consiste en capacitar a 
organizaciones sociales, en particular de mujeres, las que tienen una importante inserci&#243;n 
territorial. De esta manera ellas colaboran en prevenir sobre las formas de reclutamiento que 
tienen los tratantes e identificar en terreno propaganda o avisos enga&#241;osos. Como producto de 
estas capacitaciones se han recibido denuncias que han sido canalizadas a la justicia, a trav&#233;s 
de la Secretar&#237;a de Seguridad Interior. 
 
32. Durante el a&#241;o 2006, la Organizaci&#243;n Internacional para las Migraciones (OIM) 
desarroll&#243; un Programa de Sensibilizaci&#243;n sobre trata de personas (FOINTRA I) y est&#225; 
previsto comenzar a ejecutar el programa FOINTRA II. 
 
33. Por &#250;ltimo, el Gobierno especific&#243; las medidas que est&#225;n siendo tomadas para prestar 
asistencia legal y protecci&#243;n a las v&#237;ctimas de trata. Explic&#243; que si bien no existe a&#250;n un 
programa integral de asistencia a las v&#237;ctimas de trata de personas, varias instituciones 
participan dando asistencia psicol&#243;gica, m&#233;dica, social y legal en los casos puntuales. Entre 
ellas se encuentran la Oficina de Asistencia Integral a la V&#237;ctima del delito, de la Procuraci&#243;n 
General de la Naci&#243;n, la Secretar&#237;a de Derechos Humanos, instituciones de asistencia a la </p>

<p>ni&#241;ez que  tienen equipos de asistencia a v&#237;ctimas, el Ministerio de Desarrollo Humano y 
algunos hospitales est&#225;n formando equipos especializados y el Consejo Federal de Derechos 
Humanos. Tambi&#233;n se est&#225; coordinando en este sentido con la OIM.

<p><b>Communications sent  
</b> 
34. On 21 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding the situation of EYO, a 32-year old woman of Eritrean nationality. 
 
35. According to information received, Ms. EYO was working in Bahrain as a migrant 
domestic worker. Allegedly, the son of her employer repeatedly raped and beat her and the 
family employing her restricted her freedom of movement, did not pay her and took away her 
passport. She finally managed to run away on 7 November 2006, and found temporary 
lodging with a friend who then, however, asked her to leave since she had no legal papers. He 
called the police who took her to a women&#8217;s detention centre in ISA Town.  
 
36. It is reported that the authorities in Bahrain did not take any steps against her 
employers. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern about the safety of Ms. EYO and about 
the alleged lack of assistance provided to Ms. EYO, who could be a trafficking victim.   
 
37. The Special Rapporteur called the attention of the Government to the Trafficking 
Protocol, particularly Art. 6 (3) of the said Protocol concerning the assistance and protection 
of victims of trafficking in persons. The Special Rapporteur further suggested that, in the 
event that the Government&#8217;s investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be 
correct, the Government takes all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and 
freedoms of the aforementioned person are respected and accountability of any person guilty 
of the alleged violations ensured. The Special Rapporteur also requested that the Government 
adopts effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.

</b> 
38. Le 16 mars 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233;, conjointement avec le Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial sur la vente d'enfants, la prostitution d'enfants et la pornographie impliquant des 
enfants, un appel urgent concernant <b>les enfants b&#233;ninois qui continueraient d&#8217;&#234;tre trafiqu&#233;s 
aux fins d&#8217;exploitation dans les carri&#232;res de graviers et dans les plantations au Nig&#233;ria</b>.  
 
39. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, malgr&#233; la signature d&#8217;un accord en juin 2005 entre le 
B&#233;nin et le Nig&#233;ria, des centaines d&#8217;enfants b&#233;ninois, &#226;g&#233;s de 6 ans pour les plus jeunes, 
travailleraient toujours dans les carri&#232;res de pierres d&#8217;Abeokuta et dans ses environs ainsi que 
dans de nombreuses plantations agricoles du Sud-Ouest nig&#233;rian. 
 
40. Les carri&#232;res dans lesquelles travailleraient ces enfants seraient essentiellement des 
carri&#232;res de graviers, c'est-&#224;-dire de petits gisements prenant les apparences de &#171; trous &#187; dans 
lesquels des groupes de deux &#224; trois enfants, appel&#233;s &#171; gangs &#187;, travailleraient durant plusieurs 
semaines avant de se d&#233;placer vers un autre gisement. Les propri&#233;taires des carri&#232;res, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 12 
</p>
<p>g&#233;n&#233;ralement des notables locaux, s&#8217;adresseraient &#224; des interm&#233;diaires, souvent des femmes 
Yoruba, pour g&#233;rer l&#8217;exploitation des carri&#232;res. Ces interm&#233;diaires feraient appel &#224; des 
trafiquants b&#233;ninois pour leur fournir la main d&#8217;&#339;uvre enfantine.  
</p><p> 
41. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, les enfants travailleraient entre cinq et sept jours par 
semaine sur les carri&#232;res. La dur&#233;e de leur &#171; contrat &#187; serait normalement de six ans (trois 
cycles de deux ans), durant lesquels ils ne percevraient pas &#224; proprement parler de salaire. En 
revanche, ils pourraient gagner en fin de cycle une bicyclette et/ou une radio. Une modique 
somme d&#8217;argent serait remise &#224; leurs parents &#224; des dates pr&#233;cises et p&#233;riodiques au cours de 
ces six ann&#233;es.  
 
42. Cette activit&#233; physique serait intense et dangereuse, particuli&#232;rement &#233;prouvante pour 
les genoux et les mains, avec de nombreux risques d&#8217;accident. Les journ&#233;es de travail seraient  
de 8 &#224; 10 heures. Les enfants seraient sous-nourris et ne pourraient compter que sur eux-
m&#234;mes pour trouver de quoi se laver, se v&#234;tir et se soigner. Ils passeraient les nuits sous des 
abris de fortune. La violence entre enfants serait permanente, et il arriverait aussi que les 
adultes les maltraitent et leur infligent coups, brimades et injures.  
 
43. Ce serait une guerre entre les trafiquants en septembre 2003 qui aurait port&#233; au grand 
jour la situation d&#8217;exploitation de ces enfants. La reconnaissance de ce trafic aurait &#233;t&#233; suivie 
d&#8217;une action d&#8217;urgence visant au retrait, au rapatriement, &#224; la protection et &#224; la r&#233;int&#233;gration 
des enfants sous le contr&#244;le des pouvoirs publics b&#233;ninois et nig&#233;rians, avec l&#8217;assistance 
d&#8217;organisations internationales et non gouvernementales sp&#233;cialis&#233;es dans la protection de 
l&#8217;enfance.  
 
44. Officiellement, 261 enfants, dont la grande majorit&#233; proviendraient de la commune de 
Zakpota dans le d&#233;partement du Zou auraient pu &#234;tre retir&#233;s des carri&#232;res et rapatri&#233;s. Ils 
auraient eu pour la plupart entre 10 et 15 ans. Plus de 50 % d&#8217;entre eux auraient venu de 
passer entre 1 et 2 ans dans les carri&#232;res, 35 % entre 3 et 4 ans et le reste entre 4 et 7 ans, ce 
qui attesterait de l&#8217;ampleur et de l&#8217;anciennet&#233; du trafic. En plus de ces 261 enfants rapatri&#233;s, 
un millier d&#8217;autres enfants (au moins) seraient revenus dans le Zou sans aucune aide ni 
protection institutionnelle (enfants dits de &#171; retour non formel &#187;). Des dizaines voire des 
centaines d&#8217;autres enfants b&#233;ninois qui seraient exploit&#233;s &#224; Abeokuta seraient rest&#233;s cach&#233;s 
plusieurs semaines ou plusieurs mois dans la brousse avant d&#8217;&#234;tre achemin&#233;s vers d&#8217;autres 
sites d&#8217;exploitation dans le sud-ouest du Nigeria (&#233;tats d&#8217;Ogun, d&#8217;Osun et d&#8217;Oyo) o&#249; ils 
auraient probablement rejoint d&#8217;autres enfants b&#233;ninois d&#233;j&#224; exploit&#233;s dans des carri&#232;res ou 
des plantations agricoles. 
 
45. Seuls sept trafiquants auraient &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;s, et ceux&#8211;ci auraient &#233;t&#233; lib&#233;r&#233;s &#224; la fin de 
l&#8217;ann&#233;e 2004, apr&#232;s une p&#233;riode de d&#233;tention provisoire et des condamnations allant de 
quelques mois &#224; un an de prison. Rien n&#8217;aurait &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;vu pour faciliter leur r&#233;insertion 
&#233;conomique ni pour les encourager &#224; ne pas reprendre leurs activit&#233;s illicites. En cons&#233;quence, 
les fili&#232;res et les routes du trafic entre le B&#233;nin et Abeokuta demeureraient encore en place.  
 
46. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a attir&#233; l'attention du Gouvernement sur la Convention 182 de 
l'OIT concernant l'interdiction des pires formes de travail des enfants et l'action imm&#233;diate en 
vue de leur &#233;limination, en vertu de laquelle les &#201;tats se sont engag&#233;s &#224; prendre des mesures 
imm&#233;diates et efficaces pour assurer l'interdiction et l'&#233;limination des pires formes de travail 
des enfants et ce, de toute urgence. Aux fins de la convention, l'expression &#171; les pires formes 
de travail des enfants &#187; comprend notamment toutes les formes d'esclavage ou pratiques </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 13 
</p>
<p>analogues, telles que la vente et la traite des enfants, la servitude pour dettes et le servage 
ainsi que le travail forc&#233; ou obligatoire, l'utilisation, le recrutement ou l'offre d'un enfant &#224; des 
fins de prostitution, de production de mat&#233;riel pornographique ou de spectacles 
pornographiques, ainsi que les travaux qui, par leur nature ou les conditions dans lesquelles ils 
s'exercent, sont susceptibles de nuire &#224; la sant&#233;, &#224; la s&#233;curit&#233; ou &#224; la moralit&#233; de l'enfant. Elle a 
aussi attir&#233; l'attention sur la Convention 138 de l'OIT concernant l'&#226;ge minimum d'admission &#224; 
l'emploi. La Convention en son article 2 pr&#233;voit que les &#201;tats doivent sp&#233;cifier un &#226;ge 
minimum d'admission &#224; l'emploi ou au travail sur son territoire qui ne devra pas &#234;tre inf&#233;rieur 
&#224; l'&#226;ge auquel cesse la scolarit&#233; obligatoire, ni en tout cas &#224; 15 ans. Selon l'article 7, la 
l&#233;gislation nationale pourra autoriser l'emploi &#224; des travaux l&#233;gers des personnes de 13 &#224; 15 
ans ou l'ex&#233;cution, par ces personnes, de tels travaux, &#224; condition que ceux-ci ne soient pas 
susceptibles de porter pr&#233;judice &#224; leur sant&#233; ou &#224; leur d&#233;veloppement; ne soient pas de nature 
&#224; porter pr&#233;judice &#224; leur assiduit&#233; scolaire, &#224; leur participation &#224; des programmes d'orientation 
ou de formation professionnelles approuv&#233;s par l'autorit&#233; comp&#233;tente ou &#224; leur aptitude &#224; 
b&#233;n&#233;ficier de l'instruction re&#231;ue. 
</p><p> 
47. De plus, elle a pri&#233; le Gouvernement de prendre toutes les mesures n&#233;cessaires pour 
assurer la protection des droits et des libert&#233;s des individus mentionn&#233;s, de diligenter des 
enqu&#234;tes sur les violations qui auraient &#233;t&#233; perp&#233;tr&#233;es, de traduire les responsables en justice 
et d&#8217;adopter, le cas &#233;ch&#233;ant, toutes les mesures n&#233;cessaires pour pr&#233;venir la r&#233;p&#233;tition des faits 
mentionn&#233;s.

<p><b>Brazil 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent  
</b> 
48. On 28 August 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>Brazilian 
workers who are trafficked and subjected to forced labour in the Amazon region</b>. 
 
49. According to the information received, there are an estimated 25,000 to 40,000 forced 
labourers working under exploitative and often slavery-like conditions in Brazil. Allegedly, 
Maranh&#227;o, Piau&#237; and Tocantins are the three Brazilian states that supply the largest number of 
forced labourers, whilst Par&#225; is reportedly the state with the greatest demand for forced 
labour, followed by Mato Grosso, Tocantins and Maranh&#227;o. Labour is sought principally in 
ranching, deforestation, agriculture, logging and charcoal production.  
 
50. Reportedly, the vast majority of workers in forced labour in Brazil find themselves in 
situations of debt bondage. Workers are often given an advance in their home town and 
persuaded to go and work temporarily in the Amazon region. Once they arrive at the farms 
they are told that they will have to pay for their transport, food and lodging and also have to 
pay back any advances they have been given. They are reportedly charged a very high rate of 
interest and often have to buy everything they need at grossly inflated prices from the estate 
shop.  
 
51. It is also reported that workers are often watched by armed guards, making it 
impossible for them to escape from the farms. Threats of violence against them and their 
families are frequent. Labour rights and safety regulations are reportedly routinely ignored. 
Allegedly, workers risk their physical and psychological health, with many suffering from 
tropical diseases and work related injuries resulting from operating unsafe machinery. The </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 14 
</p>
<p>severity of their situation often leads to alcohol and drug abuse. Many workers, once released, 
find it extremely difficult to reintegrate into their home region and re-establish a normal 
family life.  
</p><p> 
52. According to the information received, greater attention to the problem of forced 
labour and slavery-like conditions in Brazil has been accompanied by a rise in the use of 
violence and intimidation against those working to stop such human rights violations, 
especially in the states of Par&#225; and Tocantins. In 2004, members of the Comiss&#227;o Pastoral da 
Terra (CPT) from the Araguaina office in Tocantins state had to leave the area after receiving 
repeated death threats. 
 
53. Reportedly, State officials have also been targeted. In October 2003, the Labour Court 
judge Dr. JARV had to leave Parauapebas after receiving repeated threats. On 11 February 
2004, his deputy was killed in a suspicious collision with a lorry while traveling from Maraba 
to Parauapebas. In Tocantins state, the federal prosecutor Dr. MLA had to leave the town of 
Palmas after receiving threats. On 28 January 2004, three officials from the Labour Ministry 
and their driver were murdered while carrying out investigations of farms situated in Minas 
Gerais. 
 
54. The Special Rapporteur called the attention of the Government to the Trafficking 
Protocol, to the Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human trafficking of the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), as well as to article 8 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibiting slavery. The Special 
Rapporteur further suggested that, in the event that the Government&#8217;s investigations support 
the above allegations, or suggest that they are correct, the Government takes all necessary 
measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned person are respected 
and the accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations ensured. The Special 
Rapporteur also requested that the Government adopt effective measures to prevent the 
recurrence of these acts.

55. On 25 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, and the Special Rapporteur on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography, sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>the 
trafficking of newborn infants from Bulgaria to Greece</b>. 
 
56. According to information received, it was alleged that pregnant women, most of them 
from the Roma community in the region of Burgas in eastern Bulgaria, and many of them 
unemployed and living in harsh conditions, are induced by members of organized crime to go 
to work in Greece. They are promised employment and good salaries, but actually end up in 
small cities throughout Greece where they are held together in apartments for the remainder 
of their pregnancy before delivering at local hospitals where, with the complicity of doctors, 
midwives and other hospital staff, their newborn babies are taken away from them and sold by 
organized crime members, with the assistance of lawyers, for up to 30,000euros. It is alleged 
that after having given birth in Greece, the women are sent back to their hometowns in 
Bulgaria and receive 1,000 Euros per child.

<p><b>People&#8217;s Republic of China 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent  
</b> 
59. On 24 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, and the Special Rapporteur on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography, sent a letter of allegation to the 
Government of China  to bring to its attention allegations of <b>the forced repatriation of a 
female national of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea</b> by China on 28 February 
2006. According to information received: 
 
60. Six years earlier, the woman and her one-year-old daughter, were sold for RMB  3,000 
to a Chinese man, whom she was forced to marry. The woman became pregnant soon 
thereafter and gave birth to a second daughter. It was reported that the mother was arrested 
during a Chinese police raid squad at 11.30 pm on 25 February 2006 and handed over to the 
security police of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea three days later.  
 
61. Concern was expressed that the woman could face harsh punishment in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, since she had already been deported on two previous 
occasions, but managed each time to return to her children in China. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur also recalled the communication she had sent on 19 December 2005, in 
which she had expressed her deep concern about the trafficking and sexual exploitation of 
women from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and the cruel and inhuman 
punishment Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea nationals face, when deported back to the 
country.  
 
62. This case was reportedly not the only similar incident. In cities near the border, 
including Yanji and Longjin, an increase in information exchanges between Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and Chinese authorities concerning Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea defectors had reportedly led to an increase in deportations of these 
nationals. Chinese police reportedly receive a salary bonus of RMB 2,000 for every arrest of a 
suspected defector from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.  
 
63. The Special Rapporteur appealed to the Government to protect citizens of the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea from all forms of trafficking, exploitation and abuse. 
Moreover, the Special Rapporteur called the attention of the Government to the Trafficking 
Protocol, and also made reference to the OHCHR Recommended Principles and Guidelines 
on Human Rights and Trafficking, and in particular to Principle 2 which states that trafficked 
persons shall be offered legal alternatives to repatriation in cases where it is reasonable to </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 16 
</p>
<p>conclude that such repatriation would pose a serious risk to their safety and/or to the safety of 
their families.  
</p>
<p><b>Response by the Government 
</b> 
64. By letter dated 14 June 2006, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that 
because her letter of allegation only referred to a child born of a mother from the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and a Chinese father, and mentions the time that the mother was 
apprehended and repatriated, but provides no indication of the woman&#8217;s full name, age, place 
of entry into China, place of residence, border-crossing point where she was repatriated or 
details of the Chinese father, it was very hard for the Chinese authorities to trace the woman 
concerned.  According to investigations conducted by the Jilin and Liaoning public security 
authorities, the Chinese authorities did not apprehend or repatriate any illegal immigrants 
from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea during the last ten days of February 2006 
whose description match that of the woman concerned. 
 
65. The Government further informed the Special Rapporteur that the statement that 
50,000 illegal immigrants from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea have been 
detained in Jilin in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, is an exaggeration.  As a 
consequence of the improved economic situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea and the strengthened controls exercised over the frontier region by China and the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, the number of Korean illegal immigrants entering 
China is steadily decreasing.  In accordance with the law, the Chinese Government guarantees 
the lawful rights and interests of foreign citizens within its territory.  Regardless of whether 
these people have entered the country in the normal fashion or have crossed the frontier 
illegally, their lawful rights and interests are equally protected under Chinese law.  With 
regard to the issue of the illegal entry into China of citizens of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, the Chinese Government invariably proceeds in an appropriate manner, 
consistent with both domestic and international law and in observance of humanitarian 
principles.  In this process, the Chinese police authorities enforce the law in an impartial 
manner and there are no cases of commissions being paid for the repatriation of citizens of the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea who have illegally entered China and been 
apprehended.  
 
66. The Chinese Government and the public security authorities always attach great 
importance to safeguarding the lawful rights and interests of women and children, and 
countering any kind of activities which infringe their rights and interests.  The authorities are 
moreover consistently working to crack down with severity on any illegal activities involving 
trafficking in women and children. 
 
67. The Government further stated that as of 2006, as a consequence of the increase in 
contacts between China and foreign countries, offences involving trafficking in women and 
children were starting to occur in China as well.  The Chinese public security authorities take 
this very seriously and have increased their preventive measures, taken stronger action to 
combat such offences, stepped up cooperation with police forces in all the other countries 
involved and cracked down with severity on Chinese and foreign offenders who traffic 
women and children.  Persons profiting from the abduction and trafficking of women and 
those involved in rape, ill-treatment and unlawful detention of others are charged, in 
accordance with the Chinese Criminal Code, with the offences of abducting and trafficking of 
women and children, rape, inflicting injury, unlawfully detaining others and other associated </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 17 
</p>
<p>offences.  At the same time, the authorities attach high importance to efforts to protect the 
rights and interests of victims, ensuring that they receive personal care and consideration, and 
are actively assisting foreign women and children who have been rescued from such abusive 
practices, with a view to ensure their personal safety and the physical and mental health of 
victims.

<p><b>Cyprus 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent  
</b> 
68. By letter dated 9 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences sent a letter of allegation 
to the Government of Cyprus to bring to its attention information concerning <b>the deportation 
of TS, a national of the Russian Federation</b>. According to information received: 
 
69. Ms. TS initially traveled to Cyprus in 2003 to work in a night-club in Larnaka. 
Reportedly Ms. TS was sexually abused by the owner of the club who also greatly limited her 
freedom of movement. She reportedly managed to escape from this situation of abuse and 
exploitation and went into hiding under the protection of the Russian Embassy. According to 
the information received, Ms TS filed a complaint for the abuse suffered with the police in 
2004. In addition, according to the Combating of Trafficking in Persons and Sexual 
Exploitation of Children Law of 2000, Ms TS should have qualified as a victim of trafficking 
and should have been entitled to protection and support as well as the possibility to retain her 
employment with another employer. The law furthermore provides for a Court of Ministers, 
which may appoint a &#8220;guardian of victims&#8221; to advise, counsel, and guide victims of 
exploitation; to hear complaints of exploitation; to investigate those complaints; to provide 
victims with treatment and safe residence; to take the steps necessary through the appropriate 
agencies to prosecute the offenders; to take rehabilitative measures, including victim 
reemployment or repatriation; and to identify any deficiency in the law to combat trafficking. 
According to the information received, however, Ms. TS was not provided with such 
assistance and was deported on 29 May, before her solicitor was able to present an appeal to 
Cypriot immigration authorities.  
 
70. The Special Rapporteur called the Government&#8217;s attention to the Trafficking Protocol, 
and also made reference to the OHCHR Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human 
Rights and Human Trafficking, and in particular to Guideline 2, which provided that states 
should ensure &#8220;that trafficked persons are not prosecuted for violations of immigration laws or 
for the activities they are involved in as a direct consequence of their situation as trafficked 
persons&#8221; and that &#8220;trafficked persons are not, in any circumstances, held in immigration 
detention or other forms of custody&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Response by the Government 
</b> 
71. By letter dated 26 October 2006, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur 
that Ms. TS initially arrived in Cyprus in November 2002 and not in 2003. As Ms. TS 
informed the Cyprus police, she had previously worked in Lebanon and Syria as an 
entertainer. During her stay in Cyprus, she was employed at the &#8220;N&#8221; night club, where, 
according to her complaint to the Cyprus Police on 3 June 2005, her employer attempted to 
force her into prostitution. As a result, she was forced to change employer and continued 
working in an unidentified night club in Limassol. Afterwards, Ms. TS traveled to her country </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 18 
</p>
<p>and returned to Cyprus on 15 November 2003, to work at the night club &#8220;C&#8221; in Larnaca when 
she was granted a work permit for three months, which permit was renewed on 19 May 2004. 
</p><p> 
72. On 22 March 2004 she married a British citizen and on 23 March 2004 she visited the 
British High Commission in Nicosia with her husband, and requested a visa to enter Great 
Britain. This request was refused because she was required to have stayed at least one year in 
Cyprus before being granted such a visa. Ms. TS then subsequently separated from her 
husband and took refuge at the Russian Church in Limassol. On 11 June 2006 her husband 
applied (application n&#176; 149/04) to the District Court of Lamaca for a divorce and on 9 June 
2006 the Court delivered its decision for divorce. 
 
73. During the above mentioned period, Ms. TS repeatedly applied to the Migration 
Officer for a work permit in other areas of activity and in early 2005 she applied to the 
Movement for Equality, Support and Anti-racism for assistance. On 26 April 2005 Ms. TS 
was informed by the Migration Officer that her request for a work permit was not accepted. 
On 3 June 2006 she complained to Larnaca Police that she was forced into prostitution by her 
employer at &#8220;C&#8221; night club, between 15 November and  22 March 2004. In her submission to 
the Police, Ms. TS provided inaccurate information and did not provide enough evidence for 
prosecution to be brought against her former employer. She also provided contradictory 
information regarding the submissions made by other people and did not reply adequately or 
provide certain necessary information to the Cypriot authorities. Furthermore, on 23 March 
2004, when asked by the Larnaca Police whether she had any complaint against her employer, 
her answer had been in the negative. 
 
74. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that after thorough investigation of 
the above case according to the relevant laws of the Republic of Cyprus and the European 
Union, as well as the international obligations of Cyprus vis-&#224;-vis the United Nations 
Conventions and with the involvement, inter alia, of the Office of the Attorney-General of the 
Republic of Cyprus, Ms. TS was deported to her country on 28 May 2006. It was noted that 
the complaints made by Ms. TS were given the necessary attention and were thoroughly 
investigated and that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus showed that it was and 
remained highly sensitive to issues concerning sexual abuses and trafficking in persons, 
especially of women and children.

bonus of RMB 2,000 RMB for every arrest of a suspected defector from the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea .  
 
79. The Special Rapporteur further urged the Government to seek clarification of the 
circumstances with a view to ensuring that the right to physical and mental integrity of the 
above-named person is protected. The Special Rapporteur further appealed to the Government 
to protect its citizens from all forms of trafficking, exploitation and abuse and called the its 
attention to the Trafficking Protocol. She also made reference to the OHCHR Recommended 
Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking as a useful, practical, and 
rights-based blueprint for interventions on the issue of trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b>Response by the Government

80. By letter dated 12 April 2006, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that 
in its view, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter had no relevance to genuine human rights and

de la trata de personas en el Ecuador</b>. 
 
82. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, en el a&#241;o 2004, el n&#250;mero de ciudadanos 
colombianos refugiados, solicitantes de asilo en el Ecuador, ascender&#237;a aproximadamente a 
44.800 personas. En a&#241;os recientes, el Gobierno ecuatoriano habr&#237;a implementado nuevas </p>

Page 20 
</p>
<p>restricciones para los colombianos que desean ingresar al pa&#237;s, as&#237; como para aqu&#233;llos que 
desean permanecer en &#233;l. 
</p><p> 
83. Los retos que enfrentar&#237;an los refugiados colombianos, los solicitantes de asilo y los 
migrantes les podr&#237;an poner en riesgo de ser objeto de tr&#225;fico hacia el Ecuador. Los factores 
que aumentar&#237;an el peligro de ser objeto de trata incluyen un aumento en las medidas de 
control en las fronteras recientemente implementadas por el Gobierno ecuatoriano, incluyendo 
la exigencia del pasado judicial para cruzar la frontera. El pasado judicial es un registro oficial 
de no tener historia criminal, emitido por las autoridades colombianas. Este documento ser&#237;a 
muy dif&#237;cil de obtener por las personas que viven en las zonas rurales de Colombia, ya que 
s&#243;lo se podr&#237;a obtener en las grandes zonas urbanas, donde les ser&#237;a dif&#237;cil y peligroso llegar. 
Adem&#225;s, ser&#237;a excesivamente costoso para los campesinos colombianos sin recursos, lo cual 
lo volver&#237;a inaccesible para ellos. 
 
84. En este sentido, el hecho de que los colombianos reaccionen ante este nuevo 
requerimiento cruzando la frontera en &#225;reas remotas en lugar de hacerlo en los sitios oficiales 
de cruce aumenta la preocupaci&#243;n de que se extienda la trata de personas. La presunta 
corrupci&#243;n entre las autoridades ecuatorianas, incluyendo oficiales de frontera, tambi&#233;n 
crear&#237;a un ambiente conducente a la trata de personas.  
 
85. Se informa del hecho de que los colombianos que ingresar&#237;an indocumentados al 
Ecuador generalmente evitar&#237;an registrarse para solicitar asilo. De todas maneras, incluso si 
cruzan la frontera con los documentos requeridos, muchos escoger&#237;an permanecer no 
registrados por el temor de que al hacer notoria su presencia en el Ecuador, ello atraer&#237;a 
represalias por parte de la guerrilla colombiana o de ciertos elementos paramilitares. 
 
86. Asimismo, si bien el permanecer indocumentados puede que les proteja de ser objeto 
de abusos por parte de los insurgentes, ir&#243;nicamente ello podr&#237;a volverles m&#225;s vulnerables a la 
explotaci&#243;n, incluyendo la trata de personas. La falta de estatus legal les dificultar&#237;a el poder 
denunciar a las autoridades ecuatorianas explotaciones o abusos de los cuales hayan sido 
objeto. Ello tambi&#233;n convertir&#237;a a los colombianos en un blanco para la trata de personas, ya 
que ser&#237;an controlados m&#225;s f&#225;cilmente por los traficantes. La reciente disminuci&#243;n del &#237;ndice 
de concesiones de asilo podr&#237;a exacerbar este problema, ya que los individuos a los que se les 
deniega el asilo pasar&#237;an a vivir en la sombra de la sociedad ecuatoriana, con la esperanza de 
no ser detectados por las autoridades. Ellos tambi&#233;n se tornar&#237;an presa f&#225;cil para los 
traficantes. 
 
87. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, los colombianos, especialmente las mujeres, se 
enfrentar&#237;an a una significativa discriminaci&#243;n dentro de Ecuador. Ello les obligar&#237;a a ingresar 
en la econom&#237;a informal, incluyendo el trabajo sexual. En muchas ocasiones, se ver&#237;an 
obligadas a buscar protecci&#243;n de hombres ecuatorianos, quienes a su vez frecuentemente las 
explotar&#237;an. Pueblos fronterizos, como Lago Agrio, tienen ya de por s&#237; un alto nivel de 
delincuencia y prostituci&#243;n, por lo que las mujeres y ni&#241;os colombianos frecuentemente 
terminar&#237;an como trabajadores sexuales. 
 
88. Precisamente en Lago Agrio se constata un elevado n&#250;mero de ni&#241;os no acompa&#241;ados. 
Se informa de que existe un orfanato en ese lugar, pero solamente podr&#237;an ingresar los ni&#241;os 
menores de 12 a&#241;os. Los ni&#241;os mayores ser&#237;an entregados a familias de la zona y se volver&#237;an 
vulnerables a abusos.

</p>
<p>89. Se informa del hecho de que los ni&#241;os colombianos tendr&#237;an dificultades para recibir 
educaci&#243;n a causa de la discriminaci&#243;n o por los costos prohibitivos de la educaci&#243;n. Como 
resultado, frecuentemente dejar&#237;an de estudiar y se pondr&#237;an a trabajar para ayudar a mantener 
a sus familias. Ello tambi&#233;n les tornar&#237;a vulnerables a la trata de personas.

Transnacional y en particular su art&#237;culo 6, denominado &#8220;Asistencia y protecci&#243;n a las

Principios y Directrices recomendados sobre los derechos humanos y la trata de personas, y 
en particular el Principio 9 que establece que se proporcionar&#225; asistencia jur&#237;dica y de otra 
&#237;ndole a las v&#237;ctimas de la trata de personas mientras duren las acciones penales, civiles o de

violence against women, its causes and consequences, sent an urgent appeal concerning Ms. 
<b>TB, a German citizen of Turkish descent</b>.  
 
93. According to information received, Ms. TB is a German citizen from Hamburg. In 
April 2006, she travelled with her mother from Hamburg to the settlement of Karastlak K&#246;y&#252; 
in the village of Yeni Halfeti, Sanliurfa province, southeast Turkey, where her grandmother 
and other relatives reside. Allegedly, her family had pretended that she was going on vacation 
to the village. Upon Ms. TB&#8217;s arrival in the village, however, her mother took her passport 
and identity documents and told her that she had to enter into an arranged marry with a close 
relative. According to the latest information received at the time this communication was sent, 
Ms. TB was still in Yeni Halfeti. Reportedly, she faced serious limitations on her freedom of 
movement and was only on rare occasions able to leave her grandmother&#8217;s house. Concern 
was expressed that Ms. TB might have been forced to marry her relative against her will or 
face severe violence, if she refused. The Special Rapporteur had appealed to the Government 
to intervene in this case and ensure that the competent Turkish authorities undertake all 
necessary action to protect Ms. TB from forced marriage, any form of violence or the threat 
thereof.

<b>the trafficking of newborn infants from Bulgaria to Greece</b>. 
 
97. According to information received, it was alleged that pregnant women, most of them 
from the Roma community in the region of Burgas in eastern Bulgaria, and many of them 
unemployed and living in harsh conditions, are induced by members of organized crime to go 
to work to Greece. They are promised employment and good salaries, but actually end up in 
small cities throughout Greece where they are held together in apartments for the remainder 
of their pregnancy before delivering at local hospitals where, with the complicity of doctors, 
midwives and other hospital staff, their newborn babies are taken away from them and sold by 
organized crime members with the assistance of lawyers for up to 30,000 Euros. It is alleged 
that after having given birth in Greece, the women are sent back to their hometowns in 
Bulgaria and receive 1,000 Euros per child.  
 
98. Reports also alleged that little progress had been made by Greek and Bulgarian 
authorities in investigating such trafficking and sale of children taking place between the two 
countries. It was further reported that the complex and lengthy procedures for legal adoption 
in Greece might have led to an increase in instances of trafficking and sale of children. 
 
99. Finally, the Special Rapporteur called on the Government, in the event that the its 
investigations supported the above allegations or suggested them to be correct, to take all 
necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned persons 
are respected and the accountability of any persons guilty of the alleged violations ensured. 
The Special Rapporteur also requested that the Government adopt effective measures to 
prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p><b>Response by the Government 
</b>100. By letter dated 18 August 2006, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that 
in Greece, adoptions are governed by Law 2447/1990 on &#8220;Adoption, supervision and 
sponsorship of minors, judicial attendance, judicial diligence of other&#8217;s affairs; relevant 
substantial, procedural and transitory provisions&#8221;, as well as articles 1542 to 1588 of the Civil 
Code, wherein the terms, conditions and procedures for the legal adoption of minors by Greek 
nationals are laid down. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 23 
</p>
<p>101. In brief, legal adoption comprises the following stages: Prospective adopting parents, 
either through the competent social services or directly with no intermediaries, come in 
contact with the natural parents of the child to be adopted and obtain the latter&#8217;s consent for 
the prospective adoption. Thereafter, the competent social services conduct an investigation, 
focused on the child&#8217;s best interests and draw up a report based on its findings. Finally, the 
competent Court, after an application filed by the adopting parents, having taken into 
consideration the said report and any other information it may have, again basing itself 
primarily on the child&#8217;s best interests, gives approval for the adoption to take place. 
</p><p> 
102. Considering all the relevant legal regulations which determine a purely administrative 
act, only the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3, art. 10, Law 2447/96 have a criminal, and 
therefore, police interest. The said provisions stipulate imprisonment or incarceration 
penalties, depending on the regularity of perpetration, against the person(s) who give(s) away 
his/her/their child for adoption, or any other intermediate person(s) who act with the aim of 
gaining unfair benefits. By virtue of such provisions which criminalize a specific form of 
adoption, police authorities have been assigned the task of combating illegal adoptions and 
certifying the related crimes. 
 
103. According to the statistics on illegal adoptions kept by the Directorate of Public 
Safety, Hellenic Police Headquarters, the following cases have been dealt with by the relevant 
Services: in 2002, there were 8 offenders (5 Bulgarian and 3 Greek nationals) and 1 victim 
(Bulgarian); in 2003, there were no cases; In 2004, there were 8 cases concerning 22 
offenders (16 Bulgarian and 6 Greek nationals) and 8 infants (7 Bulgarians and 1 Greek); in 
2005, there was 1 case concerning 4 offenders (3 Bulgarian nationals and 1 of unknown 
particulars), and one infant (Bulgarian); up to 6 April 2006, there were 7 cases concerning 27 
offenders (20 Bulgarian, 2 Albanian and 5 Greek nationals), and 7 infants (6 Bulgarians and 
1 Albanian). 
 
104. As can be seen from the above statistics, all cases involved Bulgarian nationals, both 
as offenders and victims. Competent police authorities are aware of the places (Bulgarian 
cities) where pregnant Bulgarian women are recruited, the modus operandi, and the routes 
followed in order to enter Greece. In an effort to combat such criminal activities, the Hellenic 
Police Headquarters is cooperating with its Bulgarian counterpart which has yielded 
significant results during the last two years: 
 
</p>
<p>- Information exchange mechanisms have improved; 
- Fruitful cooperation of liaison officers of the competent Police Authorities  of 
</p>
<p>the two sides has been attained; 
- In cases of large-scale investigation, operational officers of both sides meet in 
</p>
<p>order to eradicate criminal groups.

<p><b>Communication sent  
</b> 
105. On 13 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, sent a letter of allegation concerning 
<b>the trafficking and sexual exploitation of Nepalese girls in brothels in Calcutta and 
Mumbai, India</b>.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 24 
</p>
<p> 
106. According to information received, Nepalese girls, of an average age of 14 to 16 years, 
are trafficked from Nepal to brothels in Calcutta and Mumbai where they are required to work 
as prostitutes in slavery-like conditions. The girls are trafficked against their will and without 
knowledge of their destination. The traffickers are reported to be Nepalese men and women, 
who sell the girls to (Nepalese) brothel owners in Calcutta and Mumbai, at a price of 
approximately 60,000 to 70,000 Indian rupees (US$ 1,360-1,590) in Calcutta and 100,000 to 
120,000 Indian rupees (US$ 2,270- 2,720) in Mumbai. There is no evidence of extensive 
networks of traffickers of Nepalese women and girls, and trafficking seems to take place 
though an informal network with the collaboration of community members, employers, local 
officials, border officials and others such as those who operate &#8216;safe houses&#8217;  where trafficked 
girls are kept prior to their sale.   
 
107. Initially the girls are not taken to the brothels directly, but given some time to adjust to 
their new situation, in outside homes, sometimes owned by the brothel owner. After being 
told about the work that is required of them, how to dress and behave and after being 
convinced that they themselves, or their families, have incurred a debt which they will have to 
pay off by working as a prostitute after which they are &#8216;free&#8217; to leave, the girls are put to work 
as <i>tsukri</i> (the Bengali word for a child in slavery or debt bondage).  
 
108. When they start to work as <i>tsukris</i>, the girls are usually aged between 15 to 18 years. 
They often work in brothels that are referred to as &#8216;bungalows&#8217;: brothels that occupy a flat, 
usually on the first or higher floors of a building, often with a shop on the ground floor. The 
bungalow is distinguished by a channel gate (a sliding iron accordion gate) at the entrance to 
the brothel. When locked, the channel gate is virtually impenetrable; making escape from the 
brothel impossible for the <i>tsukris</i> kept inside. The area within Calcutta that contains most 
bungalow-type brothels with <i>tsukris</i> is Sonagachi; whereas in Mumbai brothels with <i>tsukris</i> 
can be found mainly in Kamathipura, although due to police raids these types of brothels are 
said to have moved to other cities in India or areas outside the known brothel areas.  
 
109. It is reported that while clients of the brothels do not have a specific preference for 
<i>tsukris</i>, they do have a preference for girls between 15 and 20, which in turn creates a demand 
for children. Under the <i>tsukri</i> system the brothel owner retains all of the fees paid by clients 
for the services provided to them by the <i>tsukris</i>. Considerable profits accrue from the use of 
the <i>tsukri</i> system: brothel owners are said to earn four to twenty times the purchase price of 
the <i>tsukri</i> over the period of her servitude. The money that the trafficker earns is relatively 
insignificant compared to the large amount that the purchaser (brothel owner) earns.  
 
110. The initial purchase price is recovered by the brothel owner, on average, in little over 
five and a half months. A Nepalese <i>tsukri</i> is also said to cost less than an Indian <i>tsukri</i> and 
because of continued client demand for Nepalese girls, the returns are higher. On occasions, 
the brothel owner may also offer &#8220;special services&#8221; such as a <i>tsukri&#8217;s</i> virginity or oral or anal 
sex as well as sex without a condom, at a special price. The total period the girls spend in 
confinement as <i>tsukris</i> varies from two to ten years.          
 
111. After being released from this situation, it is often very difficult for <i>tsukris</i> to go back 
to Nepal. They fear isolation and reprisal from family and community members. Many of 
them take up work as free-agent women in prostitution, earning their own fees by doing street 
prostitution or paying tenancy to brothel owners. Escape prior to being released is not only 
very difficult because the girls are kept in confinement; there is also fear of being brought </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 25 
</p>
<p>back to the brothels, either by police or other community members followed by severe 
physical punishment, as well as a more general fear of &#8216;India outside&#8217; since few <i>tsukris</i> have a 
clear idea of where they are, cannot speak the language and are easily recognized as 
foreigners.  
 
112. The Special Rapporteur called the Government&#8217;s attention to the Trafficking Protocol, 
with specific reference to its article 6, 7 and 8, entitled &#8220;Assistance to and protection of 
victims of trafficking in persons&#8221;, &#8220;Status of victims of trafficking in persons in receiving 
States&#8221; and &#8220;Repatriation of victims of trafficking in persons&#8221; respectively. The Special 
Rapporteur also made reference to OHCHR Recommended Principles and Guidelines on 
Human Rights and Human Trafficking, and in particular to paragraph 7 of the Recommended 
Principles which states that trafficked persons shall not be detained, charged or prosecuted for 
the illegality of their entry into or residence in countries of transit and destination, or for their 
involvement in unlawful activities to the extent that such involvement is a direct consequence 
of their situation as trafficked persons. The Special Rapporteur further recalled Guidelines 6 
and 8 which refer to the protection and support for trafficked persons and to special measures 
for the protection and support of child victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication sent  
</b> 
113. On 15 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning <b>the sale of children in Talwara migrant camp in Jammu and Kashmir</b>.  
 
114. According to the allegations received, children in the Talwara migrant camp in Jammu 
and Kashmir are sold to work as labourers and domestic workers by their parents who are 
living in circumstances of extreme poverty. Even if both parents work, there is not enough 
money within the family to feed all family members so that these children are sold, sometimes 
for a fixed period of time. Allegedly, over 200 children had already been sold or mortgaged in 
this manner for a few thousand Indian rupees, at the time this communication was sent. The 
reported asking price for children aged nine years old is 8,000 Indian rupees, 10,000 Indian 
rupees for a thirteen year old, and 15,000 Indian rupees for an older teenager.  
 
115. It is also reported that one of the residents of the camp, Ms. KD, had been forced to 
sell three of her daughters for 20,000 Indian rupees, in order to feed her other two daughters. 
Another camp resident, Ms. TD, agreed to sell her son for 8,000 Indian rupees but never 
received the money and a month and a week later her son&#8217;s dead body was found. Mr. PS 
claimed that he had mortgaged three daughters at the end of 2005 for 3,000 Indian rupees 
each and was forced to sell a fourth in March because of acute poverty.  
 
116. It is further reported that the issue of children being sold was brought to the Jammu 
and Kashmir State government&#8217;s attention after a demonstration by several hundred migrant 
workers. A four member Committee, headed by Lal Singh, Congress Member of Parliament, 
was delegated on 29 March 2006 to investigate the allegations. Apparently, testifying before 
the panel, the children claimed to have been working as domestic help or in the stores of their 
&#8216;buyers&#8217; voluntarily. The &#8216;buyers&#8217; claimed to pay the children&#8217;s parents 1,500 to 2,000 Indian 
rupees per month, apart from expenses incurred by them for the education, food and clothes of 
the children.  
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 26 
</p>
<p>117. It was further reported that entry into the Talwara camp was allegedly obstructed for 
the duration of the committee investigation. Following the investigations, Jammu and 
Kashmir Chief Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad denied that children were being sold. It is alleged 
that the President of the Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party, Bhim Singh, had 
offered to buy back the sold children and to return them to their parents.    
</p><p> 
118. The Special Rapporteur suggested that, in the event that the Government&#8217;s 
investigations support the above allegations or suggest them to be correct, the Government 
take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned 
person are respected and the accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations 
ensured. The Special Rapporteur also requested that the Government adopt effective measures 
to prevent the recurrence of these acts.

<p><b>Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent  
</b> 
119. On 21 November 2006 the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, sent a letter of allegation to the 
Government regarding the situation of <b>MJ, a minor of between 11 and 15 years of age, of 
Guinean nationality</b>, who was reportedly trafficked to Israel and who had been detained in a 
detention facility run by the Immigration Police in Hadera since May 2006. 
 
120. According to the information received, MJ is a victim of trafficking who, together 
with other Guinean citizens, was brought to Israel by Mr. BB. The trafficked victims had paid 
Mr. BB a considerable amount of money to take them to Israel and to ensure their legal entry, 
as well as a permit to stay and work in Israel. It is reported that some of the victims were 
arrested at the border while others, including MJ, managed to cross the border and enter 
Israel. Those who did manage to enter, however, were then forced into exploitative labour 
conditions and threatened with remaining without food or money for their work if they did not 
do as they were told. Some were also threatened that they would be reported to the police who 
would then detain them for not having the necessary legal papers. MJ was forced to work by 
Mr. BB and was not paid for his work.  
 
121. Israeli authorities, upon receipt of information on Mr. BB&#8217;s activities in this regard, 
arrested him and had him prosecuted for several trafficking-related offences. Mr. BB was 
convicted on 11 July 2006 and sentenced to 2 years in prison by the Magistrate Court in Tel 
Aviv. No steps were, however, taken to assist the trafficking victims concerned.  
 
122. MJ was arrested by the Immigration Police on 11 May 2006, and detention and 
deportation orders were issued against him. However, since he is an unaccompanied minor 
and since Israel has no diplomatic relations with Guinea, it is alleged that he could not be 
deported, as travel documents could not be arranged for him.  
 
123. At the time this communication was sent, MJ was being held in a detention facility in 
Hadera run by the Immigration Police. In this facility minors are held separately from adult 
detainees. The only personnel in the detention center, however, are Immigration Police 
officers. There are no psychologists, welfare workers or other professionals who are trained to 
deal with the special needs of children. Many of the children are reportedly trafficking 
victims, and some of them are refugees or asylum seekers. MJ was being held with other </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 27 
</p>
<p>unaccompanied minors and was locked in his cell most hours of the day. He was only allowed 
four hours a day to go out. No education services are available at the detention centre. An 
English teacher had started giving the children lessons in English. However, after two months 
the teacher stopped working and lessons were terminated.  
</p><p> 
124. A non-governmental organization had sought to provide MJ with an alternative 
arrangement and managed to find an adult who was willing to let MJ stay with him. A request 
to release him in the care of this person was filed on 3 September 2006. The Detention 
Administrative Tribunal denied this request arguing that there was no reason to release MJ, 
since he was being detained in a facility intended for the detention for minors. On 23 October 
2006, the Administrative Tribunal again denied an appeal to release him and confirmed that 
that there was still no progress concerning the possibility to send him back to his country. The 
Tribunal decided to send MJ for psychiatric evaluation after he started crying and threatened 
to hurt himself if he was sent again to the detention facility. The psychiatrist who examined 
him found that there was no reason to have him committed to a psychiatric facility. MJ was 
then sent back to the detention facility in Hadera, where he remained in detention at the time 
this communication had been sent.  
 
125. Whilst commending the Government for prosecuting Mr. BB for charges of trafficking 
related offences, concern was expressed for the welfare of MJ as a victim of trafficking and 
especially since he is believed to be a minor. Concern was further expressed that the 
authorities had not provided MJ, and other trafficking victims, with the assistance required by 
internationally accepted norms and standards for victims of trafficking which could include 
medical, psychological and legal assistance, including the facilitation of safe repatriation or 
alternatively proper reintegration into Israeli society, in accordance with, inter alia, the 
Trafficking Protocol, in particular its article 6 (paragraphs 3 and 4).   
 
126. The Special Rapporteur further suggested that, in the event that the Government&#8217;s 
investigations support the above allegations or suggest them to be correct, the Government 
take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned 
person are respected. The Special Rapporteur also requested that the Government adopt 
effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.

</p>
<p><b>Response by the Government 
</b>131. By letter of 26 June 2006 the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that its 
present reply was to be read in conjunction with Italy&#8217;s reply to the relevant list of issues 
submitted by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in Spring 2006, as well as its previous 
reply to the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants concerning foreign 
minors in reception centres. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that regarding 
the legislative framework, apart from the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
Government referred to national legislation, especially Act No. 39/90 on the basis of which 
Italian authorities launched a comprehensive policy on immigration, which laid down inter 
alia the principle of the programming of migratory flows and which also envisaged 
administrative procedures for the entry and stay of foreigners in Italy. Moreover, certain legal 
Acts, including the so-called &#8220;Bossi-Fini Law&#8221; (Act No.189/02), had a two-fold aim to 
propose a pattern of social integration for foreigners and to ensure the implementation of ad 
hoc measures for the protection of and support for children, while respecting their dignity and 
their rights, in the cases both of children of foreign parents and children awarded to foreign 
adults. In this regard, it is worth recalling the following measures: Act No.40/98; Legislative 
Decree No.113/99; Presidential Decree DPR 5 August 1998; Legislative Decree No. 113/99; 
Presidential Decree No. 394/99; DPCM No. 535/99; Act No. 189/02 and its following 
amendments. 
 
132. The Government further informed the Special Rapporteur that in the year 2004, about 
1,200 minors arrived in Italy, 900 of whom were received in reception centres. In 2005, the 
number of minors received was about 1,000 from different nationalities (Romanians, 
Moldovans, Africans and &#8211; although fewer than in the past &#8211; Albanians). Two important facts </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 29 
</p>
<p>were recorded: an increase in unauthorized removals of these minors from the first assistance 
centres and an increase in episodes of abuse of both males and females on the territory of the 
municipality of Rome. 
</p><p> 
133. Within this framework, the Government referred to the issue of children involved in 
unlawful activities such as begging. The vast majority of children involved in begging are 
from communities of Slav origin, as well as illegal minor immigrants from Morocco, from 
Romania, from Albania, who are generally based in Northern Italy. The majority of these 
children are exposed to illegal activities, including sexual exploitation, under the threat of 
battery and forced into slavery.  
 
134. In this context the Government explained that action taken to prevent the exploiters 
was not always effective because of difficulties encountered, including the hostility of the 
families of the children, their lack of stability or even the very lack of a house for the children 
in case of imposition of the measure to &#8220;stay home&#8221;. Last but not least, very often the minors 
manage to escape from these centres. 
 
135. As to the eradication of begging related activities, some specific preventive and 
repressive measures had been issued: First, the Memo No. 123/A3_/130/3/52/2003 on 
cooperation among police and social service providers;  Second,  a specific memo was also 
adopted in order to effectively enforce Act. No.228/03. Furthermore, on 19 June 2003, an ad 
hoc Protocol between the Romanian Government, the Local Council of Bucharest and the 
Prefecture of Turin had been adopted in order to facilitate the repatriation of Romanian 
children who are victims of exploitation. 
 
136. At the practical level, it is worth mentioning the intervention carried out by the Rome 
crime squad. Upon being called by the relevant local authorities that had been contacted 
directly by citizens, the Rome crime squad launched an operation called &#8220;Flowers in the 
mud&#8221;. The outcome of their investigations led to the adoption of several detention measures, 
especially against paedophiles. In particular there was evidence of approximately 200 Roma 
children who had been forced into begging and prostitution. 
 
137. As a result of its investigations, on January 2006 the responsible judicial authorities 
issued 20 decrees for pre-trial detention, 18 measures for the search of persons and of 
premises. In May 2006, pre-trial proceedings were in course. In particular, children victims of 
abuse were hosted in &#8220;the Rome centre against begging&#8221;, representing a unique experience in 
the Italian scenario because this is the only centre providing ad hoc psychological care 
services. 
 
138. As to the number of Romanian minors, victims of sexual exploitation in Italy and with 
specific regard to the municipality of Rome, the Government provided the following 
information: in the first semester 2005, 497 non-accompanied minors registered; place of 
origin: Bucharest, Calarasi, Craiova, Galasi, Iasi; crimes: theft, drug trafficking, begging, 
prostitution. The Government further informed the Special Rapporteur that the Council Office

undertook many initiatives in this respect, amongst the minors: 
 
- The establishment of a Working Group on The Issue Of Foreign Non-accompanied 
</p>
<p>Minors; </p>

<p>- The PALMS project led by the Municipality of Rome together with the cities of Turin, 
Milan, Bologna and Ancona &#8211; which focused on the implementation of pre-reception 
services; 
</p>
<p>- An educational project aimed at the integration into second-reception structures; 
- An initiative, started in 2005, targeted young girls victims of sexual exploitation and 
</p>
<p>which, to date, had provided assistance to 1,212 victims (of both Romanian and 
Moldovan nationality). 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>139. Within this framework, the Government made reference to the uninterrupted flow of 
nomads. At present, local authorities were engaged in several initiatives devoted to the 
integration of minors in this regard; the regularization of Roma communities; and the 
facilitation of access to the labour market. Along these lines, the following proposals or 
initiatives were in the pipeline at the time this reply was received: 
 
- A proposal for summer leisure activities for Roma minors; 
- A project of access to education for nomad minors. From 1999-2000 through 2003-

<p>2004, the number of Roma students increased progressively, going from 1,161 to  
2,157. 
</p>
<p>- Projects for vocational courses for the Roma community and for cultural mediators to 
be included in the penitentiary personnel. 
</p>
<p>- GIPSY 2000/2002, an initiative devoted to the Roma people who suffer from drug 
addiction. 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>140. The Government further mentioned the relevant NGOs that are operating in Rome. It 
also provided additional information on the situation of the Roma community in Rome and 
especially Roma children in Italy, and on specific attention given to Roma Children in the

<p><b>Communication sent  
</b> 
141. On 17 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, sent an urgent appeal <b>concerning the 
alleged trafficking of over 60 women and girls from various Central Asian countries</b>.  
 
142. According to information received, on 14 February 2006, Kyrgyz security forces 
reportedly removed more than 60 women and girls from a plane in the southern city of Osh, 
which was about to transport the women concerned to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), 
allegedly for the purpose of sexual exploitation. The women and girls, aged between 17 and 
38 - including 58 Uzbek nationals, one Tajik, one Kyrgyz and one Turkmen - were smuggled 
into Osh in small groups in early February 2006 and were kept in private apartments prior to 
the flight. They had passed through passport and customs control at Osh airport and were 
sitting on an aircraft preparing to leave for Sharjah in the UAE when they were intercepted 
and taken to a detention centre in the city. The basis for detaining the group was illegal 
crossing of the border and violation of Kyrgyz migration rules. However, the head of the 
regional office of the Kyrgyz National Security Service (NSS) reportedly declared &quot;We have 
evidence that all the girls were being trafficked, with trafficking gangs supposed to meet them 
in the Emirates.&quot;  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 31 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>143. Sources estimate that 4,000 women and girls are trafficked annually from or through 
Kyrgyzstan for purposes of sexual exploitation.  Traffickers recruit young women mainly 
from rural areas in Central Asia promising them jobs as waitresses, nannies, cooks, 
saleswomen and dancers in the UAE or other countries. Upon arrival in the destination 
country, the women are forced to prostitute themselves. Debt bondage is very often used to 
subdue the women and perpetuate their exploitation.  
 
144. Osh has reportedly become a regional transit hub for the trafficking of Central Asian 
women, especially Uzbek and Tajik women. Uzbek women are increasingly trafficked via 
Kyrgyzstan because of stricter exit controls at Uzbek airports, which aim to curb trafficking. 
Sources also allege that some Kyrgyz law enforcement officials collaborate with the 
traffickers. 
 
145. The Special Rapporteur called the Government&#8217;s attention to the Trafficking Protocol, 
and suggested that, in the event that the Government&#8217;s investigations support the above 
allegations or suggest them to be correct, the Government take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned persons are respected and 
accountability of any persons guilty of the alleged violations ensured. The Special Rapporteur 
also requested that the Government adopt effective measures to prevent the recurrence of 
these acts.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government 
</b> 
146. On 24 March 2006, the Government replied to the communication of 17 February 
2006. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that, as part of measures taken to 
block trans-border channels for trafficking in persons, the National Security Service (SNB) of 
the Kyrgyz Republic on 14 February 2006 stopped 60 citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan, 
1 Turkmen citizen and 1 Kyrgyz citizen from traveling on an Osh-Al-Fujairah (UAE) charter 
flight from Osh airport.  The grounds for detaining the citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan 
were violations of the regulations on staying in and crossing the State border of the Kyrgyz 
Republic. 
 
147. It was established in the course of the investigation that the above individuals were 
being taken for subsequent sale into sexual slavery by organizers of people trafficking.  The 
average age of most of the girls due to be flying out to the UAE was in fact 15-30 years.  It 
has to be pointed out that virtually all the Uzbekistan citizens heading to the Emirates were 
voluntarily going to engage in prostitution to solve their material and social problems. 
 
148. As of 15 February of this year, after filtering work, the decision was taken by the 
Kyrgyz SNB investigative group to gradually deport and hand over 52 of the detained citizens 
of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the one Turkmen citizen, who had entered the territory of 
Kyrgyzstan from Uzbekistan, to the Uzbekistan SNB Border Troops. Note was taken of the 
use by three Uzbek citizens of forged passports, as well as the discovery on yet another three 
citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan of forged passports and fragments of false passports of 
the Kyrgyz Republic.  On 17 February 2006 the Kyrgyz SNB Investigative Department 
initiated a criminal case based on evidence of offences under articles of the Criminal Code of 
the Kyrgyz Republic. However, taking into account the fact that four of the above-mentioned 
citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan were victims of labour trafficking, on 21 February 
2006 they were transferred to the custody of the Osh representative office of the International </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 32 
</p>
<p>Organization for Migration (IOM). Furthermore, as it was established that one of the 
organizers and links of the trans-border channel of people trafficking and illegal migration of 
citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan are representatives of tourist firms, criminal 
proceedings were also brought against them pursuant to the Criminal Code of the Kyrgyz 
Republic. 
 
149. With a view to the implementation of the National Plan of Action for Gender Equality 
in the Kyrgyz Republic, the National Security Service of the Republic is carrying out work to 
prevent and reduce gender violence in society, prohibit trafficking in persons, and also to 
afford protection and support for victims of trafficking and to raise public awareness of the 
problem of violence. In particular, from 2004 up to the present, the Kyrgyz SNB had initiated 
10 criminal cases in relation to such offences and was conducting preventive and educational 
work through the mass media, as well as cooperating closely with IOM to release from forced 
detention citizens of the Kyrgyz Republic in countries abroad. 
<b> 
Communication sent  
 
</b>150. On 23 November 2006 the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
submitted a letter of allegation to the Government regarding the <b>increasing widespread 
practice of &#8220;bride-kidnapping&#8221;</b>, whereby a woman or girl is taken against her will through 
deception or force and forced to marry one of her abductors.   
 
151. Sources alleged that the abductors are often intoxicated and act in groups, using 
physical or psychological coercion to compel the woman to &#8220;agree&#8221; to the marriage. These 
marriages are reportedly rarely registered with the State. Instead, a Muslim cleric conducts the 
ceremony or the occasion is privately celebrated.  It was further alleged that kidnapped 
women are often raped by their abductors, but fail to report the crime for fear of 
repercussions. The abductions occur in all parts of Kyrgyzstan, both urban and rural.  The 
women involved are typically under the age of 25. Some victims are also minors. Despite the 
fact that Article 155 of the Criminal Code, outlaws non-consensual marriage by force or 
kidnapping, it is reported that the perpetrators are typically not prosecuted for the crime and 
enjoy impunity for the sexual abuse and exploitation that is committed.  The Special 
Rapporteur was also informed that the police often fail to investigate reported cases of bride 
kidnapping.  Sources stated that many police officers do not view bride-kidnapping as an 
issue for law enforcement, but consider it to be a legitimate traditional practice. 
 
152. The Special Rapporteur called the Government&#8217;s attention to the Trafficking Protocol, 
and suggested that, in the event that the Government&#8217;s investigations support the above 
allegations or suggest them to be correct, the Government take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned persons are respected and the 
accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations ensured. The Special Rapporteur 
also requested that the Government adopt effective measures to prevent the recurrence of 
these acts.

<p>153. Le 8 ao&#251;t 2006,  le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la 
vente d'enfants, la prostitution d'enfants et la pornographie impliquant des enfants, et le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la violence contre les femmes, ses causes et ses cons&#233;quences, a 
envoy&#233; un appel urgent concernant la situation de plusieurs personnes qui seraient maintenues 
en esclavage en Mauritanie. 
 
154. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, six enfants et deux femmes seraient maintenus en 
esclavage et r&#233;partis dans les foyers respectifs d&#8217;<b>AOS</b> et d&#8217;<b>EHOS</b>, deux fr&#232;res, &#224; Nwar, 
d&#233;partement de Tidkikja, dans la r&#233;gion du Tagant. Les personnes retenues dans le foyer 
d&#8217;AOS seront les suivantes : <b>S</b>, une jeune fille de 20 ans ; <b>OL</b> qui a environ 15 ans (et qui est 
orpheline de m&#232;re) ; <b>S</b>, 10 ans (orphelin de m&#232;re), inscrit &#224; l'&#233;cole mais qui, selon le 
t&#233;moignage de son ma&#238;tre d'&#233;cole, serait fr&#233;quemment absent car il serait retenu par ses 
ma&#238;tres et enfin <b>T</b> et <b>F</b>, respectivement 5 et 6 ans (deux fillettes orphelines de m&#232;re). Le foyer 
d&#8217;EHOS retiendrait <b>O</b>, une femme d'environ 70 ans ainsi que deux gar&#231;ons, <b>EKOM</b> qui a 13 
ans ainsi que <b>BOM</b>, &#226;g&#233; d'environ 16 ans. 
 
155. Dans cette affaire, une organisation non-gouvernementale (ONG) qui lutte contre 
l'esclavage aurait &#233;t&#233; confront&#233;e &#224; l'opposition des autorit&#233;s, dont le gouverneur adjoint de la 
r&#233;gion du Tagant qui l'aurait accus&#233;e de cr&#233;er de faux probl&#232;mes et de politiser les faits. Le 
procureur de la R&#233;publique aurait quant &#224; lui d&#233;clar&#233; que &#171; l'esclavage n'existe pas et ceux qui 
pr&#233;tendent le contraire peuvent &#234;tre passibles de poursuites judiciaires &#187; avant de se rendre 
dans les foyers o&#249; seraient retenues les personnes susmentionn&#233;es. Apr&#232;s son intervention, 
seule une vieille femme aurait &#233;t&#233; lib&#233;r&#233;e du foyer d&#8217;EHOS. 
 
156. Dans le cadre de diff&#233;rentes actions men&#233;es pour parvenir &#224; la lib&#233;ration de personnes 
tenues en  situation d'esclavage, il ressort que cette ONG obtiendrait des r&#233;sultats plus ou 
moins efficaces selon la r&#233;gion du pays dans laquelle elle agit. Dans cette r&#233;gion du Tagant o&#249; 
seraient retenues les personnes susmentionn&#233;es et o&#249; les militants anti-esclavagistes seraient 
accus&#233;s, entre autres, de nuire &#224; l'image du pays, un sentiment d'impunit&#233; r&#232;gnerait et 
l'esclavagisme demeurerait. En effet, les autorit&#233;s charg&#233;es de l'application des lois 
refuseraient souvent de reconna&#238;tre des situations d'esclavage. En Mauritanie, la possibilit&#233; 
d'une &#233;radication de ce fl&#233;au d&#233;pendrait surtout de la volont&#233; des autorit&#233;s administratives et 
judiciaires d'appliquer la l&#233;gislation nationale et les normes internationales dans leur pays. 
 
157. Cette pratique serait apparemment tol&#233;r&#233;e alors que les droits &#224; la libert&#233;, &#224; l'&#233;galit&#233; et 
&#224; la dignit&#233; de tous les citoyens sont proclam&#233;s dans le pr&#233;ambule de la Constitution de 1991. 
De plus, en 1981, &#224; la suite de la publication d'une ordonnance, l'esclavage a &#233;t&#233; aboli en 
Mauritanie. Cependant, aucune loi d&#8217;application de ce texte n&#8217;aurait &#233;t&#233; vot&#233;e afin de parvenir 
&#224; une abolition effective. L&#8217;ordonnance, qui proclame l'ill&#233;galit&#233; de l'esclavage, n'en donne 
pas de d&#233;finition pr&#233;cise et ne l'&#233;rige pas non plus en infraction p&#233;nale. Il ressort de cette 
constatation que la suppression de l'esclavage d&#233;pendrait aussi de la volont&#233; des autorit&#233;s 
politiques qui ont le pouvoir de prendre de r&#233;elles mesures pour parvenir &#224; l'abolition de cette 
pratique. 
 
158. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a invit&#233; le Gouvernement &#224; prendre toutes les mesures 
n&#233;cessaires pour assurer la protection des droits et des libert&#233;s des individus mentionn&#233;s, de 
diligenter des enqu&#234;tes sur les violations qui auraient &#233;t&#233; perp&#233;tr&#233;es et de traduire les 
responsables en justice. De plus, elle a pri&#233; le Gouvernement d&#8217;adopter, le cas &#233;ch&#233;ant, toutes 
les mesures n&#233;cessaires pour pr&#233;venir la r&#233;p&#233;tition des faits mentionn&#233;s. </p>

<p><b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement

159. Le 30 octobre 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; la communication, en affirmant que 
le D&#233;partement de la justice a diligent&#233; une enqu&#234;te d&#232;s que les all&#233;gations de la lettre ont &#233;t&#233; 
port&#233;es &#224; sa connaissance. Cette enqu&#234;te a &#233;t&#233; men&#233;e sous la direction du procureur de la 
R&#233;publique territorialement comp&#233;tent, assist&#233; par la gendarmerie. L&#8217;enqu&#234;te a r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; que les 
all&#233;gations avanc&#233;es n&#8217;&#233;taient pas fond&#233;es et que, par cons&#233;quent, il ne s&#8217;agissait nullement de 
cas d&#8217;esclavage. Les personnes cit&#233;es dans la communication sont des citoyens libres qui ne 
souffrent d&#8217;aucune forme de discrimination ni de contraintes. Elles ne se plaignent de rien et 
sont libres d&#8217;aller et venir l&#224; o&#249; elles le d&#233;sirent. Dans un souci de transparence, le procureur 
de la R&#233;publique a associ&#233; &#224; l&#8217;enqu&#234;te des repr&#233;sentants de l&#8217;ONG qui est &#224; l&#8217;origine cette 
affaire.  
 
160. Pour ce qui est de la question relative &#224; la l&#233;gislation en vigueur, le Gouvernement a 
estim&#233; qu&#8217;il y avait lieu de faire les pr&#233;cisions suivantes. L&#8217;esclavage a &#233;t&#233; aboli par la 
Puissance coloniale. Cette abolition a &#233;t&#233; confirm&#233;e en 1961 par la premi&#232;re Constitution de la 
R&#233;publique islamique de Mauritanie laquelle proclame la libert&#233; et l&#8217;&#233;galit&#233; entre tous les 
citoyens sans distinction aucune. La Constitution du 20 juillet 1991, actuellement en vigueur, 
reprend la m&#234;me disposition dans son article premier : &#171; &#8230;la R&#233;publique assure &#224; tous les 
citoyens sans distinction d&#8217;origine, de race, de sexe ou de condition sociale, l&#8217;&#233;galit&#233; devant la 
loi. &#187; De plus, le Code p&#233;nal pr&#233;voit de lourdes peines pour les personnes coupables 
d&#8217;arrestation, de d&#233;tention ou de s&#233;questration arbitraires  (art. 319 &#224; 322).  
 
161. L'Ordonnance n&#176; 81-234 du 9 novembre 1981 portant abolition de l'esclavage n&#8217;a pas 
&#233;t&#233; suivie de d&#233;crets d&#8217;application, parce qu&#8217;elle visait essentiellement &#224; marquer l&#8217;adh&#233;sion 
des jurisconsultes de droit musulman &#224; l&#8217;abolition d&#233;cr&#233;t&#233;e auparavant en vertu du droit 
positif. Tous les textes juridiques de base avaient, en effet, &#233;t&#233; revus &#224; l&#8217;&#233;poque pour s&#8217;assurer 
de leur compatibilit&#233; avec le droit musulman. En tous cas, cette &#171; lacune &#187; a &#233;t&#233; combl&#233;e par 
les dispositions de la loi n&#176;2003-025 du 17 juillet 2003 portant r&#233;pression de la traite des 
personnes qui dispose dans son article premier : &#171; Nonobstant les d&#233;finitions pr&#233;vues par les 
trait&#233;s et conventions internationaux relatifs aux droits de l'homme ratifi&#233;s par la Mauritanie, 
l'expression &#171; traite des personnes &#187; d&#233;signe l'enr&#244;lement, le transport, le transfert des 
personnes par la force ou le recours &#224; la force ou &#224; la menace ou &#224; d'autres formes de 
contraintes par enl&#232;vement, tromperie, abus d'autorit&#233; ou l'exploitation d'une situation de 
vuln&#233;rabilit&#233; ou par l'offre de l'acceptation de paiement ou davantage pour obtenir le 
consentement d'une personne ayant autorit&#233; sur une autre aux fins d'exploitation. 
L'exploitation comprend au minimum le travail non r&#233;mun&#233;r&#233;, le travail ou les services forc&#233;s 
ainsi que les pratiques analogues, le pr&#233;l&#232;vement d'organes &#224; des fins lucratives, l'exploitation 
de la prostitution d'autrui ou d'autres formes d'exploitation sexuelle&#187;.  
 
162. Par ailleurs le Code du travail a &#233;t&#233; r&#233;vis&#233; en 2004 sur recommandation de 
l&#8217;Organisation internationale du Travail (OIT) afin de renforcer et d&#8217;&#233;largir, entre autres, ses 
dispositions relatives au travail forc&#233;. 
 
163. L'article 5 du Code du travail adopt&#233; en juin 2004 interdit le travail forc&#233; ou

contre les <b>enfants travaillant comme domestiques</b>. 
 
166. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, il semblerait qu&#8217;un nombre &#233;lev&#233; d&#8217;enfants domestiques 
dans des maisons priv&#233;es commenceraient &#224; travailler avant d&#8217;avoir atteint l&#8217;&#226;ge de 10 ans. 
Selon les statistiques officielles provenant d&#8217;une enqu&#234;te sur la main d&#8217;&#339;uvre dat&#233;e de l&#8217;an 
2000, il semblerait que 11 % des enfants &#226;g&#233;s de 7 &#224; 14 ans seraient actifs dans le march&#233; du

commun&#233;ment &#171; petites bonnes &#187;.  
 
167. Les informations re&#231;ues pr&#233;cisent que les &#171; petites bonnes &#187; employ&#233;es comme

embauche comme domestiques. La majorit&#233; des enfants seraient recrut&#233;s &#224; travers des 
interm&#233;diaires, des agents recruteurs connus comme &#171; samasra &#187; qui, sur sollicitation des 
parents ou autres membres de la famille des enfants accepteraient de &#171; placer &#187; ceux-ci chez 
un employeur &#224; travers leurs connaissances, amis, contacts ou voisins. Dans d&#8217;autres cas, les 
enfants seraient plac&#233;s directement chez l&#8217;employeur par les parents eux-m&#234;mes. Les enfants 
travaillant comme domestiques recevraient un salaire tr&#232;s minime (l&#8217;&#233;quivalent de 0,04 
dollars des &#201;tats-Unis &#224; 0,11 dollars par heure), ou, dans de nombreux cas, ne seraient pas 
pay&#233;s du tout, l&#8217;employeur se chargerait seulement de les loger et les nourrir et de leur acheter 
parfois quelques biens n&#233;cessaires (v&#234;tements). La majorit&#233; des enfants embauch&#233;s comme 
domestiques seraient astreints &#224; des horaires de travail ext&#233;nuants, pouvant aller de 14 &#224; 18 
heures par jour. Beaucoup de ces enfants seraient victimes d&#8217;abus physiques ou &#233;motionnels 
de la part de leurs employeurs et se retrouveraient &#224; leur merci. Certaines filles seraient aussi 
victimes d&#8217;abus sexuels de la part de leur employeur. 
 
168. Bien que l&#8217;emploi des mineurs de moins de 15 ans soit interdit par le Code du travail, 
le travail des enfants domestiques se ferait de fa&#231;on informelle et ils ne seraient pas prot&#233;g&#233;s

publics, notamment la police, le parquet et les juges seraient r&#233;ticents &#224; appliquer les sanctions 
pr&#233;vues dans le Code du travail pour l&#8217;emploi de mineurs en dessous de l&#8217;&#226;ge autoris&#233; et de 
celles pr&#233;vues dans le Code p&#233;nal interdisant les abus dont seraient victimes ces enfants. Les 
parents de ces enfants seraient aussi r&#233;ticents &#224; intenter des poursuites au nom de leurs 
enfants, &#233;tant donn&#233; que de telles proc&#233;dures seraient co&#251;teuses, longues et ne garantiraient 
aucun r&#233;sultat ni b&#233;n&#233;fice. De plus, dans beaucoup de cas ce seraient ces m&#234;mes parents qui 
auraient plac&#233;s leurs enfants &#224; travailler comme domestiques.  
</p><p> 
169. Les informations re&#231;ues concluent qu&#8217;il serait difficile, voire impossible pour les 
enfants plac&#233;s comme domestiques de pouvoir se soustraire &#224; cette exploitation. Beaucoup 
craindraient des actes violents ou d&#8217;autres repr&#233;sailles de la part de leur employeur s&#8217;ils 
viendraient &#224; &#234;tre rattrap&#233;s apr&#232;s leur fugue. Les filles auraient aussi peur d&#8217;&#234;tre attaqu&#233;es ou 
abus&#233;es seules dans la rue.  
 
170. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, sans vouloir pr&#233;juger des faits qui lui ont &#233;t&#233; soumis, a fait 
r&#233;f&#233;rence &#224; l&#8217;article 32 de la Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant &#224; laquelle le Maroc est 
partie, qui reconna&#238;t le droit de l'enfant d'&#234;tre prot&#233;g&#233; contre l'exploitation &#233;conomique. Elle a

<p><b>Communication sent  
</b> 
171. On 13 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, sent a letter of allegation concerning 
the <b>trafficking and sexual exploitation of Nepalese girls in brothels in Calcutta and 
Mumbai, India</b>.  
 
172. According to information received, Nepalese girls, of an average age of 14 to 16 years, 
are trafficked from Nepal to brothels in Calcutta and Mumbai where they are required to work 
as prostitutes in slavery-like conditions. The girls are trafficked against their will and without 
knowledge of their destination. The traffickers are reported to be Nepalese men and women, 
who sell the girls to (Nepalese) brothel owners in Calcutta and Mumbai, at a price of </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 37 
</p>
<p>approximately 60,000 to 70,000 Indian rupees (US$ 1,360-1,590) in Calcutta and 100,000 to 
120,000 Indian Rupees (US$ 2,270- 2,720) in Mumbai. There is no evidence of extensive 
networks of traffickers of Nepalese women and girls, and trafficking seems to take place 
though an informal network with the collaboration of community members, employers, local 
officials, border officials and others such as those who operate &#8216;safe houses&#8217;  where trafficked 
girls are kept prior to their sale.   
 
173. Initially the girls are not taken to the brothels directly, but given some time to adjust to 
their new situation in outside homes, sometimes owned by the brothel owner. After being told 
about the work that is required of them, how to dress and behave and after being convinced 
that they themselves, or their families, have incurred a debt which they will have to pay off by 
working as a prostitute after which they are &#8216;free&#8217; to leave, the girls are put to work as <i>tsukri</i> 
(the Bengali word for a child in slavery or debt bondage).  
 
174. When they start to work as <i>tsukris</i>, the girls are usually aged between 15 to 18 years. 
They often work in brothels that are referred to as &#8216;bungalows&#8217;: brothels that occupy a flat, 
usually on the first or higher floors of a building, often with a shop on the ground floor. The 
bungalow is distinguished by a channel gate (a sliding iron accordion gate) at the entrance to 
the brothel. When locked, the channel gate is virtually impenetrable; making escape from the 
brothel impossible for the <i>tsukris</i> kept inside. The area within Calcutta that contains most 
bungalow-type brothels with <i>tsukris</i> is Sonagachi; whereas in Mumbai brothels with <i>tsukris</i> 
can be found mainly in Kamathipura, although due to police raids these types of brothels are 
said to have moved to other cities in India or areas outside the known brothel areas.  
 
175. It is reported that while clients of the brothels do not have a specific preference for 
<i>tsukris</i>, they do have a preference for girls between 15 and 20, which in turn creates a demand 
for children. Under the <i>tsukri</i> system the brothel owner retains all of the fees paid by clients 
for the services provided to them by the <i>tsukris</i>. Considerable profits accrue from the use of 
the <i>tsukri </i>system: brothel owners are said to earn four to twenty times the purchase price of 
the <i>tsukri</i> over the period of her servitude. The money that the trafficker earns is relatively 
insignificant compared to the large amount that the purchaser (brothel owner) earns.  
 
176. The initial purchase price is recovered by the brothel owner, on average, in little over 
five and a half months. A Nepalese <i>tsukri</i> is also said to cost less than an Indian <i>tsukri </i>and 
because of continued client demand for Nepalese girls, the returns are higher. On occasions, 
the brothel owner may also offer &#8216;special services&#8217; such as a <i>tsukri&#8217;s</i> virginity or oral or anal 
sex, as well as sex without a condom, at a special price. The total period the girls spend in 
confinement as <i>tsukris</i> varies from two to ten years.          
 
177. After being released from this situation, it is often very difficult for <i>tsukris</i> to go back 
to Nepal. They fear isolation and reprisal from family and community members. Many of 
them take up work as free-agent women in prostitution, earning their own fees by doing street 
prostitution or paying tenancy to brothel owners. Escape prior to being released is not only 
very difficult because the girls are kept in confinement, there is also fear of being brought 
back to the brothels, either by police or other community members followed by severe 
physical punishment, as well as a more general fear of &#8216;India outside&#8217; since few <i>tsukris</i> have a 
clear idea of where they are, cannot speak the language and are easily recognized as 
foreigners.  
 </p>

</p>
<p>178. The Special Rapporteur called the Government&#8217;s attention to the Trafficking Protocol, 
with specific reference to its article 6, 7 and 8, entitled &#8220;Assistance to and protection of 
victims of trafficking in persons&#8221;, &#8220;Status of victims of trafficking in persons in receiving 
States&#8221; and &#8220;Repatriation of victims of trafficking in persons&#8221; respectively. The Special 
Rapporteur also made reference to OHCHR Recommended Principles and Guidelines on 
Human Rights and Human Trafficking, and in particular paragraph 7 of the Recommended 
Principles, which states that trafficked persons shall not be detained, charged or prosecuted 
for the illegality of their entry into or residence in countries of transit and destination, or for 
their involvement in unlawful activities to the extent that such involvement is a direct 
consequence of their situation as trafficked persons. The Special Rapporteur further recalled 
Guidelines 6 and 8 which refer to the protection and support for trafficked persons and to 
special measures for the protection and support of child victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b>Response by the Government 
</b>179. By letter dated 23 January 2007, the Government of Nepal responded to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s communication of 13 April 2006. The Government indicated that Nepal had 
adopted a series of policies and programmes to control the crime of trafficking in persons in 
general and trafficking of girls and children in particular, and to protect their rights.  
 
180. The Government noted that Nepal was a party to many international and regional 
instruments. At the national level, there was the Trafficking in Person (Control) Act, 1987 
which was amended in 2003. The Government described this Act as a comprehensive legal 
framework that governs investigation, prosecution and punishment of the crimes related to 
human trafficking. Amendments had incorporated harsher penalties for perpetrators and had 
further elaborated provisions to address new complexities of trafficking. 
 
181. In 1995, the Ministry of Labour had prepared a National Master Plan on Child Labour 
that included trafficking in children as an important component of the action programmes. A 
revision of this Plan was completed in 2001 for the period 2001-2010.  Moreover, a National 
Plan of Action against Trafficking in Children and their Commercial Sexual Exploitation 
(NPA) was formulated in 1998. In July 2001, a thorough review of the National Plan of 
Action was undertaken in order to incorporate the changing dynamics of trafficking in persons 
and to make it more inclusive of the SAARC Regional Convention on Preventing and 
Combating Trafficking of Women and Children for Prostitution as well as to strengthen the 
implementation of the Action Plan. To make the NPA more inclusive and comprehensive, to 
address all facets of the problem, the issue of trafficking in women was included. The revised 
NPA has set eight broad strategic objectives. These objectives are policy, research and 
institutional development; enactment of appropriate legislation and enforcement; awareness 
creation, advocacy, networking and social mobilization; income and employment generation; 
health and education for the prevention as well as the treatment of victims; rescue and 
reintegration of the victims; increase trans-border, regional and international efforts to 
strengthen anti-trafficking efforts at the bilateral, regional and international levels; as well as 
the monitoring and evaluation of the action plan and its performance.  
 
182. Furthermore, the establishment of the Ministry of Women and Social Welfare in 1995 
was expanded to include the component of children and renamed the Ministry of Women, 
Children and Social Welfare (MWCSW) in 2000. The Ministry outlined 13 priority areas to 
control trafficking of women and children: a public awareness campaign; non discriminatory 
laws; cooperation with NGOs and donor agencies; acting as the focal point for anti-trafficking 
programmes; protection and promotion of the human rights of women and children; harsh </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 39 
</p>
<p>penalties for the traffickers and exploiters; control and prevention of sexually transmitted 
diseases and HIV/AIDS, poverty alleviation programmes and employment opportunities for 
women of high-risk communities; formation of coordination committees at the national, 
district and village/municipality levels to control trafficking; implementation of informal and 
vocational education; rehabilitation programmes for the rescued women and children in 
collaboration with NGOs; and, seeking commitment of political parties to combat the menace 
of trafficking of women and children.  
</p><p> 
183. The Government further added that the Ministry of Women, Children and Social 
Welfare was currently working as the national focal point for implementing the NPA and all 
other activities geared against the trafficking of women and children. A sixteen-member high 
level National Coordination Committee to Control Trafficking in Women and Children 
(NCC) headed by the Minister of MWCSW, was in place and includes representatives from 
various ministries and NGOs. Under the NCC, there was a broad-based National Task Force, 
representing senior officials of the relevant government departments and NGOs and INGOs 
working in this area. The National Task Force coordinates activities at the national level and 
provides guidelines for anti-trafficking activities. Moreover, there were district and 
village/municipality level task forces that were implementing preventive and curative 
activities against trafficking. There were also 67 district level Women Development Offices 
(WDO) which were entrusted to work as the Secretariat of the District Level Task Force and 
to liaise with the village/municipality level.  
 
184. The Government indicated that the Nepal Police had created a Women&#8217;s Cell at its 
headquarters, and had also launched, in coordination with UNICEF, awareness programmes 
in various districts with regard to trafficking and related exploitation. This project also had 
other components such as capacity building of police officers and database management on 
criminal activities in this field. The Nepal Police had set up 16 Women&#8217;s Cells in its district 
level security units. It had implemented a five year long project to train and mobilize the 
police in awareness raising and prevention of trafficking. There were also several instances of 
apprehension of the traffickers and victims by the Nepal Police, often in collaboration and 
cooperation with civil society actors, before the traffickers took the girls away from the 
Nepal-India border. Such girls were then either handed over to their parents or sent to rescue 
homes for education and income generating training.  
 
185. In addition, the Government of Nepal had established a rescue/emergency fund in 
Kathmandu, Jhapa, Parsa, Rupandehii and Banke districts which are considered major transit 
points of trafficking victims. Several district level plans of action had also been formulated in 
Jhapa, Parsa, Rupandehi and Banke. A documentation and information centre on trafficking 
of women and children had been set up at the MWCSW. The Government of Nepal had also 
prepared action research reports on several trafficking related issues as, for example, the 
report entitled: &#8220;Situational analysis of rescue, rehabilitation and reintegration activities on 
trafficking in children for commercial sexual exploitation in Nepal&#8221;.  
 
186. In view of the need for special care and protection of the victims of crimes related to 
trafficking, the MWCSW had started running a &#8220;women self-reliance and rehabilitation 
home&#8221; since 1998. Civil society organizations were being encouraged to run such centres. In 
addition, many NGOs were working for the prevention of trafficking. In order to address the 
problem of young girls at risk, some NGOs had initiated childcare shelters to accommodate 
street girls, homeless girls, orphans, destitute girls and those who had been subjected to 
trafficking. Some United Nations agencies were providing assistance in this regard. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 40 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>187. Concerning the preventive front, the issue of poverty, especially of women, was being 
addressed within the framework of the tenth five-year development plan (2002-2007). In 
addition, other sectoral plans and programmes of the Government ministries including 
microfinance schemes were geared to reducing women&#8217;s poverty. These efforts were 
supported by skills promotion programmes and vocational training schemes with the view of 
enhancing income-generating employment opportunities to women and providing educational 
opportunities to girls. Particular emphasis was given to enhancing educational opportunities 
for girls at the formal and informal level such as programmes of scholarships, enforcement of 
compulsory primary education, free lunch at school, as well as non-formal education 
including for school dropouts.  
 
188. The Government noted that it was also working with civil society organizations, social 
workers, media persons, and girl students in promoting awareness among people, focusing on 
trafficking-prone areas. Media campaigns had been launched against trafficking. Networks of 
NGOs &#8211; the National Network against Girl trafficking and Alliance against Trafficking in 
Women in Nepal, had been actively promoting this cause. The Task Force on Trafficking and 
the Inter Agencies Task Forces on Trafficking were also actively engaged in fighting against 
the problem of trafficking.  
 
189. With regards to the specific queries raised in the communication, the Government 
stated that there were no specific empirical studies carried out by the Government of Nepal to 
ascertain the statements narrated in the letter. However, the Government declared that being 
aware of the problem of trafficking in women and children and cognizant of Nepal&#8217;s 
obligation as a State party to various international human rights instruments, the State had 
made legal arrangements to curb such activities, as described above. As per the provisions of 
the Trafficking in Person (Control) Act of 1987, a criminal convicted of trafficking is liable 
for a maximum of 20 years of imprisonment and up to Rs. 200,000 penalty. The Act also 
provides for extra-territorial jurisdiction in such cases, allowing indicted persons to be 
prosecuted in the court of Nepal wherever the crime may have been committed. Any of the 
police offices in Nepal can accept the complaint in such cases. The principle of strict liability 
is applied, under which the statement of the victim or the plaintiff is considered as strong 
evidence against the defendant who has to prove his/her innocence. Cases under this Act are 
investigated and prosecuted by the Government Attorney as a party to the case.  
 
190. Regarding the question as to whether complaints had been lodged, the Government 
indicated that as per the existing legal provisions, such complaints may be lodged at any 
police station verbally or in writing. The police office then proceeds with the investigation of 
the case and, in close coordination with the concerned Office of the District Government 
Attorney, files the case to the court. According to the record available with the Office of the 
Attorney General, the following figures on the cases filed by the prosecution officer to the 
court are reported: from July 2001 to June 2002, 136 cases were filed and 72 cases were 
adjudicated by the court; from July 2002 to June 2004, 133 cases were filed and 50 
adjudicated by the court; and, from July 2003 to June 2004, 173 cases were filed and 88 
adjudicated by the court.  
 
191. Regarding investigation, medical examinations, rehabilitation offered to returned 
women and girls and judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out, the 
Government specified that investigations and prosecutions of every individual case takes 
place after the complaint is lodged. This may follow necessary physical examinations as per </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 41 
</p>
<p>nature of the case and condition of the victim, which is determined by the investigating 
officer. The investigating officer, in coordination with the Office of the District Government 
Attorney, files the case to the competent court for the adjudication of the case.  
</p><p> 
192. The Government further indicated that the relevant statistics mentioned above show 
that perpetrators have been identified and penalized by court decisions. In cases where 
sufficient evidence proves that a person is involved in trafficking in persons, he/she is kept in 
judicial custody during the prosecution of the case. Even when the court of first instance 
acquits an accused, the Office of the Government Attorney files appeal to the higher court for 
the review of the verdict. 
 
193. Finally, the Government specified that there are instances of compensation provided to 
the victims. Half of the penalty amount accrued from the convicted criminal of trafficking is 
awarded to the victim or her/his minor children, in case the victim has already died. 
</p>
<p><b>The Netherlands 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent  
 
</b>194. On 16 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning the <b>trafficking of Somalian children to facilitate benefit fraud</b>.  
 
195. According to information received, in the past few years young Somalian children 
have been brought to the Netherlands by Somalian individuals living in the country claiming 
that these children are theirs in order to receive social benefits from the Dutch State. Children 
are sometimes led to believe that the people who have brought them to the Netherlands are 
their parents. Some of the children are reported to suffer child abuse and maltreatment at the 
hands of their &#8220;guardians&#8221; in the Netherlands. After a certain time, when the risk of exposure 
becomes too great or the advantages are not outweighed anymore by the costs of raising the 
children, the children are taken back to Somalia where they are left on the street. Having 
attended school in the Netherlands for many years, the children only speak Dutch and often 
do not know of any other relatives than those people they thought were &#8216;family&#8217; in the 
Netherlands.   
 
196. In the past two years, an estimated 20 children of Somalian descent have approached 
the Dutch embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The reason the embassy in Addis Ababa is 
sought out is because the Netherlands does not have an embassy in Somalia. The children 
speak fluent Dutch and are brought back from the Netherlands without knowing where they 
are going and dumped back in Somalia against their will. The children however do not 
possess documents, such as passports or school diplomas, to prove that they resided in the 
Netherlands for many years. Therefore they are reported to be often turned away by the Dutch 
embassy.  
 
197. The situation of these children was brought to the attention of the media by a Dutch 
national who lives and works in Addis Ababa. After having encountered these Dutch-
speaking minors, he reportedly devoted his time to helping these children gain entrance to 
embassy authorities and gather evidence to substantiate their stories. His estimations are that 
there are more than 100 children in Addis Ababa who have lived in various European 
countries and have been trafficked back to Somalia or Ethiopia. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 42 
</p>
<p> 
198. On 14 February 2006, the TV Programme, Netwerk, devoted part of its broadcast to 
the issue of trafficking of Somalian children for the purpose of benefit fraud. In the 
programme, details were given on the cases of several children specifically, such as <b>K, F and 
A</b>, who are currently residing in the Netherlands. K was able to return to the Netherlands with 
the help of the Dutch national. She is reported to encounter difficulties in relation to her 
identity papers and status of residence in the Netherlands.  
 
199. A and J are currently living in Ethiopia. J was taken to the Netherlands in 1991 as a 5-
year old and taken back to Somalia in 2000 when he was 14 years old. He has been living in 
the streets in Addis Ababa for 6 years and the only evidence he had of his residence in the 
Netherlands, an expired ID-card, was reportedly taken from him by the embassy as they 
claimed the ID-card was State property. A and J have no address in Ethiopia so that they 
cannot receive information from the Netherlands to back up their stories.  
 
200. A and S are also still in Ethiopia although their cases are reported to be currently 
under review by the Dutch authorities. A and S are brothers of A who with help from the 
above-mentioned Dutch national in Ethiopia was able to return to the Netherlands. The Dutch 
individual facilitated contact with A&#8217;s old school in the Netherlands so that he was able to 
substantiate his claims.   
 
201. Netwerk also reported that an investigation into the matter was carried out by the 
District Attorney&#8217;s Office (OM) in 2002. However it remains unclear what the outcome of 
this investigation was. In response to the Netwerk broadcast, representatives of a political 
party, Christian Union, called for a hearing in the House of Representatives and submitted 
written questions to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Alien Affairs and Integration 
and the State Secretary of Social Affairs. In a joint letter dated 17 February 2006 (reference 
28 638-18) the authorities reportedly illustrated the procedures followed by Immigration 
Services and the embassy in Addis Ababa with regard to the trafficked children. The above-
mentioned estimation of 20 children is derived from this letter. In a hearing on 23 February 
2006 in the House of Representatives, representatives from all political parties allegedly 
demanded a more thorough investigation of the matter and accepted a motion which proposed 
to extend residence permits to all victims of this trafficking scheme. The Ministers are 
reported to have pledged to investigate the matter more thoroughly, among others by having 
the National Ombudsman investigate the matter, and to inform the House of Representatives 
of their findings in March 2006. Also, the Minister of Foreign Affairs allegedly declared that 
he would look into the possibility of a new directive for embassy handling of these cases. 
 
202. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern at these practices and stated that she would 
appreciate being kept informed of further developments in this case, such as the outcome of 
the investigation by the national Ombudsman. 
</p>
<p><b>Response by the Government 
</b> 
203. By letter dated 22 June 2006 the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that it 
had conducted a thorough investigation after the television documentaries mentioned in the 
communication sent by the Special Rapporteur and the debate in Parliament on 23 February 
concerning the allegations of trafficking in Somali children. The Government attached a 
translation of the report which was sent to the Dutch Parliament on 18 April by the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Justice, the Minister for Immigration and Integration, the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 43 
</p>
<p>Minister for Administrative Renewal and Kingdom Relations and the Minister for Social 
Security. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur in its reply that the Dutch 
Parliament intends to have a debate with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for 
Immigration and Integration on this report in the near future.  
</p><p> 
204. The Letter to the House of Representatives addresses in four different chapters 
respectively the following questions: people smuggling and document fraud; child 
abandonment in Somalia; possible social security fraud; and consultation between the 
government and the Dutch-Somali community. 
 
205. The report considers that people smuggling from Somalia is entirely a Somali affair 
since both the smugglers and the people smuggled are ethnic Somalis.  The people smuggling 
networks are firmly embedded in the close-knit Somali diaspora in Europe. The networks are 
very well organized. The Netherlands is an important base for the smuggling of Somalis to 
Europe, both as a transit and a destination country. Dutch passports are frequently used to 
smuggle Somalis into Europe. The letter further describes the costs and methods used to 
smuggle people into Europe. 
 
206. The document establishes a distinction between people smuggling and trafficking in 
persons. People smuggling is usually defined as aiding illegal entry, residence or transit. The 
smuggled person will often have asked himself to be smuggled, and will therefore by no 
means always consider himself as a victim.  People smuggling is considered a cross-border 
crime where the interests of the State, in particular, are at issue, and is incriminated by the 
Dutch Criminal Code under article 197 (1). In human trafficking, however, exploitation is the 
key aspect and the crossing of national borders is not strictly necessary. These are situations 
where people are forced or induced to work or provide particular services or to part with their 
organs, which can be done by applying pressure or violence, or simply by taking advantage of 
a person&#8217;s vulnerability. Intentionally profiting from such exploitation is also punishable (art. 
273 (a), Criminal Code). 
 
207. According to the report, the cases discussed in the Netwerk programmes broadcast on 
14, 20, 21 and 23 February 2006 involved children who were reportedly brought to the 
Netherlands illegally and under false pretences to be housed, with someone wanting to profit 
from their stay by spending less on them than the child benefit received. If this were the case, 
the practice could not generally be referred to as &#8220;human trafficking&#8221; because the key aspect 
of &#8220;human trafficking&#8221; is exploitation. It is not clear whether or not this was indeed the case. 
If the children attend school and are fed and dressed, the aspect of exploitation is not 
immediately evident. If the children are made to work hard in the home, and do not attend 
school, however, they could be said to be exploited. The practices portrayed in the media may 
well be punishable in other aspects, e.g. fraud or people smuggling. In respect to cases which 
may concern human trafficking, the letter refers to the Human Trafficking Action Plan and 
supplementary measures as submitted to the House of Representatives on 17 February 2006. 
The report further examines several recent developments intended to improve and simplify 
the prevention of people smuggling, details the role of the Royal Military Constabulary and 
addresses the issue of misuse of travel documents. 
 
208. Regarding the question of children who are abandoned in Somalia, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs sent a delegation to Addis Ababa, immediately after the emergency debate 
that took place on 23 February 2006, to gather as much information as possible. The 
delegation spoke with the Dutch evangelist who raised the issue, with three of the young </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 44 
</p>
<p>people interviewed in the Netwerk programmes, with all staff concerned at the Dutch 
embassy in Addis Ababa, with other embassies facing similar problems, and with the 
UNHCR, IOM, UNICEF and the refugee organization ZAO. The delegation also went 
through all the applications for a passport, emergency passport or authorization for temporary 
stay made by young Somalis in the period 2000-2006. Finally, during transit in Nairobi, the 
issue was discussed with the Dutch embassy there. The chapter on children who are 
abandoned in Somalia further details the situation of Somali children smuggled into the 
Netherlands; the reasons for abandonment in Somalia; the issue of Dutch Somalis going to 
Somalia on holiday and lending their passports for substantial fees to members of their family 
or clan, or to people smugglers; the number of abandoned children; the children&#8217;s 
background; the children&#8217;s situation in Somalia; consular assistance from the Dutch embassy 
in Addis Ababa; parents who oppose return; practical assistance during the procedure; access 
to the embassy in Addis Ababa; and  immigration policy and Dutch nationality. 
</p><p> 
209. The third chapter explains that child benefit has always been a contribution towards 
the cost of maintenance, meaning that the cost of maintaining a child in the Netherlands is 
higher than the child benefit and that there is no evidence to suggest that obtaining child 
benefit is the main reason for (alleged) child smuggling. It further details issues related to the 
application for child benefit and social security fraud. 
 
210. Finally, regarding consultation with the Somali community, chapter IV mentions 
consultations taking place between the Minister for Immigration and Integration and local 
Somali organizations, the National Ethnic Minorities Consultative Committee (LOM) and the 
VON Refugee Organization which also represents Somali refugees. Other Ministries also 
maintain contacts with Dutch-Somali NGOs.

211. On 21 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, sent an urgent appeal concerning 
<b>children from Benin who continue to be trafficked to Nigeria for purposes of forced 
labour in gravel pits and plantations</b>.    
 
212. According to information received, in spite of a June 2005 agreement between Benin 
and Nigeria, hundreds of children from Benin, the youngest of which are six years old, are 
reported to work in the gravel pits of Abeokuta and surrounding areas as well as in numerous 
agricultural plantations in South-West Nigeria.  
 
213. The gravel pits in which these children have to work would have the appearance of 
&#8216;holes&#8217; in which groups of two to three children, called &#8216;gangs&#8217;, work during several weeks 
before moving on to another pit. The owners of the sites are, in general, local notables. The 
owners rely on intermediaries, often Yoruba women, to manage the exploitation of the pits. 
The intermediaries allegedly call on traffickers from Benin to supply them with child 
labourers.     
 
214. Reportedly the children work between 5 to 7 days a week in the pit. The length of their 
&#8216;contracts&#8217; is normally 6 years (consisting of 3 periods of two years each). During these 6 
years the children are not paid wages. As remuneration the children can earn a bicycle and/or </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 45 
</p>
<p>a radio at the end of each period. The children&#8217;s parents are paid a moderate amount of money 
on periodic and precise dates during the 6 year contract. The physical exertions required of 
the children are intensive and dangerous and especially trying on the knees and hands with a 
high risk of accidents. The children work 8 to 10 hours each day, are malnourished and they 
have to rely on themselves to wash, dress and care for themselves. The children sleep in slum-
like dwellings. There is permanent violence among the children who are also subjected to ill-
treatment by adults who beat and insult them. 
</p><p> 
215. A dispute between traffickers in September 2003 made the situation of these children 
publicly known. Knowledge of the trafficking was followed by urgent action aimed at the 
withdrawal, repatriation, protection and rehabilitation of the children under the control of the 
Benin and Nigerian authorities, with the assistance of international and non-governmental 
organizations that are specialized in child protection. Officially 261 children, the great 
majority of which come from the community of Zakpota in the Department of Zou, were 
withdrawn from the pits and repatriated. The majority of this group consisted of children aged 
between 10 to 15 years. More than 50 per cent of them had spent one to two years working in 
the pits, 35 per cent spent three to four years in the pits and the remaining children spent 
between four and seven years in the pits. These figures serve as an illustration of the scope 
and duration of the trafficking.  In addition to the 261 repatriated children, at least 1,000 other 
children have reportedly returned to the Department of Zou without, however, any help or 
institutional protection (these children are said to have &#8216;returned informally&#8217;).   
 
216. However, tens or even hundreds of other children from Benin who were exploited at 
Abeokuta were reportedly hidden in the bush for several weeks or even months before being 
sent on to other sites of exploitation in the South-West of Nigeria (States of Ogun, Osun and 
Oyo) where they probably joined other children from Benin who have been exploited in 
gravel pits or plantations there. Only seven traffickers were arrested in connection with the 
above-mentioned allegations. They were released at the end of 2004 following a period of 
pre-trial detention or after serving several months to a year of their prison sentences. No 
measures have been taken to facilitate their economic reintegration or to discourage them 
from reverting to their illegal practices. As a consequence the trafficking network and the 
routes between Benin and Nigeria have remained in place. 
 
217. The Special Rapporteur called the Government&#8217;s attention to the Trafficking Protocol, 
with specific reference to its article 6, 7 and 8, entitled &#8220;Assistance to and protection of 
victims of trafficking in persons&#8221;, &#8220;Status of victims of trafficking in persons in receiving 
States&#8221; and &#8220;Repatriation of victims of trafficking in persons&#8221; respectively. The Special 
Rapporteur also made reference to the OHCHR Recommended Principles and Guidelines on 
Human Rights and Human Trafficking, and in particular to paragraph 7 of the Recommended 
Principles, which states that trafficked persons shall not be detained, charged or prosecuted 
for the illegality of their entry into or residence in countries of transit and destination, or for 
their involvement in unlawful activities to the extent that such involvement is a direct 
consequence of their situation as trafficked persons. The Special Rapporteur further recalled 
Guidelines 6 and 8 which refer to the protection and support for trafficked persons and to 
special measures for the protection and support of child victims of trafficking.

que pour l&#8217;ann&#233;e 2004. La plupart d&#8217;entre eux seraient des adolescents victimes de trafic ou 
qui auraient migr&#233; de leur propre chef en Italie depuis Bucarest, Calarasi, Craiova, Galati et

<p><b>Response by the Government 
</b> 
222. By letter dated 20 July 2006 the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the 
situation on which she had reported  represented a major concern to the Romanian 
Government. The Romanian Government has adopted a &#8220;Programme of preventing and 
countering sexual abuse against minors&#8221; and a &#8220;National Action Plan for preventing and 
countering children trafficking&#8221;. On the basis of these documents, joint actions are performed 
with foreign partners in order to prevent and combat cases of exploitation of minors.  
 
223. On 29 January 2006, Law No. 248/2005 concerning the freedom of movement of 
Romanian citizens abroad entered into force; according to its provisions minors (under 18 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 47 
</p>
<p>years of age) are not allowed to travel abroad unaccompanied. The case brought to the 
attention of the Romanian authorities by the Special Rapporteur is similar to the information 
presented within the study &#8220;Extension of the prostitution phenomenon among the Romanian 
minors from Rome&#8221;, drawn up by the Casa dei Diritti Sociali Focus, Rome and the Romanian 
Foundation for Children, Community and Family. According to the statistics drawn up by the 
above-mentioned foundations, &#8220;during the first 6 months of 2005, the public services had 
registered 487 Romanian unaccompanied minors, almost the total number registered in 2004&#8221;.  
</p><p> 
224. The Romanian authorities, supported by the Office of the Romanian attach&#233;s of 
internal affairs in Italy and the Romanian Consulate in Rome, initiated investigations on the 
situation of Romanian minors.  Furthermore, they cooperated with the Italian authorities in 
order to identify the persons which have exploited those children. Specific activities were 
carried out through countering crime structures with a view to identifying the victims and the 
traffickers&#8217; networks in order to punish them. 
 
225. After receiving the letter of the Special Rapporteur letter, the Ministry of 
Administration of Interior requested the Romanian liaison officer in Italy, as well as the 
Italian liaison officer in Bucharest, to carefully analyse the facts presented by the Special 
Rapporteur, in order to identify the solutions that would safeguard the fundamental rights of 
the affected children. Following the briefing of the Italian and Romanian liaison officers, the 
following conclusions were found: the judicial authorities of Rome had not registered the 497 
Romanian minors as victims of trafficking in persons and had not made any reports in this 
respect to the Romanian authorities; not all the minors discovered by the Italian authorities 
were unaccompanied, some of them hid the fact that they were in Italy with their families. 
 
226. The identification and punishment of traffickers is the responsibility of the Italian 
authorities. The Embassy of Romania in Italy, having two attach&#233;s for internal affairs, has 
always been fully available to cooperate with the local police in order to identify and combat 
the networks of traffickers. In the case of arrested minors, Italian legislation does not allow 
the local authorities to inform the diplomatic mission in the country concerned if the minor 
does not give his/her consent in this respect; in most cases the minors do not wish to notify 
the Romanian authorities that they are detained.  
 
227. The Romanian authorities have developed close cooperation and mutual exchange of 
operational data with their Italian counterparts, to combat trafficking in persons, especially 
minors. The existing collaboration with the Italian authorities is satisfactory as regards the 
identification of undocumented children that accept the protection and social integration 
programmes and contacts with the family of origin. The project &#8220;Illegal migration and 
exploitation of unaccompanied minors - urgent measures in favour of extremely vulnerable 
minors&#8221;, financed by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ministero Degli Affari Esteri), 
was being put in place at the time that this reply was sent. The project, covering the period 
between January 2006 and January 2007, presents social issues determined by the 
psychosocial impact of migration on local communities and families, such as the 
abandonment and abuse of minors in Romania and the Moldova and aims at reducing the risk 
of trafficking in persons or that of becoming illegal immigrants. The project aims to 
strengthen the cooperation between the central and local administrations and also to involve 
civil society in the protection and supporting activities for unaccompanied minors in Italy, 
Romania, and the Moldova. Cooperation with representatives of civil society will be achieved 
by common training activities, exchanges of experience and expertise in the field of child 
protection, the target group being represented by socially disadvantaged families, one parent </p>

Page 48 
</p>
<p>families, minors with a high risk of becoming victims of abuse, unaccompanied minors from 
Italy, Romania and the Moldova. 
</p><p> 
228. The agreement between the Governments of Romania and Italy concerning 
cooperation for the protection of Romanian minors encountering difficulties on the territory of 
Italy and their return to their country of origin, as well as the field of combating the 
exploitation of minors is under negotiation. This agreement will set up the legal framework 
and the necessary procedures in order to identify and ensure assisted repatriation for the 
Romanian minors identified on the territory of Italy. Moreover, in 2005 the General 
Directorate for Countering Organised Crime in the Ministry of Administration and Interior in 
Romania registered the following data on trafficking in Romanian children in Italy: 65 files 
sent to the Prosecutor&#8217;s office, referring to cases involving 128 minor victims; in 80% of these 
cases, requests for assistance were addressed to the Italian authorities; the cooperation with 
the Italian authorities aimed at investigating cases of trafficking in persons and at identifying 
and arresting the perpetrators. 
 
229. In April 2006, following an action by Italian police, 13 Italian citizens and six  
Romanian citizens were arrested, accused of prostitution with minors, pornography with 
minors and blackmail. Twenty-two victims were identified, out of which 16 are Romanian, 
minors (the majority of Roma origin), the others are Italian, Albanian, Macedonian and 
Moroccan minors. During 2005, the Romanian National Authority for the protection of the 
Rights of the Child (NAPRC) received 398 requests regarding unaccompanied Romanian 
children on Italian territory; the repatriation procedure was initiated for all the children and in 
eight cases the procedure was completed. During the first semester of 2006, NAPRC received 
60 requests regarding unaccompanied Romanian children on Italian territory; the repatriation 
procedure was initiated and was completed in 11 cases.

230. On 16 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the human rights of migrants and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences, sent a letter of allegation concerning <b>norms and procedures that 
discriminate against women domestic migrant workers, and make them more 
vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and restrictions of their physical freedom</b>. 
 
231. According to information received, there are 150,000 women domestic migrant 
workers in Singapore who are in the majority from Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. 
Private employment agencies typically recruit the women in their countries of origin and 
place them with Singaporean employers. These agencies usually charge significant 
recruitment, transfer and placement fees (S$1,400-2,100), which the women often have to 
repay by working the initial 4 to 10 months of their contract without pay. Additional fees are 
often charged and have to be worked off, if a domestic worker decides to change employers 
during her stay. Some employment agents, especially unlicensed ones, have threatened 
workers with severe reprisals, including trafficking into prostitution, if they try to leave their 
job and return home before they have worked off their debt. Other agents have also 
intimidated workers by way of physical abuse. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 49 
</p>
<p>232. Once in Singapore, many domestic migrant workers are required to work between 13 
and 19 hours a day, seven days a week. In a large number of cases, the women also 
experience verbal abuse and food deprivation at the hands of their employers. Employers 
often prohibit their domestic migrant workers from leaving the house unaccompanied and also 
confiscate their passports and other identity documents. These restrictions isolate the workers 
and make them more vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse in the employer&#8217;s home.  
</p><p> 
233. The Special Rapporteur commended the Government on a number of important 
measures implemented in recent years to prevent abuse and exploitation of domestic migrant 
workers. However, she also noted that certain discriminatory norms and policies continue to 
exist, which inadvertently render these migrant domestic workers more vulnerable to abuse, 
trafficking, exploitation and restrictions of physical freedom: Domestic workers are explicitly 
excluded from the protection of the Employment Act, which guarantees the right to one day 
of rest per week and a maximum of 44 work hours per week. The Employment Act also limits 
salary deductions to 25% of the monthly salary for a maximum period of 12 months. The 
Employment of Foreign Workers Act, which applies also to domestic migrant workers, does 
not provide for equivalent rights.  The Employment Agencies Act stipulates that employment 
agencies must not charge job seekers more than 10 percent of their first month&#8217;s earnings. 
However, the Ministry of Manpower considers the recruitment, transfer and placement fees, 
which domestic migrant workers are charged by their agents, to be private loans that are not 
subject to the limit imposed by the Employment Agencies Act.  Employers hiring domestic 
migrant workers have to take out a S$5,000 bond, which they forfeit if they fail to pay for the 
domestic worker&#8217;s repatriation costs or if the domestic worker runs away from the employer&#8217;s 
home. The latter gives employers an incentive to prohibit their domestic workers from leaving 
their workplace in the employer&#8217;s home unaccompanied. 
 
234. Domestic migrant workers also face limitations of their reproductive and marriage 
rights: Singaporean labour regulations prohibit domestic migrant workers from becoming 
pregnant or giving birth during the course of their stay in Singapore. Unless pregnant workers 
agree to an abortion, they will be deported. For employers, who have economic and personal 
interests not to see their domestic workers deported, this limitation of reproductive rights 
provides further incentive to limit their workers&#8217; outside contacts and prohibit them from 
leaving the house on their own; The same set of labour regulations prohibits domestic workers 
from marrying Singaporean citizens or permanent residents during their stay, unless they 
receive a special permission from the Comptroller of Work Permits.  
 
235. The Special Rapporteur called the Government&#8217;s attention to various relevant 
international norms, including the 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of 
Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery which requires 
States parties to take all practicable and necessary legislative and other measures to bring 
about progressively and as soon as possible the complete abolition or abandonment of debt 
bondage, that is to say, the status or condition arising from a pledge by a debtor of his 
personal services or of those of a person under his control as security for a debt, if the value of 
those services as reasonably assessed is not applied towards the liquidation of the debt or the 
length and nature of those services are not respectively limited and defined.  
</p>
<p><b>Response by the Government 
</b> 
236. By letter dated 5 April 2006, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that 
Singapore is committed to protecting the well-being of the 160,000 foreign domestic workers </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 50 
</p>
<p>(FDWs) working in Singapore. The vast majority of FDWs experience safe, productive and 
fulfilling work in Singapore. Over 80 per cent of FDWs have indicated that they are happy to 
work in Singapore, according to an independent poll conducted by the Singapore Press 
Holdings in December 2003. One in three FDWs extend their two year employment contracts 
with the same employer. Thus, FDWs who choose to work in Singapore do so because of 
better pay and working conditions compared to their home and other countries.  
</p><p> 
237. Moreover, FDWs in Singapore receive full protection under Singapore laws including 
the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (EFWA), Employment Agencies and the Penal 
Code. The Singapore Government has taken firm enforcement actions against errant local 
employers and employment agents. In addition, the Government has extensive outreach 
programmes to educate the FDWs in Singapore on their rights under the law and the channels 
of assistance available to them. 
 
238. The Employment of Foreign Domestic Act (EFWA) imposes work permit conditions 
on employers to provide adequate rest and meals, and ensure work safety, proper housing and 
prompt salary payment. Employers who breach these conditions can be punished with a fine 
of up to $5,000 and a jail term of up to 6 months. FDWs also receive special protection under 
the Penal Code. In 1998, the Penal Code was amended to increase by one-and-a-half times the 
penalties for acts of abuse against FDWs by their employers or household members, 
compared to the same acts against any other persons including Singaporeans. This has led to a 
marked decrease in abuses against FDWs, from 157 in 1997 to 59 cases last year. In 2005, 
five employers were fined for failing to pay their FDWs and ordered to make full restitution 
of the outstanding salary. Three of these employers were subsequently jailed when they 
defaulted on the court order. From 2001 to 2005, a total of 26 FDW employers or their 
household members were also jailed for abusing their FDWs. All convicted employers and 
their spouses are permanently barred from employing FDWs. 
 
239. Furthermore, to ensure that FDWs are equipped to protect themselves and are fully 
aware of their rights, Singapore has in place extensive measures to educate FDWs on these 
aspects, and various channels of assistance that FDWs can turn to for help. Upon their arrival 
in Singapore, each FDW is given a pocket-sized handy guide published in their native 
languages, containing the Ministry of Manpower&#8217;s hotline number for FDWs to seek help or 
report grievances. It also contains the contact numbers of the Police, the relevant Embassies 
and volunteer organizations. All first-time FDWs are also required to attend a Safety 
Awareness Course to acclimatize them to working in a high-rise urban environment. The 
channels of assistance they can turn to are again highlighted during the course. As the FDWs 
attend these course on their own, without their employers or agents present, it also accords 
them ample opportunity to express any problems on their employment freely or seek help if 
they so wish. In addition, to ensure that FDWs are better able to understand and exercise their 
rights under Singapore law, with effect from 1 January 2005, all new FDWs entering 
Singapore must be at least 23 years of age (the previous minimum age being 18 years) and 
have undergone eight years of formal education. 
 
240. In addition, to remind employers of their responsibilities and empower FDWs to 
exercise self-help in safeguarding their rights and safety, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) 
has stepped up its public outreach efforts to emphasize key messages such as safety in high-
rise buildings, the rights and obligations of employers, as well as avenues through which 
FDWs can seek help. These outreach efforts include posters displayed in residential 
neighbourhoods and bus stops, as well as the distribution of goody bags containing collaterals </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 51 
</p>
<p>imprinted with MOM&#8217;s helpline at community events. MOM closely regulates the 
employment agency (EA) to prevent any exploitation of FDWs. All EAs are licensed, and can 
be punished with a fine of up to $5,000 and/or 2 years imprisonment if convicted under any 
offence under the EA Act. EAs also risk losing their license permanently for any 
infringements of the Act. Since January 2004, the Ministry has revoked the licenses of three 
EAs and not renewed the licenses of another ten . Furthermore, MOM also requires all EAs 
involved in placing FDWs to be accredited by independent bodies. One key accreditation 
criterion is that EAs must ensure that employers and FDWs enter into employment contracts, 
which specify the terms of employment. As such, FDWs have the same right as all employees 
to accept or reject work conditions imposed, including the number of rest days. 
</p><p> 
241. To further shape the behaviour of the EA industry, the Ministry has introduced a 
demerit point system (DPS) for EAs since 1 February 2006. This awards demerit points to 
EAs for regulatory infringements. The points that each EA has accumulated are also made 
public. EAs that accumulate excessive demerit points will also have their licences removed by 
the Ministry. Nonetheless, while MOM regulates the commission charged by Singapore-based 
EAs, the loans that FDWs take in their home countries fall outside Singapore&#8217;s jurisdiction. 
They have to be handled within the jurisdictions of the labour exporting countries.  
 
242. The Government further specified that it is a serious offence under the Penal Code to 
wrongfully confine any person. Anyone found wrongfully confining a person faces a jail term 
of up to one year, and/or a fine of up to $1,000 under the Penal Code. It is also an offence 
under the EA rules for the EA to withhold either the passport or work permit of an FDW. The 
Police and MOM take such offences seriously and will prosecute any EA seeking to restrict 
the FDW&#8217;s movement. In addition, as a small city-state of four million people with limited 
land resources, it is necessary for Singapore to maintain a strict immigration policy. 
Singapore therefore requires work permit holders to obtain prior approval from the Controller 
of Work Permits to go through any form of marriage or apply to marry a Singapore Citizen or 
Permanent Resident (CS/PR). A key consideration in determining the grant of approval is 
whether the couple would be financially self-reliant. The Government noted that other 
countries also impose certain restrictions of marriage on foreign workers.

243. On 18 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, sent a letter of allegation concerning 
<b>women and children refugees from Myanmar at risk of trafficking</b>.  
 
244. According to the information received, it was reported that hundreds of thousands of 
people from Myanmar, many of them women and children, have fled into neighbouring 
Thailand in the course of the past two decades, escaping armed conflict and rampant human 
rights violations in their homeland. Concern had been expressed about their vulnerable 
situation, which reportedly puts them at risk of continued human rights abuses. It was also 
reported that these women and children are particularly at risk of trafficking, and sexual and 
physical exploitation and forced labour associated with it. It was further alleged that these 
persons sought assistance in crossing the border. Sometimes family or community members </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 52 
</p>
<p>offered such help. At other times, people paid &#8220;carriers&#8221; to help them cross the border 
undetected. Such transportation can sometimes be accompanied by an offer of employment. 
</p><p> 
245. It is also reported that people from Myanmar who wish to enter Thailand and do not 
have enough money when they arrive at the border to pay a carrier, have to wait at the border 
area anywhere from a few days to months before crossing it. It seems that trafficking often 
occurs during this vulnerable time. It is further reported that sometimes carriers themselves 
are in fact engaged in trafficking. The carriers tell relatives of women or children that life is 
better in Thailand. These persons are then forced to work without pay. It is alleged that some 
Thai officials collaborate with the traffickers. Concern had also been expressed about the fact 
that, after being trafficked, women and children may end up in a range of abusive situations, 
including forced prostitution, forced begging, abusive domestic work, or work in substandard 
labour conditions in textile factories, fishing or other industrial settings. According to the 
allegations received, sometimes, the victims are not paid at all or are paid a wage far below 
that promised or allowed under Thai law. Labour conditions for trafficked persons are 
reportedly characterized by long hours and physical and sexual abuse. Some women working 
as domestic servants reported that their inability to speak Thai left them isolated, and the 
nature of their work, which often involved living in their employer&#8217;s homes, left them 
vulnerable to abuse. 
 
246. Moreover, people living without status, including victims of trafficking, fear 
deportation. Women and children may be especially susceptible to ill-treatment, and are 
reluctant to complain due to fear of persecution by the Myanmar military if returned, as well 
as the fear of leaving their families without economic support if they lose their source of 
income, as abusive as their employment situation might be. Sources also allege that the 
number of children who arrive alone in Thailand has significantly increased in the past four 
years. Families are often separated once in Thailand. In other cases, children may be left alone 
while their parents are at work.  
 
247. Children who are alone are reportedly more vulnerable to abuses such as trafficking. It 
is further alleged that some children are trafficked from inside Myanmar across the border 
into Thailand. The traffickers then collect a large group of children in Mae Sot (Thailand), 
directly across the border and transport the children to Bangkok. The traffickers lie to the 
children&#8217;s parents, telling them that the children will live &#8220;an easy, better life&#8221;. Once they 
arrive in Bangkok, the traffickers reportedly force the children to communicate to their 
parents that they are well cared for. Gradually, however, the traffickers tell the parents that the 
children are misbehaving, that they are not working hard enough, and that the children are 
forgetting them. Therefore, when a child does not send money back to the parents, the parents 
assume it is because the child is not working hard enough or is no longer gainfully employed. 
This is to drive a wedge between the children and their parents in order to sever the child&#8217;s 
familial ties. If the parents continue to insist that they want to see their children, the trafficker 
may send the child back in order to avoid trouble and unwanted attention. In most cases, 
however, the parents are unable to investigate the whereabouts of their child and thus are 
forced to give up finding them, at which point the trafficker may sell the child to someone 
else. It is alleged that a common strategy is to force the children to sell flowers or trinkets or 
to beg on the streets of Bangkok. If the child does not make the required amount of money 
each day, he is reportedly deprived of food, beaten or forced to stay on the street. 
 
248. Concerning the sex industry in Thailand, in addition to the lack of legal residence and 
employment options, trafficked persons who are removed from the brothels are reportedly not </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 53 
</p>
<p>screened for refugee status. Sources alleged that these trafficked victims are reluctant to share 
information because they typically do not want to return home to Myanmar. Besides, 
according to the information received, witness protection in Thailand is insufficient and if the 
trafficked person presents testimony, the person would be at risk of retaliation. Furthermore, 
prosecutions that are supposed to result from the brothel raids are often unsuccessful. The 
prosecution effort is primarily aimed at actors who are only minor figures in the trafficking 
networks, such as the pimps and brothel owners. In the meantime, the trafficking victims may 
be held at the shelters indefinitely, waiting to testify in the proceedings. After testifying, the 
victims are reportedly deported, including those under age 18. 
</p><p> 
249. The Special Rapporteur called the Government&#8217;s attention to the Trafficking Protocol, 
particularly to its article 1, read together with article 9 of the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime, which provides that States parties shall, to the extent 
appropriate and consistent with its legal system, adopt legislative, administrative, and other 
effective measures to promote integrity and to prevent, detect and punish the corruption of 
officials. In addition, reference was made to OHCHR Recommended Principles and 
Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking, and in particular to paragraph 7 of the 
recommended Principles, which states that trafficked persons shall not be detained, charged or 
prosecuted for the illegality of their entry into or residence in countries of transit and 
destination, or for their involvement in unlawful activities to the extent that such involvement 
is a direct consequence of their situation as trafficked persons. The Special Rapporteur further 
highlighted Guidelines 6 and 8 which refer to the protection and support for trafficked persons 
and to special measures for the protection and support of child victims of trafficking.

<p><b>Turkey 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent  
</b>250. On 23 June 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Ms. 
TB, a German citizen of Turkish descent</b>.  
 
251. According to information received, Ms. TB is a German citizen from Hamburg. In 
April 2006, Ms. TB traveled with her mother from Hamburg to the settlement of Karastlak 
K&#246;y&#252; in the village of Yeni Halfeti, Sanliurfa province, southeast Turkey, where her 
grandmother and other relatives reside. Allegedly, her family had pretended that she was 
going on vacation to the village. Upon Ms. TB&#8217;s arrival in the village, however, her mother 
took her passport and identity documents and told her that she had to enter into an arranged 
marriage with a close relative. According to the latest information received at the time this 
communication was sent, Ms. TB was still in Yeni Halfeti. Reportedly, she faced serious 
limitations on her freedom of movement and was only on rare occasions able to leave her 
grandmother&#8217;s house. Concern was expressed that Ms. TB might have been forced to marry 
her relative against her will or face severe violence, if she refused. The Special Rapporteur 
has appealed to the Government to intervene in this case and ensure that the competent 
Turkish authorities undertake all necessary action to protect Ms. TB from forced marriage, 
any form of violence or the threat thereof. 
</p>
<p><b>Response by the Government 
</b>252. On 29 June 2006, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that investigations 
found that, during her vacation in Turkey, Ms. TB contacted the Provincial Gendarmerie 
Command in Sanliurfa by phone on 30 May 2006 and requested help from the authorities, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 54 
</p>
<p>stating that there were attempts to force her to get married to her uncle&#8217;s son. The 
gendarmerie authorities had to refer the matter to the Foreigners Section of the Police, since 
Ms. TB was a German citizen. Ms. TB was then assisted by the authorities to return to 
Germany on 2 June, 2006. On 27 June 2006, the Provincial Gendarmerie Commander in Yeni 
Halfeti visited Ms. TB&#8217;s grandmother&#8217;s premises and confirmed that she was not in Turkey. 
According to a relative in Germany whom the Turkish authorities have contacted, Ms. TB 
was granted protection at a social institution in Germany under German law and she was to be 
hosted in this institution until October 2006 when she would be 18. In this framework, it had 
been confirmed that a forced marriage had not taken place during her stay in Turkey.

<p><b>United Arab Emirates

<p><b>Communication sent  
</b> 
253. On 18 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, sent a letter of allegation 
concerning  <b>SM, the founder of Villa N. 18 - City of Hope</b>, a shelter for abused and/or 
exploited women, including abused migrant domestic workers, trafficked women and minor 
girls.  
 
254. In early August 2006, the competent authorities reportedly accused SM of having 
assaulted a 15-year old girl who had sought refuge in the shelter. The authorities reportedly 
also threatened to close the shelter, although no formal decision to that effect had yet been 
taken at the time this communication was sent.  Sources alleged that the criminal charges 
against SM were fabricated. Concerns were expressed that these charges and the possible 
closure of the shelter might have been in retaliation for her activities in defence of women's 
rights, since the shelter&#8217;s work was reportedly viewed as a threat to the traditional culture and 
family values of the country and its continued operation largely depended on SM's work. 
Concerns were further expressed that the charges against SM and the possible closure of the 
women and children shelter could lead to a protection gap for women and children at risk of 
violence, including migrant domestic workers and minor girls.  
 
255. The Special Rapporteur appealed to the Government to take all necessary measures to 
prevent and combat trafficking and provide adequate assistance to the victims of this crime. In 
this context, she also drew the Government&#8217;s attention to the OHCHR Recommended 
Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking, as a useful, practical, 
and rights-based blueprint for interventions on the issue of trafficking, and underlined the 
relevance of Guideline 6, in particular, which refers to the protection and support for 
trafficked persons, which includes the provision of safe and adequate shelter that meets the 
needs of trafficked persons.

<p><b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
</b> 
<b>Response to previously transmitted communication  
 
</b>256. On 28 April 2006, the Government responded to the communication sent jointly by 
the Special Rapporteur, the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution, and 
child pornography, and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women on 28 November </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 55 
</p>
<p>2005 concerning the <b>situation of children trafficked to and abused in the United 
Kingdom</b>.  
 
257. The Government assured the Special Rapporteur that it remained committed to 
providing support to all victims of trafficking and that it was fully committed to the 
implementation of the Trafficking Protocol. Its strategy to combat human trafficking is multi-
faceted and aims to assure that there is legislation in place to criminalize trafficking, that there 
is cooperation with international partners to work to prevent trafficking at its source and that 
enforcement action against traffickers is effective.  
 
258. Legislation has actually been strengthened in order to cover trafficking for all 
purposes. The offence of trafficking for prostitution was introduced in the Nationality, 
Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. 
Moreover, the Sexual Offence Act 2003 introduced new wide-ranging offences covering 
trafficking into, out of or within the United Kingdom for any form of sexual offence, which 
also carries a 14 year maximum penalty. The Act also introduced a range of new offences 
covering the commercial sexual exploitation of a child, protecting children up to 18. These 
include buying the sexual services of a child (for which the penalty ranges from imprisonment 
for seven years to life, depending on the age of the child) and causing or inciting, arranging or 
facilitating and controlling the commercial sexual exploitation of a child in prostitution or 
pornography, for which the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment. Another new 
offence, of &#8220;trafficking for exploitation&#8221;, which covers trafficking for forced labour and the 
removal of organs, was introduced in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, 
etc.) Act 2004. All these measures have taken into account the United Kingdom&#8217;s 
international obligations and fully comply with all legislative requirements under the 
Trafficking Protocol.  
 
259. The Government added that there had been a number of arrests and convictions since 
the new legislation received Royal Assent. In April 2004, L. P. was sentenced to 23 years in 
prison for trafficking women for prostitution. In December 2004, two men were the first to be 
prosecuted under the specific offences of trafficking contained in the Sexual Offences Act 
2003, together with associated charges such as rape and false imprisonment. This was quickly 
followed by three further successful prosecutions in March 2005 for human trafficking.  
 
260. In order to strengthen enforcement, a multi-agency task force was set up, under the 
name of REFLEX, which is overseen by the National Crime Squad. REFLEX aims to reduce 
the harm caused by the serious and organized crime involved in people smuggling and human 
trafficking. Its establishment has enhanced the coherence of the United Kingdom&#8217;s broad 
response to organized immigration crime and brings government departments and law 
enforcement agencies together to foster an intelligence-led operational response.  
 
261. Knowledge of child trafficking amongst appropriate professionals has also improved 
and a best practice toolkit on trafficking has even been published (available at 
www.crimereduction.co.uk/toolkits). This acts as a guide for immigration officers, police and 
other professionals who might potentially deal with the victims of trafficking, whether they 
are adults or children. In particular, it helps those concerned to treat victims of trafficking 
fairly and appropriately.  
 
262. In addition, the Immigration Service has reviewed and updated the Unaccompanied 
Minors Best Practice Guide to include a chapter on child trafficking. The guide aims to equip </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 56 
</p>
<p>officers with the tools they need to recognize children who may have been trafficked and 
contains also a section on trafficking, the aim of which is to enable Immigration Officers to 
refer any children who may have been trafficked to the appropriate practitioners. An 
Interviewing Minors training course has been made available to border control staff since 
November 2003. Recognizing signs of trafficking is an important aspect of this course. Staff 
who have received this training have formed &#8220;Minors Teams&#8221; at ports, and deal with cases of 
unaccompanied minors arriving in the United Kingdom and work closely with Social 
Services, police and child protection officers.  
</p><p> 
263. The Government recognizes that when victims of trafficking are children, they are 
likely to be in need of welfare services and, in many cases, protection under the Children Act 
1989. Children&#8217;s services have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of trafficked 
children following an assessment of their circumstances. Where there is risk to the life of the 
child or a likelihood of serious harm, an agency with statutory child protection powers, such 
as the police or councils with responsibilities for children&#8217;s services, should act quickly to 
secure the immediate safety of the child. Under Section 20 of the Children Act 1989, a local 
authority may also provide accommodation for any child within its area if it considers that 
this would safeguard or promote the child&#8217;s welfare.  
 
264. The Government added that after the murder of Victoria Climbi&#233;, the United Kingdom 
Government announced in January 2001 a statutory inquiry, chaired by Lord Laming, to look 
at every aspect of the case. In January 2003, the Laming report was published (and can be 
viewed at httt://www.victoria-climbie-inquiry.org.uk/.) In response to the said report, the 
Government published a Green Paper, entitled &#8220;Every Child Matters&#8221;. Following extensive 
public consultation on it, the Children Act 2004 was introduced. In conjunction with the 
legislation a highly significant cross-Government strategy known as the &#8220;Every Child 
Matters: Change for Children Programme&#8221; is also currently underway. Moreover, officers in 
the Department for Education and Skills will be publishing revised and updated multi-agency 
guidance to all statutory bodied which have a role in safeguarding children and protecting 
their welfare. This guidance entitled &#8220;Working Together to Safeguard Children&#8221; provides 
focused guidance to practitioners working with children who may be particularly vulnerable 
to abuse or exploitation.  
 
265. Regarding the identification of children missing education, the Government mentioned 
that it had strengthened arrangements. Local authorities have now a named individual 
responsible for receiving details of children found to be missing education and for brokering 
support for them through the most appropriate agencies. This is supported by the good 
practice guide, Identifying and Maintaining Contact with Children Missing or At Risk of 
Going Missing from Education&#8221; (available at 
http://www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/files/12CD63286B690820CE9CE21C7ED5A877.doc.) 
that has provided a practical model of process steps to help Local Education Authorities 
(LEAs) in their implementation of effective systems for identifying and maintaining contact 
with children missing, or at risk of going missing, from education. Nevertheless, it noted its 
deep concern about any child missing from education, as it is not just the child&#8217;s educational 
development that is at risk, but also potentially his/her safety and welfare. The Department for 
Education and Skills, the Home Office, and the police are continuing to work together to 
reinforce local procedures to ensure that any children at risk will be identified and appropriate 
safeguarding action taken (further information on this and the other elements of the change 
for children programme is made available on www.everychildmatters.gov.uk). 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 57 
</p>
<p>266. Furthermore, there have been circumstances where concerns about the safety and 
welfare of children missing from school are sufficient to warrant police involvement. Initial 
enquiries made by the Metropolitan Police officers investigating the &#8220;Adam&#8221; murder (the case 
of the torso of a boy found in the Thames) actually identified 300 cases where African or 
Caribbean children had not returned to school following the 2001 summer break. However, no 
evidence was uncovered to suggest that any of them had come to harm, and there were no 
allegations from any of their families or schools that the welfare of these children was 
significantly at risk. The Metropolitan Police Service has made it clear that they believe the 
type of crime of which Adam was the victim to be extremely rare. This case did, nevertheless, 
increase concerns about a type of abuse which it was thought might emanate as a consequence 
of some belief systems in African communities. As a result, Operation Violet was launched 
by London&#8217;s Metropolitan Police to support the education of new community groups and 
representatives in acceptable and legal methods of child discipline in this country. The 
operation will also initiate intelligence-led, proactive investigations into allegations of 
ritualistic belief-related child abuse to identify and prosecute any offenders.  
</p><p> 
267. On the question pertaining to children brought to the United Kingdom to cure 
sufferers from HIV through sexual intercourse, the Government indicated that it had no 
information to support this, although they were aware that it is a belief in some regions of 
Africa where HIV/AIDS has reached endemic proportions.  
 
268. The Government of the United Kingdom was furthermore surprised by the claim 
mentioned in the communication of the shortcomings within the children&#8217;s services, police, 
and the immigration service resulting in children becoming victims of abuse. It indicated that 
there had been several operational projects dedicated to the investigation of children entering 
the United Kingdom who may be at risk from different forms of exploitation. For example, in 
order to improve the sharing of information between the Immigration Services and local 
authorities, joint Treasury and Home Office funding has been used to set up a National 
Register of Unaccompanied Children (NRUC) database. By linking the databases with others 
concerning children at risk, the Government noted that it would be able to better address their 
needs, and ultimately improve child protection amongst this group of vulnerable children.  
 
269. Information on the work from Operation Paladin Child, an operation led by London&#8217;s 
Metropolitan Police Service between August and November 2004 to explore the nature of 
child migration from non-EU countries to the United Kingdom through London was also 
provided. The communication referred to 1,738 children at Heathrow under &#8220;suspicious 
circumstances&#8221; between August and November 2004, but the Government notes that this is 
surely a misunderstanding. The number actually refers to the results of Operation Paladin 
Child, where 1,738 non asylum-seeking unaccompanied minors were purposely identified by 
UK Immigration Service during a three month study period, so that the researchers could 
evaluate their circumstances in detail. Of these, 551 (30 per cent) were identified as 
potentially vulnerable. Social Services departments were unable to trace 12 of the 551 
unaccompanied minors, and police enquires into their whereabouts continue. Operation 
Paladin did not find conclusive evidence that children were being trafficked into the United 
Kingdom through Heathrow, although it was acknowledged that the study was too limited in 
scale to predict fully the level of illegal child migration to the United Kingdom. Moreover, it 
is to be mentioned that the Metropolitan Police Child Abuse Investigation Command (CAIC), 
with funding from REFLEX have continued a presence at Heathrow airport as a result of 
Operation Paladin as part of a permanent multi-agency partnership to address the specific 
safeguarding needs of unaccompanied minors. They also have safeguarding responsibilities at </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 58 
</p>
<p>Lunar House Asylum Screening Unit in Croydon, at Waterloo Station, and at London City 
and Gatwick Airports, together with other smaller airports within London, such as Biggin 
Hill. Police forces in other parts of the country are now working with immigration officers to 
use experience gained during Operation Paladin to work more effectively to safeguard 
children at other ports of entry.  
</p><p> 
270. The Government also added that by 2006 the Serious Organized Crime Agency 
(SOCA) aimed at reducing the harm caused to the United Kingdom and its citizens by 
organized crime including the trafficking of drugs and people would be created. This will 
surely have a country-wide remit. The Home Secretary has made it clear that people 
smuggling and trafficking should be SOCA&#8217;s second priority after drugs trafficking.  
 
271. Furthermore, on 1 April 2005, the Home Secretary announced plans to create a new 
national centre to protect children from sexual exploitation and combat online child abuse. 
This new centre will be called the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) and will 
be affiliated to SOCA and will provide a specific service to address internet-based child 
abuse, as well as developing a strategic role in using its international networks to raise 
awareness, collect intelligence and combat child trafficking.  
 
272.    Finally, the Home Office recently published a draft United Kingdom Action Plan to 
combat Human Trafficking, which was out for public consultation until April 2006 (available 
at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/TacklingTrafficking.pdf). This action plan sets 
out the progress the United Kingdom has made so far in the fight against people trafficking, 
and proposes future plans for building on the existing work in this area. It also aims at 
addressing all forms of trafficking, and covering the prevention, investigation, law 
enforcement, prosecution, and the provision of protection and assistance to all victims of 
trafficking.  
</p>
<p><b>Yemen 
Response to previously transmitted communication  
 
</b>273. On 20 March 2006, the Government responded to the communication sent jointly by 
the Special Rapporteur and the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution 
and child pornography on 13 December 2005 concerning the issue of <b>smuggling of children 
into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</b>. 
 
274. The Government indicated that the said problem was being treated as a social problem 
and that the Chamber of Deputies, the Higher Council for Motherhood and Childhood, the 
Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior, 
a number of non-governmental organizations and international organizations, including 
UNICEF, were concerned with it.  
 
275. According to the Government, the issue of smuggling has a number of causes and a 
study conducted in the governorates of al-Mahwit and Hajjah in 2004 identified several 
aspects contributing to the phenomenon, such as families&#8217; low standard of living and lack of 
employment opportunities, a low level of social awareness, family disputes and unsatisfactory 
public services.  
 
276. The Government agreed with the Special Rapporteur that the problem of trafficking in 
children had increased after the 1990 Gulf War and the return of nearly 2 million Yemeni </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/Add.1 
Page 59 
</p>
<p>&#233;migr&#233;s from Saudi Arabia to their native land. It added that the figure of 3,500 children 
being trafficked into Saudi Arabia every month appears however to be exaggerated. 
Furthermore, a child may be smuggled or leave the country unlawfully as a member of a 
group consisting of the child&#8217;s family of other persons whom the child knows and who are 
related to him, or the operation may be handled by a professional trafficker. The same study 
referred to above found that children who left Yemen did indeed contribute to their families&#8217; 
income and enabled them to enjoy a higher standard of living.  
</p><p> 
277. It also noted that the members of Yemeni society are being made aware of the dangers 
to which these children are exposed, such as having to perform hard and dangerous labour, 
through a human rights information campaign conducted in the hardest-hit regions of the 
country. In fact, according to the Yemeni Government, trafficked children will inevitably be 
at risk of violence and abuse as long as they are out of reach of the protection of their families 
or the competent agencies.  However, there have been no reports of children being subjected 
to sexual abuse and extortion at the hands of border guards or in places of detention. 
 
278. The Government also expressed its appreciation for the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
expression of welcome concerning the creation of a reception centre. The operating budget of 
this centre has been included as a separate item within the overall State budget for 2006.  
 
279. An information campaign on human rights and the hazards and adverse impacts of 
child trafficking and their future was furthermore recently conducted in the governorates of 
Hajja, al-Mahwit, Sa&#8217;dah and al-Mahrah with a view to heightening the awareness of 
children, families and opinion leaders in society.  According to the same study, poverty is 
directly related to the trafficking of children in Yemen. Consequently, low-income family 
support programmes must take this factor into account in their future policies.  
 
280. Yemen signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991, and is also a 
signatory to the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child 
Pornography. The Government indicated that those instruments were reflected in Yemen&#8217;s 
Children&#8217;s Rights Act (law No. 45 of 2002), and as such are the foundations for action in the 
area of the protection and safeguarding of children&#8217;s rights. They are, actually, regarded as 
fundamental to the National Strategy on Childhood and Youth, 2006-2016, which was 
announced at the National Conference on Childhood and Youth held on 19-22 Febuary 2006.  
 
281. Bilateral cooperation measures with Saudi Arabia are also being implemented, in the 
form of action to coordinate the drafting of a bilateral agreement aimed at enhanced 
cooperation to combat child smuggling. The Government added that preparations were under 
way for a joint Yemeni-Saudi field study on the said issue.  
 
282. Concerning young offenders in detention, the Government indicated that they are kept 
separate from adults under Yemeni law. In fact, the issue was addressed in law No. 26 of 
1997, amending a number of the articles of a Republican Decree (law No. 24 of 1992) 
concerning the custody of minors. The amended text of article 11, paragraph (b), reads as 
follows: &#8220;A minor who is at least 12 years of age may be lawfully detained at a police station 
provided he is not detained for more than 24 hours and provided he is held in separate 
quarters and not allowed to associate with older detainees&#8221;. Finally, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
recommendations to ratify a number of instruments, including the Trafficking Protocol, is 
being given due consideration.  
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/23/ Add.1 
Page 60 
</p>
<p>283. The Government also provided information on the smuggling of children into Saudi 
Arabia, available from numerous sources. The Ministry of Interior supplied data on cases of

286.  Finally, the Government concluded by adding that the problem of child 
smuggling is a high-priority issue for the Government. However, it is an issue that calls for 
action on a diverse number of fronts including legislative measures, information technology, 
economic development, and training for the personnel who deal with these children, stronger 
ties of cooperation with neighbouring States, enhancement of society&#8217;s awareness of 
children&#8217;s rights in general and of the hazards of smuggling, and greater participation by the 
local community and by children themselves.
