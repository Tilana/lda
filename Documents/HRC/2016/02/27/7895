<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur has previously noted that education is central to preventing 
and combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, given its 
role in creating new values and attitudes. As a follow-up to his commitment to focus on 
both prevention and enforcement mechanisms in combating racism and racial 
discrimination, the Special Rapporteur has chosen to focus on the role and place of 
education, a decision reinforced by the Human Rights Council, which has requested him to 
address the role of education in preventing racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance in his reports; and encourages States and other stakeholders to provide 
the Special Rapporteur with information on good practices undertaken.1  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur believes that education has the powerful potential to address 
deep-rooted discrimination and the legacy of historical injustices, as well as to act as a 
means to enable individuals and groups to lift themselves out of poverty. As stated in the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action (para. 97), education that is sensitive to, and 
respects cultural diversity, plays an essential role in the prevention and eradication of all 
forms of intolerance and discrimination.  
</p>
<p>3. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 16/33. 
It examines the issue of education in relation to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance. Chapter II provides a summary of the activities of the Special 
Rapporteur from 4 September 2012 to 28 January 2013. In chapter III, the Special 
Rapporteur presents the international framework relating to racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, and education. Chapter IV addresses the issue of the 
equal access to quality education and the challenges faced by disadvantaged and 
discriminated groups. Chapter V considers the contexts that impact on the full enjoyment of 
the right to education without discrimination. Chapter V and chapter VI contains the 
Special Rapporteur&#8223;s conclusions and recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Mauritania, which 
has accepted his request for a follow-up country visit. He hopes to undertake the follow-up 
fact-finding mission to Mauritania before the end of 2013. In February 2012, the 
Government of Sudan has also accepted the visit request of the Special Rapporteur. The 
Special Rapporteur hopes that he will be able to carry out the visit to Sudan in the course of 
his mandate.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur renewed the request to visit South Africa, for which he is 
still awaiting a response from the Government. The initial request to visit South Africa was 
sent by his predecessor on 9 September 2008. The Special Rapporteur also sent a request 
for a follow-up visit to Italy, and visit requests to Algeria, Botswana, Greece, India, 
Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Nepal, Poland, Thailand and Tunisia.  
</p>
<p>  
 1 See Human Rights Council resolution 22/34. </p>


<p>6. From 4 to 10 September 2012, the Special Rapporteur visited the Plurinational State 
of Bolivia. He expresses his sincere gratitude to the Government of the Plurinational State 
of Bolivia for its full cooperation and openness in the preparation and conduct of his visit. 
The report is contained in addendum 1 to the present document.  
</p>
<p>7. From 21 to 28 January 2013, the Special Rapporteur visited Spain. He is very 
grateful to the Government of Spain for its cooperation in the preparation and conduct of 
his visit. The report is included in addendum 2 to the present document.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur participated in the Symposium on the Varieties of European 
Racism(s) in Europe organized by the European Network Against Racism and Open 
Society Foundation in Brussels on 27 and 28 September 2012.  
</p>
<p>9. On 4 and 5 October 2012 the Special Rapporteur participated in the final expert 
workshop on the prohibition of incitement to national, racial or religious hatred held in 
Rabat, Morocco. The Special Rapporteur also contributed to the tenth session of the 
Intergovernmental Working Group on the effective implementation of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action held from 8 to 19 October 2012 in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>10. On 19 November 2012, the Special Rapporteur attended the Second National 
Conference entitled &#8220;Malaysia on the Path to Non-Discrimination, Making it Possible&#8221;, 
held in Kuala Lumpur. 
</p>
<p><b> III. International framework relating to racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and 
education 
</b></p>
<p>11. The role of education in promoting tolerance and understanding has been 
underscored by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (art. 26, para. 2), which spells 
out that, inter alia, education shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among 
all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations 
for the maintenance of peace. In addition, the Durban Declaration points out that education 
is key to changing attitudes and behaviour based on racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance and to promoting tolerance and respect for diversity in 
societies (para. 95). It specifically underlines the links between the right to education and 
the struggle against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and 
the essential role of education, including human rights education and education which is 
sensitive to and respects cultural diversity, especially amongst children and young people, 
in the prevention and eradication of all forms of intolerance and discrimination (para. 97). 
</p>
<p>12. The recognition and realization of education as a human right is instrumental in 
giving effect to the role of education in combating racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, in its articles 13 and 14, comprehensively elaborates on the content of the 
right to education. This right is further reaffirmed by the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and various international human rights 
instruments. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer also to the 
Convention against Discrimination in Education, which requires States inter alia to 
abrogate statutory provisions and administrative instructions which involve discrimination 
in education (art. 3 (a)). </p>


<p>13. The Special Rapporteur also recalls that the Declaration on the Rights of Persons 
Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities provides for the right 
of persons belonging to minorities to have adequate opportunities to learn their mother 
tongue or to have instruction in their mother tongue. The Declaration also calls on States to 
take measures to encourage knowledge of the history, traditions, language and culture of 
the minorities existing within their territory (art. 4, paras. 3 and 4).  
</p>
<p>14. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples emphasizes the 
rights of indigenous peoples to establish and control their educational systems and 
institutions providing education in their own languages, in a manner appropriate to their 
cultural methods of teaching and learning (art. 14, para. 1). Additionally, the Declaration 
recognizes that indigenous children, in particular, have the right to all levels and forms of 
education of the State without discrimination (art. 14, para. 2).  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Equal access to quality education and challenges faced by 
disadvantaged and discriminated groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Ensuring equality in education  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Non-discrimination, physical and economic accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>15. As highlighted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, access 
to education has three overlapping dimensions: non-discrimination, physical accessibility, 
and economic accessibility.2 These aspects should be considered by States when 
undertaking measures for the realization of the right to education and in designing 
programmes in the field of education.  
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that prohibiting racial discrimination in 
education, as required by article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination, does not exclude the resort to temporary special measures 
which aim to bring about equality in the access to education. In this regard, he encourages 
States to implement general recommendation No. 32 (2009) of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination on the meaning and scope of special measures in the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. He also 
shares the view expressed in the recommendations of the Forum on Minority Issues that, 
when the relevant conditions for the application of temporary special measures are satisfied, 
their introduction should be used as a means to recognize the existence of discrimination 
and to eliminate it (A/HRC/10/11/Add.1, para. 12).  
</p>
<p>17.  Physical accessibility implies that educational establishments, services and facilities 
be designed in a way that ensures that they are accessible to all without discrimination 
throughout the national territory. This entails, when necessary, the provision of distance-
learning methods to certain groups, and support by the State for the use of media, such as 
radio broadcasts and other technical solutions, including promoting access to new 
technologies, as well as the establishment of mobile schools for those vulnerable groups 
with nomadic traditions.3 Physical accessibility also entails a school cycle which takes into 
account and is sensitive to the cultural practices that exist within certain groups, including 
</p>
<p>  
  2  See Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 13 (1999) on the right 
</p>
<p>to education, para. 6 (b). 
 3 See Committee on the Rights of the Child, general comment No. 11 (2009) on indigenous children 
</p>
<p>and their rights under the Convention, para. 61. </p>


<p>for instance those minorities or indigenous peoples for which agricultural seasons and 
ceremonial periods are important.4  
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur shares the view that economic accessibility requires that 
education has to be affordable to all, including free primary education.5 However in 
practice, the hidden costs of education, including those related to enrolment and attendance, 
sometimes lead to discrimination. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur recalls that the 
Durban Programme of Action urges States to set up national programmes to promote the 
access to basic social services, including primary education, of individuals and groups who 
are or may be victims of racial discrimination (para. 100). The Programme of Action also 
points out that States should consider establishing financial assistance programmes to 
enable all students to attend higher education institutions (para. 123 (g)). In this connection, 
the Special Rapporteur recalls that education is the primary vehicle by which economically 
and socially marginalized adults and children can lift themselves out of poverty and obtain 
the means to participate fully in their communities.6 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Quality of curriculum  
</b></p>
<p>19. In order to promote the principles of equality and non-discrimination, it is important 
for States to ensure that their general curriculum, and not only the curriculum specifically 
devoted to human rights education, contains adequate and balanced information on the 
contribution of minorities, migrants and other groups living in the territory of the country. 
Tolerance and respect can only be effectively promoted and take root if the narratives of all 
groups of society are known and presented to students from an early age, in order to raise 
awareness of the history, contributions and current socioeconomic situation of those groups. 
Indeed, in addition to the issue of access, it is important that the curriculum promote 
diversity rather than the perpetuation of ideas of racial and ethnic superiority. In some 
countries, school books have promoted racist and xenophobic stereotypes of particular 
groups. In other cases, textbooks have been rewritten to blank out atrocities committed 
against some ethnic groups. The Special Rapporteur believes that an accurate portrayal of 
the history of atrocities perpetrated against discriminated groups is integral to an 
educational system that promotes the values of diversity and to understanding between 
different groups and cultures.  
</p>
<p>20. Education and education systems &#8211; if not carefully designed &#8211; may be used to 
perpetuate negative stereotypes of ethnic groups or to deny them equal access to quality 
education. Other potential negative consequences may be hidden in the contents of the 
curriculum and books, which may include references and materials that contribute to 
stereotyping and demeaning certain groups of society. Such stereotypes may reinforce the 
marginalization of groups, particularly in cases where those groups live in disproportionate 
poverty and lack adequate visibility and representation in public affairs and leadership. 
</p>
<p>21. It is therefore important that States not only develop new materials, but also review 
and amend existing curricula and textbooks with a view to identifying and eventually 
eliminating elements, both textual and visual, which may have the effect of promoting 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance or of reinforcing existing 
deep-rooted negative stereotypes.7

<p><b> 3. Collection of ethnically disaggregated data  
</b></p>
<p>22. The lack of ethnically disaggregated data and statistics remains a significant 
challenge in assessing adequately the effective access to quality education by all 
individuals, including ethnic groups. The Special Rapporteur is aware that in some 
countries, for historical reasons, it is legally prohibited to collect official ethnic data and 
statistics, and that a number of States do not collect or keep such data. Consequently, it 
remains difficult to monitor and assess progress.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that the lack of such data leaves many 
incidents of discrimination unrecorded. This further reinforces the cycles of racial 
discrimination and exclusion of vulnerable groups. In addition, even where States have 
made good progress, the lack of relevant data means that such progress is not adequately 
reported.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Teacher training, awareness-raising and early education to human rights 
</b></p>
<p>24. Teachers bear the responsibility of shaping the learning experience for young 
learners. The Special Rapporteur recommends that teachers at all levels of education and 
both in public, private and non-formal education regularly participate in training aimed at 
promoting respect for human rights and the fight against racism.  
</p>
<p>25. Issues related to racial prejudice should form an integral part of the curricula for 
teacher training and racist and discriminatory behaviours by teaching staff should also be 
addressed. Sensitizing teachers to the history of the various vulnerable groups in the 
country and acquainting them with the socioeconomic constraints and structural 
disadvantages and discrimination faced by those individuals and groups on the basis of their 
ethnic origin significantly contributes to raising teachers&#8223; awareness of the sometimes 
covert prejudices faced by such groups and providing them with efficient tools to tackle 
such behaviours head-on. Teachers should also be made familiar with international norms 
prohibiting racial discrimination and their applicability under domestic law. Training 
should not be a one-off event, but regularly repeated, and should include the sensitization of 
teaching staff, in order to ensure that their actions are based on and promote the principles 
of non-discrimination, mutual respect and tolerance. 
</p>
<p>26. A well-balanced and inclusive mainstream school curriculum, which reflects the 
diversity of the country and takes into account the contributions of all groups of society, 
accompanied by an adequate human rights-specific education, may have even more impact 
if it is also accompanied by targeted and ongoing awareness-raising and media campaigns 
at the national and local levels. Such campaigns may target specific groups or sectors of 
society, or indeed certain areas of life, such as schools or sports, to highlight problems 
related to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance. The Durban 
Programme of Action, for instance, calls upon States to promote education on the human 
rights of migrants and to carry out public information and awareness-raising campaigns in 
order to ensure that the general public receives accurate information regarding migrants and 
migration issues, including the positive contribution of migrants to the host society; and to 
inform the public of the vulnerable situation of migrants, in particular those who are in an 
irregular situation (para. 27). Cultural programmes, art projects, exhibitions and theatre 
performances aimed at promoting tolerance and the diversity of experiences of different 
groups of society also have an important effect in countering racism and racial 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>27. Children enter the education system at an impressionable age and the ideas, values 
and attitudes to which they are exposed through the education system shape the kind of 
adults and citizens they become significantly. Age-appropriate and targeted human rights 
education should therefore start early on, preferably at preschool levels, in order to sensitize </p>


<p>children and adolescents to prevalent prejudices and intolerance held about certain racial or 
ethnic groups, and to address these phenomena in a way that is the most appropriate for the 
developmental stage of the child. This may take place not only in history, literature or civic 
education classes, but also through art, such as music, theatre and story-telling.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Disadvantaged and discriminated groups  
</b></p>
<p>28. While recalling that there is no hierarchy between the victims of racism and racial 
discrimination, the Special Rapporteur would like to bring to the attention of States the 
situation faced by some specific groups of individuals, including, migrants, refugees, 
asylum seekers, people of African descent, victims of caste-based discrimination and 
members of minorities, including Roma, whose situation has also been addressed by his 
predecessors.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers 
</b></p>
<p>29. Migrants and their children face multiple discrimination, including in the enjoyment 
of the right to education. In its general recommendation No. 30 (2004) on discrimination 
against non-citizens, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination calls upon 
States to remove obstacles that prevent the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural 
rights by non-citizens, including in the field of education (para. 29). The Committee further 
requires that public educational institutions are open to non-citizens and the children of 
undocumented migrants (para. 30). States should also avoid segregated schooling and 
different standards of treatment to non-citizens (para. 31).  
</p>
<p>30. Securing the right to education of migrants in an irregular situation remains a 
challenge in many parts of the world. Undocumented migrants regularly face a high risk of 
exploitation in many regards, and the realization of the right to education of their children 
remains precarious. The situation faced by children of undocumented migrants is 
potentially even more difficult given the legal barriers they have to confront on a day-to-
day basis. For instance, undocumented migrants&#8223; children need to be registered in order to 
be able to attend school. Therefore, they may be prevented from enrolling for free primary 
education because they are unable to produce the official documents required, such as a 
valid residence permit, birth certificate or medical records.  
</p>
<p>31. Their situation may also be compounded by further barriers, such as the fear of 
being reported by teachers and school authorities to immigration authorities. While school 
administrators in many countries are not required to report undocumented migrants&#8223; 
children to the relevant immigration authorities, in some other countries a general &#8220;duty to 
report&#8221; exists, thereby providing disincentives to parents in an irregular situation to 
enrolling their children in formal education. It is therefore important that States put in place 
provisions to ensure that educational institutions do not report those children with an 
irregular status to the authorities. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that 
schools should, as far as possible, avoid asking any questions on migration status or related 
issues that may reveal an irregular migrant status.  
</p>
<p>32. In many countries, children can only be enrolled in educational institutions at the 
beginning of the school year, thus children of undocumented migrants are deprived of 
access to education for prolonged periods of time.  
</p>
<p>33. Economic concerns may also further compound the obstacles faced by 
undocumented migrants&#8223; children. Although compulsory primary education in State schools 
is free of charge, the hidden, indirect costs associated with enrolment and attendance may 
prove a disproportionately heavy burden for many such children, who may be reluctant to 
apply for funding to cover such expenses.  </p>


<p>34. One of the issues disproportionately affecting migrants, including those in an 
irregular situation, is the difficulties surrounding the recognition of their qualifications and 
diplomas in host countries. Upon completing their studies, undocumented migrants in 
several countries do not automatically receive diplomas, given that certain countries only 
issue such documentation upon presentation of birth certificates or social security numbers, 
even in cases where these were not required at the time of enrolment. In terms of the 
recognition of qualifications, States should recognize those acquired outside their 
territories, although certain restrictions may be permissible.8 The Durban Programme of 
Action also encourages States to promote the recognition of the educational, professional 
and technical credentials of migrants, with a view to maximizing their contribution to their 
new States of residence (para. 30 (f)). Refusal to recognize the qualifications of 
undocumented migrants may also contribute to their exclusion from the skilled labour 
markets and confine them almost exclusively to irregular jobs, in the areas of domestic 
service, agriculture and construction.  
</p><p>35. In some countries, asylum seekers are held in special accommodation centres where 
access to education for their children may not be available, or may be of inferior level and 
quality to that enjoyed by the general population. In many countries, such special 
accommodation centres for asylum seekers are often located in remote areas where 
mainstream education facilities are difficult to access for children. There are further 
problems compounding the lack of logistical access in these cases, including the inadequate 
living conditions in some of the receptions centres and parents&#8223; lack of financial resources 
to cover the extra costs of school material. The children of asylum seekers may also not be 
adequately informed by the authorities of their right to attend public education institutions.  
</p>
<p>36. An additional compounding problem is the emerging trend witnessed in some 
countries of the education of asylum seekers and refugees being &#8220;outsourced&#8221; to non-
governmental organizations and United Nations agencies.  
</p>
<p>37. In addition, separated children who have applied for asylum regularly face great 
difficulties in enrolling in schools. In cases where their asylum applications are rejected, the 
concerned children will be normally able to attend school until the day of the enforcement 
of the return decision.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Members of minorities, including Roma 
</b></p>
<p>38. National or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities also face various impediments 
to accessing education, resulting either from a policy of historical discrimination or 
injustice, or from poverty, poor health and lack of adequate sanitation, and other structural 
factors.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur recalls that, in accordance with international human rights 
standards, persons belonging to national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities should, 
wherever possible, have adequate opportunities to learn in or have instruction in their 
mother tongue.9 Minorities should also be allowed to maintain their own educational 
institutions, as long as the quality of education and other relevant standards conform to 
those applicable to mainstream public schools, in line with international human rights 
standards; and provided that attendance of such institutions is through choice and not 
compulsory.  
</p>
<p>  
 8 See the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
</p>
<p>Members of Their Families, art. 52, para. 2 (b).  
 9 See the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
</p>
<p>Linguistic Minorities, art. 4, para. 3.  </p>


<p>40. The Durban Programme of Action calls upon States to ensure that Roma, Gypsy, 
Sinti and Traveller children and youth, especially girls, are given equal access to education 
(para. 39). The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in its general 
recommendation No. 27 (2000) on discrimination against Roma, also underlined that States 
should support the inclusion of all children of Roma origin in the school system and act to 
reduce dropout rates (para. 17).  
</p>
<p>41. While de jure segregation in schools has been abolished in various parts of the 
world, de facto segregation remains a challenge, particularly for Roma children. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur notes that there appears to be a widespread practice in 
Central and Eastern Europe whereby students of Roma origin are channelled into special 
schools for children with learning disabilities, regardless of their intellectual abilities. Such 
a practice has been challenged in both domestic and regional human rights litigation. In 
particular, the European Court of Human Rights has highlighted these problems in various 
countries.  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned that de facto racial segregation in 
education remains widespread in many countries, despite significant improvements by 
Governments in the regions. These practices may include the segregation of Roma children 
into special remedial schools for children with developmental disabilities; segregation of 
children into Roma &#8220;ghetto schools&#8221; or all-Roma classes; and denial of enrolment in 
mainstream schools. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the views and recommendations 
made by his predecessor in a report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/17/40). He also 
recalls the views expressed by the treaty bodies, including the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination in its concluding observations, that certain States need 
to intensify their efforts in order to improve the educational situation of Roma, including 
through measures to increase their enrolment in mainstream schools; by recruiting teachers 
and other school personnel from among members of the Roma community; and by 
sensitizing teachers and other education professionals to the social fabric and world views 
of Roma children. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. People of African descent 
</b></p>
<p>43. Available information shows that measures aimed at favouring a more inclusive 
education have been implemented with respect to people of African descent in some 
regions, including in the Americas. For instance, in a number of countries, legislation in 
force requires public universities to guarantee half of their places to students from public 
schools, in order to ensure better access to these universities for those students from a 
background of poverty, which includes students of African descent. Other positive 
examples in the region &#8211; where a large population of persons identify themselves as being 
of African descent &#8211; include scholarships and loans which can be written off for students of 
African descent with limited economic resources and good academic performance.  
</p>
<p>44. Despite some positive initiatives, studies and findings by international and national 
bodies show that people of African descent still have a limited access to quality and higher 
education, and that their situation with respect to structural discrimination in this area 
remains a major challenge. Indeed, the information obtained shows that the educational 
infrastructure in those areas where the residing population is mostly Afro-descendant is 
insufficient; illiteracy is higher; indexes of schooling are lower; and the children and youth 
have fewer years of education. These circumstances result in only a very small percentage 
of the Afro-descendant population being able to enter and complete higher education or 
university studies. The information obtained also points to inappropriate studies 
programmes and educational methods; the economic difficulties in affording education 
costs; and the gap in incomes between Afro-descendant and non Afro-descendant people as 
the education level increases.  </p>


<p>45. Certain regional mechanisms have also reported several cases of concern relating to 
access to education for people of African descent, including cases where prizes have been 
granted according to race; situations of de facto racial discrimination at schools; limitations 
on the access to some university programmes; overrepresentation of Afro-descendants in 
special classes; disproportionate rates of disciplinary actions for Afro-descendants; 
underrepresentation of Afro-descendants in advanced or high-level courses and 
programmes; racial harassment; underrepresentation of Afro-descendants among teachers 
or administrative staff in educational establishments; and the failure to cover the 
contribution of the Afro-descendant population in history classes. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Victims of caste-based discrimination, including Dalits 
</b></p>
<p>46.  As highlighted by the previous mandate holder (A/HRC/17/40, para. 27), there is 
serious concern about an estimated 250 million people around the world at risk of human 
rights violations on the grounds of caste and other systems based on inherited status. 
Indeed, reports received confirm that discrimination against Dalits in the educational 
system is a widespread problem in caste-affected countries. Alienation, social exclusion and 
physical abuse are present throughout all levels of education, from primary to university 
education. Illiteracy and dropout rates among Dalits are very high due to a number of social 
and physical factors. Legislation on the issue is limited, and measures to address the issue 
are often inadequately implemented. The forms of structural discrimination and abuse that 
Dalit children face in schools are often so stigmatizing that they are forced to drop out of 
school. One of the main issues is discriminatory practices conducted by teachers, which 
may include corporal punishment, denial of access to school water supplies, segregation in 
classrooms, and forcing Dalit children to perform &#8220;manual scavenging&#8221; on and around 
school premises. In addition, Dalit children face discriminatory attitudes from fellow 
students and the community as a whole, in particular from higher caste members, who 
perceive education for Dalits as a threat to village hierarchies and power relations. 
Intolerance of, prejudice against and harassment of Dalits are equally prevalent in 
institutions of higher education, where discrimination is practised by senior upper-caste 
students, teachers, faculties and university administrations. The caste bias manifests itself in 
the way teachers ignore Dalit students and unjustly fail them in exams and in the 
unwillingness of the university administration to assist and support Dalits. Reportedly, as a 
grave consequence of this harassment, a disproportionate number of Dalit students have 
committed suicide in some countries.  
</p>
<p>47. In 2006, the Special Rapporteur on the right to education recommended that 
Governments remove known barriers to the enrolment and retention in school of young and 
teenage girls belonging to all ethnic groups, castes and communities that are discriminated 
against (E/CN.4/2006/45, paras. 80&#8211;85 and 140). The Special Rapporteur urges the 
concerned States to take appropriate measures to ensure the right to non-discrimination in 
education for victims of caste-based discrimination, including Dalits. He recalls general 
recommendation No. 29 (2002) of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination on article 1, paragraph 1, of the Convention (descent), which recommends, 
inter alia, the prohibition and elimination of practices of segregation directed against 
members of descent-based communities in education, and the education of the population 
as a whole in a spirit of non-discrimination and respect for the communities subject to 
descent-based discrimination. Furthermore, it recommends the adoption of special measures 
in favour of descent-based groups and communities in order to ensure their access to 
education. The Special Rapporteur, moreover, considers that national and local authorities 
should take effective measures to reduce dropout rates and increase enrolment rates among 
children of affected communities at all levels of public and private schooling. Concrete 
steps should be taken to: eradicate the existing prevalence of caste-based discrimination in 
schools, including stereotypical and demeaning references, for example, in schoolbooks; </p>


<p>ensure the inclusion of children of affected communities in schools; and disseminate 
general information about the importance of non-discrimination and respect for affected 
communities in the entire education system. The Special Rapporteur also encourages States 
to enable and improve educational and professional training for Dalit girls and boys so that 
they can move to professions of their choice.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p><b> V. Contexts impacting on the full enjoyment of the right to 
education without discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Racially motivated violence in schools 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that States should not lose sight of the impact 
that racism, racial discrimination and intolerance in general have on students or the ways in 
which it specifically contributes to hostile environments in schools and educational 
institutions in general.  
</p>
<p>49. As stated in the Durban Programme of Action, both States and non-governmental 
organizations, as well as the private sector in general, should work towards reducing 
violence motivated by racism, including by developing specifically targeted educational 
materials in order to teach young people the importance of tolerance and respect (para. 74).  
</p>
<p>50. Criminal justice and law enforcement responses to racially motivated acts in schools 
should be used only in the most serious cases and only as a last resort. The introduction of a 
&#8220;zero tolerance policy&#8221; for minor infractions committed by students leads to the 
criminalization of misbehaviour in school, which in practice may contribute to schools 
becoming an entry point to the criminal justice system, especially in neighbourhoods where 
minorities are overrepresented. Instead of resorting to such drastic measures, schools and 
relevant authorities should put stronger emphasis on raising awareness of tolerance and 
non-discrimination, and the values of a multicultural society.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Education and conflicts 
</b></p>
<p>51. The dangers of the failure to educate people about human rights in education have 
been evident in many situations of conflict, where education has been instrumentalized and 
deployed as a tool for ethnic or racial stereotyping. For instance, the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights in Rwanda described in 1997 how successive Governments of 
Rwanda had instrumentalized education in the preparation of genocide:  
</p>
<p>The schools, for their part, took it upon themselves to develop actual theories of 
ethnic differences, based on a number of allegedly scientific data which were 
essentially morphological and historiographical. In the first case, the two main 
groups can be differentiated by appearance, as the Tutsi are &#8222;long&#8223;, whereas the Hutu 
are &#8222;short&#8223;; the Tutsi are handsome, genuine &#8222;black-skinned Europeans&#8223; while the 
Hutu are &#8222;ugly&#8223;, genuine &#8222;Negroes&#8223;. The fact that the Hutu occupied the country 
</p>
<p>before the Tutsi makes them indigenous, whereas the Tutsi, as descendants of 
Europeans, are invaders. These purportedly scientific data inevitably created a 
psychosis of fear and mistrust which gradually became a veritable culture of mutual </p>


<p>fear and led to another theory, that of pre-emptive self-defence based on the &#8222;kill or 
be killed&#8223; principle. This theory was a major factor in the 1994 genocide.10  
</p>
<p>52. Ensuring access to education during armed conflicts, including ethnic conflicts, is a 
major challenge and is crucial to preventing racism and racial discrimination in the area of 
education during such periods. Indeed, students belonging to minority groups, as well as 
other disadvantaged groups, including migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, are often 
disproportionately affected during such conflicts. The Special Rapporteur recalls that the 
consequences of armed conflicts on education constitute serious problems that need 
increased attention from States. Indeed, armed conflicts, including ethnic conflicts, lead to 
significant and grave obstacles in accessing education, including the destruction of schools 
used for military objectives; psychological trauma and injury suffered by children and 
young people; the recruitment of child soldiers; the diversion of national budgets for war 
resources; and the internal displacement of families.  
</p>
<p>53. Education can play a key role in preventing conflicts. As stated by the previous 
mandate holder, one effective way to prevent and address the eruption of a conflict is to 
ensure the equality of all individuals and equal access to economic, social and cultural 
rights for all individuals within the State&#8223;s territory and subject to its jurisdiction, and 
education is needed to complement legislative measures (A/HRC/14/43, para. 67). 
Education is also crucial in consolidating peace and ensuring development in post-conflict 
situations. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur recommends ensuring that education 
policy is an integral part of the programme of consolidating peace and integrating 
assessments of post-conflict situations and peace consolidation into national education 
strategies. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Education and the economic crisis 
</b></p>
<p>54. Reports received show that, in the field of education, financing presents a number of 
difficult and conflicting issues. Indeed, although several Governments have earmarked 
more resources for education, the level of commitment overall varies greatly. There is also 
evidence in some regions of growth in international aid, particularly for basic education, 
albeit with some failures in application. In the last few years, many countries have been 
experiencing a severe economic crisis, which in some instances has resulted in drastic 
budgetary restrictions and affects the education sector. It is essential that States carefully 
evaluate the potential impact of budgetary restrictions on the enjoyment of the right to 
education without discrimination. Budgetary stringency must not have a disproportionate 
impact on the enjoyment of the right to education, especially for disadvantaged groups, 
including minorities, Roma, people of African descent, migrants, undocumented migrants, 
refugees, asylum seekers and the victims of caste-based discrimination, since this could 
threaten the progress already achieved by some countries, and lead to increased 
marginalization and exclusion of part of these vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress the crucial importance of education in 
the prevention of all forms of racism, xenophobia, intolerance and discrimination, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular human rights education and education which is sensitive to and respects 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural diversity. The fundamental role of education as a facilitative right is linked to 
</b></p>
<p>  
 10 Report on the situation of human rights in Rwanda, E/CN.4/1997/61, para. 25.  </p>


<p><b>the effective enjoyment of all other human rights, as education acts as a multiplier in 
</b></p>
<p><b>enhancing the other human rights and freedoms. Such is the importance of education 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the prevention of racial discrimination and the enjoyment of the civil, political, 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic, cultural and social rights.  
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>Although the Special Rapporteur welcomes some of the efforts and initiatives 
undertaken by various States to prohibit discrimination and segregation in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>educational system and improve access to education opportunities for all individuals 
</b></p>
<p><b>and groups, he notes that certain groups and individuals, including people of African 
</b></p>
<p><b>descent, minorities, Roma, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, and victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>caste-based discrimination still face obstacles and challenges to the full enjoyment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their right to education, as they experience a low level of education </b>&#8211;<b> in both quality 
</b></p>
<p><b>and duration </b>&#8211;<b> and discrimination and segregation in schools. This persistence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination among these vulnerable groups and individuals remains a challenge to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the construction of a tolerant society which rests upon an inclusive education system.  
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur would like to make the 
following recommendations:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) States should recognize the important role of education in combating 
</b></p>
<p><b>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in particular in 
</b></p>
<p><b>promoting the principles of tolerance and respect to ethnic, religious and cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>diversity and preventing the proliferation of extremist racist and xenophobic 
</b></p>
<p><b>movements and propaganda, especially among the youth;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) States should take all necessary measures to ensure equality and non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination with regard to access to education, training and career development in 
</b></p>
<p><b>education. They should pay attention to availability, accessibility, acceptability and 
</b></p>
<p><b>adaptability as essential features for assessing the fulfilment of their obligations in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>realization of the right to education as detailed in general comment No. 13 (1999) of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the right to education;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) In particular, States should adopt and implement laws that prohibit 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination on the basis of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin at all 
</b></p>
<p><b>levels of education, both formal and non-formal, take all appropriate measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>eliminate obstacles limiting the access of children to education, including through 
</b></p>
<p><b>affirmative action programmes of a temporary nature, and ensure that all children, 
</b></p>
<p><b>especially those of African descent, minorities, Roma, migrants, refugees and asylum 
</b></p>
<p><b>seekers, and the victims of caste-based discrimination have access without 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination to good-quality education, including higher education. Measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>eliminate obstacles limiting access to quality education include committing 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate resources to eliminating inequalities in educational outcomes;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The new information and communications technologies, including the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Internet as an educational tool, are a positive contribution to combating racism 
</b></p>
<p><b>through rapid and far-reaching communication and States should be encouraged to 
</b></p>
<p><b>use these technologies to combat manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance in cyberspace;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) States should recognize the important role of formal and non-formal 
</b></p>
<p><b>education in the deconstruction of prejudices, positive change of negative perceptions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>enhanced understanding and social cohesion. To this end, States should be encouraged 
</b></p>
<p><b>in implementing educational activities and measures, including human rights training 
</b></p>
<p><b>at various levels, to prevent and combat effectively racism, racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance;  </b></p>


<p><b>(f) States should encourage an accurate reflection of history in education so 
</b></p>
<p><b>as to avoid stereotypes and distortion or falsification of historical facts, which could 
</b></p>
<p><b>lead to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. States 
</b></p>
<p><b>should also ensure that textbooks and other educational materials reflect accurately 
</b></p>
<p><b>historical facts as they relate to past tragedies and atrocities, as this reflects the 
</b></p>
<p><b>complex linkages between education, identity-building and outbreak of conflicts;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) States should be encouraged to provide human rights education or 
</b></p>
<p><b>training with a strong anti-discrimination component for students in schools and 
</b></p>
<p><b>universities, teachers, journalists, State officials, civil servants, judges, law 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforcement officials, military personnel, humanitarian workers and staff involved in 
</b></p>
<p><b>peacekeeping and peace-building operations. A focus on the effective prevention of 
</b></p>
<p><b>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance during such 
</b></p>
<p><b>training, in accordance with the provisions of the International Convention on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Durban Declaration and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Programme of Action, is particularly important;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Teachers at all levels of education should benefit from specialized 
</b></p>
<p><b>training, including awareness-raising, in how to prevent racism, xenophobia and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>forms of discrimination. Special emphasis should be placed on the situation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>minority or vulnerable groups within their country, such as Roma or other minorities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons of African descent, Roma, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims of caste-based discrimination. International norms prohibiting racism and 
</b></p>
<p><b>racial discrimination and their implementation under domestic law should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>emphasized in the curriculum;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) States should also continue their efforts to combat racism, racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, xenophobia and other forms of discrimination outside the educational 
</b></p>
<p><b>system. In this regard, efforts undertaken in the educational field, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>through human rights education, will have an enhanced impact if measures are 
</b></p>
<p><b>accompanied by targeted and ongoing media and awareness-raising campaigns to 
</b></p>
<p><b>sensitize the public to the realities and challenges faced by persons victims of racism, 
</b></p>
<p><b>intolerance and discrimination;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) States should ensure safe school environments, free from violence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>harassment motivated by racism; and provide appropriate assistance to victims and 
</b></p>
<p><b>public education to prevent incidents of violence motivated by racism;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) States should pursue human rights education and guarantee access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>education without discrimination during conflicts; ensure that an education 
</b></p>
<p><b>programme is an integral part of the policies of consolidating peace; and integrate 
</b></p>
<p><b>assessments of post-conflicts situations and peace consolidation into national 
</b></p>
<p><b>education strategies;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) States should carefully evaluate the potential impact of budgetary 
</b></p>
<p><b>restrictions on education, and ensure that they do not have a discriminatory and 
</b></p>
<p><b>disproportionate impact on the enjoyment of the right to education of disadvantaged 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups, including minorities, Roma, people of African descent, migrants, 
</b></p>
<p><b>undocumented migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and the victims of caste-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Finally, States should duly cooperate inter alia with civil society actors, 
</b></p>
<p><b>non-governmental organizations, national human rights institutions and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international community in providing quality and accessible education to all individuals 
</b></p>
<p><b>without discrimination based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin.
