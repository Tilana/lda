<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights visited Bosnia and Herzegovina 
from 13 to 24 May 2013 at the invitation of the Government. She visited Sarajevo, Mostar, 
Stolac, Jajce, Banja Luka, Br&#269;ko and Srebrenica. She met with a number of senior 
government officials at the level of the State, the two entities and Br&#269;ko District, as well as 
with senior cantonal and municipal officials responsible in the areas of culture, science, 
education and youth affairs. She also met representatives of the Commission to Preserve 
National Monuments, established under annex 8 to the General Framework Agreement for 
Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the institution of the Human Rights Ombudsman, 
directors of cultural and educational institutions, artists, academics, civil society 
representatives, United Nations agencies and other international organizations. She visited 
several schools and memorials.  
</p>
<p>2. Thorough discussions were held with all interlocutors on the successes and 
challenges in implementing cultural rights in the country, particularly with regard to history 
teaching, memorialization issues, participation in cultural life and the freedom of cultural 
institutions. The Special Rapporteur considered these issues with a view to assisting the 
Government and other relevant actors in their efforts to address the challenges and 
obstacles they meet in this regard.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the invitation to undertake the 
visit, which enabled her to deepen her understanding of issues relating to her mandate, 
including the teaching and writing of history, and memorialization processes in post-
conflict and divided societies.1 She expresses her gratitude to all those who have given her 
the benefit of their time and expertise.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General context: legacies of the conflict and impact on 
cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political and administrative structure 
</b></p>
<p>4. Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its independence from the Socialist Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia in March 1992. Three and a half years of armed conflict followed, 
ending with the signing of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina (Dayton Agreement) and the annexes thereto in December 1995. Annex 4 to 
the Agreement established the constitutional framework of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Annex 
6 addressed the issue of human rights protection, referring to, among other international 
instruments, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>5. Annex 8 to the Dayton Agreement contains the Agreement on the Commission to 
Preserve National Monuments, demonstrating the vital importance of cultural heritage 
matters in the post-conflict period. Significantly, from the outset of the war, monuments, 
cultural institutions such as museums and libraries, and mosques and churches were heavily 
and deliberately shelled as the symbols of the &#8220;others&#8221;, their ideology or faith, as were other 
institutions closely associated with the former Yugoslavia. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/25/49/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>6. The Dayton Agreement created three separate autonomous regions, namely, the 
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska and Br&#269;ko District, while the 
Washington Agreement, signed in 1994, established the canton system at the level of 
federation. The Dayton Agreement did end the war but, in the process, together with the 
Washington Agreement,<b> </b>it established a complex political and administrative structure that 
has resulted in serious challenges for consensus-building and decision-making today. The 
country has 14 administrative jurisdictions (State level, two entities, Br&#269;ko District and 10 
cantons in the Federation), and a plethora of ministries and governmental agencies. As 
stressed by the High Representative responsible for overseeing the implementation of the 
civilian aspects of the Agreement, between January and October 2013, not a single new law 
was adopted at the level of the State.<footnote name="2">9
 See A/HRC/23/34. </footnote> The Special Rapporteur hopes that current 
discussions on possible constitutional reform at the federation level will lead to a simpler 
and more efficient governance system, at least in that entity.  
</p>
<p>7. The lack of consensus, especially between the two entities, regarding the fate of the 
State of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the main contentious issue underlying current 
difficulties. The absence of a shared perspective on the future is grounded in deep 
disagreements regarding the past, in particular events of the two world wars and the 1992-
1995 war. Divergent viewpoints of the past are used to justify different objectives in the 
present and the future. Bosniak political elites present the contemporary State of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina as the natural result of historical processes and essential for preventing 
violence against the Bosniaks and the narrowing of their living space. Likewise, Serbian 
political elites present the creation of Republika Srpska in 1992 as also rooted in past events 
and necessary for protecting the Bosnian Serb population against violence and for 
protecting their interests. Bosnian Croat parties also use historical events to legitimize their 
battle for more rights in similar fashion. &#8220;Bosnia and Herzegovina is confronted &#8211; like no 
other country &#8211; with the coexistence and competition of three official memory narratives 
and ethno-national identity constructions.&#8221;<footnote name="3">7
  See A/68/296. </footnote>  
</p>
<p>8. This disagreement among political elites on the fate of the State results not only in 
direct challenges in carrying out State responsibilities, as provided for under the 
Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina; it also impedes the effective functioning of State 
institutions. It does not help that, in addition, some representatives of the Republika Srpska 
openly advocate for its independence and the dissolution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<footnote name="4">S/2013/646, annex, paras. 6 and 18. </footnote>  
</p>
<p>9. Cultural institutions have been hijacked in this discussion, as exemplified by the 
current uncertainty surrounding the fate of seven major cultural institutions of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina: the National Museum, which had to close in 2012, as well as the National and 
University Library, the National Gallery, the Museum of History, the Film Archives 
Kinoteka, the Library for the Blind and Visually Impaired Persons, and the Museum of 
Theatre and Literature. These institutions were created by the pre-war Socialist Republic of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, but were never accepted by all as the official State institutions 
after the conflict.  
</p>
<p>10. The Republika Srpska has established its own &#8220;mirror institutions&#8221;, such as the 
Peoples&#8217; and University Library of Republika Srpska, the Library for the Blind and 
Visually Disabled, the Kinoteka in Pale and the Museum of Contemporary Art, sometimes 
upgrading former branches of one of the above-mentioned seven institutions or pre-existing

<p>smaller institutions. Some of these cultural institutions in Republika Srpska contest that the 
above-mentioned seven institutions should be the nation-wide &#8220;State institutions&#8221;, 
advocating instead for parallel institutions in both the Federation of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and Republika Srpska, with dual membership in international organizations, 
such as the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions. Cultural 
institutions in Republika Srpska receive financial support from the Government of 
Republika Srpska for their operational part and salaries, and seem to be functioning well. 
</p>
<p>11. The Ministry of Civil Affairs provided funds to the above-mentioned seven 
institutions until 2010. Institutional funding was replaced by project grants in 2012. This 
new financing modality enabled the funding of projects developed by Republika Srpska 
cultural institutions on an equal basis with the above-mentioned institutions. The latter, 
however, no longer receive operational costs or salaries owing to the controversy over 
whether the State or the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina should finance them. As a 
result, they are struggling to keep their collections protected and their doors open. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur met with representatives of many of these institutions in 
both Sarajevo and Banja Luka, and expresses her concern at the fate of the seven 
institutions, their collections and, consequently, the opportunities for people of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina to have access to and enjoy their own cultural heritage. The Special 
Rapporteur received testimonies that cooperation works well between some institutions 
across the entities, for example, between the Contemporary Art Museum of Banja Luka and 
the National Gallery of Sarajevo, enabling Bosnia and Herzegovina to be represented at the 
Venice Biennale in 2013 after a long absence. This is not, however, always the case, and 
relations between the two libraries do not seem satisfactory. While the Sarajevo Library 
continues to send a copy of its deposit collection to the Banja Luka Library, the latter does 
not reciprocate. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur notes with interest that, in November 2013, the Federation 
Government decided to temporarily take responsibilities for five of the seven above-
mentioned institutions (all except the National Museum and the Kinoteka) and to co-
finance them until a permanent decision is adopted at the State level to resolve their status. 
This is a welcome development. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that the status and fate of other prominent 
cultural institutions remain uncertain, such as the Olympic Museum in Sarajevo, which was 
heavily targeted during the war, together with its sports installations, and the Anti-Fascist 
Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ) Museum in Jajce. Many see these 
two institutions as testimonies of the history of Yugoslavia.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Population and identity 
</b></p>
<p>15. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the main population groups, which were also the parties 
to the conflict, are those termed by the Dayton Agreement as &#8220;constituent peoples&#8221;: 
Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs. Today, most Bosniaks and Croats live in the Federation of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, while most Serbs live in Republika Srpska. Generally, most 
Bosniaks are Muslim, Croats are Roman Catholic and Serbs are Orthodox Christians. 
Seventeen recognized national minorities in the country constituted less than 1 per cent of 
the population in the 1991 census.<footnote name="5">3. Unfortunately, an assessment widely shared in the country is that the reform did not 
bring about significant progress. The main curricula currently used in Bosnia and </footnote> They comprise Albanians, Czechs, Germans, 
Hungarians, Italians, Jews, Macedonians, Montenegrins, Poles, Roma, Romanians, 
Russians, Ruthenians, Slovaks, Slovenes, Turks and Ukrainians.

<p><b>A/HRC/25/49/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>16. All persons falling outside the &#8220;constituent peoples&#8221; categories are classified as 
&#8220;others&#8221; in the Dayton Agreement. This classification is problematic. In addition to the 17 
recognized national minorities, it includes other national, ethnic, religious and linguistic 
groups, as well as persons of mixed descent who do not self-identify as one particular 
ethnic group, and those who identify themselves as Bosnian. 
</p>
<p>17. Tensions over identity issues delayed the latest census of population and households, 
which was finally conducted in October 2013 as the first post-war census; the full results of 
the census will be published in 2014. The authorities should be congratulated for this 
important achievement, as it will enable the country to attain a better understanding of the 
impact of the war on all population groups and their distribution and numbers within the 
country, which has undergone significant changes since the war.  
</p>
<p>18. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the questionnaire envisaged for the census 
was being discussed, regarding in particular the identification of national/ethnic and 
religious backgrounds. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that, in the questionnaire 
used for the census, national/ethnic identity has not been fused with religious identity, and 
that persons were not required to declare their affiliations. Semi-open questions on 
national/ethnic affiliation, religious affiliation and mother tongue allowed for a variety of 
responses beyond Bosniak, Croat and Serb.6  
</p>
<p><b> C. Over-emphasis on ethnic, linguistic and religious affiliations 
</b></p>
<p>19. Many international and European human rights mechanisms have expressed serious 
concern regarding the over-emphasis on ethnic, religious and linguistic affiliations in the 
country&#8217;s constitutional and legislative framework, as well as in policies applicable at the 
various levels of the State and entities.<footnote name="7">6. Today, territories in Bosnia and Herzegovina are commonly identified as 
community-specific, with substantial consequences in terms of the space made available for 
interaction. Places such as cultural and art centres, city parks, sports grounds and facilities 
are needed in locations where, regardless of ethno-national affiliation, people will feel free 
to interact. In Mostar, for example, people do not travel &#8220;deep&#8221; into the area over the other </footnote>  
</p>
<p>20. Ethnicity, religion and language have become prominent group markers and dividing 
lines in society, accentuated by the conflict and perpetuated through the Dayton Agreement, 
which divided the country largely along ethnic, religious and linguistic lines. De facto 
impediments to freedom of movement resulting from, for example, the fragmented system 
of administration and education, obstruct interaction between people and deepen mistrust 
between communities. Such divisions constitute a serious obstacle to social cohesion, and 
are conducive to violations of cultural rights, in particular, the right of each person to 
manifest her/his own identity, to participate (or not) in particular aspects of cultural life, 
and to have access to one&#8217;s own cultural heritage, as well as that of others. Artificial 
boundaries have been created between peoples, and are being entrenched.  
</p>
<p>21. The hierarchy established between constituent peoples and others is not compatible 
with human rights standards, including in particular the principle of non-discrimination.<footnote name="8">1. The Special Rapporteur met with members of the Commission to Preserve National 
Monuments, established under annex 8 to the Dayton Agreement to &#8220;receive and decide on 
petitions for the designation of property having cultural, historic, religious or ethnic 
importance as national monuments&#8221; (art. IV). Annex 8 defines a national monument as 
&#8220;movable or immovable property of great importance to a group of people with common 
cultural, historic, religious or ethnic heritage, such as monuments of architecture, art or 
history; archaeological sites; groups of buildings; as well as cemeteries&#8221; (art. VI).  
82. The Commission has significant powers. According to annex 8, when the 
Commission designates property as a national monument, the entity in whose territory the 
national monument is situated &#8220;(a) shall make every effort to take appropriate legal, 
scientific, technical, administrative and financial measures necessary for the protection, 
conservation, presentation and rehabilitation of the property, and (b) shall refrain from 
taking any deliberate measures that might damage the property&#8221; (art. V.<footnote name="5">2. For more than a decade, many steps, supported by the international community, have 
been taken to develop a common core curriculum to reduce differences of perspectives 
among students and to promote mutual knowledge and understanding. In 2003, the State 
Framework Law on Primary and Secondary Education provided for the development of a 
common core curriculum for all public and private schools, consisting of &#8220;the curricula and 
syllabi of all subjects of primary and general secondary education in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina that have as broad an agreed common core as possible&#8221; (art. 42). All Ministers 
for Education pledged to introduce the common core curriculum under their jurisdiction in 
the 2003/04 school year.  
</footnote>). Commission 
decisions are binding, and override all others. The Commission, according to article 39 of 
its own rules of procedure, also determines the boundaries of immovable property 
designated a national monument and the &#8220;conditions for its protection&#8221;. </footnote> As 
noted by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, the emphasis placed in 
law and in practice on ensuring the full enjoyment of rights by persons belonging to one of 
the constituent peoples has placed all others at a serious disadvantage. This includes not

<p>only the recognized national minorities but also those not desiring to identify themselves 
with any single constituent people or national minority, such as children of mixed descent 
or those self-identifying as Bosnians. The latter, who try consciously to prevent imposed 
ethnic affiliations from superseding all other aspects of their identity, remain discriminated 
against, invisible in law and ignored in practice. The &#8220;others&#8221; simply do not enjoy genuine 
equality with other citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
</p>
<p>22. This framework, which overemphasizes national/ethnic and religious affiliations, 
has been used by some actors to pursue ethno-nationalistic agendas, to promote the false 
notion of hermetically sealed communities and to conduct segregation policies. Arguments 
based on the need to preserve and promote culture and to respect cultural rights are 
advanced to justify these divisions, and are especially worrying.  
23. This is even more worrisome in the case of language. Each population speaks a 
separate although closely related language: Bosnian, Croatian or Serbian. These languages 
are mutually intelligible in most respects; indeed, before the war, they were collectively 
categorized as Serbo-Croatian. Serbian uses Cyrillic, one of two official alphabets. The 
insistence today by many actors on emphasizing and reinforcing the differences between 
these three languages, coupled with rhetoric on the right of each person to learn his or her 
mother tongue, is used to justify a segregated school system.  
24. According to many interlocutors, the ethno-nationalist narratives of political leaders 
dominate the media. Frustration was expressed across the board that positive efforts are 
being blocked by senior decision-makers and politicians. A general assessment widely 
shared by interlocutors was that the political situation has been deteriorating since 2005-
2006, and that every issue, in particular in the field of culture and education, has become 
politicized. One positive trend, however, is that people have asked the judicial system to 
step in, for example regarding the &#8220;two-schools-one-roof&#8221; system. Unfortunately, these 
court decisions remain unimplemented.  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur underlines that the assistance of the international 
community has also had an impact on perceived identities, bringing with it the use of such 
terms as &#8220;ethnic groups&#8221; or &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221;, which are seen by many as imported 
language satisfying the human rights &#8220;industry&#8221;. The notion of &#8220;ethnicity&#8221; carries with it 
the idea that a group of people share specific physical features, which is not the case in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina: constituent people mainly guess the affiliations of others by 
asking their names.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International framework  
</b></p>
<p>26. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a party to United Nations instruments protecting cultural 
rights, including the two international covenants on human rights. It is also a party to 
important conventions of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO), such as the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in 
the Event of Armed Conflict, the Convention concerning the Protection of the World 
Cultural and Natural Heritage, the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible 
Cultural Heritage and the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of 
Cultural Expressions. The country has two sites on the World Heritage List. 
</p>
<p>27. Bosnia and Herzegovina is also a party to a number of cultural rights-related 
European treaties, in particular the European Convention for the Protection of Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Protocols thereto, the Framework Convention </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/49/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>for the Protection of National Minorities, the European Charter for Regional and Minority 
Languages and the Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society. 
</p>
<p><b> B. National framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Relevant constitutional provisions 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina stresses that the State and the entities 
are to ensure the highest level of internationally recognized human rights and fundamental 
freedoms (art. II (1)). A higher status is granted to &#8220;civil and political rights&#8221;, as only the 
rights and freedoms set forth in the European Convention for Human Rights and its 
Protocols apply directly (art. II (2)). Article II (3) enumerates a number of human rights, 
some of particular relevance in the field of culture, such as freedom of thought, conscience 
and religion, freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association with others, and the 
right to education. Additionally, the enjoyment of other rights enshrined in other 
international instruments, such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, is to be assured for all persons without discrimination (art. II (4)). 
29. The Constitution, in addressing the division of competencies between the State and 
the two entities, does not mention the field of culture as being of special interest to the State 
(art. III (1)). Since all governmental functions and powers not expressly assigned in the 
Constitution to the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina are be those of the entities (art. 
III (3)), it is assumed that the main responsibilities in the field of culture lie with the 
entities. Hence, at the State level, there is no minister for culture; instead, a Minister for 
Civil Affairs is mandated with a coordinating role in the field of culture.  
</p>
<p>30. Which institution is responsible for financing the implementation of international 
treaties as they relate to cultural rights is, however, unclear. The State is competent in the 
area of &#8220;finances of the institutions and for the international obligations of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina&#8221; (art. III (1)), while &#8220;each entity shall provide all necessary assistance to the 
Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to enable it to honour the international 
obligations of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#8221; (art. III (2b)). It seems, therefore, that the State 
does have important responsibilities in terms of ensuring cultural rights beyond mere 
coordination.  
</p>
<p>31. It has been contended that unclear constitutional provisions impede the practical 
implementation of most conventions relating to culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Moreover, because constitutional provisions are silent on the issue of cultural rights of 
citizens in general, the cultural rights of national minorities seem to be more clearly defined 
and protected than those of other citizens.9 
</p>
<p>32. The constitutional provisions of entities must be taken into account. Article 4 of the 
Constitution of the Federation authorizes the cantons to create and implement cultural 
policies, introducing an additional layer of complexity to the decentralized governance of 
cultural matters. Furthermore, amendment XXXVII to that Constitution stipulates that 
education, religion, language, culture, traditions and cultural heritage constitute issues of 
vital national interest. Some cantons have added similar provisions to their own 
constitutions. Legislation on issues of vital national interest requires a two-thirds majority

<p>vote. A number of cantonal constitutions have further delegated the responsibility for 
adopting cultural policies to municipalities.10  
</p>
<p>33. The Constitution of Republika Srpska contains important provisions relating to 
freedom of cultural and artistic creation (art. 27) and expressing national affiliation and 
culture (art. 34). The Constitution makes it clear that cultural heritage is an issue of general 
interest to Republika Srpska and that the protection, preservation, use, improvement and 
management of cultural heritage are regulated by special laws.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Relevant laws and policies 
</b></p>
<p>34. The 2003 State law on national minorities was praised by representatives of 
minorities, who did complain, however, about its poor implementation. A strategy and a 
plan of action for Roma have also been adopted.11 
</p>
<p>35. In 2008, the Council of Ministers adopted a strategy on cultural policy in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina12 and a plan of action for its realization in 2011. According to interlocutors, 
the strategy is not operational and should be given a boost. The entities have adopted their 
own cultural policy strategies, for 2010-2020 (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) and 
2010-2015 (Republika Srpska). 
36. Debates are ongoing regarding the adoption of a framework law on culture, both at 
the level of State and of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. To date, however, such 
legislation has not been adopted. A number of cantons have adopted a law on culture. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Realizing cultural rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina: specific 
issues 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. A segregated school system 
</b></p>
<p>37. A number of international and European human rights mechanisms have expressed 
deep concern regarding the segregated school system established in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, operating through both the &#8220;two-schools-under-one-roof&#8221; system and mono-
ethnic schools.13 The issue, therefore, is not new, and the authorities are fully aware of its 
depth.  No reform has, however, been possible, owing to the inability of the fragmented 
governmental system to take action, the politicization of education issues and the mistrust 
between communities. The over-emphasizing of cultural differences, including linguistic 
differences, is used to justify practices that enforce the segregation of students based on 
ethno-national affiliation. The Special Rapporteur stresses that this is a serious 
misinterpretation of cultural rights, which must not be used under any circumstances to 
justify segregation policies.

</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Two-schools-under-one-roof system 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the two-schools-under-one-roof system, by 
which children from different ethnic groups attend classes in the same building but are 
taught in segregated sections, have different curricula and rarely mix within the school 
environment. Institutional arrangements render it virtually impossible for pupils to interact, 
even in the playground. The schools have separate administrative bodies, school boards, 
parents&#8217; and student councils, as well as student clubs, for such activities as sports or 
theatre. This system operates in 54 schools in three cantons of the Federation of Bosnia 
Herzegovina, in municipalities with mixed Bosniak/Croat population. Sixteen have now 
been administratively unified under pressure from the international community.14  
</p>
<p>39. Many of these schools were formed to accommodate returnee children in school 
buildings catering to the dominant ethnic group of the area in the wake of the 
reconfiguration of population demographics caused by the conflict. Conceived of as a 
bridging step, the schools became cemented and are now justified by some as a means to 
protect the right of children to learn in their mother tongue.  
</p>
<p>40. Some initiatives have been undertaken to suppress the two-schools-under-one-roof 
system. In 2010, the Federation Parliament of invited the cantonal ministries of education to 
take the measures necessary to bring the system to an end before the beginning of the new 
school year, but was unsuccessful.15 In April 2012, the Mostar Municipal Court ruled that 
the two-schools-under-one-roof system operating in the towns of Stolac and &#268;apljina was 
illegal and discriminatory. It ordered the Education Ministry of the Herzegovina &#8211; Neretva 
canton to end the practice by the start of the new school year. The judgement is yet to be 
implemented.16 In August 2012, the Ministry of Education of the Federation of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina outlined a two-year plan to end segregation, although strong political 
resistance at the local levels is likely to hamper progress.17  
</p>
<p>41. The Ministry of Education of the Herzegovina &#8211; Neretva Canton explained to the 
Special Rapporteur that municipal councils resisted implementing the ruling, but that 
efforts were being made at the cantonal level to move forward. The Special Rapporteur also 
met the Mayor of Stolac, and agreed with him that the two-schools-under-one-roof system 
was often used as the symbol of the country&#8217;s segregated educational system, although 
mono-national/ethnic schools, which are equally problematic, are far more numerous (see 
paras. 44-47 below). 
42. The two-schools-under-one-roof system exemplifies how divisions between children 
based on their national or ethnic affiliation become entrenched by establishing different 
entrances and staircases, erecting walls and fences, and even scheduling a 15-minute gap at 
recess and the start and end of school. It is disturbing to see how those schools deliberately 
seek to prevent any kind of interaction between children. Multiplying joint activities and 
integrating these schools should be easy to organize; all that is lacking, clearly, is political 
will. Reforming the system should pave the way for broader reforms to address the mono-
national/ethnic schools system throughout the country. In the Stolac school she visited, the 
Special Rapporteur met the directors of both the Bosnian and the Croat wings, and felt the 
necessity of building trust among the various communities through joint activities. She was 
pleased to note in this regard the joint drawing exhibit organized at the time of her visit by

direction. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Mono-national/ethnic school system 
</b></p>
<p>43. Fewer than 6 per cent of all pupils are enrolled in the two-schools-under-one-roof 
system, the vast majority being educated in mono-national/ethnic schools in both the 
Federation and Republika Srpska. Curricula, school environments and practices throughout 
the country ensure that schools cater largely or solely for the ethnic majority in 
municipalities, with parents forced to choose between having their children face 
assimilation in the local school or enrolling them in a distant school with a different ethnic 
majority.18 This is of great concern to the Special Rapporteur, as children in these schools 
are denied opportunities to meet children of a different ethnic/linguistic background. It also 
means that children with a culturally diverse heritage only have access to one part of their 
cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p>44. This separation touches not only general education schools but also, for example, 
medical and engineering schools, as in Mostar, where the Special Rapporteur was informed 
of the planned merger of secondary schools of music, which would be an excellent 
initiative.  
</p>
<p>45. The right of pupils to learn in their mother tongue and the right of parents to choose 
their child&#8217;s school are often advanced in defence of the current segregated education 
system, be it through the two-schools-under-one-roof school or mono-national/ethnic 
schools. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that the implementation of such rights is 
not dependent on establishing a segregated school system, as evident in many other 
countries. Furthermore, the choice of parents cannot be real in a situation where options are 
limited to either a mono-national/ethnic school of their own affiliation or a mono-
national/ethnic school of others&#8217; affiliation. In practice, this discriminates against parents 
wishing their children to enjoy a pluralistic culture. 
46. The Special Rapporteur is disconcerted by the fact that some neighbouring countries 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina support mono-national/ethnic schools (for people sharing their 
own national/ethnic affiliation)19 or support one side of a two-schools-one-roof school, 
leading to striking discrepancies either between mono-national/ethnic schools or between 
the two wings of a two-schools-under-one-roof school.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Integrated schools 
</b></p>
<p>47. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur learned of efforts to establish integrated 
schools. She visited the First Gymnasium of Sarajevo, where classes are offered in the three 
languages of the constituent peoples. She also visited the Gymnasium of Mostar, which was 
re-organized as a joint reintegrated school in 2004. These remain isolated examples, while 
the Special Rapporteur was informed that many more students would like to attend such 
gymnasiums.  
</p>
<p>48. Unfortunately, to date (in particular in the case of the Gymnasium of Mostar, which 
the Special Rapporteur had more time to study), integration is minimal: only one class is 
held in common (information technologies, owing to the strong demand by the company 
from Japan that offered the computers), while all other subjects remain divided between the

</p>
<p>Bosnian and Croat curriculum, including, for example, mathematics. In general, pupils 
from west Mostar choose the Croat curriculum, while pupils from the east select the 
Bosnian curriculum. According to interlocutors, nothing more can be done by the city and 
school, since cantonal and pedagogical decisions regarding curriculum content must be 
followed. A common curriculum simply does not exist, including in the said integrated 
schools. Hence, further efforts are completely blocked owing to the operative political and 
administrative environment. 
</p>
<p>49. Nevertheless, joint extracurricular activities such as sports have started, and 
administrative bodies, such as teachers&#8217;, parents&#8217; and students&#8217; councils, have been 
integrated, easing interaction and the organization of joint activities like competitions. Still, 
pupils reported a lack of connectedness across communities and expressed their desire for 
enhanced joint activities. Teachers organize theatre clubs separately, without sharing 
information with students from other communities on how to join. In addition, 
organizational arrangements obstruct interaction: there is no cafeteria, so shared meals are 
not possible. Pupils from the primary school attend in the morning, while pupils in the 
secondary attend in the afternoon. It is interesting to note, in contrast, that students 
themselves have organized initiatives outside of the school to interact, for example bridge-
building events outside their school premises and on the Mostar bridge. The Special 
Rapporteur recommends that they receive robust support for such activities. 
</p>
<p>50. The system put in place in Br&#269;ko is often presented as a good model of integrated 
schools, where the pupils from different communities attend school together and mainly 
receive instruction in their own languages in the same classroom. According to the 
Education Law of Br&#269;ko District, &#8220;the Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian languages, and the 
Latin and Cyrillic alphabets, shall be used in equal terms in the realization of curricula and 
facultative activities in primary and secondary schools&#8221; (art. 9). The law stipulates that 
students have the freedom to express themselves in their own language, and that school 
documents are to be issued in the language and alphabet requested by a student or parent. In 
class, only the blackboard is divided, enabling teachers to use both the Latin and Cyrillic 
scripts and to show the differences existing between the various languages. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Common core curriculum 
</b></p>
<p>51. Separated classes facilitate, and are seemingly aimed at, teaching a non-harmonized 
curriculum and various narratives, in particular related to &#8221;national groups of subjects&#8221; &#8211; 
language and literature, nature and society, religious instruction, geography and history.

54. One obstacle frequently mentioned by interlocutors was the deep system-wide 
politicization of education. The perspective of stakeholders with regard to the education 
system is quite worrying; they consider that most people on school boards are politicians, 
view school boards as an extended arm of political parties, and believe that school funding 
is based on political affiliation. Municipalities appoint school boards, which in turn appoint 
school directors, who then hire teachers. An issue requiring attention is the fate and 
prospects of teachers who may become redundant and risk losing their jobs following 
curriculum harmonization and the reunification of the school system, bearing in mind also 
decreasing population growth.  
</p>
<p>55. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met representatives of a national network of 
student councils demanding a uniform school system. She also had the opportunity to 
attend a demonstration of high school students, organized in Sarajevo with the support of 
the Youth Communication Club, which links around 292 student councils across the 
country. Demonstrators asked the ministries of education many questions, including 
regarding when a harmonized curriculum would be available for all schools in the country.  
</p>
<p>56. The High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina also reported that the start of 
the school year in September 2013 was accompanied by disputes over the curricula being 
used in a number of schools in Republika Srpska where there had been a significant number 
of Bosniak returnees. Parents and pupils boycotted classes at a number of schools. The 
High Representative stressed that &#8220;the problem underlying the protests is not unique to 
Republika Srpska. It reveals the failure of the competent authorities in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina in the past 11 years to find a permanent, countrywide solution, which would 
guarantee children&#8217;s equal rights to education&#8221;.21 
</p>
<p>57.  Although the common core curriculum is better developed in Br&#269;ko, culture, 
language and history remain highly sensitive issues; officials there reported that they 
exercised caution &#8220;to preserve the different characteristics of groups, while bringing them 
round to universal values&#8221;. Classes are separated only for language and religion. Language 
classes, which are separated starting from the sixth grade, study national authors, including 
those from other constituent peoples. The Br&#269;ko District authorities do not view their 
system as ideal, and are making efforts to improve it. Teachers confirmed that progress in 
integration was not satisfactory.  
</p>
<p>58. Differences in the curricula seem to create a general feeling in the community that 
children are being educated to become &#8220;little ethnic soldiers&#8221;. Many interlocutors opined 
that children of &#8220;the other community&#8221; were being raised &#8220;as enemies&#8221;. The Special 
Rapporteur believes, however, that a thorough study may be necessary to assess the extent 
to which this is the case. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The teaching and writing of history 
</b></p>
<p>59. According to various observers, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, &#8220;the different 
perspectives of history that the pupils are taught in schools seem to generate more divisions

<p>and ethnic discrimination. Although there has been progress in eliminating explicit hate 
speech from history and geography textbooks, significant differences in history teaching 
still exist and cause serious concern.&#8221;22  
</p>
<p>60. During and following the 1992-1995 war, school curricula were divided into three 
different and often conflicting versions of history. Immediately after the war, teams of 
international experts reviewed all textbooks in order to delete references considered to be 
offensive. The exercise was not without problems. Text correction entailed deleting or 
blackening out entire sentences, including, for example, references to &#8220;genocide&#8221; and 
&#8220;aggression&#8221; in the textbooks used in the Federation, without, however, proposing any 
alternative language to describe traumatic events.  
</p>
<p>61. In April 2005, all Ministries of Education, with the strong support of OSCE and the 
Council of Europe, adopted a set of guidelines for writing and evaluating history textbooks 
for primary and secondary schools in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
(www.coe.ba/pdf/History_Report_22_April_05.pdf).23 The guidelines are considered a 
huge step towards the elaboration of scientifically based and objective textbooks that apply 
the principle of the multi-perspective, thereby enabling children to learn tolerance and 
encouraging the development of critical thinking. A new and substantially improved 
generation of textbooks has now been published in accordance with the guidelines. 
Furthermore, a teacher&#8217;s manual on contemporary history teaching in schools was 
developed, published and distributed to schools. 
</p>
<p>62. Nevertheless, it appears that history textbooks still feature a national/ethnic bias.24 A 
comprehensive study conducted to analyse history textbooks published in 2007/08 
demonstrated that all Croatian-language history textbooks for the primary school 
curriculum presented history as the history of Croats; all history textbooks for the primary 
school curriculum in Republika Srpska predominantly presented history as the history of 
Serbs; and some (but not all) history textbooks under the framework curriculum for the 
compulsory nine years of primary education in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina presented history as predominantly the history of Bosniaks.25 
</p>
<p>63. Teaching about the 1992-1995 war remains one of the most problematic areas for 
history teachers in Bosnia and Herzegovina today. It is still a sensitive, highly politicized 
issue; indeed, some history textbooks make no reference to it at all.26 When references are 
included, they are mostly one-sided or manipulated to create segregated identities.27 Many 
interlocutors, including teachers, stressed that they still try to avoid addressing the war.  
</p>
<p>64. Textbook policies vary between the entities. In Republika Srpska, a single textbook 
per grade is published and approved, even though the Special Rapporteur was assured that 
modern textbooks together with additional material are made available to students to 
develop their critical thinking. She was also informed that, since 2007, vocational schools

<p>too have been working with a new generation of textbooks that address history from diverse 
perspectives and are drafted by authors of various nationalities. In Republika Srpska, the 
only publishing and printing company, created in 1993 and owned by the Government, has 
the monopoly of the textbooks market.  
</p>
<p>65. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, three textbooks are officially approved 
for each grade. Textbooks can be chosen by individual teachers, in consultation with 
colleagues, or the decision may be made for them at a higher level, namely, by the 
Pedagogical Institute or the Ministry of Education. The Special Rapporteur was informed 
during her visit, however, of a recent decision to accredit only one history textbook, which 
would introduce a multi-perspective approach, starting from the eighth grade, although 
cantons with a Croat majority have shown resistance.  
66. The Special Rapporteur does not believe that having a single history textbook for 
each grade in each entity is a good step; she recommends that several good quality 
textbooks be offered instead. As explained in her thematic report on the writing and 
teaching of history (A/68/296), a multi-perspective approach can ensure that every event is 
shown, by way of historical sources, from the perspective of others. In particular, when the 
historiography of each group provides a very different viewpoint and is closely linked to a 
political agenda, publishing the historical sources and supplementary teaching material is a 
reasonable way of presenting sensitive issues and of promoting critical thinking.  
</p>
<p>67. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur learned of a pilot project conducted under 
the auspices of OSCE and supported by the Council of Europe, proposing to focus on 
learning outcomes in history from the sixth to the ninth grade. She believes the project is a 
very good initiative.  
</p>
<p>68. The current political environment does not seem to be conducive to progress on this 
issue. For example, on 27 June 2013, the Republika Srpska National Assembly adopted a 
declaration on the causes, character and consequences of the tragic armed conflict in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995. In the document, the Assembly criticized the work of 
the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the Court of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and the Bosnia and Herzegovina Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, blaming the war on the 
&#8220;domination of the Serb people in Bosnia and Herzegovina&#8221;. Bosniak politicians reacted by 
labelling the declaration discriminatory and a falsification of history.28 This episode 
underscores the extreme importance of ensuring that historians, academics and 
schoolteachers enjoy academic freedom, without interference by politicians (see paras. 70-
73 below). 
69. According to information received, the teaching of literature serves as an important 
means for nationalistic ideologies to build opposing narratives (including historical ones), 
dramatically affecting children&#8217;s perceptions of each other. Nationalistic ideologies rely on 
legends, language, national symbols, territories and enemies, and literature can be a very 
pervasive tool, even though its impact is frequently overlooked. Novelists, poets and other 
writers enjoy the right to artistic expression and creativity.29 Given that education is 
compulsory, however, the State and entities authorities should abide by their obligation to 
ensure that all educational content is in compliance with the 2003 Framework Law on 
Education (art. 3) and with international standards with regard to the objectives of 
education.

</p>
<p><b> D. Academic freedoms and the autonomy of academic and cultural 
institutions  
</b></p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur heard many allegations that, all too often, nominations and 
appointments in cultural and educational institutions, including schools and universities, are 
motivated by political considerations. Political bodies have, in general, expanded their 
influence over cultural and educational institutions, which suffer from a lack of 
administrative independence and financial autonomy. For example, the Special Rapporteur 
is concerned at reports allegations that researchers in Republika Srpska are reluctant to 
participate in collaborative events and exchanges with historians from the Federation of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina for fear of losing their jobs or career opportunities, or of being 
refused future authorization to travel. In general, it was reported that academic freedoms are 
not sufficiently respected and promoted throughout the country. Allegations are quite 
serious; independent researchers unaffiliated to political parties reportedly encounter 
difficulties in their work, and scientific work is said to remain under the control of 
nationalist elites.  
</p>
<p>71. Interaction and cooperation are necessary between professionals and institutions in 
the field of culture and education, including among the two entities and the District. The 
Special Rapporteur commends the willingness of some professionals, institutions and civil 
servants to cooperate with each other, and is encouraged by the imaginative projects 
developed by civil society organizations and cultural institutions to overcome what they 
consider to be artificial divisions in the country. As long as cooperation remains informal, 
with no mechanisms and official policies to institutionalize this, however, people will feel 
restrained.  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur believes that the systems put in place in both entities to fund 
art projects and cultural activities should be assessed and revised to ensure the right to 
freedom of artistic expression and creativity, as well as the autonomy of cultural and art 
institutions.  
</p>
<p>73. The degree of transparency in the election of members and directors of Steering 
committees of cultural public institutions is not considered adequate. Interlocutors stressed 
that selection is often selected based on political affiliation rather than professional skills. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Promoting cultural activities and interaction outside of schools  
</b></p>
<p>74. Throughout her visit, the Special Rapporteur addressed the issue of the spaces 
available for people to interact across communities, in particular for children and youth. 
Although some 110 cultural centres remain in the country, most have been neglected since 
the war and are in ruins. Some are being re-established.  
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur learned of a variety of competitions, exhibitions and 
festivals held throughout the country on a regular basis providing people with the 
opportunity to interact with each other. Interlocutors regretted, however the absence of a 
ministry for culture mandated to conduct cultural policies in a more thoughtful manner. 
They stressed that funds were scarce and that support, including from the international 
community, should be based on a long-term strategy rather than on the financing of single 
events.  
</p>

<p>side, especially if they have not ventured there for years. Some young people, having never 
visited the &#8220;other side&#8221;, imagine all sorts of situations. Other cities are also territorially 
divided, like Sarajevo and East Sarajevo. The Special Rapporteur hopes that the 
organization of the 2017 European Youth Olympics in Sarajevo will provide opportunities 
to proactively develop spaces for interaction. She was pleased to learn that collaboration 
between the Mayors of Sarajevo (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) and of East 
Sarajevo (Republika Srpska) has started in this regard.  
77. Excellent initiatives promoting interaction between people are visible in both 
entities. In Republika Srpska, the Teddy Bear association conducts, with support from the 
entity&#8217;s Government, activities, promoting interaction between rural and urban children. In 
Mostar, several civil society organizations are fully engaged in the field of sport, culture 
and art, promoting interaction among people from various communities. For example, the 
Mostar Blues festival, established in 2003, uses music to bring people together, and a 
number of institutions, such as the Rock School, use their talents to combat segregation 
proactively, challenging the perspectives offered by ethno-nationalistic agendas.  
</p>
<p>78. People in general and decision-makers in particular do not always value such actions 
in the field of culture or give them priority. The Special Rapporteur is convinced, however, 
that it is precisely at this level that significant changes can be achieved in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. This is especially urgent, given that while some youth demand more spaces 
for interaction through art and sport, others have already developed a sense of mistrust and 
intolerance, and it is difficult to know how large either group is. Hate speech remains a 
worrying reality, as seen for example during football games in Mostar. 
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur wishes to underline that, since 1996, all associations for 
national minorities have attempted to find ways to establish centres, which they lack, to 
make minorities more visible. The centre for national minorities in Banja Luka was 
described as quite an exception. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Reconstruction and memorialization processes 
</b></p>
<p>80. Many efforts have been made throughout the country to reconstruct cultural heritage 
destroyed during the war, including mosques and churches. These are steps conducive to 
the return of refugees and displaced persons. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Commission to Preserve National Monuments 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/25/49/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur met with the two entity-level institutes for the protection of 
monuments, and appreciated their good cooperation. There was widespread discontent, 
however, regarding the level of cooperation between the Commission and the two 
institutes, meant to work together, and the delimitation of their respective competencies. 
The Special Rapporteur believes that disagreement stems from different objectives and 
approaches; the Commission aims to foster post-war reconciliation by designating property 
deemed to symbolize a people&#8217;s identity as national monuments; its reconstruction work is 
a means of reparation for past wrongs. By contrast, the two institutes seek to preserve 
authentic monuments with high universal value that merit classification as national 
monuments. 
</p>
<p>84. Consequently, considerable criticism was levelled against the Commission for 
identifying undeserving property as national monuments. The surfeit of monuments 
identified as &#8220;national&#8221;, it was felt, obstructs much needed development schemes. 
Moreover, the protection measures taken by the Commission are considered to be arbitrary 
and excessive, while local communities are not always aware of their full ramifications. 
More than 700 properties have been designated national monuments, creating difficulties in 
setting priorities and mobilizing funds. Some consider that the Commission has gone 
beyond its competencies, creating serious concerns, given that Commission decisions are 
final and not subject to appeal. 
85. Given the lack of trust in the country, such criticism, even when well-grounded, may 
be interpreted as an attack against communities, a denial of the destruction that occurred in 
the past, and the pursuit of the war through other means. This is particularly the case when 
the institutes are mere departments of an entity&#8217;s ministry, and therefore not seen as 
independent bodies. 
</p>
<p>86. The Commission informed the Special Rapporteur that it consults with the 
concerned communities and offers the option of reconstructing the property exactly as 
before; reconstructing in a larger or altered format; constructing something with a different 
function; or not reconstructing it at all. Consultations are welcome and, according to the 
Commission, in about 90 per cent of cases, people wish to reconstruct the same monument. 
Should communities select a modified structure, however, it is no longer a case of 
reconstruction but part of a new landscape.  
</p>
<p>87. In any event, be it through the Commission&#8217;s process or otherwise, many people 
expressed deep concern that a new cultural landscape is being built in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, with taller minarets and steeples in bigger mosques and churches, marking 
territories and competing for predominance. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Memorials and memorialization processes 
</b></p>
<p>88. The issue of memorials has caused much controversy in the country.<footnote name="3">6
  Popovi&#263;, UNDP report (see footnote 31), p. 27. </footnote>0 
Memorialization activities are &#8220;characterized by a (mono)-ethnic approach, an insufficient 
institutional coordination, the lack of adequate and programmatic regulations, and the lack 
of conceptual understanding of the issue of memorialization in the context of transitional 
justice&#8221;.<footnote name="3">9

&#8220;credit and blame&#8221; approach. 
</p>
<p>89. Memory entrepreneurs are diverse: numerous associations and private actors erect 
their own memorials, on private or public land, with or without prior authorization, and

<p>with or without financial support from the authorities. Authorities at all levels of 
government also intervene, depending on the national/ethnic, political and ideological 
content of the memorial activity. The international community, too, has been very active in 
this context. 
</p>
<p>90. The building of new memorials dedicated to the 1992-1995 war has a deep impact 
on the country&#8217;s cultural landscape in ways that frequently clash with transitional justice 
principles. First, memorials are commonly used to mark one group&#8217;s dominance over 
specific territories. Some memorials have been erected at places of return or at places where 
other communities suffered. For example, tensions were exacerbated by the construction of 
an Orthodox church on a disputed location near the Srebrenica-Poto&#269;ari Memorial Centre,32 
where mass graves have been discovered. 
</p>
<p>91. Second, the memorialization process in the country is &#8220;characterized by the creation 
of new and deletion of old narratives&#8221; in &#8220;a relatively organized way&#8221;, to show that the old 
narratives were inappropriate even in the past and did not meet the needs of the community 
as a whole or some parts thereof and, in particular, that &#8220;they do not correspond to the 
needs of the current appearance of the community as a result of the 1992-1995 armed 
conflict&#8221;.33 
</p>
<p>92. The absence of a memorial may be equally problematic. For example, the Omarska 
camp in Prijedor, run by Serbian forces during the war and the site of mass murders and 
torture, remains unmarked, despite requests by survivors. The site is today a mining 
complex owned by Arcelor Mittal, which allows victims to conduct commemorative 
activities on the site for three hours every year on 6 August. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed that, while Bosnian and Croat members of the State Presidency had participated 
in these commemorations in 2012, no Serbian member had ever attended. By contrast, a 
memorial to fallen Serbian soldiers has been established in front of the camp. Furthermore, 
the site has been used as the filming location for a recent historical Serbian film production, 
which made no mention of the events of 1992-1995 and is seen by many as contributing to 
the denial of the traumatic events in the camp. According to interlocutors, victims and their 
families fear to speak up except in closed circles. 
</p>
<p>93. Memorialization processes are hindered as commemorative activities are sometimes 
rendered very difficult, for example around Srebrenica,34 although interlocutors reported 
that the situation has improved.  
</p>
<p>94. The memorialization of those who risked their lives to save people from the other 
groups appear to be minimal, although interesting private initiatives have been undertaken 
to that end.35  
</p>
<p>95. The legal basis for erecting monuments is fragmented between the laws and 
regulations of entities, cantons and municipalities, and there is no framework law dealing 
with memorialization processes at the State level (though some laws regulate the issue 
within their own sphere).36 
96. The transitional justice strategy for Bosnia and Herzegovina (2012-2016) drafted 
with the support of UNDP, involving the Ministries of Justice and of Human Rights and 
Refugees, has not yet been adopted. An important aim of the strategy is to ensure that 
memorialization processes are fully integrated into the broader framework of transitional

<p>justice strategies, and that they develop a &#8220;public/educative&#8221; purpose, which they currently 
lack. In sections dealing specifically with memorials, the strategy proposes that a set of 
common standards and criteria be developed through a participatory process for both 
memorial monuments and commemorative activities. It envisages the creation of a national 
memorial to all the victims of war in Bosnia, and the construction of similarly inclusive 
memorials in every local community. It also recommends that an enacted framework law 
and policy at the State level fully regulate the issue. The Special Rapporteur hopes that such 
initiatives will be concretized. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>97.<b> Twenty years after the war, divisions between communities in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina are much greater at the political level than on the ground. People, 
especially youth, often express a desire to overcome divisions that they see as imposed 
on them on a daily basis, creating absurd situations.  
</b></p>
<p>98<b>. While contrasting perspectives exist regarding the country&#8217;s future and its 
political and administrative organization, the Special Rapporteur does not believe that 
such perspectives are irreconcilable. Building a common future for all citizens can be 
achieved while also addressing the concerns of those who fear being subjected to 
assimilation policies.  
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> Too often, however, culture and education are hijacked by the rhetoric of 
difference, with an immense, detrimental impact on artistic, cultural, scientific and 
academic life in the country, and on the right of all persons, without discrimination, to 
enjoy their cultural rights and to have full access to their cultural heritage in all its 
rich diversity.  
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> Cultural rights, including linguistic rights, have been seriously misinterpreted 
by a number of actors to justify policies of separation and the establishment of 
hermetically sealed communities. The right to be taught in one&#8217;s mother tongue 
cannot justify segregation; no one should invoke cultural diversity to infringe upon 
human rights guaranteed by international law, nor to limit their scope. In particular, 
the three official languages and the two scripts officially recognized in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina must not be considered a reason for separation but rather an asset that 
facilitates communication and openness to others. 
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> Irrespective of the country&#8217;s current structure or its future, it is essential, from 
a cultural rights perspective, that people be free to have access to their cultural 
heritage as well as to that of others, to engage freely in cultural cooperation with 
others, both within and across localities and entities, and to leave, join and create new 
communities of shared cultural values. It is the responsibility of the authorities, at all 
levels, to ensure and respect cultural diversity within each community, as well as 
between communities.  
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> A number of positive steps have been taken, despite the difficult political 
climate. Many efforts have been made in the area of education to establish a common 
core curriculum and new pedagogical methodologies. The authorities must also be 
congratulated for organizing the census of population and households in 2013. 
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> The Special Rapporteur calls upon all stakeholders to urgently resolve the 
status of the seven major cultural institutions, enabling them to function without 
hindrance. She also warns against a system that would reinforce the divisions of 
people by confining cultural institutions to Bosnian, Croatian or Serbian cultural and 
artistic expressions and history, depending on the entity in which they are located. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/49/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>The various levels of government should create an environment conducive to 
cooperation and working relations among all cultural institutions, without 
interference from political actors.  
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Reforming the education system to end the segregation of pupils according to 
national/ethnic affiliation in both the two-schools-under-one-roof system and mono-
national/ethnic schools is vital and urgent. For this, efforts must be pursued to 
implement a common core curriculum and to increase the number of subjects in 
which children learn together, regardless of background, including in those labelled 
&#8220;integrated schools&#8221; (where in fact interaction is minimal). The Special Rapporteur 
recommends that:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Steps be taken to increase significantly the number of joint cultural 
activities between students across communities within two-schools-under-one-roof 
schools and between mono-national/ethnic schools; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The right of all pupils and students to learn in their mother tongue and 
to have access to the cultural heritage of their particular community as well as those of 
all others be guaranteed. Children should learn the three official languages of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, and both the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets, as necessary tools for full 
access to their cultural heritage.  
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> Neither history nor literature should be manipulated to indoctrinate students 
into believing in mutually exclusive and antagonistic identities. 
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> Efforts should be increased to ensure a comparative and multi-perspective 
approach in history teaching, to develop a multi-voice narrative that acknowledges 
different viewpoints, and to promote critical thinking, analytic learning and debate 
among students.</b>37<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Authorities at all levels pursue their efforts to raise the quality of history 
textbooks; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) A wide array of textbooks by a range of publishers be accredited. The 
curriculum should allocate a certain amount of time (at least 30 per cent) for teachers 
to introduce supplementary material, especially primary historical resources, without 
prior approval by the ministry; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Transparent approval and accreditation procedures and criteria for 
textbook selection be adopted, relying on expertise in history and pedagogy, not 
particular ideological and political requirements. Those procedures should include, 
for example, open tenders in which all publishers may bid equally, and independent 
expert committee reviews to ensure that textbooks meet required standards. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Cooperation among researchers of various communities be envisaged 
and promoted, such as inviting them to review each other&#8217;s textbooks for comments. 
</b></p>
<p>107.<b> The State and the entities should ensure that children have access to literature 
offering diverse viewpoints and mutual understanding. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>Respecting, protecting and promoting academic freedoms across the whole 
territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina is vital. This includes the freedoms to choose 
research subjects, to have access to information, including archives, without 
discrimination, to collaborate and exchange views with others, to disseminate results

<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>and to travel for such purposes. It is equally important that a better economic status 
be ensured for researchers. The Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The authorities of the State and of entities proactively encourage (and 
refrain from discouraging) meetings between academics and researchers in all fields, 
including history; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The authorities of the State and entities, and other relevant stakeholders, 
including the international community, pay particular attention to academic freedoms 
and the country&#8217;s higher education system, which should be free from political 
interference. 
</b></p>
<p>109.<b> With regard to enhancing interactions among children and youth, what may 
not be immediately achievable inside classrooms can most certainly be achieved 
outside, through cultural events and systematized exchanges across communities. The 
Special Rapporteur recommends in particular that:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) cross-community opportunities for engaging in activities in the field of 
culture, sports, science and arts be maximized through, for example, the rehabilitation 
of cultural and youth centres, and the creation of neutral spaces sheltered from 
politics and issues relating to ethno-national or religious affiliation. Such spaces 
should be established in locations where people feel free to come and interact; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) People associated with sports, in particular football teams and fan clubs, 
as well as artists in projects bridging communities, be engaged and supported. 
</b>110.<b> Institutions in the field of science and culture should be free to conduct their 
activities unencumbered by political agendas, and their independence guaranteed in 
law and in practice. The selection of cultural and art projects for public funding 
should be transparent and delegated to independent peer-review bodies.</b>38<b> 
</b></p>
<p>111.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the respective competencies and 
relationships of the Commission to Preserve National Monuments and the two 
institutes for the protection of monuments be clarified and revisited, and that the 
mandate of the Commission be integrated more clearly into transitional justice 
strategies. The independence of the Commission and of the institutes should be 
guaranteed.  
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Authorities have a key role to play for successful memorialization.</b>39<b> The Special 
Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Memorialization processes be fully integrated into the broader 
framework of transitional justice strategies;  
 (b) The steps regarding memorialization processes envisaged in the 
transitional justice strategy elaborated with the support of UNDP be implemented, in 
particular the enactment of a framework law and policy at the State level to fully 
regulate the issue; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Stakeholders encourage processes of memorialization of those who 
refused to participate in mass or grave violations of human rights, resisted oppression 
and helped others across community divides.
