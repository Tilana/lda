Review of operations
Overview
Evolution is a leading, growth-focused Australian gold miner. The Group consists of seven wholly-owned
operating gold mines: Cowal in New South Wales, Cracow, Pajingo, Mt Carlton and Mt Rawdon in Queensland
and Mungari and Edna May in Western Australia.
The Group’s strategy is to deliver shareholder value through efficient gold production, growing gold reserves and
developing or acquiring assets to improve the quality of the portfolio. Since its formation in November 2011, the
Group has built a strong reputation for operational predictability and stability through a record of consistently
achieving production and cost guidance. This has been achieved primarily as a result of the Group owning a
number of similar sized mines, rather than a single mine or one dominant mine like many of its peers. This
portfolio approach to production provides Evolution with a Group-wide level of operational stability and
predictability. The Group’s high-performance team culture, clearly defined business plans and goals, and
locations within Australia and New Zealand, further contribute to delivering reliable and consistent results.
To build a sustainable business, the Group maintains a strong commitment to growth through exploration and a
disciplined methodical approach to business development through opportunistic, logical, value-accretive
acquisitions. The Group is actively involved in these activities within Australia and most recently New Zealand.
Both jurisdictions are highly attractive destinations due to the location of the Group’s asset base and
management knowledge, low political risk, high gold endowment, weakening Australian dollar (which benefits US
dollar denominated gold revenue) and an environment of low inflation.

Review of operations (continued)
Overview (continued)
The Group posted a record underlying profit after tax of $226.884 million (30 June 2015: profit $106.050 million)
and a statutory net loss after tax of $24.349 million (30 June 2015: profit $100.115 million) for the year ended 30
June 2016. This increase in underlying profit after tax was driven by record production, a strong focus on cost
control and a favourable Australian dollar gold price.
The statutory net loss after tax includes one-off transaction and non-operating costs which have been excluded
from the Group's underlying profit after tax. These costs include acquisition and integration costs of $54.681
million, impairment of goodwill of $35.270 million, and fair value amortisation and expenses of $88.317 million
incurred on the Cowal, Mungari and Phoenix acquisitions. The Group also incurred an impairment on assets of
$77.330 million as a result of reclassifying the Pajingo asset to held for sale.
Total production for the year increased 84% to 803,476oz despite a decline in the average grade processed by
9% to 1.77g/t (30 June 2015: 437,570oz, 1.94g/t). This was largely achieved as a result of the first year inclusion
of Cowal and Mungari which contributed 29% and 17% of the Groups total respectively. Mt Carlton was the
largest contributor of the existing assets with 14% of the Groups total, a 45% increase on the prior year.
A record net mine cash flow of $428.203 million (30 June 2015: $137.793 million) was also achieved during the
year, representing a 211% improvement over the prior year. All operations were cash flow positive after all
sustaining and major capital expenditure, including capital stripping.
The consolidated operating and financial results for the current and prior period are summarised below. All $
figures refer to Australian thousand dollars (A$'000) unless otherwise stated.

Key Highlights for the Year
Key highlights for the year ended 30 June 2016 include:
•
Safety of our people is of paramount importance and our focus has been demonstrated through maintaining a
steady total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) of 9.7 (30 June 2015: 9.6).
• During the year the Group reached a record production milestone of 803,476oz. This was the mid range of
upgraded guidance for the year of 770,000 - 820,000oz.
•
•
All in Costs reduced 12% to $1,134/oz during the year, as a result of a sustained focus on cost reduction and
productivity improvements. The Group achieved savings on a number of supply contracts in addition to the
successful integration of Cowal and Mungari assets.
All mines contributed a positive cash flow for the year resulting in a record mine cash flow of $428.203
million.
• During the year the Group strengthened its balance sheet through the voluntary and early repayments of
$322 million on the Senior Secured Syndicated Revolving and Term Facility ("The Facility). As at 30 June
2016, the Group was 15 months ahead of the Term Facility repayment schedule and had a total of $285
million outstanding on The Facility.
•
The completion of the Cowal and Mungari transactions during the year had a significant and immediate
impact on reducing Group costs and increasing cash generation. The Cowal gold mine is one of Australia’s
most attractive gold assets and its large scale, long life and low cost profile providing a strong strategic fit
with the Group’s long term objective of pursuing value accretive acquisition assets which improve the quality
of the Group’s asset portfolio. Cowal has contributed gold production of 237,940oz with a first quartile unit
cost of $591/oz. The Mungari operations high quality integrated operating assets provide a strong strategic fit
with the Group’s long term objective of pursuing value accretive acquisition opportunities which improve the
quality of the Group’s asset portfolio. Mungari, contributed gold production of 137,193oz with a unit cash cost
of $756/oz from 10 months of ownership.
• During the year the Company completed the takeover of Phoenix Gold Limited. There is a clear commercial
logic in combining with Phoenix’s assets given the close proximity to the Mungari operations and covers a
significant strike length of the highly prospective Zuleika Shear and Kunanalling Shear.
Mining Operations
Cowal
The acquisition of Cowal was completed on 24 July 2015. This transformational acquisition saw Cowal continue
its historically strong performance finishing the year with gold production of 237,940oz, a unit cash operating cost
in the first cost quartile at $591/oz, and an AISC and AIC of $776/oz and $789/oz respectively.
Mining continued in the Stage G cutback with 12,651kt of material mined, comprised of 8,714kt of ore mined at
an average grade of 1.16g/t and 3,937kt of operating waste. Higher ore mined tonnes were driven by positive ore
reconciliations and a focus on mining in high grade areas.

Review of operations (continued)
Mining Operations (continued)
Cowal (continued)
Reduced costs were driven by a combination of higher volumes of material moved, higher than anticipated grade,
higher recoveries, lower mining costs, lower capital spend and lower processing costs. This impressive
performance during the year led to the unit cash operating costs and AISC being well below the improved full
year guidance of $650 - $750/oz and $800 - $850/oz respectively. Total ore processed for the year was 6,666kt
at a grade of 1.33g/t with gold recovery of 83.5%. Gold production was also above plan for the year due to
increases in grade processed and higher recoveries.
Cowal generated $193.058 million and $163.646 million in operating and net mine cash flow respectively since its
acquisition, which is an outstanding result and confirms the asset quality acquired.
Productivity improvements and cost reductions achieved during the year included:
•
•
•
•
Since ownership, the Ore Reserves have been upgraded from 1.56Moz to 2.85Moz, an increase of 83%
and Ore Resources have been upgraded from 3.263Moz to 5.046Moz, and increase of 55%.
E42 Resource Development drilling is currently in progress in support of the Stage H cutback feasibility
study. Seven drill rigs are now in position with initial assays supporting prior interpretations and identifying
new zones of mineralisation.
Use of high shock energy products in blasts has seen higher dig rates improving mining production and
softer mill feed improving mill production.
Shorter shut times during the year reduced mill maintenance costs by $6.8 million against plan.
Mungari
The acquisition of Mungari was completed on 24 August 2015 and saw the establishment of a strong strategic
partnership with the La Mancha Group and its owner Naguib Sawaris. Mungari finished the year as the Groups
second highest producer with 137,193oz from just over 10 months of ownership following its successful
integration. Mungari is a low cost quality asset with a unit cash operating cost of $756/oz and AISC of $1,024/oz.
Underground ore mined at Frogs Leg for the year totaled 563kt at an average grade mined of 5.89g/t targeting
the Fog, Dwarf, Mist and Rocket orebodies. Underground development of 2,785m was completed during the year
and comprised 1,629m of operating development and 1,157m of capital development. A milestone was achieved
with ground support rehabilitation of ore drives completing in the Mist orebody following a geotechnical review.
This allowed jumbos to resume focus on face advance, albeit with the increased level of support.
Open pit ore mined from White Foil for the year was 1,121kt at an average grade mined of 1.47g/t with total
material mined of 8,590kt. Production focused on the completion of Stage 2A, progression of Stage 2B and the
commencement of the northern Stage 3 cutback.
Productivity improvements and cost reductions achieved during the year included:
•
•
•
Progress has been made on extending the life of the Frog’s Leg mine as a result of well planned and
executed diamond drilling programs combined with the ramp up of regional exploration.
A live online data monitoring system was introduced to the mine during the year which resulted in
improving the average payload of trucks by 4% in the commissioning phase.
Mungari moved to an owner-operator for shotcrete activities during the year. This will result in reduced
ground support costs going forward by combining these activities with the paste-fill operations.

Review of operations (continued)
Mining Operations (continued)
Mt Carlton
The Group’s only concentrate producing mine, Mt Carlton produced a record of 113,056 oz in payable gold at a
record low unit cash operating cost of $463/oz and a record low AISC of $742/oz (30 June 2015: 77,658 oz,
687/oz, $912/oz). These record results for the year were driven by a combination of increased average grade
mined of 5.55g/t (30 June 2015: 4.42g/t) being achieved and the realisation of lower mining costs as a result of
the transition to owner-maintainer of the mining fleet.
Mining activity focused on the medium and high grade zones in Stage 2 of the V2 pit which resulted in higher
tonnes mined and higher average grade. Despite developing an improved resource model, the mined tonnes
variance was attributed to defining and mining additional ore outside of the Ore Reserve and the mining and
processing of incremental ore below the Ore Reserve cut-off grade.
Productivity improvements and cost reductions achieved during the year included:
•
•
•
Mining unit costs were significantly reduced for year at $6.36/t (30 June 2015: $8.60/t) as a result of cost
reductions and productivity improvements captured through the transition to owner-maintainer for the
mining fleet.
The ongoing plant optimisation project has seen improved filtration circuit performance due to a new
preventative maintenance regime ensuring more consistent filter feed slurry density along with improved
stability of the flotation circuit with ongoing modifications to the process control logic and a new design of
dart valve that improves tank level control.
A new weightometer was installed to correct a persistent mill feed tonnage measurement problem.
Mt Rawdon
Mt Rawdon had a difficult year which focused heavily on completing the Stage 4 cutback while processing low
grade stockpile. Additionally, seasonal storms across Central Queensland resulted in heavy rainfall limiting
access to high-grade ore from the Stage 3 pit floor. Despite the issues encountered gold production of 85,002oz
was achieved at a unit cash operating cost of $726/oz and an AISC of $1,024/oz (30 June 2015: 102,162oz,
$631/oz, $873/oz).
A total of 3,307kt of ore was mined at an average grade of 0.88g/t (30 June 2015: 3,283kt, 1.04g/t). Processed
tonnages remained consistent with the prior year at 3,421kt (30 June 2015: 3,405kt).
Mining activity continued to focus on the Stage 4 cutback which has now accessed ore and initial reconciliations
against the resource model have been positive.
Productivity improvements and cost reductions achieved during the year included:
•
•
•
Ongoing improvement initiatives around grinding and cyanide consumption have delivered a 6% saving in
unit processing costs.
Unit mining costs have continued to trend lower averaging $3.19/t for the year representing a significant
improvement over the prior period unit mining cost of $3.41/t. This has been as a result of incremental
improvements in mining productivity, low fuel prices and production drilling improvement initiatives.
The accelerated stripping capital program at Mt Rawdon is almost complete. The strip ratio is expected to
drop from approximately 4.4:1 in FY16 down to approximately 2.1:1 in FY17

Edna May
Edna May produced 71,028oz of gold for the year at a unit cash operating cost of $1,407/oz and an AISC of
$1,504/oz (30 June 2015: 98,766oz, $747/oz, $898/oz). This outcome was largely driven by the increased
difficulty in accessing the current high grade area of the pit due to tight working areas and significant rainfalls
throughout spring and summer.
The waste profile of Stage 2 transitioned from predominantly capital waste to operating waste during the year in
line with the increased ore tonnes being mined from Stage 2. Operating waste mined was 5,550kt (30 June 2015:
1,639kt), resulting in a significantly higher mining cost than the previous year. Gold mined grades were
significantly lower than the prior period at 0.91g/t (30 June 2015: 1.27g/t) contributing to the lower production
during the year. A return to higher grade ore at the base of the cutback is anticipated in FY17.
Key achievements during the year included:
•
•
The stage 1 Underground Development received board approval during the March 2016 quarter and
development commenced in June 2016 with contractors starting ground preparation for the portal and
surface water reticulation pipework. The capital investment of $16.0 million targets an initial resource of
approximately 200,000oz.
A feasibility study is currently being undertaken for Stage 2 of the underground development with portal
development and installation of gen-set and power reticulation is planned in early FY17.
Cracow
Cracow proved its reliability once again and repeated a strong gold production and cost result with 90,626oz at a
unit cash operating costs of $746/oz and AISC of $1,065/oz (30 June 2015: 93,064oz, $726/oz, $1,050/oz).
A total of 499kt of ore was mined at an average grade of 5.92g/t (30 June 2015: 541kt, 5.85g/t), with the primary
ore sources being the Kilkenny, Empire and Klondyke ore bodies. The slight reduction in production was primarily
driven by a decrease in ore processed through the mill of 511kt (30 June 2015: 541kt) and lower plant utilisation
of 95.8% compared with 97.6% in the prior year. This was offset by a higher grade mined driven by stope dilution
management, selective mining and access to higher grades when developing ore levels.
Underground development during the year comprised of 4,988m split between operating development of 3,000m
and capital development of 1,988m (30 June 2015: 3,105m, 2,599m). Production drilling focused on improving
stoping flexibility with ore development at Klondyke and Tipperary. Capital development focused on accessing
the Klondyke remnants and lower levels of the Empire stopes with the successful trial of narrow vein mining
techniques.
Productivity improvements and cost reductions achieved during the year included:
•
•
Transfer of surplus equipment between sites delivered reduced costs and reduced contractor dependency
Reduced power costs with the plant and mine feeder being switched over to a new power factor
conversion capacitor banks. This change also allowing for the ventilation fans at the Empire and VR1
decline to be connected to mains power no longer requiring diesel.

Pajingo
Pajingo exceeded internal benchmarks, doubling its net mine cash flow for the year to $26.515 million. Pajingo
was able to increase ore mined and tonnes processed by 10% and 13% respectively, while keeping costs flat
against a lower processed grade to result in steady unit cash operating costs of $785/oz (30 June 2015: $787/oz)
and AISC of $1,161/oz (30 June 2015: $1,163/oz). Gold production increased 5% to 68,630oz (30 June 2015:
65,919oz), driven by higher processed tonnes which helped to offset lower planned gold grades.
Pajingo's primary ore sources continued to be the Sonia East, Sonia Splay, Zed East and Zed West orebodies
with total ore mined of 418kt at an average grade of 5.50g/t (30 June 2015: 379kt, 5.78g/t). Additional targets
continued to be identified in the upper remnant areas of these lodes following an engineering and geological
review.
Underground development of 4,138m comprised of 1,867m in operating development and 2,272m in capital
development (30 June 2015: 3,133m, 2,342m). The completion of the Camembert underground platform and
associated diamond drilling program allowed for the development of the Camembert deposit to commence during
the year.
Productivity improvements and capital projects commissioned during the year included:
•
•
Reductions in processing unit rates were achieved due to improved management of the processing tanks
for campaign milling as well as the processing of a historic low grade laterite stockpile which was located
at the mill and thus only attracting the incremental processing costs for treatment.
A new tailings facility was permitted during the March quarter to provide approximately 2.5 years of tails
storage.
Financial Performance
Profit or Loss
Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2016 was up 100% to $1.329 billion (30 June 2015: $665.958 million)
largely as a result of the first year inclusion of Cowal and Mungari which contributed revenues of $375.346 million
and $232.549 million respectively. The original five mine sites contributed $720.719 million which is an increase
on the prior year of 8%. This can be largely attributed to an outstanding performance at Mt Carlton which offset
operational issues at a couple of the other sites along with a 7% increase in the achieved gold price to $1,597/oz
(30 June 2015: $1,489/oz).
Deliveries into the hedge book were 264,322oz at an average price of $1,594/oz (30 June 2015: 85,147oz,
$1,571/oz). The remaining 551,266oz were sold at spot price achieving an average price of $1,591/oz (30 June
2015: 279,646oz, $1,526/oz). Additionally, the Company acquired a further 245,985oz of gold delivery contracts
as part of the La Mancha acquisition, with scheduled quarterly deliveries from September 2015 through to
December 2017. The Group's outstanding hedge book as at 30 June 2016 totals 706,989oz at an average price
of $1,624/oz for deliveries to June 2020.

Financial Performance (continued)
Profit or Loss (continued)
Operating costs (excluding depreciation, amortisation and fair value adjustments of $422.766 million) increased
to $674.226 million (30 June 2015: $360.525 million) as a result of the first year inclusion of Cowal and Mungari
which accounted for operating costs of $153.108 million and $117.487 million respectively. The operating costs
for the existing five mine sites were $403.631 million, an increase of 12% on the prior year. This increase is
largely due to the transition of the Edna May Stage 2 cut back from capital waste to operating waste during the
year. Despite the increase, the Group continues to place a strong focus on cost control over operating activities
and anticipates efficiencies in FY17.
The Group's AISC decreased 2% to $1,014/oz (30 June 2015: $1,036/oz) despite a 9% drop in average grade
mined during the year. This grade decline was offset by the benefits of the new low cost assets, Cowal and
Mungari which contributed $776/oz and $1,024/oz respectively. Mt Carlton was the largest contributor with an
AISC of $742/oz representing a decrease of 23% on the prior year (30 June 2015: $912/oz).
Total exploration expenditure for the year ended 30 June 2016 was $27.823 million (30 June 2015: $23.981
million) with an exploration expense of $13.801 million (30 June 2015: $6.968 million).
The Group posted a record underlying profit after tax of $226.884 million (30 June 2015: $106.050 million) and a
statutory net loss after tax of $24.349 million (30 June 2015: profit $100.115 million) for the year ended 30 June
2016. This increase in underlying profit was driven by record production, a strong focus on cost control and an
improved Australian dollar gold price.

In July 2015, the Group's gearing ratio peaked at 32.0% as a result of drawing down on the Senior Secured
Syndicated Revolving and Term Facility ("The Facility") to fund the Cowal acquisition. This was subsequently
reduced to 15.1% as at 30 June 2016 as a result of a total of $322 million in voluntary and early repayments
during the year. As at 30 June 2016, the Group was 15 months ahead of the Term Facility repayment schedule.

Review of operations (continued)
Financial Performance (continued)
Balance Sheet (continued)
The Group’s net assets increased by 38% to $1.551 billion (30 June 2015: $1.125 billion), primarily due to the
completion of the Cowal, Mungari and Phoenix acquisitions which contributed net assets of $1.065 billion, offset
by the resulting draw down of $607 million on The Facility and impairment of assets of $77.330 million. At 30
June 2016, the Group held a cash balance of $17.279 million and total net debt of $296.455 million. Total net
debt comprises $285 million outstanding on The Facility (less $6.677 million of capitalised borrowing costs),
$9.660 million of finance leases and $8.472 million of other short-term debt. The Group also reclassified net
assets of $45 million for the Pajingo asset to held for sale as a result of the subsequent divestment.
Total assets increased during the period to $2.187 billion (30 June 2015: $1.312 billion), representing a 67%
movement. Excluding the Cowal, Mungari and Phoenix transactions, which account for the majority of the
increase, total assets decreased by 28% which can be attributed to the reduction in cash, property, plant and
equipment and mine development and exploration of 94%, 18% and 25% respectively. Capital additions for
property, plant and equipment totalled $70.260 million, while depreciation totalled $134.556 million. Mine
development and exploration additions totalled $164.455 million as a result of continued stripping at Cowal, Mt
Rawdon and Edna May, while amortisation totalled $200.894 million.
Total liabilities for the Group increased to $635.726 million as at 30 June 2016 from $187.678 as at 30 June
2015. This increase is largely due to the $607 million drawing of The Facility which was used to fund the
acquisition of the Cowal asset. The balance of The Facility as at 30 June 2016 was $285 million with scheduled
repayments on the Revolving Facility out to July 2018 and the Term Facility out to July 2020.
Cash Flow
The Group ended the year with a cash balance of $17.295 million and available credit of $205 million through the
Revolving Facility.
Net cash inflow from operating activities was $574.084 million, an increase of $289.347 million (30 June 2015:
$284.737 million). The majority of the increase can be attributed to the first year inclusion of the Cowal and
Mungari assets which contributed net receipts of $239.047 million and $112.024 million respectively. The
remaining increase is a result of the increase in achieved gold price.
Net cash outflows from investment activities were $999.380 million, a $804.309 million increase (30 June 2015:
$195.071 million) consisting of payments for the acquisition of Cowal and Phoenix of $734.646 million and the
payment of stamp duty on the Cowal and Mungari transaction of $48.091 million. Capital investments for the
period include property plant and equipment of $70.260 million and mine development and exploration of
$164.455 million.
Net cash inflows from financing activities were $236.803 million, an increase of $152.288 million (30 June 2015:
outflow $84.515 million). Financing for the period included the drawing of $607 million on The Facility and the
subsequent voluntary and early repayments on The Facility of $322 million and La Mancha Debt Facility of $124
million. Also included are net proceeds received on the issue of shares to the La Mancha Group of $111.468
million, dividend payments of $23.834 million and a net drawing of $3.062 million for Mt Carlton shipment
refinancing and insurance premiums.
Total cash outflows for the year amounted to $188.493 million (30 June 2015: inflow $174.181 million).
Taxation
As at the year ended 30 June 2016, the balance sheet carried a deferred tax liability as a result of timing
differences of $0.089 million.

Financial Performance (continued)
Taxation (continued)
The Company recognised a $17.244 million tax benefit in the current period from previously unrecognised tax
losses to reduce the current tax expense. The Group has available tax losses as at 30 June 2016. These tax
losses have not been recognised due to the uncertainty of their recoverability in future periods.
Capital Expenditure
Capital expenditure has increased 19% to $200.214 million (30 June 2015: $168.197 million). This consists of
sustaining capital, including near mine exploration and resource definition of $106.970 million (30 June 2015:
$77.012 million) and major projects, including mine development of $93.244 million (30 June 2015: $91.185
million). This increase can be attributed to the Stage 4 cutback at Mt Rawdon and the Stage 2 cutback at Edna
May for the open pit operations and continuing capital development at the underground operations.
Financing
Total finance costs for the year were $43.785 million (30 June 2015: $14.382 million). Included in total finance
costs is Interest expenses of $26.314 million (30 June 2015: $8.622 million), debt establishment fee amortisation
of $11.623 million (30 June 2015: $1.225 million) and discount unwinding on mine rehabilitation liabilities of
$3.406 million (30 June 2015: $2.098 million).
In May 2015, the Group entered into a refinancing arrangement by way of a letter of commitment. The Facility
comprises $300 million Senior Secured Revolving Loan (“Facility A”), a $400 million Senior Secured Term Loan
(“Facility B”), and a $155 million Performance Bond Facility (“Facility C”).
The Facility was executed on 20 July 2015 and was effective from that date.
The Facility was drawn down on 23 July 2015 on completion of the Cowal acquisition and is repayable over the
following periods:
•

•
Facility A: 31 July 2018
Facility B: 20 July 2020
Facility C: 20 July 2018
Future outlook
Material business risks
The Group prepares its business plans using estimates of production and financial performance based on a
range of assumptions and forecasts. There is uncertainty in these assumptions and forecasts, and risk that
variation from them could result in actual performance being different to expected outcomes. The uncertainties
arise from a range of factors, including the nature of the mining industry and general economic factors. The
material business risks faced by the Group that may have an impact on the operating and financial prospects of
the Group as at 30 June 2016 are:
Fluctuations in the gold price and Australian dollar
The Group’s revenues are exposed to fluctuations in both the gold price and the Australian dollar. Volatility in the
gold price and Australian dollar creates revenue uncertainty and requires careful management of business
performance to ensure that operating cash margins are maintained should the Australian dollar gold price fall.
11
Evolution Mining Limited
Annual Financial Report
Directors' Report
30 June 2016
Review of operations (continued)
Material business risks (continued)
Fluctuations in the gold price and Australian dollar (continued)
Declining gold prices can also impact operations by requiring a reassessment of the feasibility of a particular
exploration or development project. Even if a project is ultimately determined to be economically viable, the need
to conduct such a reassessment could cause substantial delays and/or may interrupt operations, which may have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources
The Group’s Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are estimates, and no assurance can be given that the
estimated reserves and resources are accurate or that the indicated level of gold, silver or any other mineral will
be produced. Such estimates are, in large part, based on interpretations of geological data obtained from drill
holes and other sampling techniques. Actual mineralisation or geological conditions may be different from those
predicted. No assurance can be given that any part or all of the Group’s Mineral Resources constitute or will be
converted into Ore Reserves.
Market price fluctuations of gold and silver as well as increased production and capital costs may render the
Group’s Ore Reserves unprofitable to develop at a particular site or sites for periods of time or may render Ore
Reserves containing relatively lower grade mineralisation uneconomic. Estimated reserves may have to be
re-estimated based on actual production experience. Any of these factors may require the Group to reduce its
Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources, which could have a negative impact on the Group’s financial results.
Replacement of depleted reserves
The Group must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long
term. Reserves can be replaced by expanding known ore bodies, locating new deposits or making acquisitions.
Exploration is highly speculative in nature. The Group’s exploration projects involve many risks and are frequently
unsuccessful. Once a site with mineralisation is discovered, it may take several years from the initial phases of
drilling until production is possible.
As a result, there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful. There is a risk
that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions or that divestitures of assets will lead to
a lower reserve base. The mineral base of the Group may decline if reserves are mined without adequate
replacement and the Group may not be able to sustain production beyond the current mine lives, based on
current production rates.
Mining risks and insurance risks
The mining industry is subject to significant risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial
accidents, unusual or unexpected geological conditions, unavailability of materials and equipment, pit wall
failures, rock bursts, seismic events, cave-ins, and weather conditions (including flooding and bush fires), most of
which are beyond the Group’s control. These risks and hazards could result in significant costs or delays that
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial performance, liquidity and results of operation.
The Group maintains insurance to cover the most common of these risks and hazards. The insurance is
maintained in amounts that are considered reasonable depending on the circumstances surrounding each
identified risk. However property, liability and other insurance may not provide sufficient coverage for losses
related to these or other risks or hazards.

Annual Financial Report
Directors' Report
30 June 2016
Review of operations (continued)
Material business risks (continued)
Production and cost estimates
The Group prepares estimates of future production, cash costs and capital costs of production for its operations.
No assurance can be given that such estimates will be achieved. Failure to achieve production or cost estimates
or material increases in costs could have an adverse impact on the Group’s future cash flows, profitability, results
of operations and financial condition.
The Group’s actual production and costs may vary from estimates for a variety of reasons, including: actual ore
mined varying from estimates of grade, tonnage, dilution and metallurgical and other characteristics; short-term
operating factors relating to the ore reserves, such as the need for sequential development of ore bodies and the
processing of new or different ore grades; revisions to mine plans; risks and hazards associated with mining;
natural phenomena, such as inclement weather conditions, water availability and floods; and unexpected labour
shortages or strikes.
Costs of production may also be affected by a variety of factors, including: changing waste-to-ore ratios, ore
grade metallurgy, labour costs, cost of commodities, general inflationary pressures and currency exchange rates.
Environmental, health and safety; permits
The Group’s mining and processing operations and exploration activities are subject to extensive laws and
regulations governing the protection of the environment, waste disposal, worker safety, mine development and
protection of endangered and other special status species. The Group’s ability to obtain permits and approvals
and to successfully operate may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with
the Group’s activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety or
the surrounding communities. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain government permits and approvals may
adversely affect the Group’s operations, including its ability to continue operations.
While the Group has implemented extensive health, safety and community initiatives at its sites to ensure the
health and safety of its employees, contractors and members of the community affected by its operations, there is
no guarantee that such measures will eliminate the occurrence of accidents or other incidents which may result in
personal injuries or damage to property, and in certain instances such occurrences could give rise to regulatory
fines and/or civil liability.
Community relations
The Group has an established community relations function, both at a Group level and at each of its operations.
The Group function has developed a community engagement framework, including a set of principles, policies
and procedures designed to provide a structured and consistent approach to community activities across our
sites whilst recognising that, fundamentally, Community Relations is about people connecting with people. The
Group recognises that a failure to appropriately manage local community stakeholder expectations may lead to
dissatisfactions which have the potential to disrupt production and exploration activities.
Risk management
The Group manages the risks listed above, and other day-to-day risks through an established management
framework which conforms to Australian and international standards and guidance. The Group’s risk reporting
and control mechanisms are designed to ensure strategic, operational, legal, financial, reputational and other
risks are identified, assessed and appropriately managed. These are reviewed by the Risk Committee throughout
the year.

Risk management (continued)
The financial reporting and control mechanisms are reviewed during the year by management, the internal audit

The Leadership Team, the Risk Committee and the Board regularly review the risk portfolio of the business and
the effectiveness of the Group’s management of those risks.
Events occurring after the reporting period
No matter or circumstance has occurred subsequent to the year end that has significantly affected, or may
significantly affect, the operations of the Group, the results of those operations or state of affairs of the Group or
economic entity in subsequent financial years except for the following matters:
(a) Divestment of Pajingo asset
On 16 August, the Company signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with Minjar Gold Pty Limited for the sale of
the Pajingo asset for $45 million. The consideration comprises of $42 million in cash and $3 million in deferred
consideration. The sale is expected to settle in early September.
Likely developments and expected results of operations
Further information on likely developments in the operations of the Group and the expected results of operations
have not been included in this Annual Financial Report because the Directors believe it would be likely to result in
unreasonable prejudice to the Group.
Environmental regulation
The Group is subject to the reporting requirements of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007.
The National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 requires the Group to report its annual greenhouse
gas emissions and energy use. The Group has implemented systems and processes for the collection and
calculation of the data required and submitted its 2014/15 report to the Greenhouse and Energy Data Officer on
31 October 2015.

(d) Industry Context
After two extremely challenging years, the industry began to experience a recovery in 2015. Improved sentiment
towards the sector, which has been evidenced by rising share prices of Australian gold miners, has been driven
by two major tailwinds.
Firstly, the decline in the Australian dollar from 2011 highs of US$1.10 to the current level of around US$0.75 has
provided a natural hedge against the US dollar gold price. The Australian dollar gold price is now back at close to
record highs of around A$1,750 per ounce, with the recent rally in the US$ gold price to US$1,350, from its
recent low of US$1,040 per ounce.
Secondly, costs in the Australian gold industry have been reduced substantially in recent years, albeit back to
what can be best described as normal levels. Throughout the decade-long commodities bull run, which ended
around the end of 2012, Australian resources companies experienced the highest cost inflation in the world
relative to their global peers. The sharp sell-off in commodities prices in recent years has seen costs come down
rapidly towards more normalised levels. With large reductions in the number of workers across the broader
resources industry, competition for labour has eased. As a result, gold companies have benefited from reduced
voluntary staff turnover and an increase in productivity.
Mining services companies are also now competing much more aggressively for business which is further
reducing the cost base of Australian gold miners.
The pendulum has swung back in favour of Australian gold miners. After many years of delivering new projects
above budget and behind schedule, companies are now delivering projects below budget and ahead of schedule.
The combination of the Australian dollar and rapidly declining costs have meant many of the Australian mid-tier
gold producers are able to generate strong cash margins in the current environment.
Since the mid-2013 it has been estimated that around 23% of Australia’s annual gold production has changed
hands. Offshore companies have divested many of their non-core Australian assets and a group of Australian
mid-tier miners who have purchased these assets are being rewarded by the market.
Over the last few years, from a remuneration perspective, we have continued to take active steps in prudent
financial management, in particular with regards to our fixed cost base, as well as moving performance awards
more weighted towards the variable elements of the remuneration mix.
The latest McDonald’s remuneration benchmarking report (April 2016 - 88 companies, 249 positions surveyed,
made up of 38,127 individual employees) has the following key findings:
•
•
•
In November 2015, those employed in the Resources industry were still receiving the highest Full-Time
Adult Average Weekly Ordinary Time Earnings reported in Australia at $2,523.00. The equivalent figure for
the Construction industry was $1,500.18;
The predominant rosters remain at the even roster (23%), however both the 5/2 and the 8/6 rosters
cumulatively have increased when looking at rostering arrangements across all incumbents (21% and
20% respectively), with those on a 2/1 roster being paid a premium for longer stints;
Despite the continuation of media coverage with regards to WA wide redundancies (BHP, Rio Tinto, South
32), WA continues to be pay a premium (along with NT) to the eastern states, with unemployment in WA
jumping from 5.7% to 6.2% in 2015-2016;
26

Remuneration Report (Audited) (continued)
(d) Industry Context (continued)
•
•
Year-on-year actual annual remuneration percentage increases reduce significantly over the last 5 years
from 5% in 2011-2012 to 0.7% in 2015-2016;
Forecast salary increase budgets - including salary freezes - have seen upper quartile budgets reduce
from 3% in 2014-2015, to 1.5% in 2016-2017.
We firmly believe we have the right company vision and strategy and our remuneration strategy aims to ensure
that we have the right mix of responding to the prevailing market conditions, recognising and rewarding the good
work done over the last 12 months and ensuring that we have motivated and engaged employees to enable the
successful delivery of short term goals and longer term strategic objectives.
(e) Remuneration Strategy and Philosophy
The remuneration strategy was set in the year ended 30 June 2012 with the assistance of Mercer Australia
(“remuneration consultants”), which included the setting of short term (“STIP”) and long term incentive plans
(“LTIP”) to align with objectives of the newly established entity. For the year ended 30 June 2016, new STIP and
LTIP measures were agreed and aligned to the key objectives for the Group.
The Group’s target remuneration philosophies are:
•
•
•
Total Fixed Remuneration (TFR being base salary plus superannuation) positioned at the median (50th
percentile) based on the industry benchmark McDonald report (an industry recognised gold and general
mining remuneration benchmarking survey covering over 80 organisations within the industry);
Total Annual Remuneration (TFR plus STI) at the 75th percentile for high performers; and
Total Remuneration (TFR plus STIP plus LTI) at the 75th percentile, with flexibility to provide up to the
90th percentile levels for high performers and critical roles.
The overarching objectives and principles of the Group’s remuneration strategy are that:
•
•
•
•
•
•
total remuneration for each level of the workforce is appropriate and competitive;
total remuneration comprises a competitive fixed component and a sizeable “at risk” component based on
performance hurdles;
short term incentives are appropriate with hurdles that are measureable, transparent and achievable;
incentive plans are designed to motivate and incentivise for high performance and delivery on
organisational objectives;
the corporate long term incentives are focused on shareholder value; and
the principles and integrity of the remuneration review process deliver fair and equitable outcomes.
(f) Remuneration Policy
Executive Directors and Key Management Personnel Remuneration Policy
The Group remuneration policy has been designed to align Executive Directors and Key Management Personnel
objectives with shareholder and business objectives by providing a TFR component and offering specific “at risk”
short and long-term incentives based on key performance areas affecting the Group’s overall performance. The
Nomination and Remuneration committee was formed to review the specifics of Directors and KMP remuneration
and oversee all Group compensation changes and principles. The Board believes the remuneration policy to be
strategic, appropriate and effective in its ability to attract and retain Executive Directors and KMP and to operate
and manage the Group effectively.
The Group defines and applies its remuneration policy and elements by considering the overall business plan,
external market conditions, key employee value drivers, individual employee performance and industry
benchmark data.

Remuneration Report (Audited) (continued)
(f) Remuneration Policy (continued)
Executive Directors and Key Management Personnel Remuneration Policy (continued)
All KMP receive a remuneration package in line with the overall Group policy and additionally takes into account
factors such as length of service and experience. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee reviews
executive packages annually by reference to the Group’s performance, individual KMP performance and
comparable information from industry sectors and surveys, as well as other listed companies in similar industries.
The remuneration elements offered by the Group include TFR, which consists of a base salary plus
superannuation and a variable or “at risk” remuneration component provided through short and long term
incentive plans. Every permanent employee has eligibility under the Group’s annual and quarterly bonus STI
programs.
Executive Directors and KMP receive a superannuation guarantee contribution (“SGC”) required by law, of 9.5%
and capped in line with the SGC maximum quarterly payment, and do not receive any other retirement benefits.
Some individuals, however, may choose to sacrifice part of their salary to increase payments towards
superannuation.
The at Target achievement remuneration mix for Executive Directors and KMP for the 2016 Financial year and
prior year is as follows:

Changed position to part-time role effective 1 July 2016. Ceased as Vice President Discovery & Chief Geologist
effective 30 June 2016.
There were two key changes to the remuneration structure approved by the Board that are aligned with shifting
our remuneration mix to having a larger variable component. With this in mind, effective 1 July 2017, the STI
target level will shift from 50% to 60% and the LTI target level will shift from 60% to 100%.

The Board policy is to remunerate Non-Executive Directors at market rates for comparable companies for time,
commitment and responsibilities. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee determines Non-Executive
Directors fees and reviews this annually, based on market practice, their duties and areas of responsibility.
Independent external advice is sought when required. The maximum aggregate amount of fees that can be paid
to Non-Executive Directors is subject to approval by shareholders (currently $950,000 per annum). Fees for
Non-Executive Directors are not linked to the performance of the Group and they currently do not participate in
the Group’s STIP or LTIP.
(g) Relationship between Remuneration and Performance
The relative proportions of actual remuneration received by the Directors and KMP of the Group is calculated
based on the Remuneration of Directors and KMP table presented on page 39. The At Risk - LTI component
comprises the fair value of options and performance rights expensed during the year. The breakdown between
fixed and performance related remuneration received for the current and prior year is as follows:

Short Term Incentive Plans
(i) The Group Plan
The Group STIP applies to employees at the level of Manager and above across the Group. The Group STIP is a
cash bonus, up to a maximum percentage of TFR, based on the employee job band. It is assessed and paid
annually conditional upon the achievement of key corporate objectives, which for the current financial year were
in the areas of safety, group cash contribution, production, costs and a board discretionary element, as well as
individual key performance indicators (“KPI"). The Group STIP is currently set at between 20% and 60% of TFR
for at Target achievement, with a maximum of 1.5 x Target at 30%-90% of TFR for Stretch achievement,
depending on the employee job band.
Details of Group STIP’s and bonuses paid to the Directors and KMP are shown in the Remuneration Table on
page 39.

(g) Relationship between Remuneration and Performance (continued)
Short Term Incentive Plans (continued)
The discretionary component was allocated a high weighting to provide the Board with more input into the overall
business performance and to address factors outside of the operational performance (safety, production, costs
and cash).
At the time of setting the FY16 STIP measures, the Board determined it would consider the following factors
when awarding the score for this measure:
•
•
•
•
Overall business performance;
Successful integration of the Cowal and Mungari assets;
Discovery outcomes that contribute to the growth of the company; and
Continuing the development of the core culture and values of the Group.
The Board approved a discretionary score of 130.00% for a number of reasons, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Overall business performance on a Group basis met or exceeded set targets. A number of records have
been achieved throughout the business this year. The weighted average result of the four (4) business
performance measures in the STIP was 139.31%;
The integration of the Mungari and Cowal assets has gone to schedule and they are well embedded in the
Group now. There is still work to be done to ensure the ongoing success of the integration but the
performance of these assets and their buy-in to the Evolution way of business has been very pleasing;
The implementation of improvements in our planning area through the province plans, more timely
completion of the MROR program and higher quality Life of Mine plans have made us better positioned to
be able to develop a longer term outlook for the business;
The successful completion of the Phoenix acquisition was an important step in creating a more
prospective and longer term future for the Mungari asset;
A sustained focus on cash management and debt has enabled us to capture all the benefits of higher
production, lower costs, and higher prices to reduce our debt position from $607 million upon closing the
Cowal transaction to $285 million at the end of June 2016;
In terms of Discovery not all outcomes were achieved, but good progress was made in Tennant Creek JV,
Puhipuhi, and brownfields programs in the portfolio; and
• Work has been ongoing on the core culture and values of the company. The outcomes of the engagement
survey were very positive with 81% response rate, 94% overall satisfaction and a 76% engagement score.
The successful Act Like Owner program and the employee share offer (92% acceptance rate) are other
examples of continued development of the core culture in the business.
(ii) The Performance Bonus
The Performance Bonus is a cash award which applies to all employees at Operating Sites who are not eligible
for the Group STIP. It is determined on a quarterly basis based on the achievement of each Operating Site’s
KPIs. The Performance Bonus is currently set at 10% of TFR for at target achievement, with a maximum of 20%
of TFR for stretch achievement.
(iii) The Annual Performance Bonus
The Annual Performance Bonus applies to corporate employees and those employees who, by exception, are not
included in a Group STIP or Performance Bonus Plan. The Annual Performance Bonus is targeted at up to a
maximum of 20% for stretch achievement (target of 10%), as a cash bonus on TFR, paid annually against the
outcomes of individual KPIs.

Long Term Incentive Plans
The Company has two long term incentive plans currently in existence, specifically the Employees and
Contractors Option Plan (“ECOP”) and the Employee Share Option and Performance Rights Plan (“ESOP”),
together and separately also referred to as the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). The ECOP is now effectively
dormant with no new options to be issued under this plan.
(i) Employees and Contractors Option Plan (“ECOP”)
The ECOP was established and approved at the Annual General Meeting on 27 November 2008. The plan
permits the Company, at the discretion of the Directors, to grant Options over unissued ordinary shares of the
Company to eligible Directors, members of staff and contractors as specified in the plan rules.
Options under ECOP
As at 30 June 2016, there were 52,954 Options outstanding (30 June 2015: 488,651), all of which were on issue
to Directors.
The movement in the Options under this plan is summarised in the table below:

(ii) The Employee Share Option and Performance Right Plan (“ESOP”)
The ESOP was established and approved at the Annual General Meeting on 23 November 2010, and
re-approved at the Annual General Meeting on 26 November 2014. The plan permits the Company, at the
discretion of the Directors, to grant both Options and Performance Rights over unissued ordinary shares of the
Company to eligible Directors and members of staff as specified in the plan rules.
Under the ESOP, the Options and Performance Rights, issued for nil consideration, are granted in accordance
with performance guidelines established by the Board. In exercising their discretion under the rules, the Directors
will take into account matters such as the position of the eligible person, the role they play in the Group, the
nature or terms of their employment or contract and the contribution they make to the Group as a whole. The
Options and Performance Rights are issued for a specified period and each Option or Performance Right is
convertible into one ordinary share. The exercise price of the Options, determined in accordance with the rules of
the plan, is based on the market price of a share on grant date or another specified date after grant close. All
Options and Performance Rights expire on the earlier of their expiry date or termination of the employee’s
employment subject to Director discretion. Options and Performance Rights do not vest until a specified period
after granting and their exercise is conditional on the achievement of certain performance hurdles that are aligned
with shareholder interests.
There are no voting or dividend rights attached to the Options or Performance Rights. Voting rights will attach to
the ordinary shares when the Options have been exercised or the Performance Rights vested. Unvested Options
and Performance Rights cannot be transferred and will not be quoted on the ASX.

The ESOP approved by shareholders on 23 November 2010 provided for the issuance of Performance Rights to
Executive Directors and eligible employees. This LTIP was introduced for employees at the level of Manager and
above, effective from 1 July 2011 and provides equity based “at risk” remuneration, up to maximum percentages,
based on, and in addition to, each eligible employee’s TFR. These incentives are aimed at retaining and
incentivising KMP and senior managers on a basis that is aligned with shareholder interests, and are provided via
Performance Rights.

The Group entered into a Retention Agreement with the Executive Chairman during the year. Pursuant to this
agreement 3,750,000 Retention Rights will be issued on the terms and conditions of the Company's current Employee
Share Option and Performance Rights Plan, subject to shareholder approval at the Company's next shareholder
meeting. The Retention Rights will be issued for nil consideration and will only vest three years from the date of the
Agreement if the Executive Chairman is an employee of the Company at that time.
The Performance rights awarded during the 2013 financial year were tested as at 30 June 2015 and vested on 2
September 2015. 2,262,954 Performance Rights met the performance measures and vested whilst 923,228

The Group’s TSR will be based on the percentage by which its 30-day volume weighted average share price
quoted on ASX (“VWAP”) at the close of trade on the Relevant Date (plus the value of any dividends paid during
the performance period) has increased over the Group’s applicable 30-day VWAP at the close of trade, relating
to the grant of Performance Rights for that period.
The TSR for the Peer Group will be based on the percentage by which the Peer Group’s 30-day VWAP at the
close of trade on the Relevant Date (plus the value of any dividends paid during the performance period) has
increased over that Group’s applicable 30-day VWAP at the close of trade, relating to the grant of Performance
Rights for that period.
The Board has the discretion to adjust the composition and number of the companies in the Peer Group to take
into account events including, but not limited to, takeovers, mergers and de-mergers that might occur during the
performance period.
The proportion of the TSR Performance Rights that will vest will be based on the Relevant Date TSR as
compared to the Peer Group TSRs. The proportion of the TSR Performance Rights that will vest will be
determined as follows:

Performance Rights Valuation for FY16 Grants
The Performance Rights have four performance components: two market-based TSR conditions, being a relative
and an absolute TSR condition, and two non-market based conditions, being the EPS growth condition, the
increased ore reserve condition in addition to continued employment at the vesting date.
The fair value of the TSR Performance Rights (market-based condition) was estimated at the date of grant using
Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.

Annual Financial Report
Directors' Report
30 June 2016
Indemnification of officers and auditors
During the financial year the Company paid a premium in respect of a contract insuring the Directors of the
Company, the company secretaries and all executive officers of the Company and of any related body corporate
against a liability incurred as such a Director, secretary or executive officer to the extent permitted by the
Corporations Act 2001. The contract of insurance prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liability and the amount
of the premium.
The Company has entered into a Deed of Indemnity, Insurance and Access with each Director. In Summary the
Deed provides for:
•
•
•
Access to corporate records for each Director for a period after ceasing to hold office in the Company;
The provision of Directors and Officers Liability Insurance; and
Indemnity for legal costs incurred by Directors in carrying out the business affairs of the Company.
Except for the above the Company has not otherwise, during or since the financial year, except to the amount
permitted by law, indemnified or agreed to indemnify an officer or auditor of the Company or of any related body
corporate against a liability incurred as such an officer or auditor.
Proceedings on behalf of the company
No person has applied to the Court under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 for leave to bring
proceedings on behalf of the Company, or to intervene in any proceedings to which the Company is a party, for
the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of the Company for all or part of those proceedings.
No proceedings have been brought or intervened in on behalf of the Company with leave of the Court under
section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001.
Non-audit services
The Company may decide to employ the auditor on assignments additional to their statutory audit duties where
the auditor's expertise and experience with the Company and/or the Group are important.
Details of the amounts paid or payable to the auditor (PricewaterhouseCoopers) for non-audit services provided
during the year are set out below. Details of the amounts paid or payable to the auditor for audit services
provided during the year are set out in note 19(a).
The board of Directors has considered the position and, in accordance with advice received from the audit
committee, is satisfied that the provision of the non-audit services is compatible with the general standard of
independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001. The Directors are satisfied that the provision of
non-audit services by the auditor, as set out below, did not compromise the auditor independence requirements
of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons:
•
•
all non-audit services have been reviewed by the audit committee to ensure they do not impact the

1 Segment information
(a) Description of segments
The Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the
Executive Chairman and the Senior Leadership Team (the chief business decision makers) in assessing
performance and in determining the allocation of resources.
The Group’s seven operational mine sites, Exploration and Corporate are each treated as individual operating
segments. Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making
decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Corporate includes share-based payment expenses and other corporate expenditures supporting the business
during the period.
Segment performance is evaluated based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
(EBITDA).
The Group’s operations are all conducted in the mining industry in Australia and New Zealand.

(b) Trade and other receivables
(i) Classification as trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course
of business. Loans and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market. If collection of the amounts is expected in one year or less they are
classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets. Trade receivables are generally due
for settlement within 30 days and therefore are all classified as current. The Group’s impairment and other
accounting policies for trade and other receivables are outlined in notes 10(c) and 23(j) respectively.
(ii) Other receivables
These amounts generally arise from transactions outside the usual operating activities of the Group.
(iii) Fair value of trade and other receivables
Due to the nature of these receivables, their carrying amount is assumed to approximate their fair value.
(iv) Impairment and risk exposure
Information about the impairment of trade and other receivables, their credit quality and the Group’s exposure to
credit risk can be found in note 10.

(i) Classification of financial assets as available-for-sale
Investments are designated as available-for-sale financial assets if they do not have fixed maturities and fixed or
determinable payments, and management intends to hold them for the medium to long-term. Financial assets
that are not classified into any of the other categories (at FVTPL, loans and receivables or held-to-maturity
investments) are also included in the available-for-sale category.
The financial assets are presented as non-current assets unless they mature, or management intends to dispose
of them within 12 months of the end of the reporting period.
(ii)
Impairment indicators for available-for-sale financial assets
A security is considered to be impaired if there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below
its cost. See note 23(l) for further details about the Group’s impairment policies for financial assets
(iii) Amounts recognised in profit or loss and other comprehensive income
During the year, the following gains/(losses) were recognised in profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

In May 2015, the Group entered into a refinancing arrangement by way of a letter of commitment. The Facility
comprises $300 million Senior Secured Revolving Loan (“Facility A”), a $400 million Senior Secured Term Loan
(“Facility B”), and a $155 million performance bond facility (“Facility C”).
The Facility was executed on 20 July 2015 and was effective from that date.
The Facility was drawn down on 23 July 2015 on completion of the Cowal acquisition and is repayable over the
following periods:
•
•
•
Facility A: 31 July 2018
Facility B: 20 July 2020
Facility C: 20 July 2018
In July 2015, the Group's gearing ratio peaked at 32.0% as a result of drawing down on The Facility to fund the
Cowal acquisition. This was subsequently reduced to 15.1% as at 30 June 2016 as a result of a total of $322
million in voluntary and early repayments during the year. As at 30 June 2016, the Group was 15 months ahead
of the Facility B repayment schedule.
(i) Secured liabilities and assets pledged as security
Lease liabilities are effectively secured as the rights to the leased assets recognised in the financial statements
revert to the lessor in the event of default.
Security on The Facility is held in the form of a General Security Agreement and Share Security Agreement over
the Groups operating assets. The carrying amounts of assets pledged as general security for current and
non-current borrowings is $1.387 billion. The share capital pledged as share security for current and non-current
borrowings is $1.992 billion.
(ii) Compliance with loan covenants
Evolution Mining Limited has complied with the financial covenants of its borrowing facilities as at the financial
years ended 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015, see note 11 for details.

(f) Recognised fair value measurements
(i) Fair value hierarchy
This section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial
instruments that are recognised and measured at fair value in the financial statements. To provide an indication
about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Group has classified its financial instruments
into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standards. An explanation of each level follows underneath
the table.

There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 for recurring fair value measurements during the year.
The Group did not measure any financial assets or liabilities on a non-recurring basis as at 30 June 2016.
Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives, and
trading and available-for-sale securities) is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. The
quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are
included in level 1.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example,
over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable
market data and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value
an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is
included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted equity securities.

(f) Recognised fair value measurements
(ii) Valuation techniques used to determine fair values
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
•
•
•
•
The use of quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows
based on observable yield curves.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the
balance sheet date.
the fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis.
All of the resulting fair value estimates are included in either level 1 or 2. There are no financial instruments
included in level 3 for the year ended 30 June 2016.

(i) Assigning costs to inventories
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost represents the weighted average cost and
includes direct costs and an appropriate portion of fixed and variable production overhead expenditure, including
depreciation and amortisation, incurred in converting material into finished goods.
(ii) Amounts recognised in profit or loss
Write-downs of inventories to net realisable value amounted to $1.443 million (30 June 2015: $5.357 million).
These were recognised as an expense during the year ended 30 June 2016 and included in 'cost of sales' in
profit or loss.

An impairment is recognised when the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount for the Pajingo asset cash-generating unit has been determined based on its
fair value less cost to dispose.
On 16 August, the Company signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with Minjar Gold Pty Limited for the sale of
the Pajingo asset for $45 million. The consideration comprises of $42 million in cash and $3 million in deferred
consideration. The sale is expected to settle in early September.
(ii) Non-recurring fair value measurements
The recoverable amount of the Pajingo asset has been determined based on the fair value less cost to dispose.

(i) Non-current assets pledged as security
Refer to note 5(e) for information on non-current assets pledged as security by the Group.
(ii) Depreciation methods and useful lives
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated using the straight line method to
allocate their cost, net of their residual values, over their estimated useful lives. The rates vary between 10% and
33% per annum.
See note 23(o) for the other accounting policies relevant to property, plant and equipment.

(i) Non-current assets pledged as security
Refer to note 5(e) for information on non-current assets pledged as security by the Group.
(ii) Amortisation methods and useful lives
Mine development costs are amortised on a units of production basis over the life of the area to which they relate.
In applying the units of production method, amortisation is calculated using the expected total contained ounces
within the mine to achieve a consistent amortisation rate per ounce. To achieve this, the amortisation rate is
based on the ratio of total mine development costs (incurred and anticipated) over the expected total contained
ounces.
See note 23(n) for the other accounting policies relevant to mine development and exploration.

As explained in note 23(l), the Group has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain investments in
equity securities in other comprehensive income. These changes are accumulated in a separate reserve within
equity. The entity does not have any policy on transferring amounts from this reserve to another reserve or to
retained earnings when the relevant equity securities are sold.

9 Critical estimates, judgements and errors
In the application of Australian Accounting Standards, management is required to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstance, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period
of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions that management has made in the process of applying the Group’s
accounting policies and that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial
statements are discussed below.
(a) Determination of mineral resources and ore reserves
The Group estimates its Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves in accordance with the Australasian Code of
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (“the JORC Code”). The information on
mineral resources and ore reserves is prepared by or under the supervision of Competent Persons as defined in
the JORC Code. The amounts presented are based on the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves determined
under the JORC Code.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral resources and ore reserves and assumptions
that are valid at the time of estimation which may change significantly when new information becomes available.
Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change
the economic status of reserves and may, ultimately, result in the reserves being restated. Such changes in
reserves could impact on depreciation and amortisation rates, asset carrying values, impairment assessments
and provisions for decommissioning and restoration.
(b) Estimation of the provision for rehabilitation and dismantling
Provision for rehabilitation and dismantling property, plant and equipment is estimated taking into consideration
facts and circumstances available at the balance sheet date. This estimate is based on the expenditure required
to undertake the rehabilitation and dismantling, taking into consideration time value of money. Factors that will
affect this liability include future disturbances caused by further development, changes in technology, changes in
regulations, price increases and change in the timing of cash flows. When these factors change or become
known in the future, such differences will impact the mine rehabilitation provision in the period in which they
change or become known.
(c) Recoverability of deferred tax
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses and deductible temporary differences to the extent
management considers that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to utilise those tax losses
and temporary differences.
81
Evolution Mining Limited
Annual Financial Report
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
9 Critical estimates, judgements and errors (continued)
(d) Impairment of non-current assets
The group undertakes an impairment review to determine whether any indicators of impairment are present.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the CGU is made. Each mine
is considered to be a separate CGU.
In 2013, the group recognised significant impairment losses in each CGU following the significant decline in the
gold price, and related market valuations and sentiment around gold equities. At 30 June 2016, there were no
indicators of potential impairment expense or previous impairment reversals, with the exception of the Pajingo
asset, refer to note 6(c) for details.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on the higher of the CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal
and value in use. These assessments require the use of estimates and assumptions such as reserves and
anticipated mine operating lives, discount rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, grade of ore mined, recovery
percentage, operating performance, costs and capital estimates. Given the impairment expense recognised in
2013, a significant negative change in these assumptions in isolation would likely result in an additional
impairment expense.
10 Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including interest rate risk and price
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability
of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.
The Group has used derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk
exposures.
Risk management is carried out at a corporate level under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Management identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating
units. The Board of Directors approves written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering
specific areas, such as interest rate risk, credit risk, gold price risk and use of derivative financial instruments and
non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
The Group holds the following financial instruments:
Financial Assets
Cash and cash equivalents
Trade and other receivables (excluding GST refundable)

(i) Classification of derivatives
Derivatives are classified as held for trading and accounted for at fair value through profit or loss unless they are
designated as hedges. They are presented as current assets or liabilities if they are expected to be settled within
12 months after the end of the reporting period.
The Group’s accounting policy for its cash flow hedges is set out in note 23(m). For hedged forecast transactions
that result in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the Group has elected to include related hedging gains and
losses in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset.
(ii) Fair value measurements
For information about the methods and assumptions used in determining the fair value of derivatives please refer
to note 5(f).
(b) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities
denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional. As at 30 June 2016, the Group held US$0.279
million (30 June 2015: US$0.172 million) in a US dollar currency bank account and outstanding receivables of
US$9.748 million (30 June 2015: US$1.858 million) relating to the Mt Carlton operation. The Group also held
NZ$0.060 million (30 June 2015: NZ$ nil) in a NZ dollar currency bank account.

Evolution Mining Limited
Annual Financial Report
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
10 Financial risk management (continued)
(b) Market risk
Management has set up a policy to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional currency. The risk
is measured using sensitivity analysis and cash flow forecasting. An increase/decrease in AUD:USD foreign
exchange rates of 5% will result in a $13,950 (30 June 2014: $8,600) increase/decrease in US dollar currency
bank account balances and a $487,400 (30 June 2015: $92,900) increase/decrease in US dollar receivables. An
increase/decrease in AUD:NZD foreign exchange rates of 5% will result in a $3,150 (30 June 2015: $ nil)
increase/decrease in NZ dollar currency bank account balances.
(ii) Price risk
The Group is currently exposed to the risk of fluctuations in prevailing market commodity prices on the gold and
silver currently produced from its gold mines and market share prices on the available-for-sale assets. The Group
has in place physical gold delivery contracts as at 30 June 2016 covering sales of 706,988oz (30 June 2015:
306,820oz) of gold at an average flat forward price of $1,623/oz (30 June 2015: $1,536/oz). An
increase/decrease in market share prices on available-for-sale assets of 10% will result in a $270,806 (30 June
2015: $651,603) increase/decrease in available-for-sale assets.
(iii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from variable interest rates on interest bearing liabilities. As at 30 June 2016,
the Group held interest bearing liabilities of $285 million (30 June 2015: $ nil) which incurs interest at a variable
rate. An increase/decrease of variable interest rates of 0.25% will result in a $1.854 million(30 June 2015: $ nil)
increase/decrease in interest expense relating to interest bearing liabilities.
(c) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and
investment securities. At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk given
customers and banks have investment grade credit ratings. The total trade and other receivables outstanding at
30 June 2016 was $19.262 million (30 June 2015: $5.776 million).
(d) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Prudent
liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and term deposits, the availability of funding through
an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. The Group
manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity
profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
(i) Financing arrangements
The Group had access to the following undrawn borrowing facilities at the end of the reporting period:
Bank loans - revolving credit facility
Expiring beyond one year

11 Capital management
(a) Risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern, so as to maintain a strong capital base sufficient to maintain future exploration and development of its
projects. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may return capital to shareholders, issue
new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. The Group’s focus has been to raise sufficient funds through equity and
debt capital markets to fund capital investment in working capital and exploration and evaluation activities.
The Group monitors its liquidity through analysis of regular cash flow forecasts.
(i) Loan covenants
The lenders have placed covenants over the revolving credit facility based on the current ratio, leverage ratio,
interest coverage ratio and the gearing ratio. The Group has complied with these covenants during the year.
(b) Dividends

The Board of Directors approved the implementation of a DRP as part of the Groups existing dividend policy. The
DRP allows shareholders to elect to reinvest all or part of any dividends payable on their Evolution shares to
acquire additional Evolution shares. The participation rate in the final dividend for the year ended 30 June 2015
was 18.8% of the Company's ordinary shares, with 2,492,008 shares issued at $1.0863 per share. The cash
payment amount for the final dividend for the year ended 30 June 2015 was $11.653 million. The participation
rate in the interim dividend for the half-year ended 31 December 2015 was 17.6% of the Company's ordinary
shares, with 1,525,313 shares issued at $1.6864 per share. The cash payment amount for the interim dividend
for the half-year ended 31 December 2015 was $12.181 million. As at 30 June 2016, the Group held an amount
for unclaimed dividends of $0.196 million. Total cash paid for dividends during the year was $23.834 million.
(ii) Dividends not recognised at the end of the reporting period
In June 2016, the Directors approved a change to the dividend policy of whenever possible paying a half-yearly
dividend equivalent to 4% of the Group's sales revenue. The change in policy doubled the payout ratio from the
previous level of 2% to 4% of revenue (relating to sales in the six month period to 30 June 2016). The change is
effective immediately and has been applied to the final dividend for 2016.

Corporation ("WBC"), Commonwealth Bank of Australia ("CBA"), Citibank N.A ("Citibank") and Societe Generale
("SG"). Contracts are settled on a quarterly basis by the physical delivery of gold per the banks instructions. The
contracts are accounted for as sale contracts with revenue recognised once the gold has been delivered to
Macquarie, ANZ, NAB, WBC, CBA, Citibank, SG or one of their agents. The physical gold delivery contracts are
considered a contract to sell a non-financial item and is therefore out of the scope of AASB 139 Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. As a result no derivatives are required to be recognised. The
Company has no other gold sale commitments with respect to its current operations.
The Company acquired a further 245,985oz of gold delivery contracts as part of the La Mancha acquisition, with
scheduled quarterly deliveries from September 2015 through to December 2017.

(i)
The Group entered into a Retention Agreement with the Executive Chairman during the year. Pursuant to this
agreement 3,750,000 Retention Rights will be issued on the terms and conditions of the Company's current Employee
Share Option and Performance Rights Plan, subject to shareholder approval at the Company's next shareholder
meeting. The Retention Rights will be issued for nil consideration and will only vest three years from the date of the
Agreement if the Executive Chairman is an employee of the Company at that time.
The Performance rights awarded during the 2013 financial year were tested as at 30 June 2015 and vested on 2
September 2015. 2,262,954 Performance Rights met the performance measures and vested whilst 923,228
Performance Rights did not meet the performance measures and lapsed. This equates to a vesting rate of
71.02% and a lapsing rate of 28.98%.
The Performance Rights awarded during the 2014 financial year were tested as at 30 June 2016. As at the date
of this report, all 7,961,146 Performance Rights eligible for testing have met the performance measures and have
been approved by the Board to vest. This equates to a vesting rate of 100%.
There were 10,804,370 Performance Rights granted during the 2015 financial year, with 9,739,812 outstanding
after accounting for forfeitures, which will be subject to performance testing as at 30 June 2017.
There were 8,141,268 Performance Rights granted during the 2016 financial year, with 7,978,853 outstanding
after accounting for forfeitures, which will be subject to performance testing as at 30 June 2018. Additionally,
there were 3,750,000 Retention Rights granted during the 2016 financial year to the Executive Chairman, subject
to shareholder approval, which will vest subject to the Executive Chairman being an employee of the Company at
16 December 2018.

During the period, the Company issued two allotments of performance rights that will vest on 30 June 2018. They
have four performance components being a Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) condition, an absolute TSR
condition, a Growth in Earnings per share (“EPS”) condition and a Growth in Ore Reserves condition.
(i) TSR Performance Right Valuation
The fair value of the TSR Performance Rights (market-based condition) was estimated at the date of grant using
Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.
(ii) Absolute TSR Performance Right Valuation
The Absolute TSR Performance Right Valuation will be measured as the cumulative annual TSR over the three
year period ending 30 June 2018.
(iii) Growth in Earnings per Share
The growth in Earnings per Share is measured as the cumulative annual growth rate in EPS, excluding non
recurring items over the three year period ending 30 June 2018.
(iv) Growth in Ore Reserves per Share
The growth in Ore Reserves per share is measured by comparing the Baseline measure of the ore reserves as at
31 December 2014, to the Ore Reserves as at 31 December 2017 on a per share basis, with testing to be
performed at 30 June 2018.

23 Summary of significant accounting policies
This note provides a list of all significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these Consolidated
Financial Statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise
stated. The financial statements are for the Group consisting of Evolution Mining Limited and its subsidiaries.
(a) Basis of preparation
These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting
Standards and interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Corporations Act
2001. Evolution Mining Limited is a for-profit entity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements.
The presentation or classification of certain comparatives has been amended to be consistent with current year
presentation.
(i) Compliance with IFRS
The consolidated financial statements of the Evolution Mining Limited Group also comply with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
(ii) Historical cost convention
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis, except for the following:
•
•
•
available-for-sale financial assets, financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) certain
classes of property, plant and equipment and mine development and exploration - measured at fair value
assets held for sale - measured at fair value less cost of disposal, and
retirement benefit obligations - plan assets measured at fair value.
(iii) New and amended standards adopted by the group
The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time in their annual reporting period
commencing 1 January 2014:
The adoption of AASB 2014-1 has resulted in additional disclosures required in our segment note. The adoption
of the other standards did not have any impact on the current period or any prior period and is not likely to affect
any future periods.
The Group has not elected to early adopt any standards.

Nature of change
Impact
Management is currently assessing the impact
of the new rules and has identified the following
areas that are likely to be affected:
Metal and concentrate sales where recognition
of revenue will depend on the passing of
control rather than the passing of risks and
rewards.
At this stage, the Group is not able to estimate
the impact of the new rules on the Group's
financial statement. The Group will make more
detailed assessments of the impact over the
next twelve months.
AASB 15
Revenue
from
Contracts
with
Customers
The AASB has issued a new
standard for the recognition of
revenue. This will replace AASB 118
which covers contracts for goods
and services and AASB 111 which
covers construction contracts.
The new standard is based on the
principle that revenue is recognised
when control of a good or service
transfers to the customer - so the
notion of control replaces the
existing notion of risks and rewards.
The standard permits a modified
retrospective approach for the
adoption. Under this approach
entities will recognise transitional
adjustments in retained earnings on
the date of initial application (eg. 1
July 2017), i.e. without restating the
comparative period. They will only
need to apply the new rules to
contracts that are not completed as
of the date of initial application.

Impact
AASB 9
Financial
Instruments
AASB 9 addresses the classification,
measurement and derecognition of
financial assets and financial
liabilities and introduces new rules
for hedge accounting.
Following the changes approved by the AASB
in December 2014, the Group no longer
expects any impact from the new classification,
measurement and derecognition rules on the
Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities.
In December 2014, the AASB made
further changes to the classification
and measurement rules and also
introduced a new impairment model.
These latest amendments now
complete the new financial
instruments standard.
While the Group has yet to undertake a
detailed assessment of the debt instruments
currently classified as available-for-sale
financial assets, it would appear that they
would satisfy the conditions for classification as
at fair value through other comprehensive
income (FVOCI) and hence there will be no
change to the accounting for these assets.
There will also be no impact on the Group’s
accounting for financial liabilities, as the new
requirements only affect the accounting for
financial liabilities that are designated at fair
value through profit or loss and the Group does
not have any such liabilities.
The new hedging rules align hedge accounting
more closely with the Group’s risk management
practices. As a general rule it will be easier to
apply hedge accounting going forward as the
standard introduces a more principles-based
approach. The new standard also introduces
expanded disclosure requirements and
changes in presentation.
The new impairment model is an expected
credit loss (ECL) model which may result in the
earlier recognition of credit losses.
The Group has not yet assessed how its own
hedging arrangements and impairment
provisions would be affected by the new rules.

Evolution Mining Limited
Annual Financial Report
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
23 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(b) Principles of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls
an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and
has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date
that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are
eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of
the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated
income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and balance sheet
respectively.
(c) Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision maker.
The board of Evolution Mining Limited has appointed a strategic steering committee which assesses the financial
performance and position of the Group, and makes strategic decisions. The steering committee, which has been
identified as being the chief operating decision maker, consists of the Executive Chairman and the Senior
Leadership Team.
(d) Foreign currency translation
(i) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The consolidated financial
statements are presented in Australian dollars ($), which is Evolution Mining Limited's functional and presentation
currency.
(ii) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at
the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such
transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, except when they are deferred in equity as qualifying cash
flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign
operation.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings are presented in the consolidated income
statement, within finance costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the consolidated
income statement on a net basis within other income or other expenses.
111
Evolution Mining Limited
Annual Financial Report
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
23 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(d) Foreign currency translation
Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates
at the date when the fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair
value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. For example, translation differences on non-monetary
assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss as
part of the fair value gain or loss and translation differences on non-monetary assets such as equities classified
as available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income.
(e) Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Amounts disclosed as revenue
are net of returns, trade allowances, rebates and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future
economic benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria have been met for each of the Group's activities as
described below. The Group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of
customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.
The specific accounting policies for the group’s main types of revenue are explained in note 2. Revenue for other
business activities is recognised on the following basis:
(i)
Interest income
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Group
reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the
original effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest
income on impaired loans is recognised using the original effective interest rate.
(f)
Income tax
The income tax expense or revenue for the period is the tax payable on the current period's taxable income
based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and
liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the
end of the reporting period in the countries where the Company's subsidiaries and associates operate and
generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to
situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However,
deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax
is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by
the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised
or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
The deferred tax liabilities in relation to investment property that is measured at fair value is determined assuming
the property will be recovered entirely through sale.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise
those temporary differences and losses.
112
Evolution Mining Limited
Annual Financial Report
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
23 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(f)
Income tax
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and
tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the company is able to control the timing of the reversal of
the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and
tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a
net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Evolution Mining Limited and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax
consolidation legislation. As a consequence, these entities are taxed as a single entity and the deferred tax
assets and liabilities of these entities are set off in the consolidated financial statements.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in
other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive
income or directly in equity, respectively.
(g) Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease's inception at the fair
value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding
rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other short-term and long-term payables. Each lease
payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the
lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each
period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the asset's useful
life or over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the
Group will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term.
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group as
lessee are classified as operating leases (note 15). Payments made under operating leases (net of any
incentives received from the lessor) are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the
lease.
(h) Impairment of assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and other intangible assets to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash in-flows that are independent from other
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates
of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount of the asset (CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or
loss immediately.

Annual Financial Report
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
23 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(h) Impairment of assets
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses for assets other than goodwill, the carrying amount of the asset
(CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss
been recognised for the asset (CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in profit or
loss immediately.
(i) Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on
hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to
an insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts.
(j) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. See note 5(b) for further information about the group’s
accounting for trade receivables and note 10(c) for a description of the Group's impairment policies.
(k)
Inventories
Gold in solution form, gold dore, refined gold bullion, stockpiled ore, concentrates and work in progress are
physically measured or estimated and valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost represents the
weighted average cost and includes direct costs and an appropriate portion of fixed and variable production
overhead expenditure, including depreciation and amortisation, incurred in converting materials into finished
goods.
Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Any provision for obsolescence is
determined by reference to specific stock items identified. A regular and ongoing review is undertaken to
establish the extent of surplus items and a provision is made for any potential loss on their disposal.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of
completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
(l)
Investments and other financial assets
(i) Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories:
•
•
•
•
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss,
loans and receivables,
held-to-maturity investments, and
available-for-sale financial assets.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired. Management determines the
classification of its investments at initial recognition and, in the case of assets classified as held-to-maturity,
re-evaluates this designation at the end of each reporting period. The Group may choose to reclassify the
financial assets depending on change in intentions and circumstances.
114
Evolution Mining Limited
Annual Financial Report
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
23 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(l)
Investments and other financial assets
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is
classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are
classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as
current assets if they are expected to be settled within 12 months; otherwise they are classified as non-current.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12
months after the reporting period which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included
in trade and other receivables and receivables in the balance sheet.
Held-to-maturity investments
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed
maturities that the Group's management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. If the Group
were to sell other than an insignificant amount of held-to-maturity financial assets, the whole category would be
tainted and reclassified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity financial assets are included in non-current assets,
except for those with maturities less than 12 months from the end of the reporting period, which are classified as
current assets.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets, comprising principally marketable equity securities, are non-derivatives that
are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They are included in
non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of the investment within 12
months of the end of the reporting period. Investments are designated as available-for-sale if they do not have
fixed maturities and fixed or determinable payments and management intends to hold them for the medium to
long-term.
(ii) Recognition and derecognition
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, which is the date on which the
Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction
costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value
through profit or loss is initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed to profit or loss.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or
have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in
other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss as gains and losses from investment securities.
(iii) Measurement
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset
not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the
financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in
profit or loss.
Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.
115
Evolution Mining Limited
Annual Financial Report
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
23 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(l)
Investments and other financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried
at fair value. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the 'financial assets at fair value through
profit or loss' category are presented in profit or loss within other income or other expenses in the period in which
they arise. Changes in the fair value of securities classified as Available-for-sale are recognised in the other
comprehensive income. Dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in
profit or loss as part of revenue from continuing operations when the Group's right to receive payments is
established. Interest income from these financial assets is included in the net gains/(losses).
Details on how the fair value of financial instruments is determined are disclosed in note 5(f).
(iv) Impairment
The Group assesses at each balance date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of
financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or
prolonged decline in the fair value of a security below its cost is considered as an indicator that the securities are
impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss - measured as
the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial
asset previously recognised in profit or loss - is removed from equity and recognised in profit or loss. Impairment
losses recognised in profit or loss on equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not reversed through
the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
(m) Derivatives and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for subsequent
changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the
nature of the item being hedged. The Group currently only designates derivatives as cash flow hedges (hedges
of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised assets and liabilities and highly probable forecast
transactions). There are no fair value hedges or net investment hedges, nor are there any derivatives that do not
classify for hedge accounting.
The Group documents at the inception of the hedging transaction the relationship between hedging instruments
and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of
whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and will continue to be highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 5(f).
Movements in the hedging reserve in shareholder's equity are shown in note 7(b). The full fair value of a hedging
derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more
than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is
less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability.
(i) Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow
hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves in equity. The gain or loss
relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss within other income or other
expenses.
116
Evolution Mining Limited
Annual Financial Report
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
23 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(m) Derivatives and hedging activities
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit
or loss (for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating to the effective
portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in profit or loss within 'finance
costs'.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for
hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately reclassified to profit or
loss. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for
example, fixed assets) the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included
in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit or
loss as depreciation in the case of fixed assets.
(n) Mine development and exploration
(i) Mine development
In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste materials to access ore from
which minerals can be extracted economically. The process of mining overburden and waste materials is referred
to as stripping. During the development of a mine (or pit), before production commences, stripping costs are
capitalised as mine development.
During the production stage of some pits, further development of the pit may require a phase of unusually high
overburden removal activity that is similar in nature to pre-production pit development. This typically occurs when
‘cut-backs’ are made to gain access to a specific section of the ore body. The costs of such unusually high
overburden removal activity are also capitalised as mine development.
Mine development costs are amortised on a units of production basis over the life of the pit to which they relate.
In applying the units of production method, amortisation is calculated using the expected total contained ounces
within the pit to achieve a consistent amortisation rate per ounce. To achieve this, the amortisation rate is based
on the ratio of total pit development costs (incurred and anticipated) over the expected total contained ounces.
(ii) Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Exploration and evaluation activity involves the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical
feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource. Exploration and evaluation activity
includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
researching and analysing historical exploration data;
gathering exploration data through topographical, geochemical and geophysical studies;
exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling;
determining and examining the volume and grade of the resource;
surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements; and
conducting market and finance studies.
Early stage exploration expenditure on new areas of interest are expensed as incurred. Exploration and
evaluation expenditure is capitalised in relation to areas of interest in or around producing mines or where
management believes the costs are recoverable.
Exploration expenditure for each area of interest is carried forward as an asset provided the rights to tenure of
the area of interest are current and one of the following conditions is met:
117
Evolution Mining Limited
Annual Financial Report
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
23 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(n) Mine development and exploration
•
•
the exploration and evaluation expenditures are expected to be recouped through successful development
and exploitation of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale; and
exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not at the reporting date reached a stage
which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable
reserves, and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing.
An impairment review is performed, either individually or at the CGU level, when there are indicators that the
carrying amount of the assets may exceed their recoverable amounts. To the extent that this occurs, the excess
is fully provided against, in the financial year in which this is determined. Exploration and evaluation assets are
reassessed on a regular basis and these costs are carried forward provided that at least one of the conditions
outlined above is met.
Administration costs that are not directly attributable to a specific exploration area are charged to the Statement
of Comprehensive Income. Expenditure is transferred to mine development assets once the work completed to
date supports the future development of the property and such development receives appropriate approvals.
(o) Property, plant and equipment
Land is carried at historical cost. All other plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation.
Historical cost equals the fair value of the item at acquisition date and includes expenditure that is directly
attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost
of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset
is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the
reporting period in which they are incurred.
The depreciation methods and periods used by the group are disclosed in note 6(d).
The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each
reporting period.
An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount
is greater than its estimated recoverable amount (note 23(h)). These are included in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income.
(p) Intangible assets
(i) Mining tenements, mining rights and mining information
Mining tenements have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less, where applicable, any accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The carrying values of mining tenements and mining rights are
reviewed to ensure they are not in excess of their recoverable amounts. Amortisation of mining tenements and
mining rights commences from the date when commercial production commences or in the case of the
acquisitions, from the date of acquisition and is charged to the profit or loss. Mining tenements are amortised
over the life of the mine using units of production basis in ounces.
Mining information has a finite useful life and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Mining information
amortisation is recognised over the period that the information is expected to remain relevant.
The amortisation of the above intangibles is classified as a cost of sale.
118
Evolution Mining Limited
Annual Financial Report
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
23 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(q) Trade and other payables
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial year
which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are paid on normal commercial terms.
(r) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction and establishment costs incurred. Borrowings
are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs)
and the redemption amount is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective
interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan
to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred
until the draw down occurs.
Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged,
cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been
extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets
transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss as other income or finance costs.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of
the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.
(s) Borrowing costs
General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of
a qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for
its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get
ready for their intended use or sale.
(t) Site restoration
Site restoration costs include the dismantling and removal of mining plant, equipment and building structures,
waste removal and rehabilitation of the site in accordance with the requirements of the mining permits. Such
costs are determined using estimates of future costs, current legal requirements and technology.
Costs of site restoration are recognised in full at present value as a non-current liability. An equivalent amount is
capitalised as part of the cost of the asset when an obligation arises to decommission or restore a site to a
certain condition after abandonment as a result of bringing the assets to its present location. The capitalised cost
is amortised over the life of the project and the provision is accreted periodically as the discounting of the liability
unwinds. The unwinding of the discount is recorded as a finance cost.
Any changes in the estimates for the costs or other assumptions against the cost of relevant assets are
accounted for on a prospective basis. In determining the costs of site restoration there is uncertainty regarding
the nature and extent of the restoration due to community expectations and future legislation.
(u) Royalties
Western Australian State government royalties and other royalties payable under existing agreements are
payable on production and are therefore recognised on delivery of gold dore to the refinery. New South Wales
and Queensland State government royalties are payable on a revenue basis and therefore recognised at the time
of revenue recognition.
119
Evolution Mining Limited
Annual Financial Report
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
23 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(v) Employee benefits
(i) Wages and salaries, annual leave and other employee benefits
Provision is made for employee benefits accumulated as a result of employees rendering services up to the
reporting date. These benefits include wages and salaries, annual leave, and long service leave.
Liabilities arising in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave and any other short-term employee benefits are
measured at their nominal amounts based on remuneration rates which are expected to be paid when the liability
is settled. All other employee benefit liabilities are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash
outflow to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. In determining the
present value of future cash outflows, the market yield as at the reporting date on national government bonds,
which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related liability, are used.
(ii) Share-based payments
The Group provides benefits to its employees (including Key Management Personnel) in the form of share-based
payments, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled
transactions). The Group provides awards to its employees and Directors through the Company’s Employee
Share Option and Performance Rights Plan. Shares and options may also be issued directly to other parties.
Vesting conditions that are linked to the price of shares of the Company (market conditions) are taken into
account when determining the fair value of equity settled transactions. Other vesting conditions such as service
conditions are excluded from the measurement of fair value but are considered in estimating the number of
investments that may ultimately vest.
The cost of these equity-settled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments
at the date at which they are granted. A Monte Carlo simulation in conjunction with the Black Scholes model is
applied to take into account any market conditions associated with an award and determine its fair value at grant
date.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the
period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled (“the vesting period”).
At each subsequent reporting date until vesting, the cumulative charge to the statement of comprehensive
income is the product of:
•
•
•
The grant date fair value of the award;
The current best estimate of the number of awards that will vest, taking into account such factors as the
likelihood of employee turnover during the vesting period and the likelihood of non-market performance
conditions being met; and
The expired portion of the vesting period.
The charge to the statement of comprehensive income for the period is the cumulative amount as calculated
above less the amounts already recognised in previous periods. There is a corresponding entry to equity.
Until an award has vested, any amounts recorded are contingent and will be adjusted if more or fewer awards
vest than were originally anticipated to do so. Any award subject to a market condition or non-vesting condition is
considered to vest irrespective of whether or not that market condition or non-vesting is fulfilled, provided that all
other conditions are satisfied.
120
Evolution Mining Limited
Annual Financial Report
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
23 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(v) Employee benefits
If a non-vesting condition is within the control of the Company or the participant, the failure to satisfy the condition
is treated as a cancellation. If a non-vesting condition within the control of neither the Group, Company nor
employee is not satisfied during the vesting period, any expense for the award not previously recognised is
recognised over the remaining vesting period, unless the award is forfeited.
If the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had
not been modified. An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of
the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee, as measured at the date of
modification. If an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation,
and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is
substituted for the cancelled award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the
cancelled and new award are treated as if they were a modification of the original award.
The dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of
diluted earnings per share.
(w) Contributed equity
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares,
options or performance rights are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
(x) Earnings per share
(i) Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing:
•
•
the profit attributable to owners of the Company, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than
ordinary shares
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for
bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the year and excluding treasury shares.
(ii) Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into
account:
•
•
the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary
shares, and
the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming
the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
(y) Goods and Services Tax (GST)
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred
is not recoverable from the taxation authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the
asset or as part of the expense.
Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of
GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the
balance sheet.
121

23 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(y) Goods and Services Tax (GST)
Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or
financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the taxation authority, are presented as operating
cash flows.
(z) Rounding of amounts
The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors Reports) Instrument
2016/191, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, relating to the 'rounding off' of
amounts in the financial statements. Amounts in the financial statements have been rounded off in accordance
with that ASIC Corporations Instrument to the nearest thousand dollars, or in certain cases, the nearest dollar.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Evolution
Mining Limited
Report on the ﬁnancial report
We have audited the accompanying ﬁnancial report of Evolution Mining Limited (the company],
which comprises the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of
proﬁt or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and
consolidated statement of cash ﬂows for the year ended on that date, a summary of signiﬁcant
accounting policies, other explanatory notes and the directors' declaration for Evolution Mining
Limited (the consolidated entity). The consolidated entity comprises the company and the entities it
controlled at years end or from time to time during the ﬁnancial year.
Directors‘ responsibility for the ﬁnancial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial report that gives a
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001
and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enablc the preparation of the
ﬁnancial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In Note 23, the
directors also state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial
Statements, that the ﬁnancial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the ﬁnancial report based on our audit. We conducted
our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply
with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance whether the ﬁnancial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the ﬁnancial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial report, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the consolidated
entity‘ s preparation and fair presentation of the ﬁnancial report in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion
Independence
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requircments of the Corporations
Act 2001.
