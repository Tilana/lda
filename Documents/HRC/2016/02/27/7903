<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifteenth session from 
21 January to 1 February 2013. The review of Botswana was held at the 5th meeting on 23 
January 2013. The delegation of Botswana was headed by Dikgakgamatso Ramadeluka 
Seretse. At its 10th meeting, held on 25 January 2013, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Botswana. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Botswana: Austria, Poland and Uganda. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Botswana: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/15/BWA/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/BWA/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/BWA/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to Botswana through the troika. These questions are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation stated that it was happy to see that the UPR had retained its form, 
following the review of the work and functioning of the Human Rights Council. The 
successful completion of the first cycle of the UPR epitomized the achievement of the 
Human Rights Council in discharging its mandate. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation stated that the value of the UPR depended on the acceptance by 
Member States that the promotion and protection of human rights could no longer be a side 
issue in the global discourse of human development. 
</p>
<p>7. In introducing the national report, the delegation emphasized that the report was a 
product of broad consultations involving Government, civil society and non-governmental 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation stated that Botswana continued to live up to its obligations as a 
democracy, particularly as it observed the rule of law, fundamental freedoms and good 
governance characterized by consultations and inclusiveness, as well as due regard for the 
will of its people. 
</p>
<p>9. In addition, the delegation stated that the Government placed a high premium on 
providing resources for the institutions that dealt with the promotion and protection of 
human rights, including the Office of the Ombudsman, the Directorate of Public </p>


<p>Prosecutions, the Police Service, the Prisons Service, and the Directorate on Corruption and 
Economic Crime. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation stated that, in order to protect and safeguard the interests of the 
people from possible police misconduct, such as torture, corruption and other forms of 
malpractice, a motion had been adopted in 2011 towards the creation of the Independent 
Police Complaints Commission. 
</p>
<p>11. Furthermore, in 2009, a woman had been elected head of the legislature. That 
election was in addition to key appointments of women to positions of leadership, which 
included that of the Governor of the Central Bank of Botswana, the Attorney General and 
the Ombudsman. In the public service sector, female leadership stood at over 40 per cent. 
</p>
<p>12. With regard to access to justice, the delegation stated that more specialized courts 
had been established. The initiative had been further augmented by the extension of the 
Judicial Case Management System from the High Court to lower courts with a view to 
improving case management and facilitating speedy resolution. In addition, the 
Government introduced a pilot project on legal aid in 2011, to promote greater access to 
justice for needy citizens. 
</p>
<p>13. The delegation stated that the Government continued to pay particular attention to 
the rights of women, children and youth. Public education on HIV/AIDS, gender-based 
violence and gender-sensitization initiatives had been adopted. 
</p>
<p>14. In 2009, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) had been domesticated 
through the enactment of the new Children&#8217;s Act, incorporating the Bill of Child Rights. 
</p>
<p>15. A comprehensive six-year (2010-2016) National Action Plan for Orphans and 
Vulnerable Children had been adopted to facilitate the welfare and protection of vulnerable 
children. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation stated that the Government had made those strides despite its small 
and vulnerable economy. 
</p>
<p>17. The delegation underscored the country&#8217;s need for assistance and support. Most 
urgently, Botswana required support for the development of a comprehensive strategy and 
plan of action on human rights, and was willing to engage with local and international 
partners in that regard. 
</p>
<p>18. The delegation stated that the Government had not made any changes to the 
clemency procedure since 2008, since the procedure was considered sufficiently transparent 
so as not to warrant any review. 
</p>
<p>19. The delegation indicated that there was no legislation specifically addressing marital 
rape. That was a sensitive matter that hinged on established cultural beliefs. Wide 
consultations with the public and legislators were ongoing. 
</p>
<p>20. Furthermore, the delegation stated that the Government had put in place a 
comprehensive public education and awareness programme to disseminate information on 
the Domestic Violence Act. The Government was at an advanced stage of developing 
regulations to the Domestic Violence Act to improve implementation. 
</p>
<p>21. The delegation reported that a number of initiatives were also being developed, 
including the establishment of the Gender-Based Violence Referral System, which was 
aimed primarily at promoting closer collaboration among key service providers for 
survivors and perpetrators. The Government was currently validating the 2012 Gender-
Based Violence Indicators Study, which was due for completion in September 2013. 
</p>
<p>22. The delegation indicated that the National Gender Machinery continued to work 
with the Botswana Police Service to train police officers on gender-based violence issues. </p>


<p>Also, the Government had continued to support civil society organizations that provided 
services to women and children who were victims of gender-based violence. That support 
included funding specific activities. 
</p>
<p>23. The delegation stated that an interministerial initiative was in place to address 
gender-based violence from a criminal justice perspective, to augment all other existing 
initiatives and programmes. 
</p>
<p>24. The delegation stated that the Government had not taken any additional measures, 
subsequent to the 2010 Employment Act amendment, regarding the issue of sexual 
orientation. However, the delegation clarified that the Penal Code still proscribed unnatural 
acts involving persons who have carnal knowledge of others against the order of nature. 
</p>
<p>25. The delegation stated that the Government continued to engage the Basarwa through 
established structures, with a view to ensuring a sustainable solution to the Central 
Kgalagadi Game Reserve (CKGR) matter. Several programmes were being implemented, 
including poverty eradication, affirmative action, education for all, community-based 
natural resource management planning, and effective utilization of wildlife management 
areas. 
</p>
<p>26. The delegation stated that the Government was working with the coalition of non-
governmental organizations that was producing a community-based land use management 
plan for within the CKGR, intended to address government policies for the conservation of 
the CKGR biodiversity and wildlife resources. 
</p>
<p>27. Regarding measures to speed up responses by government departments to the 
requests of the Office of the Ombudsman, the delegation stated that all departments had 
been urged to respond promptly to enquiries by the Office. Non-compliance may affect the 
grading of a given ministry or department during periodic ministerial reviews and could 
result in severe consequences. 
</p>
<p>28. Regarding steps taken to ensure equal access for women to education and justice, the 
delegation stated that there were no institutionalized impediments to education for women. 
</p>
<p>29. On access to justice, the delegation stated that all persons within the territory of 
Botswana had access to national courts of civil and criminal jurisdiction. The Abolition of 
the Marital Power Act of 2005 changed the initial position prohibiting women from 
bringing an action in the courts without their husband&#8217;s assistance. In addition, the Rules of 
</p>
<p>the High Court recognized women&#8217;s unlimited access to the High Court and that a spouse 
could sue and be sued without the assistance of the other. 
</p>
<p>30. The delegation stated that the Government continued to comply with international 
standards in the treatment of prisoners. Regarding overcrowding in prisons, the 
Government had embarked on a study, with the assistance of the Commonwealth 
Secretariat, to develop alternatives to imprisonment. That was in addition to a number of 
measures already being implemented, such as remission and extramural provisions already 
contained in the legislation. 
</p>
<p>31. Regarding the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on the rights of 
indigenous peoples, the delegation stated that the Government did not recognize any 
specific group as more indigenous than others. All groups were considered to be indigenous 
to the land. However, the delegation indicated that Botswana recognized that not all groups 
were at the same level of development. The Government introduced preferential strategies 
to absorb such communities into the mainstream of the country&#8217;s economy, including 
</p>
<p>through employment and education. The Government was also actively pursuing 
affirmative action measures for remote area communities in order to promote social 
inclusion and equal opportunities for meaningful participation in the development process. </p>


<p>In that regard, special dispensation was given for the employment of members of those 
communities in the police and defence forces, and in the civil service in general. 
</p>
<p>32. The delegation stated that the Economic Diversification Drive Policy, adopted in 
2010, was aimed at improving livelihoods and food security at the household level, 
especially in rural and remote areas. Additionally, the Livestock Management and 
Infrastructure Development Programme was specifically designed to improve the economic 
status of Botswana in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>33. In education, the delegation stated that a number of policies and strategies had been 
put in place to ensure that women and the girl child were not discriminated against. 
Students who fell pregnant were no longer required to discontinue their education. 
</p>
<p>34. Regarding empowerment of persons with disabilities, the delegation stated that the 
Coordinating Office for People with Disabilities had been established in 2010. The Office 
designated coordinating structures in all government ministries and departments at national 
and district levels to address issues relevant to persons with disabilities. The Office also 
undertook a continuing review of the laws, with the objective of adequately providing for 
persons with disabilities. It also undertook to develop a strategy to address issues of 
disability. 
</p>
<p>35. The delegation noted that there were several obstacles, such as a lack of resources to 
modify the environment to accommodate people with disabilities, a lack of skilled 
personnel, and a lack of appropriate training facilities for students with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>36. Regarding measures to discourage practices that were detrimental to women&#8217;s rights, 
the delegation stated that measures such as public awareness and educational campaigns 
and legislative reform, particularly in relation to the equal right to inheritance by women 
and men, had been adopted. The Government also took a decision to cascade the campaign 
to traditional leaders (Dikgosi), with a view to eliminating negative traditional and cultural 
practices. 
</p>
<p>37. Regarding a safer environment in prisons and reduction of health risks, the 
delegation stated that the Government had introduced human rights education in the 
training curriculum for prison staff. Furthermore, training was provided by health education 
officers in District Health Management Teams to ensure continuous health education, 
including on HIV/AIDS, to the prison population. Health education officers also provided 
education on other public health interventions, including hygiene. Those measures were 
designed to ensure a safer environment in prisons and reduction of health risks. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>38. During the interactive dialogue, 69 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>39. Thailand commended Botswana for the human rights education in schools and 
equality of access to education for HIV/AIDS orphans, and noted efforts to promote gender 
equality. It noted the country&#8217;s efforts to discourage practices, deeply rooted in customary 
laws, that were detrimental to women&#8217;s rights. However, the challenges of patriarchal 
attitudes and stereotypes vis-&#224;-vis women remained perceptible in society. Thailand made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Timor-Leste commended the accession by Botswana to human rights treaties, and 
noted specific strategies to protect and promote the rights of women, children and youth. 
However, it was concerned at reports of corporal punishment at home and in schools. 
Timor-Leste made recommendations.<b> </b></p>


<p>41. Togo noted the opening of special courts, which had improved access to justice and 
case processing and had eased delays. The measures taken by Botswana to improve living 
conditions for women, children and young people were welcomed. Togo made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Tunisia took note of the improved access to justice and protection for the rights of

<p>45. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland took note of the positive 
progress with regard to children&#8217;s rights, prison conditions and HIV/AIDS awareness. It 
expressed disappointment with the criminalization of homosexuality. Also, the application 
of the death penalty and a lack of transparency over final decisions for executions were 
regrettable. Progress in negotiations between the Government and the San residents of the 
CKGR was a matter of urgency. Closer attention should be given to women&#8217;s rights. The 
United Kingdom made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. The United States of America applauded the High Court&#8217;s decision to overturn

United States made recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>47. Uruguay noted the progress in the fields of youth development, children&#8217;s rights and 
human rights education. A public debate on the death penalty, with a view to abolishment, 
would be useful. Women&#8217;s rights in marriage and customary law raised concerns, as did the 
arrangements for children&#8217;s courts. Uruguay made recommendations.

</p>
<p>50. Algeria noted progress in the promotion of women&#8217;s rights, particularly the election 
of a female speaker to Parliament, and improved access to justice. It also noted the 
ratification of international and regional instruments, the launch of youth development 
programmes and the revision of national health policy. Algeria made recommendations. </p>


<p>51. Angola noted legislation and strategies aimed at children and youth, the National

made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>63. The Congo noted the adoption of new legislation on childhood, including a charter

</p>
<p>64. Costa Rica emphasized achievements in the field of women&#8217;s rights and in women&#8217;s

Costa Rica made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire welcomed the establishment of the Coordinating Office for People

</p>
<p>66. Cuba stated that the efforts of Botswana in respecting human rights and in particular

</p>
<p>79. Indonesia welcomed the introduction of the National Strategy for Poverty

of CRC into new legislation and establishing relevant bodies and plans. Indonesia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80. Ireland expressed concern about continuing issues relating to equal rights for 
minority tribes, and encouraged Botswana to ensure that relevant court judgements were 
implemented. It welcomed efforts to raise awareness of women&#8217;s rights and mainstream 
</p>
<p>gender issues, but was concerned at reports that three fifths of women were victims of 
gender-based violence. Ireland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>81. Italy welcomed endeavours to eradicate poverty and protect freedom of religion. It

</p>

</p>

towards achieving economic recovery and the eradication of poverty. Kuwait made

</p>
<p>84. Latvia noted with appreciation that Botswana had shown openness in its cooperation 
with special procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights Council. Latvia made a

</p>
<p>85. Liechtenstein expressed concerned that the Children&#8217;s Act failed to prohibit corporal

marriage and the family and the lack of focus on women in poverty reduction strategies. 
Liechtenstein made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>86. Malaysia noted with appreciation the significant strides and continued efforts in 
upholding the rights of children, women, minorities, persons with disabilities and </p>


<p>disadvantaged groups, but further noted that Botswana continued to face serious challenges, 
particularly relating to refugees and education. Malaysia made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>87. Mauritania welcomed efforts to guarantee access to justice and the rights of children,

promotion of cultural diversity and the establishment of an independent national institution 
in accordance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>88. Mexico encouraged the Supreme Court of Botswana to continue reviewing 
customary practices that discriminated against women. It noted that, in response to the 
recommendation by Mexico, Botswana had adopted a preferential strategy on indigenous 
peoples and had received a visit from the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous 
peoples in 2009. Mexico made recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>89. Morocco commended the commitment of Botswana to human rights principles and 
respect for the rights of children, women and persons with disabilities. It also commended 
efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, including making special provision for migrants, refugees, 
and HIV-positive mothers and their infected children, and raising awareness among 
prisoners. Morocco made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>90. In response to the questions raised from the floor, the delegation stated that the 
Constitution was the supreme law of the land. Cultural practices that were deemed to be 
inconsistent with the Constitution would not prevail, if challenged. 
</p>
<p>91. Furthermore, the delegation stated that, as a predominantly Christian nation, 
Botswana had not reached a stage where it could accept same-sex activities. It would be 
necessary to engage in educational campaigns on this issue so that when the laws were 
changed, the people would be carried along. 
</p>
<p>92. Regarding cultural sensitivities that had a bearing on existing legislation, the 
delegation confirmed the commitment of Botswana to comply with its treaty obligations. In 
that regard, the Government was determined to undertake educational awareness campaigns 
with a view to raising these issues, including sexual orientation, corporal punishment and 
the death penalty. Thus far, public consultations had confirmed that Botswana still 
supported the retention of corporal punishment, the death penalty and the criminalization of 
same-sex activities. 
</p>
<p>93. The delegation also stated that wildlife management areas outside the CKGR had 
been established with a view to preserving the ecosystem and promoting sustainable

made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>99. Norway welcomed the focus on indigenous groups, women and the judicial system

women from enjoying as much protection as men. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>

obligations. There were gaps to fill, however, such as the failure of the new Children&#8217;s Act 
</p>
<p>to prohibit corporal punishment in any setting and the lack of authority, capacity and 
resources allocated to the Women&#8217;s Affairs Department. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>109. South Africa noted that Botswana remained committed to fulfilling its international 
human rights obligations, notwithstanding the obstacles and constraints present. It called on

assistance it had requested. South Africa made recommendations.

recommendations. 
</p>
<p>112. Lesotho stated that the ratification of almost all the core human rights treaties was a 
testament to the commitment of Botswana to enhancing human rights. Moreover, Botswana

recommendation. 
</p>
<p>113. Bangladesh was impressed by government efforts to promote and protect human
