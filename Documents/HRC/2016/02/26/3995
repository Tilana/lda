</p>
<p>promote the empowerment of women and the realization of their human rights through the 
creation of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women 
and through the Secretary-General&#8217;s campaign &#8220;UNiTE to End Violence against Women&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the adoption of regional instruments relating to the human rights of 
women and specifically on violence against women, including the Inter-American 
Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women, 
the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women 
in Africa, the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against 
women and domestic violence, the Southern African Development Community Protocol on 
Gender and Development and the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against 
Women in the ASEAN Region, which strengthen the implementation of international 
commitments relating to the human rights of women, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> <i>also </i>that violence against women and girls persists in every country in 
the world as a pervasive violation of the enjoyment of human rights and a major 
impediment to achieving gender equality, development, peace and security and 
internationally agreed development goals, in particular the Millennium Development Goals,  
</p>
<p><i> Underscoring</i> that States have the obligation to promote and protect all human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, 
</p>
<p><i> Underscoring</i> <i>also</i> that the duty of States to exercise due diligence to provide 
protection to women and girls who have been subjected to or are at risk of violence 
includes using all appropriate means of a legal, political, administrative and social nature to 
provide access to justice, health care and support services that respond to their immediate 
needs, protect against further harm and continue to address the ongoing consequences of 
violence for women and girls, taking into consideration the impact of violence on their 
families and communities, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the inclusion of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence in the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, as well as the recognition by the ad hoc 
international criminal tribunals that rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute a 
war crime, a crime against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide or 
torture, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the importance of the full and equal participation of women and the 
involvement of civil society groups, in particular women&#8217;s organizations and networks, in 
the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies, measures and 
programmes relating to the protection of women facing violence as well as the protection 
and promotion of the human rights of women, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> that multiple, intersecting and aggravated forms of discrimination against 
women and girls increase their vulnerability and undermine their ability to protect 
themselves from violence, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Strongly condemns </i>all acts of violence against women and girls, where these 
acts are perpetrated by the State, private persons or non-State actors, and calls for the 
elimination of all forms of gender-based violence in the family, within the general 
community and where perpetrated or condoned by the State, in accordance with the 
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, and stresses the need to treat 
all forms of violence against women and girls as a criminal offence, punishable by law, and 
the duty to provide victims with access to just and effective remedies and specialized 
assistance, including medical and psychological assistance, as well as effective counselling; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Stresses</i> that States have the obligation to promote and protect all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to 
prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of violence against women and </p>


<p>girls and provide protection and support to women and girls who have been subjected to 
violence, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of their 
human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Recognizes</i> that effective protection requires comprehensive, integrated, 
coordinated multisectoral approaches involving multiple stakeholders, including women&#8217;s 
organizations, religious and community leaders, youth, men and boys, victim service 
workers and advocates, law enforcement personnel, the judiciary, corrections officials and 
forensic scientists, as well as legal, health and education professionals, and that such 
responses should avoid re-victimization, be empowering to the victim, be evidence-based 
and culturally sensitive, and integrate the specific and differentiated needs of women and 
girls who face multiple, intersecting and aggravated forms of discrimination; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Emphasizes</i> that women should be empowered to protect themselves against 
violence and, in this regard, stresses the need for legal and policy measures that promote the 
full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights by eliminating discrimination 
against women, promoting gender equality, empowering women and promoting their full 
autonomy, including with regard to land, property, marriage and divorce, child custody and 
inheritance, and to promote equal access to literacy, education, skills training and 
employment opportunities, political participation and representation, credit, agricultural 
extension, adequate housing, just and favourable conditions of work, and business and 
leadership skills training; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Underscores</i> that States have the primary responsibility for protecting women 
and girls facing violence and, in this regard, urges States: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To enact and, where necessary, reinforce or amend domestic legislation and 
other measures to enhance the protection of victims, including, where appropriate, by 
providing for the use of testimonial aids in criminal proceedings to avoid re-victimization 
and access to legal representation, and to ensure that such legislation or measures conform 
with relevant international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To take measures to investigate, prosecute, punish and redress, including by 
ensuring access to adequate, effective, prompt and appropriate remedies, the wrongs done 
to women and girls subjected to any form of violence, whether in the home, the workplace, 
the community or society, in custody, or in situations of armed conflict;  
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To implement their treaty obligations addressing the human rights of all 
women and girls and to withdraw reservations to treaties which are incompatible with the 
object and purpose of the specific treaties, and further encourages States to consider 
ratifying or acceding to all human rights treaties, including, as a matter of priority, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Optional Protocol thereto; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To take all appropriate measures to amend or repeal existing laws or to 
modify legal or customary practices that sustain the persistence and tolerance of violence 
against women and girls; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To develop and, where necessary, strengthen policing systems and judicial 
procedures to provide adequate protection for women who have been subjected to violence, 
including by ensuring conducive environments for women and girls to report acts of 
violence against them, timely and thorough investigation of all allegations of violence, 
effective and victim-sensitive collection and processing of evidence, especially forensic 
evidence, effective protection of victims and their families from acts of retaliation, respect 
for the privacy, dignity and autonomy of all victims, as well as necessary victim protection 
measures, such as restraining or expulsion orders and adequate witness protection; </p>


<p><b> 4</b> 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To place a high priority on removing gender bias from the administration of 
justice and enhancing the capacity of law enforcement officials to deal appropriately with 
violence against women, including by providing systematic gender-sensitivity and 
awareness training, as appropriate, for police and security forces, prosecutors, judges and 
lawyers, integrating gender into security sector reform initiatives, developing protocols and 
guidelines, and enhancing or putting in place appropriate accountability measures for 
adjudicators;  
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To encourage the removal of all barriers to women&#8217;s access to justice and 
ensure access to effective legal assistance for all female victims of violence so that they can 
make informed decisions regarding, inter alia, legal proceedings and issues relating to 
family law, and also ensure that victims have access to just and effective remedies for the 
harm that they have suffered, including through the adoption of national legislation, where 
necessary;  
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) To adopt measures to enhance the awareness of women, and in particular 
women at known risk of gender-based violence, of their rights, the law and the protection 
and legal remedies it offers, including by disseminating information on the assistance 
available to women and families who have experienced violence, and ensuring that timely 
and appropriate information is available to all women who have been subjected to violence, 
at all stages of the justice system; 
</p>
<p> (<i>i</i>) To promote an increase in the number of women lawyers, judges, prosecutors 
and law enforcement officials where women are underrepresented in these professions, and 
to take steps to address any barriers that may be preventing women from entering these 
professions, including through the use of appropriate incentives, as important steps towards 
enhancing women&#8217;s awareness of their rights and the ability of the judiciary and law 
enforcement officials to be more sensitive to the specific and differentiated needs of women 
and girls who face targeted, compounded and structural discrimination;  
</p>
<p> (<i>j</i>) To promote the establishment or support of safe and integrated centres 
through which shelter, legal, health-care, psychological, counselling and other appropriate, 
timely, accessible and confidential support services are provided to all women and girls 
who have been subjected to violence and, where such centres are not feasible, to promote 
collaboration and coordination among agencies in order to make remedies more accessible, 
and to facilitate the physical, psychological and social recovery of women who have been 
subjected to violence;  
</p>
<p> (<i>k</i>) To ensure that mechanisms, services and procedures set up to protect women 
and girls facing violence are designed in a manner that addresses the targeted, compounded 
and structural discrimination that combines to increase the vulnerability of women and 
girls, including those belonging to minority groups, indigenous women, refugee and 
internally displaced women, stateless women, migrant women, women living in rural or 
remote communities, women living in slums and informal settlements, women living in 
conditions of poverty, women in institutions or in detention, women with disabilities, 
elderly women, widows and women in all situations of armed conflict, women who face 
trafficking, sexual or labour exploitation, and women who are otherwise discriminated 
against, including on the basis of their HIV/AIDS status;  
</p>
<p>  (<i>l</i>) To establish a multidisciplinary, coordinated response to sexual assault that 
prevents the re-victimization of women and includes specially trained police, prosecutors, 
judges, forensic examiners, victim support services and, where appropriate, testimonial aids 
and other accommodations, to contribute to the well-being of victims, ensure that they are 
able to participate fully, and increase the likelihood of the successful apprehension, 
prosecution and conviction of perpetrators;  </p>


<p> (<i>m</i>) To provide, fund and encourage counselling and rehabilitation programmes 
for the perpetrators of violence and to promote research to further efforts concerning such 
counselling and rehabilitation so as to prevent the recurrence of such violence;  
</p>
<p> (<i>n</i>) To support initiatives undertaken by and engage in strategic partnerships with 
women&#8217;s groups, non-governmental organizations, the private sector, media, faith and 
community groups and other relevant civil society actors and international organizations 
aimed at protecting women and girls who have been subjected to violence, promoting 
gender equality and the full enjoyment of all human rights by women and girls;  
</p>
<p> (<i>o</i>) To take measures to protect human rights defenders who provide support to 
women who have been subjected to violence;  
</p>
<p> (<i>p</i>) To monitor the effectiveness of laws, policies, programmes and measures 
aimed at protecting women and girls facing any form of violence, including monitoring 
actions taken by State agencies in relation to the investigation and prosecution of cases of 
violence and to convictions and sentencing;  
</p>
<p> (<i>q</i>) To establish or strengthen plans of action to eliminate violence against 
women and girls that clearly delineate government accountabilities for protection and are 
supported by the necessary human, financial and technical resources, including, where 
appropriate, time-bound measurable targets, to accelerate the implementation of existing 
plans of action and to regularly monitor and update them, taking into account inputs by 
civil society, in particular women&#8217;s organizations, networks and other stakeholders;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Urges</i> States and the United Nations system to give attention to and 
encourage greater international cooperation in systematic research and the collection, 
analysis and dissemination of data, including data disaggregated by sex, age and disability, 
and other relevant information on the extent, nature and consequences of violence against 
women and girls, and on the impact and effectiveness of policies and programmes for 
protecting women and girls who have been subjected to violence and, in this context, urges 
States and the United Nations system to regularly provide information for inclusion in the 
Secretary-General&#8217;s coordinated database on violence against women;
