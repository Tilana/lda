<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of the minority and other representatives consulted by 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on minority issues during her visit to Ukraine described a history of 
</p>
<p>harmonious inter-ethnic and interfaith relations and a legislative, policy and social 
</p>
<p>environment that was generally conducive to the protection of their rights, including 
</p>
<p>cultural and linguistic rights. Nevertheless, minority issues have become highly politicized 
</p>
<p>as the situation of political and social unrest has emerged in some regions since February 
</p>
<p>2014. That threatens to create and widen fractures along national, ethnic and linguistic lines 
</p>
<p>and undermine peaceful coexistence if not quickly resolved. An end to violence and 
</p>
<p>constructive consultations on minority rights must be primary objectives for all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>The overall human rights and minority rights situation and the civil and political, 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural conditions experienced by minorities cannot justify any 
</p>
<p>violent action or incitement and support of such action by any party, national or 
</p>
<p>international. While there are challenges relating to minority issues, some radical elements 
</p>
<p>are intent on promoting and inciting disunity. It is essential to establish a process of 
</p>
<p>national and regional dialogue with the objective of understanding the concerns and issues 
</p>
<p>of all minority communities and ensuring that they are addressed appropriately and rapidly

<p>A historical good governance deficit and widespread corruption have contributed to

</p>
<p>should include strengthening of legal protection, enhancing institutional attention to 
</p>
<p>minority issues, and instituting stronger and permanent consultation mechanisms. All 
</p>
<p>measures should be adequately funded and politically supported.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on minority issues, Rita Izs&#225;k, conducted an official visit to 
</p>
<p>Ukraine between 7 and 14 April 2014, at the invitation of the Government. She visited 
</p>
<p>Donetsk, Kyiv, Odesa and Uzhgorod. She consulted widely with hundreds of stakeholders, 
</p>
<p>including senior government officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Culture, representatives of civil society and minority communities, religious leaders, 
</p>
<p>political actors, academics, journalists and internally displaced persons (IDPs), the 
</p>
<p>diplomatic community, United Nations bodies and other national and international actors. 
</p>
<p>She thanks the Government and all of those who consulted with her and provided 
</p>
<p>information. 
</p>
<p>2. Key objectives of her visit were to hear the voices of minorities and to understand 
</p>
<p>their issues and concerns, both long-standing and current. The Special Rapporteur met 
</p>
<p>representatives of communities including those who identified as ethnic Armenians, 
</p>
<p>Azerbaijanis, Bulgarians, Crimean Tatars, Gagauzis, Germans, Greeks, Hungarians, 
</p>
<p>Moldovans, Poles, Roma, Romanians, Russians, Ruthenians, Slovaks, Vietnamese and 
</p>
<p>members of Jewish communities. She also met ethnic Ukrainians to learn about their 
</p>
<p>situation as de facto minorities in some localities including the Autonomous Republic of 
</p>
<p>Crimea. 
</p>
<p>3. The most recent census was conducted in 2001. The main minority groups recorded 
</p>
<p>include Russians 8,334,100 (17.3 per cent), Belarusians 275,800 (0.6 per cent), Moldovans 
</p>
<p>258,600 (0.5 per cent), Crimean Tatars 248,200 (0.5 per cent) and Bulgarians 204,600 (0.4 
</p>
<p>per cent). There are smaller populations of Armenians, Hungarians, Jews, Poles, 
</p>
<p>Romanians and other nationalities.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s evaluation is based on the provisions of the Declaration on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities 
</p>
<p>and other relevant international standards, from which she has identified four broad areas of 
</p>
<p>global concern: (a) the protection of a minority&#8217;s survival by combating violence against it 
</p>
<p>and preventing genocide; (b) the protection and promotion of the cultural identity of 
</p>
<p>minority groups, and their right to enjoy their collective identity and to reject forced 
</p>
<p>assimilation; (c) the guarantee of the rights to non-discrimination and to equality, including 
</p>
<p>ending structural or systemic discrimination and the promotion of affirmative action, when 
</p>
<p>required; and (d) the right to the effective participation of minorities in public life and in 
</p>
<p>decisions that affect them. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur focuses her work on minority groups whose generally non-
</p>
<p>dominant situations require measures to allow them to exercise all their rights, including 
</p>
<p>minority rights, to the fullest. Apart from the national dimensions, minority issues have 
</p>
<p>regional and local dimensions. A group that may constitute a dominant majority or a 
</p>
<p>significant proportion of the population nationally or in a particular region may be 
</p>
<p>numerically smaller and non-dominant in another region. Minority rights protection must 
</p>
<p>also be applied fully for those who find themselves in the situation of being de facto 
</p>
<p>minorities in the localities in which they live.  
</p>
<p>6. In view of the current political situation in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and 
</p>
<p>eastern Ukraine, the Special Rapporteur notes that ethnic Ukrainians may constitute de 
</p>
<p>facto minorities in some regions where they live. Some communities, notably Crimean 
</p>
<p>Tatars, self-identify as indigenous peoples. Their engagement with her mandate on minority </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/64/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>issues in no way undermines or is incompatible with their claims to indigenous status and 
</p>
<p>to enjoy the rights contained in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples.  
</p>
<p>7. In its resolution 68/262 of 27 March 2014, the General Assembly upheld the 
</p>
<p>territorial integrity of Ukraine and underscored that the referendum held in the Autonomous 
</p>
<p>Republic of Crimea on 16 March 2014 had no legal validity. The visit and findings of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur are in full conformity with resolution 68/262 regarding recognition of 
</p>
<p>the continuing status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea as the territory of Ukraine 
</p>
<p>under international law. The present report does not provide a comprehensive analysis or 
</p>
<p>chronology of events resulting in political and social unrest and conflict in 2014, but 
</p>
<p>summarizes developments relevant to minority issues. The report includes references to 
</p>
<p>events after the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit and has benefited from the reports of the Office 
</p>
<p>of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)1 and others.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Minority rights: legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. Ukraine is a party to several of the international human rights instruments that are 
</p>
<p>most relevant to minority rights, including: the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and 
</p>
<p>the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
</p>
<p>Article 9 of the Constitution of Ukraine provides that ratified international treaties are part 
</p>
<p>of the national legislation. Ukraine is a member of the Council of Europe, and has been a 
</p>
<p>State party to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
</p>
<p>Freedoms since 1997. It has signed and ratified the major European multilateral treaties for 
</p>
<p>the protection of national minorities: the Framework Convention for the Protection of 
</p>
<p>National Minorities, and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, and 
</p>
<p>falls under their monitoring procedures. 
</p>
<p>9. The Constitution of Ukraine2 (art. 11) requires that the State &#8220;promotes the 
</p>
<p>consolidation and development of the Ukrainian nation, of its historical consciousness, 
</p>
<p>traditions and culture, and also the development of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and 
</p>
<p>religious identity of all indigenous peoples and national minorities&#8221;. The right to equality 
</p>
<p>and non-discrimination is enshrined under article 24, which prohibits &#8220;privileges or 
</p>
<p>restrictions based on race, colour of skin, political, religious and other beliefs, sex, ethnic 
</p>
<p>and social origin, property status, place of residence, linguistic and other characteristics&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>10. Article 10 establishes that the State language is Ukrainian but that &#8220;the free 
</p>
<p>development, use and protection of Russian, and other languages of national minorities of 
</p>
<p>Ukraine, is guaranteed&#8221;. Article 53 recognizes the right to native-instruction: &#8220;Citizens who 
</p>
<p>belong to national minorities are guaranteed in accordance with the law the right to receive 
</p>
<p>instruction in their native language, or to study their native language in State and communal 
</p>
<p>educational establishments and through national cultural societies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>11. On 25 June 1992, Law 2494&#8211;XII on National Minorities3 was adopted. It defines 
</p>
<p>national minorities as citizens who are not ethnic Ukrainian but hold feelings of a national 
</p>
<p>identification and affinity among themselves (art. 3). It established a consultative body, the 
</p>
<p>Council of Representatives for Public Associations of National Minorities, within the

</p>
<p>former Ministry for Nationalities (art. 5). It guarantees cultural rights including, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>native-language instruction in State educational institutions, the celebration of national 
</p>
<p>holidays, the right to freedom of religion, and protection of historical and cultural heritage 
</p>
<p>(art. 6). Minority languages may also be used, alongside Ukrainian, in workplaces where 
</p>
<p>the majority of the population belongs to a minority (art. 8). The right to political 
</p>
<p>participation at all levels is guaranteed (art. 9). A specific State budget is established to 
</p>
<p>support &#8220;the development of national minorities&#8221; (art. 16). Article 19 provides that in case 
</p>
<p>of conflict between that norm and international law, the latter has primacy. 
</p>
<p>12. Since the Law on National Minorities was adopted, the institutional framework of 
</p>
<p>national minorities has undergone numerous changes and the Ministry for Nationalities has 
</p>
<p>been abolished. In 2010, Presidential decree No. 1085/2010 disbanded the State Committee 
</p>
<p>on Nationalities and Religions, which was the main body in charge of minority issues, 
</p>
<p>following institutional reform, and its competencies were assumed by the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Culture. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the Department of Organizations and 
</p>
<p>National Minorities had primary responsibility for minority issues within the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Culture and had only six staff members. 
</p>
<p>13. In 2013, the Council of Europe Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention 
</p>
<p>for the Protection of National Minorities stated that the Law on National Minorities was 
</p>
<p>&#8220;outdated&#8221;, &#8220;too vague in its provisions&#8221; and &#8220;inconsistent&#8221;, resulting in &#8220;a gap in legal 
</p>
<p>certainty for persons belonging to national minorities with regard to the enjoyment of their 
</p>
<p>constitutionally guaranteed rights, such as in the areas of education, language or 
</p>
<p>representation in elected bodies&#8221;.4 The European Commission against Racism and 
</p>
<p>Intolerance of the Council of Europe has called for revisions to the Law to include 
</p>
<p>provisions prohibiting direct and indirect racial discrimination.5 
</p>
<p>14. Law 5029&#8211;VI on Principles of the State Language Policy6 was adopted on 3 June 
</p>
<p>2012, and constitutes, to date, the primary national legislation on national minorities&#8217; 
</p>
<p>linguistic rights, and the use of minority languages in public life. Recognition of the status 
</p>
<p>as &#8220;regional languages&#8221; is provided to 17 languages (Belorusian, Bulgarian, Crimean Tatar, 
</p>
<p>Gagauz, German, Hungarian, Karaim, Krymchak, Modern Greek, Moldovan, Polish, 
</p>
<p>Romani, Romanian, Russian, Rusyn, Slovak and Yiddish) in regions where the language is 
</p>
<p>spoken by at least 10 per cent of the population (art. 7). That allows minority languages to 
</p>
<p>be used in public administration, schools and courts alongside Ukrainian. Other provisions 
</p>
<p>include the right to use minority languages in Parliament, the publication of the acts of the 
</p>
<p>central State authorities, guarantees of freedom to receive media broadcasts from 
</p>
<p>neighbouring countries in regional or minority languages, and free circulation of 
</p>
<p>information in the written press in those languages. Despite moves to abolish the law in 
</p>
<p>February 2014, these were vetoed by the interim President and, at the time of writing, the 
</p>
<p>law remains in force while under review.  
</p>
<p>15. The 2001 Criminal Code of Ukraine criminalizes (art. 161) inciting national, racial 
</p>
<p>or religious enmity and hatred, humiliation of national honour and dignity, insulting 
</p>
<p>citizens&#8217; feelings with respect to their religious convictions, and any direct or indirect 
</p>
<p>restriction of rights, or granting direct or indirect privileges to citizens based on race, colour 
</p>
<p>of skin, political, religious and other convictions, sex, ethnic and social origin, property 
</p>
<p>status, place of residence, linguistic or other characteristics. In 2009 amendments expanded

<p>the scope of provisions and penalties for inciting racial, national and religious hatred, 
</p>
<p>intolerance and discrimination.7 
</p>
<p>16. The legislative framework for political representation and the electoral system 
</p>
<p>includes the Constitution, the Law on Political Parties (2001),8 and the Law on Election of 
</p>
<p>the People&#8217;s Deputies (2011).9 The 2012 Law on National Minorities (art. 9) contains a 
</p>
<p>general provision regarding the representation of minorities among candidates for elections, 
</p>
<p>which in principle guarantees minorities the right &#8220;to be elected or to be appointed to any 
</p>
<p>position in the legislative, executive, judicial bodies, in the bodies of local or regional self-
</p>
<p>government&#8221;.10 However, no specific measures are provided to ensure the political 
</p>
<p>participation of minorities. Some interviewees indicated that the current formulation of 
</p>
<p>electoral districts and restrictions on minority parties should be reconsidered in order to 
</p>
<p>improve the possibility for minority representatives to be elected to Parliament.  
</p>
<p>17. The Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights (the Ukrainian 
</p>
<p>Ombudsperson11) is a constitutional, independent body created in December 1997. The 
</p>
<p>Commissioner conducts legal proceedings and inspections and receives individual 
</p>
<p>complaints. A 2010 special report of the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights noted that a monitoring programme on the human rights status of national minorities 
</p>
<p>had been initiated by the Ombudsman&#8217;s office.12 The European Commission against 
</p>
<p>Racism and Intolerance recommended the establishment of a special representative of the 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman with competence to deal with minority issues and racial discrimination.13 
</p>
<p>18. The Ministry of Culture stated that processes were under way to strengthen and 
</p>
<p>expand institutional attention to minority issues, including proposals to establish new 
</p>
<p>independent bodies with responsibility for minorities and inter-ethnic affairs. At the time of 
</p>
<p>writing full details of those proposals were unavailable. The Special Rapporteur urges the 
</p>
<p>authorities to put in place fully inclusive and participatory processes to establish such 
</p>
<p>bodies and to provide assurances that they will be representative of minorities and have 
</p>
<p>appropriate budgets and powers. She noted a general lack of awareness of minority rights 
</p>
<p>amongst minorities and found that minorities mainly focused attention on intercommunal 
</p>
<p>relationships, but often seemed to have limited knowledge of government obligations to 
</p>
<p>protect and promote minority rights.

<p><b> IV. Minority rights in the context of political and social unrest 
in 2014 
</b></p>
<p>19. The situation of political and social unrest in some regions since February 2014, 
</p>
<p>while having minority rights dimensions, is distinct from the general minority rights 
</p>
<p>situation in Ukraine. Evidence suggests that the concerns of minorities, primarily over 
</p>
<p>language and cultural rights, following the Euromaidan movement and the new 
</p>
<p>Government taking power in February 2014, have been unduly escalated to create a 
</p>
<p>situation of high tension and conflict. The presence and activities of far-right, 
</p>
<p>ultranationalist &#8220;self-defence&#8221; groups and unidentified illegal armed actors have created 
</p>
<p>anxiety and inflamed tensions in several locations. The Special Rapporteur does not 
</p>
<p>consider that they represent or speak for most persons belonging to minorities or the 
</p>
<p>majority of the Ukrainian people, and they should not be allowed to influence political, 
</p>
<p>social or economic decisions via force or coercion.  
</p>
<p>20. The role of informal, unofficial and sometimes illegally armed groups, including in 
</p>
<p>the events in the occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea, and the unrest in eastern and 
</p>
<p>southern Ukraine leading to the takeover and occupation of some buildings and towns have 
</p>
<p>been prominent and highly destabilizing. It is essential to quickly re-establish the rule of 
</p>
<p>law and the role of legitimate law enforcement actors and for all non-official groups to be 
</p>
<p>disarmed and dispersed. Where any individuals involved in such groups are alleged to have 
</p>
<p>committed or incited crimes, they must be prosecuted according to the law.  
</p>
<p>21. Several interviewees complained about worsening economic conditions, corruption, 
</p>
<p>unemployment and the lack of good governance, which they considered to have contributed 
</p>
<p>to grievances, political instability and a general distrust of politicians and political 
</p>
<p>structures. It is essential to consider the wider economic and political dimension of the 
</p>
<p>current situation and to implement measures to guarantee equality, social and economic 
</p>
<p>rights and combat corruption and mismanagement of resources, as a means to increase trust 
</p>
<p>in political leadership. The reality or perception of inequality in access to resources or 
</p>
<p>distribution of resources, also involving geographical imbalances, as well as partisan 
</p>
<p>politics and political patronage serve to undermine stability and create ethnic, linguistic, 
</p>
<p>and geographic fault lines.  
</p>
<p>22. Ethnic Russians consulted in Donetsk, Kyiv and Odesa strongly expressed their 
</p>
<p>views that the Euromaidan movement represented an explicit anti-Russian agenda with 
</p>
<p>potential implications for their future rights and security. Some stated concern over the role 
</p>
<p>of far-right and Ukrainian nationalist groups including the All-Ukrainian Union &#8220;Svoboda&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(Freedom) and &#8220;Pravyi Sektor&#8221; (Right Sector), that have openly expressed anti-Russian and 
</p>
<p>anti-Semitic sentiments and have nationalist agendas. It is evident that dialogue between the 
</p>
<p>Government and ethnic-Russian groups in eastern and southern Ukraine is weak, while it is 
</p>
<p>essential to build confidence that minority rights guarantees will be put in place and 
</p>
<p>respected. The Special Rapporteur notes the poor election results of far-right and allegedly 
</p>
<p>anti-Russian parties in the May 2014 elections.14  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur was not provided with evidence that anti-Russian sentiment 
</p>
<p>was widespread. There have been few incidents of discrimination, harassment or abuse of 
</p>
<p>individuals or groups on the basis of their Russian identity in Kyiv or other localities. 
</p>
<p>Russians and ethnic Ukrainians frequently stated that their relations remained good. 
</p>
<p>Incidents of intercommunal violence were extremely rare or non-existent in most localities 
</p>
<p>at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. However, in the current situation of conflict in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 14 Right Sector and Svoboda received just 0.9 per cent and 1.3 per cent of the vote, respectively. </p>

<p>some regions, it is necessary for all relevant actors, including the United Nations human 
</p>
<p>rights monitoring team, to identify incidents or trends that indicate that violence or 
</p>
<p>intimidation on the grounds of ethnicity, language or religion are increasing.  
</p>
<p>24. In April and May 2014, unrest in southern and eastern Ukraine escalated 
</p>
<p>significantly with public buildings in localities including Donetsk, Kharkiv, Odesa and 
</p>
<p>Slovyansk falling under the occupation of pro-Russian activists and violent incidents as 
</p>
<p>Ukrainian authorities responded. Vaguely defined pro-Russian elements, including 
</p>
<p>organized and illegally armed groups, often emerged in previously peaceful locations, 
</p>
<p>sometimes with tragic consequences. Such incidents have the potential to further divide 
</p>
<p>communities along ethnic and linguistic lines and create the conditions for the escalation of 
</p>
<p>tensions.  
</p>
<p>25. On 11 May 2014, pro-Russian elements in separatist-controlled cities and towns in 
</p>
<p>Donetsk and Luhansk regions held &#8220;referendums&#8221; asking &#8220;Do you support the act of State 
</p>
<p>self-rule of the Donetsk/Luhansk People&#8217;s Republic?&#8221; The vote was condemned as illegal 
</p>
<p>by the Government and the international community and the Special Rapporteur supports 
</p>
<p>that opinion. Reports suggest that many pro-unity supporters boycotted the action while 
</p>
<p>pro-Russian supporters took part. The &#8220;referendums&#8221; lacked democratic legitimacy. They 
</p>
<p>provided a distorted and unreliable account of public opinion and have served to further 
</p>
<p>divide communities, increase tensions and destabilize the situation. 
</p>
<p>26. Some minority representatives emphasized their desire for greater political and 
</p>
<p>cultural autonomy for some regions. Some representatives of Russian ethnicity maintained 
</p>
<p>strongly nationalist feelings associated with their kin-State and historical claims over 
</p>
<p>certain territories. Those who proclaimed a &#8220;People&#8217;s Republic&#8221; in Donetsk and held 
</p>
<p>&#8220;referendums&#8221; on the status of those regions stated their objective as separation from 
</p>
<p>Ukraine. Regrettably, some have sought to achieve that by force.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur considers it important to monitor and robustly address any 
</p>
<p>hate speech and incitement to violence that may fuel tensions, particularly in the context of 
</p>
<p>the current crisis. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe 
</p>
<p>(OSCE)/Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Assessment Mission in Ukraine found that &#8220;instances of hate speech towards ethnic and 
</p>
<p>religious groups have been widespread&#8221; including in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. 
</p>
<p>It stated that &#8220;pro-Maidan activists have often been labelled &#8216;<i>banderovtsy</i>&#8217;, &#8216;Nazis&#700; and 
</p>
<p>&#8216;fascists&#700;. Supporting the territorial integrity and unity of Ukraine has been depicted as a 
</p>
<p>sign of intolerance and nationalism&#8221;.15 The Mission report noted indications of growing 
</p>
<p>anti-Tatar sentiment in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>concurs with the assessment of the Mission that there has been a trend that has seen 
</p>
<p>political orientation conflated with ethnic background in eastern and southern Ukraine, 
</p>
<p>where Ukrainian identity and symbols have been targeted for hate speech. Equally, any 
</p>
<p>anti-Russian sentiments must be closely monitored. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur received reports stating that some Russian language media 
</p>
<p>sources in Donetsk Oblast (region) and Ukrainian language media in the Autonomous 
</p>
<p>Republic of Crimea have faced closure or broadcasting restrictions. The violent takeover of 
</p>
<p>some broadcast media was reported in some localities under pro-Russian control.16

<p> 16 The June 2014 OHCHR report on the human rights situation in Ukraine states that &#8220;according to 
</p>
<p>NGOs, freedom of media in the Donetsk region is severely curtailed, with Ukrainian TV channels 
</p>
<p>switched off by the &#8216;Donetsk People&#8217;s Republic&#700; and replaced by its own media programmes and 
</p>
<p>Russian TV&#8221; (para. 232). Available from

</b></p>
<p><b>10 </b> 
</p>
<p>Freedom of expression and media freedom should be guaranteed within the framework of 
</p>
<p>the Constitution and international law, and respected in practice. All journalists should be 
</p>
<p>free to work in safety and without threat of detention or violence. Nevertheless, evidence 
</p>
<p>suggests that some media provided a distorted picture of events as they developed. 
</p>
<p>Journalists and those who control media content have a responsibility to convey 
</p>
<p>information accurately and objectively and to avoid propaganda or misinformation which 
</p>
<p>may incite unrest or violence.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Issues of minority identity in Ukraine  
</b></p>
<p>29. Given the historical, geopolitical and national/cultural contexts that have shaped 
</p>
<p>independent Ukraine, issues of identity are complex and emotive. Many of those consulted 
</p>
<p>self-identified primarily according to their national or ethnic origins in a kin-State, while 
</p>
<p>placing less emphasis on their Ukrainian identity and citizenship. Ukraine consequently has 
</p>
<p>numerous large minority groups with strong historical, ethnic, cultural and linguistic 
</p>
<p>connections to neighbouring countries and clear historical narratives regarding their 
</p>
<p>communities, and their &#8220;belonging&#8221; in Ukraine. The Special Rapporteur also interviewed 
</p>
<p>representatives of groups, including Ruthenians, who felt that they had not been recognized 
</p>
<p>as minorities or indigenous peoples, which is how they identified themselves.  
</p>
<p>30. Many representatives of minorities emphasized their strong and enduring relations 
</p>
<p>with their kin-States and the fact that no barriers existed to their establishing associations 
</p>
<p>and maintaining social and cultural ties with those countries. They maintained cultural 
</p>
<p>associations and events and minority media, as well as education in their mother tongue 
</p>
<p>languages, sometimes with the support of kin-States. It is evident that Ukraine substantively 
</p>
<p>upholds the right of minorities to establish their own associations and to maintain free and 
</p>
<p>peaceful contacts including across frontiers; some interviewees stated that additional State 
</p>
<p>support and funding were necessary.  
</p>
<p>31. Despite a strong feeling of minority identity, the majority of those consulted also 
</p>
<p>emphasized their Ukrainian citizenship and their satisfaction with their treatment as 
</p>
<p>minorities. Some interviewees suggested that stronger history and civic education 
</p>
<p>components could be incorporated in school curricula in order to foster stronger Ukrainian 
</p>
<p>national identity, mutual knowledge and understanding among different groups and to 
</p>
<p>promote national unity. 
</p>
<p>32. The long history of settlement in the territory of Ukraine by different peoples has 
</p>
<p>created overlapping and sometimes competitive identities. In the short time since 
</p>
<p>independence, it has proved difficult to unite such diverse population groups and forge a 
</p>
<p>sense of common Ukrainian identity.17 Measures to promote national identity, culture and 
</p>
<p>language, known as Ukrainianization, are legitimate and necessary to promote unity and 
</p>
<p>economic, geographic and social mobility in a country with such diverse population groups. 
</p>
<p>However, issues of cultural autonomy and the ability for minorities to influence decisions 
</p>
<p>that affect them and the regions where they live were particularly prominent in 
</p>
<p>consultations held and the Special Rapporteur encourages continued dialogue with 
</p>
<p>minorities on those important matters. 
</p>
<p>33. Russian minority representatives acknowledged that, prior to the unrest, they did not 
</p>
<p>face a repressive environment, widespread discrimination, exclusion, or violence based on 
</p>
<p>their identity. They commonly reflected their greatest concerns as being in the fields of 
</p>

<p>language and education and expressed their perception that the Euromaidan movement and 
</p>
<p>pro-European Government would diminish the status of the Russian language and culture, 
</p>
<p>reinforced by attempts to abolish the 2012 language law. Some ethnic Russians viewed the 
</p>
<p>territory and people of Ukraine as historically and culturally Russian and strongly rejected 
</p>
<p>the label &#8220;minority&#8221; being applied to them.  
</p>
<p>34. A population census is overdue and is planned for 2016. In the absence of accurate 
</p>
<p>disaggregated data that reveal the ethnic, linguistic or religious composition of the 
</p>
<p>population, there is often dangerous speculation and manipulation relating to the size of 
</p>
<p>certain groups. An early and well-conducted census will provide reliable data on the ethnic 
</p>
<p>and linguistic diversity of Ukraine, help to identify problems facing particular population 
</p>
<p>groups, and enable the Government to understand and respond to the needs of different 
</p>
<p>minorities.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Language and cultural rights of minorities 
</b></p>
<p>35. Consultations revealed that the use of minority languages was highly important and 
</p>
<p>emotive for many communities and an essential aspect of individual and community 
</p>
<p>identity. National minorities clearly expressed their desire to maintain and protect their 
</p>
<p>language rights and their ability to use their languages freely in private and public without 
</p>
<p>discrimination. Most communities broadly expressed satisfaction that their children had the 
</p>
<p>opportunity to learn and, in many cases, be taught in their mother-tongue language. 
</p>
<p>Minority schools have been established and can function freely according to national law.  
</p>
<p>36. Calls to upgrade the status of Russian as a second official State language have been 
</p>
<p>the subject of fierce disagreement between pro-Russians and those who advocate the 
</p>
<p>primacy of Ukrainian. The Government considers that widespread knowledge and use of 
</p>
<p>Ukrainian as the State language are important to Ukrainian national identity and unity and 
</p>
<p>allow economic, geographical and social mobility while ensuring that those belonging to 
</p>
<p>any ethnic or linguistic minority can participate fully in all aspects of society, including 
</p>
<p>political life. Minority representatives frequently mentioned that the use of minority 
</p>
<p>languages was a significant and valued feature of Ukrainian society and was not 
</p>
<p>incompatible with the teaching and use of Ukrainian.  
</p>
<p>37. Reliable data concerning the number of users of minority languages and their 
</p>
<p>geographic distribution are important to ensure that they comply fully with international 
</p>
<p>standards for protection of the linguistic rights of minorities. The 2001 census revealed that, 
</p>
<p>while 67.5 per cent described their native language as Ukrainian, 29.6 per cent recorded 
</p>
<p>their native language as Russian.18 Russian is widely spoken in the south, the east and the 
</p>
<p>Autonomous Republic of Crimea, particularly the regions of Crimea (77.0 per cent), 
</p>
<p>Donetsk (74.9 per cent), Luhansk (68.8 per cent), Zaporizhia (48.2 per cent) and Kharkiv 
</p>
<p>(44.3 per cent), while in some other regions there is reportedly extensive bilingualism.  
</p>
<p>38. The passing of Law 5029&#8211;VI on the Principles of the State Language Policy in 2012 
</p>
<p>provided relatively extensive language rights and a low threshold of 10 per cent for 
</p>
<p>recognition of regional language status, benefiting several minority language communities. 
</p>
<p>However, it also raised concerns, including with regard to the promotion of the Ukrainian 
</p>
<p>language, despite its status as the sole State language. The Law was criticized, including by 
</p>
<p>the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission), as being 
</p>
<p>overly focused on the promotion of the status of the Russian language, potentially at the

<p>expense of Ukrainian.19 While the Law remains in effect, the Government has announced 
</p>
<p>that new language legislation is being drafted and will be subject to review by the 
</p>
<p>Commission before being passed into law.  
</p>
<p>39. Nevertheless, steps in February 2014 to abolish the 2012 Law on the Principles of 
</p>
<p>the State Language Policy, although vetoed in practice, created anxiety as minorities were 
</p>
<p>concerned that new amendments would weaken their linguistic rights. Ethnic Russians 
</p>
<p>spoke passionately about the decline in use of Russian in education, and their desire to see 
</p>
<p>enhanced protection measures put in place. Some pointed out that there were relatively few 
</p>
<p>Russian language schools in relation to the number of Russians who considered it their first 
</p>
<p>language and described a gradual decline of the Russian language and cultural institutions.  
</p>
<p>40. Some ethnic Russians voiced their concerns regarding assimilation and the gradual 
</p>
<p>erosion of elements of Russian culture and language. One representative stated: &#8220;There is 
</p>
<p>not a repressive environment, but there is an attempt to push out the Russian culture part of 
</p>
<p>me.&#8221; Although according to Ministry of Education and Science statistics, in 2012/2013 
</p>
<p>Russian was the language of instruction and study in 1,256 schools providing general 
</p>
<p>education, with 694,331 pupils being taught in Russian, ethnic Russian representatives 
</p>
<p>noted a decline in education in the Russian language, notably in higher education, and that 
</p>
<p>some Russian cultural centres had closed.  
</p>
<p>41. In practice, Russian remains widely used and understood. The Government states 
</p>
<p>that 40 per cent of all printed media nationally are in Russian and up to 74 per cent of 
</p>
<p>media broadcasts are in Russian in some regions. Government objectives of promoting 
</p>
<p>Ukrainian as the national language may impact on the extent of Russian language use over 
</p>
<p>time. Although according to the Government over 100 public associations represent the 
</p>
<p>Russian minority, some ethnic Russians stated that civil society organizations and activities 
</p>
<p>to promote Russian language and culture and to raise their issues and concerns were 
</p>
<p>relatively weak.  
</p>
<p>42. The January 2014 report of the Committee of Experts on the European Charter for 
</p>
<p>Regional or Minority Languages,20 while noting some challenges for smaller linguistic 
</p>
<p>minorities, stated: &#8220;In regard of Hungarian, Romanian and Russian the situation is by and 
</p>
<p>large satisfactory and the right of speakers to receive education in these languages is more 
</p>
<p>or less secured. The traditional models of teaching in Hungarian, Romanian and Russian 
</p>
<p>have been preserved, although there seems to be a certain decline in the number of pupils 
</p>
<p>enrolled.&#8221; Concern was expressed that the &#8220;phasing out of higher education in Russian will 
</p>
<p>constitute an obstacle to full access of Russian speakers to higher education&#8221;. The report 
</p>
<p>referred to an unmet demand from users of minority languages for support to establish and 
</p>
<p>sustain cultural centres and a lack of long-term financing for such centres.  
</p>
<p>43. Civil society groups emphasized that any revised language law must fully conform 
</p>
<p>with international standards and should not weaken the existing protection of the linguistic 
</p>
<p>rights of minorities. Some expressed concern that a new language law might increase the 
</p>
<p>threshold of 10 per cent for recognition of minority languages as &#8220;regional languages&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>restrict language rights in fields such as the media and education, and provide weak 
</p>
<p>language rights protection for smaller and dispersed minority groups. Importantly, some 
</p>
<p>minorities stated that they had not been consulted about the process of drafting a revised 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 19 The Commission recommended the implementation of balanced policies in order to preserve 
</p>
<p>Ukrainian as an integrative tool within society. See

</p>
<p>Russian officials of Svoboda would have a substantive role in formulating the new law.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Situation of internally displaced persons and Crimean Tatars 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur attempted to gain access to the Autonomous Republic of 
</p>
<p>Crimea to assess the situation of minorities and to consult with the de facto authorities and 
</p>
<p>minority and other community actors. Regrettably, she did not receive the required 
</p>
<p>assurances to enable her to travel. The general human and minority rights situation in the 
</p>
<p>Republic is of concern as administrative authority over the region has been illegally 
</p>
<p>assumed by the Russian Federation following a disputed referendum on 16 March 2014.21 
</p>
<p>On 27 March, the General Assembly underscored in its resolution 68/262 that that 
</p>
<p>referendum had &#8220;no validity&#8221; and upheld the territorial integrity of Ukraine, including the 
</p>
<p>Autonomous Republic of Crimea.  
</p>
<p>45. The 2001 census revealed that ethnic Russians made up 58.3 per cent of the total 
</p>
<p>population in Crimea (1,180,400 people, although that percentage has declined from 
</p>
<p>65.6 per cent in 1989). Ukrainians accounted for 492,200 people or 24.3 per cent (a decline 
</p>
<p>from 26.7 per cent in 1989), and 243,400 were Crimean Tatars (reflecting an increase from 
</p>
<p>1.9 per cent in 1989 to 12 per cent in 2001 owing to the significant return of Tatars to the 
</p>
<p>peninsular). The number of returning Crimean Tatars reportedly peaked at 41,400 in 1991, 
</p>
<p>and has been rapidly falling since.22 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur interviewed several people who had left the Autonomous 
</p>
<p>Republic of Crimea. Some mentioned uncertainty, social and political pressure and fear for 
</p>
<p>their security and rights as the reasons for their decision to leave. They reported a tense and 
</p>
<p>threatening environment, including via social media, against those who opposed or 
</p>
<p>criticized the events surrounding the &#8220;referendum&#8221; and some stated that they knew about 
</p>
<p>incidents of physical and verbal abuse. Some interviewees stressed their desire to remain 
</p>
<p>Ukrainian and not to live in the Russian Federation. Some stated that Ukrainian language 
</p>
<p>media in Crimea had been &#8220;switched off&#8221;. In the current political circumstances, the human 
</p>
<p>rights situation of ethnic Ukrainians who remain in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea as 
</p>
<p>a de facto minority requires close monitoring; some reports suggest that there has been 
</p>
<p>intimidation of those who openly oppose Russian control of the region or use the Ukrainian 
</p>
<p>language in public.  
</p>
<p>47. Some individuals stated that concerns over maintaining Ukrainian citizenship and 
</p>
<p>passports had been a contributing factor in their decision to leave. They expressed fears that 
</p>
<p>those who wished to remain Ukrainian in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea would face 
</p>
<p>discrimination as &#8220;foreigners&#8221; with implications for their economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights and their right to participate in political life. Crimean residents were given one 
</p>
<p>month, until 18 April 2014, to submit applications declaring that they did not wish to 
</p>
<p>become Russian citizens. Some reported procedural difficulties that apparently made it 
</p>
<p>difficult to meet the necessary requirements to keep their Ukrainian passports, including a 
</p>
<p>shortage of registration offices, and suggested that those were deliberate barriers.  
</p>
<p>48. Concern exists regarding the implications of not accepting Russian citizenship and 
</p>
<p>passports, including loss of property, restrictions on freedom of movement, provision of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 21 Pro-Russian authorities claimed that 97 per cent of voters supported the proposal to join the Russian 
</p>
<p>Federation, a figure that was disputed by the Ukrainian authorities.

</p>
<p>State pensions, and the possible loss of government jobs. Civil servants and law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officials are required under Russian law to formally relinquish their Ukrainian 
</p>
<p>passports since those who occupy government jobs cannot hold dual citizenship.23 Some 
</p>
<p>expressed concern that Ukrainian citizens would feel compelled not to refuse Russian 
</p>
<p>citizenship owing to the potential impact on their human rights. Equally, expectations of a 
</p>
<p>hostile climate towards those with pro-Ukrainian views and those who wished to remain 
</p>
<p>Ukrainian might encourage more people to leave.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur consulted leaders of the Crimean Tatar Mejlis (the self-
</p>
<p>governing body of Tatars). The return of Tatars, who are the indigenous inhabitants of the 
</p>
<p>Autonomous Republic of Crimea, following their mass deportation in 1944, resulted in 
</p>
<p>reported friction with the significant Russian population. Repatriation programmes were 
</p>
<p>reportedly insufficiently funded and many returnees lacked adequate support. Issues of 
</p>
<p>concern included high unemployment among Tatars and competition for land, despite their 
</p>
<p>claims to land rights as indigenous people. There was no compensation provided for the 
</p>
<p>properties that Tatars had lost and many, lacking access to land, occupied public lands. 
</p>
<p>Consequently incidents of confrontation with other communities and the police have been 
</p>
<p>recorded.  
</p>
<p>50. It is of great concern that many Crimean Tatars will refuse to accept Russian 
</p>
<p>citizenship or authority which may render them even more vulnerable. Most Crimean 
</p>
<p>Tatars boycotted the March 2014 referendum.24 Sergey Aksyonov, who at the time was 
</p>
<p>&#8220;governor&#8221; in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, reportedly stated publically that 
</p>
<p>Crimean Tatars should &#8220;leave if they don&#8217;t like it&#8221;. Some Crimean Tatar leaders who 
</p>
<p>travelled out of the Republic have faced restrictions on re-entering, including the former 
</p>
<p>head of the Mejlis, Mustafa Dzhemilev, who called for a boycott of the &#8220;referendum&#8221;. On 
</p>
<p>22 April, he was banned from travelling to the Republic for five years, leading to protests 
</p>
<p>and subsequently a warning from the de facto authorities that the Mejlis could be dissolved 
</p>
<p>if it supported &#8220;extremist activities&#8221;. On 5 July, a ban on entry was imposed on the current 
</p>
<p>head of the Mejlis, Refat Chubarov, reportedly for &#8220;extremist statements&#8221;. Charges were 
</p>
<p>reportedly brought against 30 protestors and fines imposed. The authorities imposed a 
</p>
<p>temporary ban on public protests in advance of the seventieth anniversary of the deportation 
</p>
<p>of Crimean Tatars. 
</p>
<p>51. Some incidents have heightened anxiety within Tatar communities. On 3 March 
</p>
<p>2014 a Tatar labourer, Reshat Ametov, disappeared after reportedly being led away from a 
</p>
<p>protest in Simferopol by unknown men in camouflage. His body was found days later in the 
</p>
<p>mixed ethnic community of Belogorsk. Prior to the referendum of 16 March, Tatar 
</p>
<p>communities reportedly had crosses marked on the walls or gates of their homes, which 
</p>
<p>allegedly heightened anxiety regarding potential targeting. OHCHR stated that some Tatar 
</p>
<p>representatives had mentioned concerns over unidentified uniformed men claiming rights 
</p>
<p>on Tatar properties and land and reports of plans to relocate some communities .25  
</p>
<p>52. At the time of drafting, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Refugees (UNHCR) reported over 10,000 verified IDPs in 24 regions as of 20 May 2014, 
</p>
<p>the majority having left the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, with numbers continuing to

<p>rise.26 The Government has no registration system for IDPs on national or ethnic lines that 
</p>
<p>would allow for a full breakdown according to identity. Estimates suggest that many are 
</p>
<p>Crimean Tatar (80 per cent in western Ukraine; 20 per cent in the Kyiv region); however 
</p>
<p>there are reports of an increased registration of ethnic Ukrainians, ethnically mixed 
</p>
<p>families, ethnic Russians, refugees, asylum seekers and foreigners married to Ukrainian 
</p>
<p>citizens.27 The true number may exceed that provided, given that many people may have 
</p>
<p>found accommodation with relatives and communities without registering with 
</p>
<p>organizations that provide support. According to UNHCR, factors triggering movement 
</p>
<p>include increased security concerns and personal threats.  
</p>
<p>53. Efforts to address the needs of IDPs and protect the rights of those who remain in 
</p>
<p>the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and prevent further displacement should conform with 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. UNHCR reported the priority concerns of 
</p>
<p>IDPs as: maintaining contacts in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea; freedom to move 
</p>
<p>and communicate between the Republic and the mainland; assistance with shelter and 
</p>
<p>employment; simplified procedures for obtaining identity and residence documents to enjoy 
</p>
<p>social and economic rights on the mainland; continuity of social payments; and assistance 
</p>
<p>with property sales, transfer of funds and personal belongings. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>welcomed efforts to support IDPs and witnessed solidarity across various communities 
</p>
<p>manifested in voluntary services and contributions. However, some reports suggested that 
</p>
<p>IDPs had experienced difficulties gaining access to financial support from the State.  
</p>
<p>54. Some Crimean Tatar representatives indicated that, historically, their rights had not 
</p>
<p>been fully recognized and protected by any authority in the Autonomous Republic of 
</p>
<p>Crimea. The Government mentioned that, following the events in the Republic resulting in 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;referendum&#8221;, in March 2014 the Verkhovna Rada had passed a resolution guaranteeing 
</p>
<p>the rights of the Crimean Tatar people as a part of the State of Ukraine (No. 1140&#8211;VII of 20 
</p>
<p>March). According to the resolution, Ukraine guarantees to preserve and develop &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious uniqueness of the Crimean Tatar people, as 
</p>
<p>indigenous people and of all national minorities of Ukraine&#8221;. It acknowledges the Mejlis of 
</p>
<p>the Crimean Tatar people as a competent authority and requires urgent submission of draft 
</p>
<p>laws and regulatory legal acts confirming the status of the Crimean Tatar people as 
</p>
<p>indigenous people. 
</p>
<p>55. According to General Assembly resolution 68/262 on the territorial integrity of 
</p>
<p>Ukraine, the Russian Federation has no legal jurisdiction over the Autonomous Republic of 
</p>
<p>Crimea or its populations. Nevertheless, it is to be noted that on 21 April 2014, following 
</p>
<p>its occupation of the Republic, the Russian Federation published a decree on measures to 
</p>
<p>rehabilitate Armenian, Bulgarian, Greek, Crimean Tatar and German populations and State 
</p>
<p>support for their revival and development. The Special Rapporteur notes that the full 
</p>
<p>spectrum of human rights of minorities must be respected, protected and promoted without 
</p>
<p>discrimination by the de facto authorities even in situations of territorial dispute or 
</p>
<p>occupation.  
</p>
<p>56. In view of recent political and social change and the activities of armed militias, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur recommends that the United Nations human rights monitoring mission 
</p>
<p>should be allowed unfettered access to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea at the earliest 
</p>
<p>opportunity. It should engage with both the de facto authorities and diverse civil society and 
</p>
<p>community actors to ensure that human rights standards, including minority rights, are 
</p>
<p>upheld in practice.

<p> 27 From mid-April 2014, UNHCR noticed movement of people away from eastern Ukraine as tensions 
</p>
<p>increased in the regions. </p>

</p>
<p><b> VIII. Situation of religious minorities 
</b></p>
<p>57. Ukraine has a wide range of religions, belief groups and religious freedoms and the 
</p>
<p>rights of religious minorities are protected in practice. Nevertheless, given the climate of 
</p>
<p>political and social unease, it is particularly necessary for the authorities to guard against 
</p>
<p>any human rights violations, including acts of violence, intimidation, threat or abuse 
</p>
<p>targeted at individuals or groups based on their religion. Some incidents of concern have 
</p>
<p>been reported in the context of the tense social and political environment since February 
</p>
<p>2014.  
</p>
<p>58. Jewish representatives reflected that they were well integrated, enjoyed their rights 
</p>
<p>as a religious minority and that anti-Semitism, discrimination and violent incidents were 
</p>
<p>rare. They generally expressed satisfaction at the extent of their minority rights protection. 
</p>
<p>However, some incidents were reported in the context of the unrest that had put Jewish 
</p>
<p>communities on alert. In February, the Giymat Rosa Synagogue in Zaporizhia, near Kyiv 
</p>
<p>was firebombed. In early April 2014, a Holocaust memorial in Odesa was vandalized with 
</p>
<p>Nazi graffiti. On 19 April, the Nikolayev Synagogue was firebombed causing minor 
</p>
<p>damage. Representatives expressed concern about adequate protection measures. One 
</p>
<p>leader stated: &#8220;No proper police are in place; ordinary people are carrying arms.&#8221; Some 
</p>
<p>anti-Semitic graffiti was also reported in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.  
</p>
<p>59. Of concern to the Jewish community was the distribution in Donetsk by men 
</p>
<p>wearing balaclavas of leaflets calling on Jews to register with the pro-Russians, pay a tax, 
</p>
<p>or leave. The leaflets bore a stamp reportedly of the self-proclaimed &#8220;People&#8217;s Republic of 
</p>
<p>Donetsk&#8221;, although it declared the leaflets to be a hoax. It remains unclear who was behind 
</p>
<p>the leaflet. One leader of the Jewish community mentioned an incident in which neo-Nazi 
</p>
<p>graffiti, allegedly signed by the Right Sector, had been painted on the walls of a synagogue 
</p>
<p>in Odesa. Right Sector representatives denied involvement and reportedly helped remove 
</p>
<p>the graffiti. A Jewish leader stated: &#8220;Politicians are playing the &#8216;Jewish card&#8217;&#8221; and that the 
</p>
<p>incidents were intended to inflame tensions and concerns amongst Jewish communities for 
</p>
<p>political ends.  
</p>
<p>60. While incidents remain rare, they nevertheless indicate a potential rise in 
</p>
<p>manifestations of anti-Semitism, which must be monitored closely. The lack of 
</p>
<p>implementation of the rule of law in some localities provides an environment in which far-
</p>
<p>right groups have undoubtedly increased their activities and such anti-Semitic incidents 
</p>
<p>may become more pronounced. Such incidents have created anxiety and should be 
</p>
<p>investigated as crimes aggravated by hatred. Anti-Semitism must be acknowledged by the 
</p>
<p>Government and measures should be taken to prosecute according to the law any person or 
</p>
<p>group alleged to have committed or incited anti-Semitic acts. 
</p>
<p>61. Senior representatives of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) 
</p>
<p>expressed concerns over alleged reports from church members of rising animosity against 
</p>
<p>them, searching of properties, and the questioning of a church leader. They stated that there 
</p>
<p>had been calls for Russian churches to be destroyed and Russian priests to be killed. They 
</p>
<p>mentioned calls for the two most important monasteries to be transferred to the Kyiv 
</p>
<p>Patriarchate and threats, allegedly by the Right Sector, to take over the cathedral unless it 
</p>
<p>was transferred to the Kyiv Patriarchate. They reported cases of intimidation and 
</p>
<p>persecution, including the case of a priest who had fled to Luhansk after having been 
</p>
<p>interrogated by the authorities.  
</p>
<p>62. In the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, there have been news reports of 
</p>
<p>representatives of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church claiming that Russian priests with armed 
</p>
<p>supporters had threatened to confiscate churches. Some representatives of the Ukrainian 
</p>
<p>Catholic Church reportedly left Crimea following alleged threats of arrest or property </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/64/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>seizure and intimidation. One priest was allegedly detained and beaten in March 2014 and a 
</p>
<p>number of priests and parishioners have reportedly left for areas under Ukrainian control. 
</p>
<p>Some Tatar representatives expressed concern, as members of the Muslim minority, over 
</p>
<p>the extent to which their rights to freedom of religion, expression and assembly would be 
</p>
<p>protected. According to UNHCR, some observant Muslims (mainly Tatar) and evangelical 
</p>
<p>Christians mentioned fear of religious persecution as a reason for leaving the Autonomous 
</p>
<p>Republic of Crimea.  
</p>
<p><b> IX. Situation of the Roma 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur was made aware of ongoing concerns with regard to the 
</p>
<p>situation of Roma communities in Ukraine. She visited a Roma settlement and consulted 
</p>
<p>widely with Roma representatives. Economic and social marginalization, as well as 
</p>
<p>problems with registration and identity documents, were widely reported by Roma 
</p>
<p>representatives. The Government&#8217;s Strategy on the Protection and Integration of Roma in 
</p>
<p>Ukraine until 2020 as well as the National Action Plan on Roma Inclusion are welcomed 
</p>
<p>and have been drafted with the participation of some Roma organizations. However Roma 
</p>
<p>representatives expressed their concern over their lack of participation in the formulation 
</p>
<p>and monitoring of the Strategy and stated that policies were often inadequately funded and 
</p>
<p>poorly implemented in practice.  
</p>
<p>64. In the context of the tense political situation in March and April 2014, there have 
</p>
<p>been reports of attacks on some Roma communities by armed perpetrators. Despite 
</p>
<p>comments from some Roma that they had previously had good relations in the locality, 
</p>
<p>such incidents were clearly causing anxiety in Roma communities. The European Roma 
</p>
<p>Rights Centre stated that: &#8220;It is evident in the current ongoing political instability in 
</p>
<p>Ukraine that some elements are attempting to target Roma, or to mark Roma as 
</p>
<p>scapegoats&#8221;.28 In the current context of tension and with the reported presence of a number 
</p>
<p>of far-right and extreme nationalist groups in different localities, threats and attacks against 
</p>
<p>Roma communities must be taken extremely seriously, prevented and perpetrators 
</p>
<p>prosecuted where any such acts take place.  
</p>
<p>65. On Friday 18 April 2014, there was an attack on a Roma settlement in the city of 
</p>
<p>Slovyansk, which was largely under the control of pro-Russian illegally armed groups. 
</p>
<p>According to residents, at about 10 p.m. a group of around 20 masked armed people burst 
</p>
<p>into Roma houses, beat residents, including women and children, demanded gold and 
</p>
<p>money and took possessions. The attackers were armed with automatic weapons and fired 
</p>
<p>shots into some homes. On the same day, a Roma family house was reportedly set on fire in 
</p>
<p>Cherkassy following tensions between Roma and non-Roma in the town.29 The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur also received unconfirmed information about alleged threats against Roma by 
</p>
<p>separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk at the end of May, which had reportedly resulted in 60 
</p>
<p>Roma families leaving to seek refuge with families in Lviv and in the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>Such incidents should be immediately investigated. 
</p>
<p>66. One Roma resident of Slovyansk is reported as stating: &#8220;They say they are going to 
</p>
<p>evict the Roma from here. And we don&#8217;t sleep in our houses, because we are afraid 
</p>
<p>someone will come.&#8221;30 On 29 April 2014, a Roma man was shot and seriously injured in 
</p>
<p>Slovyansk while reportedly trying to defend his home from attackers. Roma representatives

</p>
<p>stated that they had alerted authorities about such incidents and called for heightened 
</p>
<p>security, including police patrols of Roma settlements, to protect Roma from further 
</p>
<p>attacks. They urged the affected Roma communities to file complaints about violence or 
</p>
<p>threats although they indicated that the Roma were fearful of doing so given the lack of 
</p>
<p>trust in police forces in some locations. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur visited a Roma community on the outskirts of Kyiv. Over 
</p>
<p>100 people, including more than 60 children, were living on a rubbish tip in basic shelters 
</p>
<p>of wood and tarpaulin. The community scavenged scrap from the site which they sold to 
</p>
<p>local merchants. Community members described their situation, which included a shortage 
</p>
<p>of food and drinking water, and poor sanitation, health and access to health care. None of 
</p>
<p>the children were in school and they were clearly inadequately dressed for the low 
</p>
<p>temperatures. The community members stated that they had travelled from Uzhgorod 
</p>
<p>owing to the lack of work or income-generating opportunities there and in the hope of 
</p>
<p>finding a better situation. The community needs urgent intervention to improve living 
</p>
<p>conditions and ensure the health, well-being and access to education for their children.  
</p>
<p><b> X. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General comments 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Many persons belonging to minorities in Ukraine have strong, distinct 
</b></p>
<p><b>historical, ethnic, religious and linguistic identities that they wish to maintain and 
</b></p>
<p><b>express, as well as strong cultural, economic, social or linguistic connections with kin-
</b></p>
<p><b>States. Their historical and group narratives are frequently heavily influenced by 
</b></p>
<p><b>those ties. Despite previous periods of political and social upheaval since 
</b></p>
<p><b>independence, harmonious relations have endured between different population 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups and equal treatment was described in most areas of life. Many minority 
</b></p>
<p><b>representatives emphasized their minority status while asserting their desire to build 
</b></p>
<p><b>their futures as equal citizens of Ukraine. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>Ukraine is a relatively new independent State, following a long period of 
</b></p>
<p><b>historical Russian linguistic and cultural hegemony. In the current context it should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be recognized that a gradual decline in the influence and extent of a formerly 
</b></p>
<p><b>dominant minority language and culture does not automatically indicate evidence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination or human rights violations. However, while it is legitimate for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government to foster Ukrainian national identity and language, that must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>conducted in a manner which respects, protects and promotes the rights of minorities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sensitivity must be exercised to ensure that no law, policy or programme has 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory intent or effect.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Ukraine has a legislative and policy framework and environment that are 
</b></p>
<p><b>generally consistent with the provisions of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities and that are 
</b></p>
<p><b>generally conducive to the protection of minority rights, including their civil and 
</b></p>
<p><b>political and economic, social and cultural rights.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>As in many States, the infrastructure for minority rights protection requires 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthening and development and complaints by minorities must be addressed 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriately. That should be achieved in full consultation with minorities. It is 
</b></p>
<p><b>essential that any revisions to existing legislation and policy, as well as newly adopted 
</b></p>
<p><b>laws, including relating to the status and use of minority languages, fully conform 
</b></p>
<p><b>with international standards relating to equality, non-discrimination and minority 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/64/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Any revised language law must be carefully considered and sensitively 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressed to ensure that it fully conforms with international standards for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of the linguistic rights of minorities, while equally not undermining the 
</b></p>
<p><b>knowledge and use of Ukrainian. It should not weaken standards previously 
</b></p>
<p><b>established in the 2012 Law</b> <b>on the Principles of the State Language Policy. Steps must 
</b></p>
<p><b>be taken to ensure wide and meaningful consultation, so that the law meets, to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>fullest extent, the rights and expectations of the highly diverse and distinct linguistic 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities of Ukraine.</b>  
</p>
<p><b>  Minority rights in the context of political and social unrest since 
</b></p>
<p><b>February 2014 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>While recognizing the concerns of minorities, the Special Rapporteur considers 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the current human and minority rights situation and the civil and political, 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic, social and cultural conditions experienced by minorities cannot justify any 
</b></p>
<p><b>violent actions or incitement and support of those actions by any party, national or 
</b></p>
<p><b>international. The majority of the population of Ukraine, irrespective of national 
</b></p>
<p><b>origin, ethnicity or language, wishes for a peaceful and united Ukraine, rich in its 
</b></p>
<p><b>ethnic and linguistic diversity and confident in its future security and stability.</b>  
</p>
<p>74. <b>Developments in early 2014 have created an environment of uncertainty and 
</b></p>
<p><b>distrust that may create fractures along national, ethnic and linguistic lines and which 
</b></p>
<p><b>threaten peaceful coexistence if not quickly resolved. In some localities, tension has 
</b></p>
<p><b>spilled over into conflict. Such tensions must be diffused as a matter of urgency. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>radical nationalist objectives of a limited number of individuals or groups should not 
</b></p>
<p><b>be allowed to dictate the future of Ukraine. Protection of human rights and minorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>relies on the rule of law, which must be quickly re-established and upheld in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>locations.</b>  
</p>
<p>75. <b>Good and inclusive governance is essential for the effective management of 
</b></p>
<p><b>diversity. The current crisis, although framed by some as an inter-ethnic dispute 
</b></p>
<p><b>between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian factions, has been partially caused by wider 
</b></p>
<p><b>political and economic factors that must be recognized and addressed in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>avoid further ethnic, regional and political polarization. A historic good governance 
</b></p>
<p><b>deficit, widespread corruption and mismanagement of resources have contributed to a 
</b></p>
<p><b>lack of trust in political institutions and actors and significantly contributed to 
</b></p>
<p><b>instability.</b>  
</p>
<p>76. <b>The situation of minority communities in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including Crimean Tatars, ethnic Ukrainians and other potentially vulnerable groups, 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be monitored closely. The United Nations human rights monitoring mission 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other international monitors should be allowed unfettered access to the Republic 
</b></p>
<p><b>at the earliest opportunity. They should engage with both de facto authorities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>diverse civil society and community actors to assess the extent to which human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards, including minority rights, are being upheld in practice.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that, even in situations of territorial dispute or 
</b></p>
<p><b>occupation, the full spectrum of human rights of minorities must be respected, 
</b></p>
<p><b>protected and promoted without discrimination by the de facto authorities. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Those displaced from the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and other locations 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be provided with all necessary</b> <b>short, medium and long-term support. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Mechanisms of possible return to their homes, compensation for loss of property, or 
</b></p>
<p><b>restitution of property and land should be considered. All relevant authorities must 
</b></p>
<p><b>take measures to reduce or prevent further displacement, including through </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/64/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20 </b> 
</p>
<p><b>implementation of human and minority rights standards. The possibility for IDPs to 
</b></p>
<p><b>return voluntarily to their places of origin with assurances for their security should 
</b></p>
<p><b>remain a key objective. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>It is essential to begin a process of national dialogue with the objective of 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding the concerns and issues of all communities and ensuring that they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressed appropriately and rapidly. Moderate voices must come to the fore. First 
</b></p>
<p><b>and foremost, solutions to the current situation must come from the Ukrainian people 
</b></p>
<p><b>themselves. That must be achieved through decision-making processes that are 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusive and which respect diversity and political structures that ensure the 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation of all, including minorities.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Hate speech and incitement to hatred, hostility or violence targeted at any 
</b></p>
<p><b>person or group must not be tolerated. Political and community leaders should be the 
</b></p>
<p><b>first to condemn any such statements and to send a clear message that they will be 
</b></p>
<p><b>treated as criminal acts, punishable by law. Those elements on any side engaging in or 
</b></p>
<p><b>inciting violence or hatred must be prosecuted. They should have no role in shaping 
</b></p>
<p><b>the future of Ukraine, nor should they be allowed to impose their will through the use 
</b></p>
<p><b>of violence or force. All non-official and illegally armed groups should be disarmed 
</b></p>
<p><b>and disbanded.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Freedom of expression, assembly and the right to protest peacefully must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>protected even in times of political unrest and must only be restricted under 
</b></p>
<p><b>exceptional circumstances. All relevant authorities must uphold those rights for all. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Violent protest, the forced or armed occupation of public buildings or territories, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>formation of armed militia groups and activities to intimidate, threaten or coerce are 
</b></p>
<p><b>not legitimate in a democratic society and should be addressed according to the law 
</b></p>
<p><b>and international standards.  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that all journalists should be free to conduct 
</b></p>
<p><b>their work in safety and without threat of detention or violence and that the freedom

<p><b>of the media must be protected. Censorship of media should be used only as a last 
</b></p>
<p><b>resort and any restrictions on the media and freedom of expression must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>legitimate, proportionate and in conformity with international standards. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned over media coverage that 
</b></p>
<p><b>was frequently cited as misrepresenting the situation and serving to fuel tensions. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Governments and media outlets have a responsibility to convey information 
</b></p>
<p><b>accurately and objectively and to avoid any propaganda or misinformation which 
</b></p>
<p><b>may incite unrest or violence.</b>  
</p>
<p>83. <b>The rights of religious minorities are protected in practice. However, given the 
</b></p>
<p><b>climate of political and social unease, it is particularly necessary for the authorities to 
</b></p>
<p><b>guard against any human rights violations, including against Crimean Tatars and 
</b></p>
<p><b>members of Jewish communities. Acts of anti-Semitism, hate speech, violence, 
</b></p>
<p><b>intimidation, threat or abuse targeted at individuals or groups based on their religion 
</b></p>
<p><b>or belief must not be tolerated. All relevant authorities have an obligation to act 
</b></p>
<p><b>swiftly to protect all religious groups in all localities, their places of worship, 
</b></p>
<p><b>monuments and burial sites, particularly during periods of heightened tension, and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecute the perpetrators of violations against them. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur was struck by the many actors who have demonstrated 
</b></p>
<p><b>national unity, solidarity and dialogue across different population groups to ensure a 
</b></p>
<p><b>peaceful resolution to the crisis. Different faith and community groups have reached 
</b></p>
<p><b>across religious and ethnic divides to offer support and assistance to those affected by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the current situation, including those who have been displaced, and some of those with 
</b></p>
<p><b>different political views have sought reconciliation. Political, religious and community </b></p>

<p><b>leaders are urged to use their influence to promote dialogue and encourage peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>solutions to tensions.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Strengthening minority rights protection 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur considers that additional measures are required to 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen minority rights protection. Considering the great diversity of population 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups and the sensitivity of minority issues in the independent, post-Soviet era, 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutional attention to minority issues is currently insufficient and has been 
</b></p>
<p><b>downgraded in recent years. Mechanisms to register complaints and seek solutions are 
</b></p>
<p><b>currently insufficient. At the time of the Special Rapporteur</b>&#8217;s<b> visit, there were only six 
</b></p>
<p><b>staff members within the Ministry of Culture with direct responsibility for minority 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues. The Government must recognize the wider scope of minority rights that 
</b></p>
<p><b>includes but goes beyond cultural issues, and ensure appropriate ministerial-level 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention to minority issues.</b>  
</p>
<p>86. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes Government assurances that measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen institutional attention to minority issues are being developed. She 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends the establishment of a consultative and advisory body on minority issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>with frequent and regular sessions, empowered to consider a wide range of matters of 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevance to minorities, including problems of minority languages and education, 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious affairs, and measures to address practically and prevent ethnic tensions from 
</b></p>
<p><b>emerging. A dedicated Ombudsperson or similar structure mandated to address 
</b></p>
<p><b>minority issues and receive complaints from minorities should also be considered.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>A key pillar of minority rights is full and equal participation in public life, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including political participation at the national, regional and local levels. Full access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>democratic structures is critical for minorities to voice their concerns and to achieve 
</b></p>
<p><b>meaningful solutions to their issues. Measures are necessary to strengthen the political 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation of minorities and guarantee their full involvement in decision-making 
</b></p>
<p><b>bodies.</b>  
</p>
<p>88. <b>Policies to guarantee representation of minorities in Parliament include 
</b></p>
<p><b>reserved seats or the redrawing of electoral districts to allow compact minority 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities to elect their own representatives, and should be considered. Measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>increase political and cultural autonomy for some localities with large minority 
</b></p>
<p><b>populations may be considered, where appropriate and in full consultation with all 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities affected. The Special Rapporteur urges consideration of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations of the Forum on Minority Issues which addressed minorities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective political participation during its second session.</b>31 
</p>
<p>89. <b>In many countries, autonomous arrangements have been established and are 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate taking into account specific circumstances, including where a national 
</b></p>
<p><b>minority forms a high percentage of the population in a region. However, the nature 
</b></p>
<p><b>and extent of that autonomy should be established in conformity with national law 
</b></p>
<p><b>and international standards and through democratic, legal and consultative 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms and constructive dialogue which takes fully into account the views of 
</b></p>
<p><b>minorities and all affected communities, including ethnic Ukrainians who might 
</b></p>
<p><b>constitute a minority in affected regions.

<p><b>identity. The Government and all political parties must uphold the highest standards 
</b></p>
<p><b>with regard to the banning of statements and political platforms that promote racism, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia or hate speech, or which are intended to incite ethnic, religious or other 
</b></p>
<p><b>forms of hatred or intolerance. Any such actions should be prosecuted according to

<p><b>their commitment to minority rights protection and the Declaration on the Rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities.</b>  
</p>
<p>91. <b>Educational curricula should reflect the diversity of Ukraine and enable 
</b></p>
<p><b>students to learn about their own origins, cultures and religions, but also those of 
</b></p>
<p><b>others, in a positive way that recognizes the contributions of all groups to society. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Minority and mother-tongue schools, while legitimately maintaining minority 
</b></p>
<p><b>languages and cultures, should also be required to provide education on the wider 
</b></p>
<p><b>ethnic, national, social and religious make-up of society. The national curriculum 
</b></p>
<p><b>should include education on active citizenship.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Government should take additional measures, including providing 
</b></p>
<p><b>financial and institutional support, for minorities to establish cultural and advocacy 
</b></p>
<p><b>associations and maintain and enhance their activities. While there are now an 
</b></p>
<p><b>increasing number of civil society organizations, further strengthening of civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>is needed so that minorities can enhance cultural activities as well as jointly formulate 
</b></p>
<p><b>and convey important messages and establish and maintain dialogue with various 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Religious and Linguistic Minorities (art. 5) calls for programmes of cooperation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance among States with due regard for the legitimate interests of minorities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Article 6 requires States to cooperate on questions relating to minorities in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote mutual understanding and confidence. Under article 7, States should 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperate to promote respect for the rights set forth in the Declaration. States with 
</b></p>
<p><b>large diaspora communities are urged to take all possible steps to promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>reconciliation and to defuse tensions where they exist. They must avoid actions that 
</b></p>
<p><b>undermine confidence or incite, fuel or support violent or separatist movements on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the part of minorities.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>There has been an apparent escalation of anti-Roma sentiment and of incidents 
</b></p>
<p><b>of violence and intimidation directed towards Roma in the context of the 2014 political 
</b></p>
<p><b>unrest. All relevant authorities should ensure adequate protection of Roma 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities and that any incidents of violence and intimidation are fully and speedily 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigated and perpetrators prosecuted. Authorities should ensure that current and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ongoing political instability is not used by any party as an opportunity to attack or 
</b></p>
<p><b>intimidate Roma or forcefully remove them.</b>  
</p>
<p>95. <b>In the medium to long term, more robust responses from the Government are 
</b></p>
<p><b>required to address Roma exclusion, marginalization and poverty. Measures should 
</b></p>
<p><b>include an institutional, policy and programme framework, created with the full 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation of Roma, that is adequately financed and politically supported to tackle 
</b></p>
<p><b>the long-term challenges that many Roma experience.</b> 
</p>
<p>96. <b>The most recent census was conducted in 2001. The absence of accurate 
</b></p>
<p><b>demographic and socioeconomic data constitutes a serious challenge to ensuring 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of minority rights. Accurate data will reveal the current picture of national,

<p><b>ethnic, religious and linguistic groups and provide key socioeconomic information, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in relation to such issues as language and identity. Such data, including

<p><b>respondents to self-identify according to their national, ethnic, religious and linguistic 
</b></p>
<p><b>affiliation, including multiple identities. Ensuring accurate data for the most
