<p>1. We welcome this opportunity for national reflection and stocktaking on the 
collective efforts of Belize to promote, deepen and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>2. Arising from the UPR process were one hundred and three (103) recommendations 
of which we supported 59.  As noted in Belize&#8217;s concluding Statement to the Working 
Group of the Universal Periodic Review, in November, 2013, there were 44 
recommendations that required further consultation at the national level. 
</p>
<p>3. In this regard, the Government of Belize has reviewed the 44 recommendations and 
is pleased to report that Belize accepts a total of 6 recommendations in whole or in part.  
We have noted 29 recommendations in full or in part and which will remain under review.  
We are unable to support 11 recommendations in whole or in part.  The 44 
recommendations have been grouped under support, note and reject.
