  The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its twenty-third session (A/HRC/23/2), chap. I. 
 
</p>

<p><i>Bearing</i> <i>in mind</i> that international human rights treaties, including the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender and include guarantees 
to ensure the enjoyment by women and men, and girls and boys, of their civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights on a basis of equality, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the full participation of women in all spheres of life, on an equal 
basis with men, is essential for the full and complete economic, political and social 
development of a country,  
</p>
<p><i>Mindful</i> <i>of the fact</i> that the elimination of discrimination against women and girls 
requires the consideration of their specific socioeconomic context, and recognizing that 
laws, policies, customs and traditions that restrict their equal access to full participation in 
development processes and public and political life are discriminatory, and that the non-
participation of women in decision-making contributes to the feminization of poverty and 
hampers sustainable development and economic growth, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful also</i> that women and girls account for more than half of the world 
population, that equal rights and opportunities are key factors in achieving sustainable 
economic, political and social development and lasting solutions to global challenges, and 
that gender equality benefits women, men, girls and boys and society as a whole, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing</i> <i>in mind</i> the challenges still faced by all countries throughout the world to 
overcome inequality between men and women,  
</p>
<p><i>Reiterating</i> the need to intensify efforts to eliminate all forms of discrimination 
against women and girls throughout the world, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> by the fact that stigmatization, harassment and various forms of 
violence against women, including targeted attacks and sexual violence, have been used to 
silence and discredit women engaging in political and public life, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> <i>and deeply regretting</i> that many women and girls face multiple forms 
of discrimination and are still subject to significant disadvantage as the result of 
discriminatory laws and practices, and that de jure and de facto equality has not been 
achieved,  
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the work undertaken by the United Nations Entity for Gender 
Equality and the Empowerment of Women, the Commission on the Status of Women, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the special procedures 
mandate holders of the Human Rights Council and other relevant United Nations bodies, 
agencies and mechanisms to eliminate discrimination in law and in practice throughout the 
world, and noting the work undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that gender responsiveness is an essential part of the role played by 
national human rights institutions as established by the principles relating to the status of 
national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles) 
adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/134 of 20 December 1993, 
</p>
<p><i>Considering</i> that periods of political transition provide a unique opportunity to 
advance women&#8217;s equal participation and representation in economic, political and social 
spheres but can also raise challenges in that regard, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the 
Council, and 5/2, on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the 
Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, </p>

it, in the discharge of its mandate, to maintain such an approach and dialogue with States to 
address the elimination of discrimination against women in law and in practice in all 
spheres from the perspective of States&#8217; obligations under international human rights law, 
taking into account the good practices that have been transformative in different contexts 
and in the light of the different realities that women face; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Affirms</i> that realizing human rights in political and public life requires the 
effective and meaningful participation of women in all aspects of political and public life, 
on an equal footing with men;  
</p>
<p>4. <i>Calls upon</i> States to include, as appropriate, special or positive action 
measures to achieve gender equality in political and public life as part of a comprehensive 
system-wide approach of non-discrimination and equality of opportunity and treatment;

<p>5. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to take concrete steps towards eliminating all forms of 
discrimination against women and girls, directed to achieve gender equality at all levels of 
political and public decision-making processes, particularly during times of political 
transition, and to engage women in State-building and peace and security issues; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Further calls upon</i> States to promote reforms and implement legal 
frameworks and policies directed towards achieving equality and the elimination of all 
forms of discrimination against women and girls, including nationality laws;  
</p>
<p>7. <i>Urges States</i> to support the creation of enabling conditions for public 
recognition and acceptance for all women in leadership and decision-making positions by,

multicultural settings and developing a bottom-up approach to building democratic and 
accountable relations between State and society;  
</p>
<p>8. <i>Calls upon</i> States to promote the rights of women and girls and to support 
their empowerment by adopting, as appropriate, a coherent set of gender-responsive social 
and economic policies directed at the family, the workplace and the marketplace, and by 
addressing poverty and social exclusion in order to overcome the structural barriers and 
inequalities they face and to thereby ensure their long-term and sustainable participation in 
political and public life;  
</p>
<p>9. <i>Stresses</i> the need to accelerate efforts to eliminate all forms of violence 
against women and girls in political and public life, including by working towards a 
comprehensive national legal framework to combat impunity and by guaranteeing access to 
appropriate civil remedies and redress, and taking into account multiple, intersecting and 
aggravated forms of discrimination;  
</p>
<p>10. <i>Reaffirms</i> the importance of the right to education as key to the 
empowerment of women and girls and for ensuring equality and non-discrimination;  
</p>
<p>11. <i>Calls upon</i> States to support and enhance women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; equal 
participation in political and public life by improving their digital literacy and their access 
to information and communications technologies and to the global governance of such 
technologies, including through international cooperation and within their national 
capabilities; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>12. <i>Recommends</i> that States collect data, prepare statistics disaggregated by sex 
and conduct multidisciplinary research reflecting the whole spectrum of women&#8217;s 
engagement in society in order to contribute to overcoming the knowledge gap that exists at 
the local, national and global levels regarding their participation in political and public life;  
</p>
<p>13. <i>Calls upon</i> States to support the work of national human rights institutions 
and specialized mechanisms for women&#8217;s human rights and gender equality by improving 
their resources, as appropriate;  
</p>
<p>14. <i>Recognizes</i> that the work done by civil society organizations, in particular 
independent women&#8217;s civil society organizations, is crucial to promoting full equality in all 
aspects of political and public life and eliminating violence against women, including 
women human rights defenders, and therefore that they require support for their 
sustainability and growth;  
</p>
<p>15. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Working Group on the issue of 
discrimination against women in law and in practice for a period of three years on the same 
terms as provided for by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 15/23;  
</p>
<p>16. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to cooperate with and assist the Working Group in its 
task, to supply all necessary available information requested by it and to give serious 
consideration to responding favourably to its requests to visit their country to enable it to 
fulfil its mandate effectively; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Calls upon</i> States and urges institutions of global governance, including the 
United Nations, to promote women&#8217;s equal access to decision-making positions and 
processes, and encourages them to appoint and promote women staff members in order to 
guarantee women&#8217;s equal participation; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Invites</i> relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, treaty 
bodies and civil society actors, including non-governmental organizations, as well as the 
private sector, to cooperate fully with the Working Group in the fulfilment of its mandate, 
and requests the Working Group to continue its cooperation with the Commission on the 
Status of Women;  
</p>
<p>19. <i>Requests</i> the Working Group to continue to work on its thematic priorities, 
namely, political and public life, economic and social life, family and cultural life, and 
health and safety, and to dedicate specific attention to good practices that have contributed 
to mobilizing society as a whole, including men and boys, in the elimination of 
discrimination against women;  
</p>
<p>20. <i>Takes note </i>of the intention of the Working Group to focus its next report on 
the issue of discrimination against women in law and in practice in economic and social 
life, including in times of economic crisis, with specific attention to the way in which 
current and past economic crises have affected women&#8217;s access to economic and social 
resources, as well as policies that effectively protect women&#8217;s social and economic status 
during and after economic crises;  
</p>
<p>21. <i>Requests</i> the Working Group, in the discharge of its mandate, to offer support 
to States&#8217; initiatives to address multiple forms of discrimination against women and girls 
when implementing their obligations as State parties to relevant international human rights
