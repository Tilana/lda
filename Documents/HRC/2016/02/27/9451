 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p>The independent expert on technical cooperation and advisory services in Liberia 
undertook two missions to Liberia in 2006, from 20 to 26 February and from 13 to 
23 November 2006.  There were a number of positive developments in the year, but the failure to 
effectively tackle some critical human rights issues in the period, and especially those affecting 
the most marginalized and vulnerable in society, must also be highlighted. 
</p>
<p>The year 2006 commenced with the enactment in January of amended rape legislation 
which sought to give greater legal protection to victims.  The act provides for a broader 
definition of rape, creation of the offence of gang rape and also provides that there should be a 
presumption against bail in the case of those accused of first-degree rape.  While this legislation 
should be revisited and revised, it is encouraging to see that the proper legislative framework is 
being put in place.  The enactment of legislation to prohibit female genital mutilation must also 
be a priority for the authorities in the coming year. 
</p>
<p>However, the failure by both the Liberian National Police and the courts to properly 
implement this crucial piece of legislation on sexual crimes has left victims - women, girls, men 
and boys - without any effective protection or remedy.  This also gave rise in the past year to the 
widespread practice of out-of-court settlements by victims and their parents with the alleged 
perpetrators.  The impotence of the justice system combined with the prevailing dire social and 
economic conditions gave rise to this phenomenon, which is essentially a form of impunity. 
</p>
<p>Another promising start last year was the inauguration in February 2006 of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which was then launched in June.  This is to be one of the 
major mechanisms for national healing and reconciliation and indeed the commission started its 
first public activity in October with the statement-taking process.  The Government of Liberia 
has been supportive of this process at all stages and has provided substantial funding. 
</p>
<p>However, at the time of writing, TRC is not, in the view of the independent expert, in a 
position to proceed with public hearings as scheduled because the basic administrative and 
technical procedures have not been put in place.  The functioning of TRC and the competence of 
the Commission must be reviewed as a matter of urgency. 
</p>
<p>The failure to respect, protect and fulfil economic and social rights throughout the 
country, and particularly for workers on the rubber plantations, makes daily life for the citizens 
of Liberia a constant struggle.  The Government has made efforts to restore limited basic 
services to parts of Monrovia and it is encouraging that the basic principle that there can be no 
sustainable development without good governance is at the centre of the anti-corruption 
strategies being implemented.  It is too early to comment on the success or otherwise of such 
strategies but the implementation of the Governance and Economic Management Assistance 
Programme (GEMAP), which aims to strengthen public financial management, is a promising 
start.  The effective implementation of a national anti-corruption strategy with a powerful 
anti-corruption commission is needed. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p> The human rights challenges facing Liberian society on all fronts - civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural - are enormous.  While the authorities have demonstrated good will 
to progress on several issues, the slow progress and lack of effective implementation is due to 
several factors, including lack of capacity, competence and funds.  The international community 
has a duty to assist the national authorities but the Government must lead the way by putting in 
place concrete and targeted measures. 
</p>
<p> The key recommendations of the independent expert are that: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Judges and prosecutors from outside of Liberia should be engaged to work as 
mentors.  This is a necessary step to address some of the existing deficiencies in the 
administration of justice; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The Law Faculty at the University of Liberia should be rehabilitated and strengthened 
and that scholarships should be offered to law graduates to do their postgraduate 
studies in the United States of America.  In particular, positive discrimination should 
be exercised so that more female students are attracted to the practice of law; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; An amendment to the Constitution allowing all international treaties to become part 
of domestic law should be proposed by the Government; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Discriminatory and offensive legislation such as the &#8220;Hinterland Regulations&#8221; should 
be repealed immediately. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  DEVELOPMENTS SINCE 2005 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Security situation 
</b></p>
<p>1. By the time of the second report of the independent expert on technical cooperation and 
advisory services in Liberia (E/CN.4/2006/114), the security situation in general had greatly 
improved.  The Liberian National Police (LNP) is deployed in all counties, as are 
superintendents.  The establishment of local administrations is thus complete.  Circuit courts are 
now established in all counties, though the absence of defence counsel in some counties hampers 
their proper functioning. 
</p>
<p>2. The high incidence of sexual assault throughout the country, however, reflects the 
weakness of the LNP, its inability to adequately police these areas and highlights the urgent need 
to strengthen the competence and capacity of this branch of the security forces.  Providing 
security for its citizens is a fundamental obligation of the State and all necessary assistance 
should be given to the State to ensure it is able to discharge this obligation. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
</b></p>
<p>3. The establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was provided for in 
the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in Accra in 2003.  The required national legislation 
establishing TRC, the Act to Establish the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Liberia 
(TRC Act), was passed and signed into law in June 2005.  The nomination and selection process 
for the nine national commissioners commenced that August and TRC was inaugurated in 
February 2006.  The ceremonial launch was held in June 2006. 
</p>
<p>4. The Government of Liberia has led this process by providing US$ 1.4 million in the first 
year (1 per cent of the national budget) for TRC.  The international community has matched this 
contribution.  Funding will be the major challenge in the years ahead and the timely allotment of 
monies will be critical to effective action.  The full establishment of a secretariat for TRC is 
urgent, so that commissioners do not have to involve themselves with administrative issues and 
can concentrate on policy matters.  The international community also has a key role to play in 
providing technical advice and expertise. 
</p>
<p>5. However, there is serious concern that there appears to be a lack of coordination within 
the commission on programming and activities.  The timely elaboration of well conceived 
programmes and a budget will influence the willingness of donors to make funds available in the 
future.  The disharmony between the commissioners themselves and also with the members of 
the International Technical Advisory Committee (ITAC) is leading to an incomplete 
implementation of the TRC Act.  This has also resulted in a failure to address some critical 
issues such as sensitization of both the general public and civil society organizations.  The 
Commission&#8217;s outreach efforts to introduce and explain its work to the public will determine its 
impact and the support of an active and effective civil society.  While they will remain 
independent, these organizations can make valuable contributions to the work of the 
commission.  Such groups must also monitor activities of the commission and provide honest 
feedback on progress. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6. There is also an urgent need to establish an information management system for storing 
and analysing statements and other information received in the statement-taking process that 
commenced in October 2006.  A number of aspects of the statement-taking process were heavily 
criticized by interlocutors.  The absence of any apparent mechanism to protect the guarantee of 
confidentiality or forms of protection to be provided to victims, perpetrators and statement-takers 
was highlighted.  A number of interlocutors questioned the effectiveness of the vetting process.  
The need to incorporate a gender perspective into this exercise was emphasized so that the 
participation of women could be facilitated and they would be encouraged to provide statements. 
</p>
<p>7. This situation needs to be addressed urgently, as an effective TRC can play a central role 
at this time of transition and in the ongoing reconciliation efforts being undertaken in Liberia.  
The elaboration of clear terms of reference for the ITAC members together with the 
establishment of an effective secretariat would contribute to the effective and efficient running of 
this institution. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Independent National Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>8. The enabling legislation for this body, which was drafted following nationwide 
consultations and with the technical support of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), 
was signed into law in March 2005.  It will have a broad mandate that includes making 
recommendations to the Government on the prevailing human rights situation.  The appointment 
of commissioners of integrity, experience and skill to serve on this body is of utmost importance.  
It is to be hoped that this selection process can be completed as soon as possible, and that the 
experience gained in the establishment of TRC will be taken into account.  At the time of writing 
a list of 11 names had been submitted to the President by the nominating body for possible 
appointment. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE LEGISLATURE 
</b></p>
<p>9. The heads of parliamentary subcommittees admitted to a lack of knowledge and 
awareness of the TRC process.  They would welcome a workshop on TRC, and in their role as 
parliamentarians, would be anxious to see that the terms of the Act are being respected.  They 
could also play an important role in dissemination of information among their constituents.  The 
progress to date by the commission, which was due to complete the statement-taking process in 
January 2007, was an issue of concern.  The point was strongly made that an evaluation of the 
international role in the conflict should also be undertaken so that a full understanding of events 
could be obtained. 
</p>
<p>10. In relation to the enforcement of the Rape Law, a shortage of lawyers, and specifically of 
prosecutors, was identified as a possible impediment to implementation.  The potential for 
recruiting lawyers from private practice to conduct prosecutions, as an interim measure, was 
raised.  The parliamentarians agreed that they have a definite oversight responsibility on this 
issue and would move towards a more proactive approach.  The legislature is also taking steps to 
join the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), which it sees as an important avenue for strengthening 
its capacity and professionalism. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  LEGAL REFORM AND RULE OF LAW 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Review of national legislation 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Minister for Justice reported that draft legislation for the creation of a Law Reform 
Commission was before Parliament and was to be considered early in 2007.  The establishment 
of such a body was envisaged by the Government&#8217;s 150-day Action Plan and a task force had 
been constituted. 
</p>
<p>12. A comprehensive review of both the Constitution and national legislation ensuring 
respect for the provisions of international human rights law should then be undertaken.  This 
work will be facilitated by the legal audit recently completed by the Human Rights and 
Protection Section of UNMIL. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The Liberian justice system 
</b>13. New legislation on the autonomy of the judiciary goes some way to ensuring its 
independence.  Funding will now be guaranteed on a quarterly basis.  The repeated allegations of 
judicial corruption continue to undermine the credibility of this area of government.  In addition, 
negligence of judicial personnel in performing their duties has resulted in cases not being heard.  
The appointment of a Supreme Court justice to head a conduct committee that will decide on 
disciplinary matters will also go some way to enforcing the code of conduct.  Article 71 of the 
Constitution provides that judges may be removed upon impeachment by the legislature on the 
grounds of proven misconduct and gross breach of duty.  Recent steps taken by the Chief Justice 
towards improving the professionalism and quality of work of the judiciary deserve to be 
supported. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Ending impunity for past and present crimes 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Liberian criminal justice system is not, for the various reasons mentioned above, in a 
position to respond to ongoing human rights violations and abuses.  This is particularly true in 
the area of gender-based violence which appears to be on the increase.  Police misconduct in the 
execution of their duties was a repeated theme in discussions with local actors.  The 
mistreatment of those being arrested and detained highlights the need for greater training on the 
code of conduct and rules on the use of force. 
</p>
<p>15. Some progress has been made in restructuring, and strengthening the capacity of 
LNP:  2,214 officers have now graduated from the police academy in Monrovia and the target 
remains 3,500 trained officers by July 2007.  Nonetheless, there remain serious challenges to an 
effective LNP, primarily in relation to logistics.  The need for a communications system and 
increased mobility are critical elements which need to be addressed.  Any restructuring and 
strengthening of LNP must be accompanied by a parallel improvement in the functioning of the 
judiciary.  To fail in the latter would be to do a disservice to the new officers and negate to a 
large degree their effectiveness in the fight against crime. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Rape Law 
</b></p>
<p>16. The amended Rape Law (An Act to Amend the New Penal Code, chapter 14, 
sections 1470-1471, and to Provide for Gang Rape), the drafting of which international NGOs 
and United Nations agencies had participated in an effort to ensure that international standards 
were observed, entered into force on 17 January 2006.  However, a combination of a weak 
judiciary and a lack of awareness among the populace is resulting in weak implementation of this 
vital legislation.  While the law provides for stronger penalties for rape and includes the specific 
crime of gang-rape, there are reports that clear evidence is being rejected in court and that 
provisions of the Act are not being respected. 
</p>
<p>17. The reported high incidence of out-of-court settlements in these cases is particularly 
worrying.  While there are socio-economic considerations involved in such a decision, this trend 
is bolstered by both the delay in the hearing of cases and the lack of implementation mentioned 
above.  The Chief Justice assured the independent expert that he was taking all measures to 
ensure that such unwarranted delays in these cases did not occur; one court was now to be 
dedicated to conducting such hearings. 
</p>
<p>18. The failure of the law to address rape by juveniles is one glaring deficiency in the new 
law which, it is hoped, will be reviewed by the Law Reform Commission. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Human rights on rubber plantations 
</b></p>
<p>19. The independent expert visited the Guthrie Plantation, which was repossessed by the 
Government of Liberia, on 15 August 2006.  An Interim Management team had been put in place 
and a formalized purchase process was being gradually established.  A total of 1,500 workers 
had been employed, including many ex-combatants.  Basic social amenities, particularly 
hospitals, schools, and clean drinking water, are being supplied.  The rehabilitation of these 
social services for the community is facilitated by the much improved security situation, which is 
monitored by 12 Liberian National Police and 92 UNMIL troops.  There are approximately 
36,000 inhabitants on the plantation, and UNMIL facilitated the voluntary return of families of 
ex-combatants to their home counties at the time of the takeover. 
</p>
<p>20. The rubber plantations represent a major source of wealth for the Liberian economy and 
Guthrie Plantation alone is estimated to have generated up to US$ 908,000 between January to 
June 2005.  The situation on this plantation must continue to be monitored.  Serious concerns 
remain regarding the protection of human rights in the remaining major plantations - Firestone, 
Liberian Agricultural Company (LAC), Salala, Cavalla, Cocopa and Sinoe.  The implementation 
of the recommendations of the Rubber Plantation Task Force is a matter of urgency as the poor 
living and working conditions on these plantations must be addressed and the rule of law must be 
restored. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Human rights of women 
</b></p>
<p>21. The incidence of gender-based violence combined with a lack of implementation of the 
applicable legislation is a serious concern.  Domestic violence and harmful traditional practices 
are not being addressed and the non-implementation of the above-mentioned Rape Law means 
that discrimination against women continues unabated.  The fact that no redress is available often 
leads to the unfortunate practice of out-of-court settlements in cases of rape.  The Association of 
Female Lawyers, the only NGO providing free advice and representation for women and 
children, is undertaking an assessment of the implementation of the Rape Law, which should be 
available in the next year.  To date the Association has been very much Monrovia-based; it is to 
be hoped that their much-needed assistance will soon be available in the interior of the country. 
</p>
<p>22. The establishment of a woman and child unit at police stations is, however, a very 
welcome development.  This unit is only present in three counties but the stated intention is that 
these should be established across the country.  Such a unit is now automatically installed where 
stations are refurbished or to be constructed.  UNICEF is providing the training for the staff 
though there are difficulties in this area.  Many trained staff have been deactivated in the 
downsizing exercise while the command and control structure in many stations is weak. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Human rights of children 
</b></p>
<p>23. The ratification of International Labour Organization Convention No. 182 (1999), which 
prohibits the most dangerous forms of child labour, obliges Liberia to take steps to eliminate 
such practices.  The Ministry of Labour has assured that legislation is being drafted to give effect 
to these provisions in domestic law.  It is hoped that the current situation, in which children are 
employed in their hundreds throughout the country in quarries, and engage in rock crushing and 
transport activities, can be resolved.  Poverty also forces children, who are selling goods at 
market for their parents, to engage in commercial sex to supplement their incomes. 
</p>
<p>24. An assessment of reintegration of ex-combatants shows that assimilation of child soldiers 
has been successful, with only 5 per cent maintaining contact with their former commanders.  
Furthermore, 70 per cent are now attending school. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>25. The progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights, as required under the 
International Covenant, which was ratified by Liberia and entered into force in 2004, continues 
to pose major challenges.  The lack of infrastructure and resources to implement projects is a 
source of great concern.  The crippling Liberian debt, which is the highest per capita debt in the 
world, is another concern.  Due consideration should be given to a debt relief programme so that 
Liberia can be freed from accumulating debt. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  The right to work, fair remuneration and regular payment of wages 
</b></p>
<p>26. The commitment of the Ministry of Labour to a comprehensive labour reform 
programme and the ongoing consultation process with all stakeholders is an encouraging 
development.  The fact that there is social dialogue among workers, managers and the 
Government and that the latter is to invite the workers&#8217; union as an observer to the minimum </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>wage board is a positive development.  The payment of salaries for government employees is 
now being made on a more regular basis than before and in fact the paymaster is now travelling 
out to the counties to make payments to local staff. 
</p>
<p>27. However, the general situation is one of concern as there is 80 per cent unemployment 
and non-payment of salaries in the private sector continues to be a problem.  The Ministry of 
Labour plans to create 12,000 additional jobs by March 2007, primarily in the agricultural sector, 
and there is a great need to concentrate on labour intensive industries. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The rights to physical and mental health 
</b></p>
<p>28. The existence of many illegal and privately run orphanages is a major concern.  The 
system to date has lent itself to exploitation of children and families.  The publication of draft 
minimum standards for operating orphanages in Liberia by the Ministry of Health and Social 
Welfare, after a consultative process involving the Child Protection Network Task Force, is a 
major step forward and the speedy adoption of these guidelines is now urgently required.  The 
Ministry, in coordination with the Child Protection Network, has established a list of over 
60 orphanages for closure and arrangements are being put in place for the placement of those 
children whose parents cannot be traced and in whose case reunification is not possible.  The 
Minister for Social Welfare reported that any closures have to be carefully coordinated with the 
Ministry of Justice, as past attempts had failed, following legal challenges.  The matter has 
become very politicized and the legislature has frequently called on her office for explanations in 
relation to specific closures.  However, the Minister assured us that as soon as the documentation 
was finalized further closures would commence.  A visit to one such unaccredited orphanage, 
which housed 61 children in totally inadequate and substandard conditions, was described to the 
Minister. 
</p>
<p>29. In relation to the general health system, it is reported that there has been no progress on 
maternal and infant mortality since the last report.  The rate of tuberculosis is in fact on the 
increase and this development may well be related to the incidence of HIV/AIDS.  The Ministry 
reports that education on HIV has in fact been sporadic to date and recent acceptance of the 
proposal for funding under the Global Fund was warmly welcomed. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The right to education 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Government has attempted to introduce free primary education this school term.  
Principals may no longer levy school fees but a campaign to sensitize parents to the new system 
is needed.  The Ministry of Education has supplied stationery but some concern was raised that 
the funds for school materials and maintenance are not being fully replaced by the State.  
Considerable financial assistance to the State is required in this area.  It was decided not to 
require primary education to be compulsory at this stage as neither the necessary infrastructure 
nor an adequate number of facilities are in place. 
</p>
<p>31. A national policy on the education of the girl child, which acknowledges the need to 
establish sustainable measures to address gender inequality in the education sector, was first 
published in 2005.  The Ministry of Education recognized the need to establish proactive</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>measures to accelerate the presence of girls in the educational system.  Furthermore, there are 
three regulatory bodies for the implementation of these education policies at local level.  
However, progress has been slow due to a combination of cultural/traditional attitudes and the 
lack of resources within the Ministry. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  WORKSHOPS CONDUCTED 
</b></p>
<p>32. At a workshop organized by UNMIL which took place on 21 November 2006, the 
follow-up to the last report (E/CN.4/2006/114) was discussed.  The incidence of 
gender-based violence, and particularly the status of implementation of the amended 
Rape Act, was then discussed in some detail.  A plan of action was elaborated by the national 
task force on gender-based violence, on which the line ministries, the United Nations, and both 
non-governmental and governmental organizations are represented, aims to promote awareness 
and make strategic interventions to prevent such violence and support victims.  The 
establishment of safety shelters for victims of such violence together with the much needed 
physiological support was identified as a priority. 
</p>
<p>33. While the new Rape Act provides greater protection, particularly a broader definition, 
increased age for statutory rape, and the creation of the offence of gang rape, a number of 
concerns were expressed.  The weak implementation of the legislation and, at the time of writing 
this report, only one conviction recorded, points to a clear need for more effective training of 
investigators, prosecutors and judges.  The phenomenon of out-of-court settlements in these 
cases was cited as an example of the creation of an atmosphere of impunity.  Revision of the 
legislation to address such vital issues as rape by juveniles and to render illegal out-of-court 
settlements is urgent. 
</p>
<p>34. Civil society and government officials expressed serious concerns about UNMIL 
accountability in cases of alleged rape/sexual assault by members of the mission.  Local 
authorities accept that these individuals are not subject to national jurisdiction but the absence of 
any information on the follow-up to investigations or action taken was an issue raised by a 
number of interlocutors.  The argument was made that these matters deserve to be clarified as 
there is a need for justice to be seen to be done and people want to know that there is 
accountability by all. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  OBSTACLES AND CONCERNS 
</b></p>
<p>35. If the work of TRC is to continue and to be effective, it will be necessary to increase 
activities on several fronts.  The establishment of an effective secretariat, and the submission of a 
strategy document to donors (as opposed to seeking funding for ad hoc activities), is needed in 
order to inspire confidence in the donor community.  Funding will be a critical issue in the life of 
TRC and remedial steps must be taken immediately. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>36. Both positive developments and areas of concern have been highlighted in the report.  
This is the first year in the life of the newly elected Government and the support of the 
international community for the ambitious programme of reform, which touches on all areas of 
economic, social, civil and political rights, must be forthcoming.  The authorities have given </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>clear signals that they view the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as an 
imperative in these early years.  The operational independence of the institution is respected by 
both the national and international actors but it should always be remembered that the 
reconciliation process belongs to the people of Liberia.  Reconciliation is a process and it is 
essential that the key institutions of the judiciary be established, so that the conditions to avoid a 
relapse into conflict are set.  The legal obligation of the international community to assist in 
relation to the realization of economic and social rights, and particularly with efforts at poverty 
reduction, must also be met by the implementation of deliberate, concrete and targeted measures 
by the national authorities in the key areas of housing, food, health, education and work.  This 
will not be achieved overnight.  The efforts to divert potential funds saved as a result of the 
anti-corruption drive is welcome, but it will be a long, hard battle and banning corruption is not 
enough; there must be enforcement.  It is only by working together that these enormous 
challenges facing Liberian society can be overcome. 
</p>
<p><b>IX.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>37. <b>The independent expert makes the recommendations that follow in the 
paragraphs below to the Government of Liberia, the donor community and the Office of 
the High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>38. <b>The strengthening of the judicial system is crucial to the promotion and protection 
of human rights and to ending impunity.  In this regard, the earlier recommendation of 
engaging judges and prosecutors from outside Liberia, including as mentors, is still very 
pertinent.  OHCHR, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS), the European Union (EU), United Nations agencies and UNMIL must 
continue to talk to the Government, the Chief Justice, and all stakeholders to work towards 
the realization of this recommendation. 
</b></p>
<p>39. <b>An earlier recommendation to the Government of the United States of America to 
offer scholarships to qualified Liberians to study law and for postgraduate courses is 
pertinent.  In this regard, affirmative action, as reflected in article 4, paragraph 1, of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, should be 
implemented in Liberia to attract more females into the legal profession.  At the same time, 
the international community is being requested to assist in improving the law faculties of 
universities in Liberia. 
</b></p>
<p>40. <b>OHCHR should provide more funds through technical cooperation services for the 
re-establishment of the Human Rights Unit in the Ministry of Justice. 
</b></p>
<p>41. <b>OHCHR should provide more funds to conduct workshops on international human 
rights instruments for the legislature, judicial service and all law-enforcement agencies. 
</b>42. <b>OHCHR, United Nations agencies and international NGOs should support the 
Women and Children&#8217;s Unit of LNP. 
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>OHCHR should provide funds to enable sector ministries and relevant civil society 
organizations to respond regarding the State party of Liberia&#8217;s obligation to report on 
treaties ratified. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>44. <b>The Government of Liberia, OHCHR, ECOWAS, AU and other stakeholders 
should seriously consider making all assistance available so that proper implementation of 
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act might be achieved. 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>All stakeholders, having learnt from the experience of the non-performance of the 
Commissioners of TRC, should hasten the process of the establishment of the Independent 
Human Rights Commission. 
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>OHCHR and the donor community should help the Government of Liberia establish 
a mission in Geneva. 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>The Government of Liberia should consider proposing an amendment to the 
Constitution allowing all international treaties to become part of domestic law, i.e. move 
from a dualist to a monist system. 
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>The repeal of discriminatory and offensive legislation such as the &#8220;Hinterland 
Regulations&#8221; be immediately tabled by the Legislature. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Undertakings/suggestions 
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>Finally, commitments and suggestions made by the independent expert include that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>She would intervene with the Swiss authorities in relation to the establishment of 
a Liberian Mission in Geneva and will seek advice from other countries that 
would be prepared to support the establishment of such a presence; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>The independent expert would intervene with the Government of Ghana 
regarding the resettlement of Liberian refugees in Ghana; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>The Government of Liberia should request the United States of America to offer 
scholarships to law graduates so the legal training and the judicial system can be 
strengthened; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>UNMIL should clarify with local authorities the status of any cases involving 
allegations of sexual misconduct against Liberian nationals by United Nations 
peacekeepers, staff members or any others contracted or subcontracted to carry 
on work on its behalf; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>TRC should request the assistance of UNMIL to disseminate explanatory 
information; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>The offer of the Finnish delegation, made during the third session of the 
Human Rights Council, in relation to the provision of psychological support and 
assistance to TRC, should be taken up; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>The international community should move towards the creation of a fund for 
victims of rape and sexual violence in Liberia</b>. </p>
