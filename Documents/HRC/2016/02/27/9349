Indonesia, respectively. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  ACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur draws the attention of the Council to his third interim report to 
the General Assembly (A/62/221, paras. 6-41), which he presented in New York on 
29 October 2007. In this report he described his activities for the period from January to 
July 2007 (i.e. the period since the submission of his report to the fourth session of the Human 
Rights Council<b>1</b>). The Special Rapporteur would like to inform the Council of the key activities 
he has undertaken since the submission of his report to the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications concerning human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the period 16 December 2006-14 December 2007, the Special Rapporteur 
sent 79 letters of allegations of torture to 51 Governments and 187 urgent appeals to 
59 Governments on behalf of persons who might be at risk of torture or other forms of 
ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur reports that in the period since the submission of his report to the 
General Assembly, he has completed missions to Sri Lanka (1 to 8 October 2007) and Indonesia 
(10 to 23 November 2007) the reports of which are found in addenda 6 and 7 to this report, 
respectively.

delegation of Zimbabwe to the fortieth session of the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights, held in Banjul in November 2006 that an invitation to the Special Rapporteur 
could be expected shortly. No further information has been received following an invitation 
extended to the Special Rapporteur by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Gambia, 
H.E. Mr. B. Garba-Jahumpa, at a meeting on 17 November 2006. 
</p>
<p>9. In May 2007, the Special Rapporteur renewed requests for invitations from the 
following States: Algeria (request first made in 1997); Afghanistan (2005); Belarus (2005); 
Bolivia (2005); C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (2005); Egypt (1996); Eritrea (2005); Ethiopia (2005);

are long-standing. 
</p>
<p><b>Highlights of key presentations and consultations 
</b></p>
<p>10. From 1 to 2 September 2007, the Special Rapporteur participated in a panel discussion at 
the Salzburg Seminar on &#8220;Upholding human rights, civil liberties, and non-derogable rights: can 
they survive the present age of terrorism?&#8221; 
</p>
<p>11. From 3 to 5 September, he made several presentations at a regional seminar for the

 <p> 
</p>
<p>24. On 23 November 2007, on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of 
Violence against Women, he issued a joint statement with the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, calling on States to use the human rights 
framework in a gender-sensitive way to strengthen the protection of women from violence.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  STRENGTHENING THE PROTECTION OF WOMEN FROM TORTURE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Introduction: towards a gender-sensitive interpretation of torture 
</b></p>
<p>25. The present chapter seeks to respond to and complement initiatives in the area of gender 
mainstreaming and combating violence against women, such as Human Rights Council 
resolution 6/30, the Secretary-General&#8217;s in-depth study on all forms of violence against women, 
together with the United Nations follow-up campaign on violence against women to be launched 
in 2008, the focus of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on ending impunity, especially 
for sexual violence, and the call by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women to fully 
apply the human rights framework to the concerns of women.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>26. The aim is to ensure that the torture protection framework is applied in a gender-inclusive 
manner with a view to strengthening the protection of women from torture. While a variety of 
international instruments explicitly or implicitly provide for an extensive set of obligations with 
respect to violence against women or rape, classifying an act as &#8220;torture&#8221; carries a considerable 
additional stigma for the State and reinforces legal implications, which include the strong 
obligation to criminalize acts of torture, to bring perpetrators to justice and to provide reparation 
to victims. 
</p>
<p>27. Torture is prohibited under a wide range of international instruments, such as article 7 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). Torture is also 
prohibited by many regional instruments as well as under international criminal law and 
international humanitarian law. CAT is the only legally binding instrument at the universal level 
concerned exclusively with the eradication of torture. Its article 1 lays down a definition, which 
sets out four elements required to meet the threshold of torture: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Severe pain and suffering, physical or mental; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Intent; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Purpose; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; State involvement. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  A/HRC/4/34, para. 56. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur has suggested adding to these elements the criterion of 
powerlessness.<b>5</b> A situation of powerlessness arises when one person exercises total power over 
another, classically in detention situations, where the detainee cannot escape or defend 
him/herself. However, it can also arise during demonstrations, when a person is not able to resist 
the use of force any more, e.g. handcuffed, in a police van etc. Rape is an extreme expression of 
this power relation, of one person treating another person as merely an object. Applied to 
situations of &#8220;private violence&#8221;, this means that the degree of powerlessness of the victim in a 
given situation must be tested. If it is found that a victim is unable to flee or otherwise coerced 
into staying by certain circumstances, the powerlessness criterion can be considered fulfilled. 
</p>
<p>29. The element of powerlessness also allows the specific status of the victim to be taken into 
consideration, such as sex, age and physical and mental health,<b>6</b> in some cases also religion, 
which might render a specific person powerless in a given context. A society&#8217;s indifference to or 
even support for the subordinate status of women, together with the existence of discriminatory 
laws and a pattern of State failure to punish perpetrators and protect victims, create the 
conditions under which women may be subjected to systematic physical and mental suffering, 
despite their apparent freedom to resist. 
</p>
<p>30. In regard to violence against women, the purpose element is always fulfilled, if the acts can 
be shown to be gender-specific,<b>7</b> since discrimination is one of the elements mentioned in the 
CAT definition. Moreover, if it can be shown that an act had a specific purpose, the intent can be 
implied. 
</p>
<p>31. The central role of the State in article 1 of the Convention, which restricts the definition of 
torture to acts &#8220;when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the 
consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity&#8221;, has 
frequently been used to exclude violence against women outside direct State control from the 
scope of protection of CAT. However, the Special Rapporteur wishes to recall that the language 
used in article 1 of the Convention concerning consent and acquiescence by a public official 
clearly extends State obligations into the private sphere and should be interpreted to include 
State failure to protect persons within its jurisdiction from torture and ill-treatment committed by 
private individuals. Also, article 1 of CAT should be seen as reinforcing - and reinforced by - the 
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women adopted by the General Assembly in 
resolution 48/104. 
</p>
<p>32. Article 4 (c) of this Declaration proclaims that States should &#8220;exercise due diligence to 
prevent, investigate and, in accordance with national legislation, punish acts of violence against 
women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private persons&#8221;. Recently, the 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  See E/CN.4/2006/6, paras. 39-40. 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  See also European Court of Human Rights: <i>Soering v. UK</i>, 1989 and <i>Costello v. UK</i>, 1993. 
</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  I.e. violence that is gender-specific in its form or purpose in that it is aimed at &#8220;correcting&#8221; 
</p>
<p>behaviour perceived as non-consonant with gender roles and stereotypes or at asserting or 
perpetuating male domination over women. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Committee against Torture indicated that &#8220;Since the failure of the State to exercise due diligence 
to intervene to stop, sanction and provide remedies to victims of torture facilitates and enables 
non-State actors to commit acts impermissible under the Convention with impunity, the State&#8217;s 
indifference or inaction provides a form of encouragement and/or de facto permission&#8221;.<b>8</b> 
Similarly, other universal<b>9</b> and regional<b>10</b> bodies have been applying the due diligence test. 
</p>
<p>33. Whereas the Committee against Torture often does not specify whether a violation 
amounts to torture or to other forms of ill-treatment, it has stressed that ill-treatment is often 
conducive to torture, and therefore torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment are 
closely intertwined. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, the main elements distinguishing 
cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment are the powerlessness of the victim and the purpose of 
the act. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  What constitutes torture? 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Torture and ill-treatment of women in the public sphere11 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Rape and sexual violence 
</b>34. Custodial violence against women very often includes rape and other forms of sexual 
violence such as threats of rape, touching, &#8220;virginity testing&#8221;, being stripped naked, invasive 
body searches, insults and humiliations of a sexual nature, etc.<b>12</b> It is widely recognized, 
including by former Special Rapporteurs on torture<b>13</b> and by regional jurisprudence, that rape

Honduras</i>, 29 July 1988, No. 4. In <i>MC v. Bulgaria</i>, the European Court of Human Rights found 
that the failure to establish and apply a criminal law system punishing all forms of rape and 
sexual abuse constituted a violation of the prohibition of degrading treatment. 
<b>11
</b></p>
<p>  The large majority of the communications sent by the Special Rapporteur on torture in 
relation to violence against women involve the active participation of State officials both in and 
outside of classic detention settings, which include prisons, police and military detention 
facilities, psychiatric clinics, social care centres etc. During the last four years the Special 
Rapporteur on torture has sent 122 joint communications together with the Special Rapporteur 
on violence against women (22 in 2007, 27 in 2006, 27 in 2005 and 46 in 2004).

<p>constitutes torture when it is carried out by or at the instigation of or with the consent or 
acquiescence of public officials.<b>14</b> In a 1997 decision on a case of custodial rape the European 
Court of Human Rights acknowledged that &#8220;rape of a detainee by an official of the State must be 
considered to be an especially grave and abhorrent form of ill-treatment given the ease with 
which the offender can exploit the vulnerability and weakened resistance of the victim&#8221; and 
&#8220;rape leaves deep psychological scars on the victims which do not respond to the passage of time 
as quickly as other forms of physical and mental violence&#8221;.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>35. In the area of international criminal law, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former 
Yugoslavia decisions in the Celebici and Furundzija cases have contributed to the international 
recognition of rape as a form of torture.<b>16</b> Also, international criminal tribunals, in their 
jurisprudence, have broadened the scope of crimes of sexual violence that can be prosecuted as 
rape to include oral sex and vaginal or anal penetration through the use of objects or any part of 
the aggressor&#8217;s body.<b>17</b> This is crucial because in many countries rape is still defined as &#8220;carnal 
access&#8221;, reducing it to penetration with the male sexual organ. It is noteworthy that other forms 
of sexual violence, whether defined as rape or not, may constitute torture or ill-treatment<b>18</b> and 
must not be dealt with as minor offences.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>14
</b>  For instance, the Committee against Torture found in its decision <i>V.L. v. Switzerland</i> 
</p>
<p>(CAT/C/37/D/262/2005) that &#8220;the sexual abuse by the police in this case constitutes torture even 
though it was perpetrated outside formal detention facilities&#8221;, para. 8.10; see also <i>Mej&#237;a v. Per&#250;</i>,

<p>  International Criminal Court, Elements of Crimes, article 8 (2) (b) (xxii)-1 of the ICC 
Elements of Crimes. 
<b>18
</b></p>
<p>  For instance, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights resorted to the international 
jurisprudence on rape to conclude that &#8220;the acts of sexual violence to which an inmate was 
submitted under an alleged finger vaginal &#8216;examination&#8217; constituted sexual rape that due to its 
effects constituted torture.&#8221; See <i>Miguel Castro-Castro Prison v. Peru</i>, Inter-American Court of 
Human Rights judgement of 25 November 2006, para. 312. 
<b>19
</b></p>
<p>  As for example in a case currently under consideration in Mexico (<i>Ana Mar&#237;a Velasco contra 
Doroteo Blas Marcelo</i>, 79/2006, juzgado Primero Penal de Tenango de Valle, Estado de 
M&#233;xico), where a policeman forced his penis into her mouth and was charged with having 
committed a &#8220;libidinous act&#8221;. In relation to the same incident, the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women sent a joint allegation 
letter to the Government of Mexico on 18 December 2006 concerning, inter alia, the sexual 
abuse of a group of women by police officers during incidents in San Salvador Atenco 
on 3 and 4 May 2006, to which the Government responded on 17 May 2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>36. The case law presented here has, without exception, emphasized the severe pain and 
suffering endured by victims of rape. However, the Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight some 
of the unique dimensions of this form of torture. When Government officials use rape, the 
suffering inflicted might go beyond the suffering caused by classic torture, partly because of the 
intended and often resulting isolation of the survivor. In some cultures a rape victim may be 
rejected or formally banished from her community or family. This rejection greatly hinders the 
psychological recovery of the victim and often condemns her to destitution and extreme poverty. 
Even when rape survivors are not rejected they still face important difficulties in establishing 
intimate relationships.<b>20</b> Furthermore, raped women are often infected with sexually transmitted 
diseases or may experience unwanted pregnancies, miscarriages, forced abortions or denial of 
abortion.<b>21</b> Because of the stigma attached to sexual violence, official torturers deliberately use 
rape to humiliate and punish victims but also to destroy entire families and communities. This is 
particularly clear when State officials force family members to rape their female relatives or to 
witness their rape. The Akayesu decision, in which the International Criminal Tribunal for 
Rwanda (ICTR) recognized rape as a form of genocide in the same way as any other act 
committed with specific intent to destroy a particular group, is a striking acknowledgment of the 
destructive potential of rape. The ICTR made it explicit that these rapes resulted in the physical 
and psychological destruction of Tutsi women, their families and their communities.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Violence against pregnant women and denial of reproductive rights23  
</b>37. In its general comment No. 28 (2000) on article 3 (The equality of rights between men and 
women), the Human Rights Committee explicitly indicated that breaches of article 7 include 
forced abortion as well as denial of access to safe abortion to women who have become pregnant 
as a result of rape. The Committee against Torture has also identified reproductive decisions as a 
context in which women are particularly vulnerable<b>24</b> and expressed concern regarding 
domestic legislation that severely restricts access to voluntary abortion in cases of rape.<b>25</b>

<p>  The Special Rapporteur has sent nine communications in the last four years, linked to 
miscarriages as a result of torture or ill-treatment in detention. See for example 
A/HRC/4/33/Add.1, para. 11. He has also received information regarding female detainees

<p>potentially life-saving medical treatment after abortion.<b>26</b> Whereas, in a case where a woman&#8217;s 
health was threatened if she gave birth, the European Court of Human Rights recently found a 
violation of the applicant&#8217;s right to her private life, it regrettably did not establish that this 
amounted to inhuman treatment.<b>27  
</b></p>
<p>38. The Human Rights Committee has referred to the sterilization of women without their 
consent as a breach of ICCPR article 7.<b>28</b> The Special Rapporteur also stresses that, given the 
particular vulnerability of women with disabilities,<b>29</b> forced abortions and sterilizations of these 
women if they are the result of a lawful process by which decisions are made by their &#8220;legal 
guardians&#8221; against their will, may constitute torture or ill-treatment.<b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>39. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR), laws or policies prescribing the use of forced abortion or forced sterilization as 
methods of enforcement, or as punishment for non-compliance, would be considered inherently 
persecutory and will therefore give rise to justified claims for refugee status in view of the 
serious human rights violations each individual subject to these measures would suffer.<b>31</b> It is

<p>&#8220;a permanent and ongoing form of persecution&#8221;<b>32</b> and to &#8220;involve drastic and emotionally painful 
consequences that are unending&#8221;.<b>33</b>  The Special Rapporteur recalls that enforced sterilization as 
well as forced pregnancy constitute crimes against humanity when committed as part of a 
widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Corporal punishment 
</b>40. Between 2004 and 2007 the Special Rapporteur sent 13 joint communications 
concerning 21 women sentenced to death by stoning and 2 sentenced to flogging under sharia 
law. Stoning is a method of capital punishment primarily used for crimes of adultery and other 
related offences, of which women are disproportionately found guilty, which is inconsistent with 
the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex enshrined in all major human rights 
instruments, including the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women (CEDAW).<b>35</b>  The Special Rapporteur on torture, the Human Rights Committee, the 
Committee against Torture and the Commission on Human Rights have reiterated that any form 
of corporal punishment is contrary to the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment.<b>36</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(d) Women-specific aspects of detention 
</b>41. Women in contexts of detention or control, such as psychiatric institutions or social care 
centres, have specific needs in terms of reproductive health care, family contact, hygiene, etc., 
which are often overlooked. They are often the sole or primary caregivers of young children and 
therefore frequently mention concern for their children as their biggest worry, especially at the 
initial stage of detention.<b>37</b> Breastfeeding mothers are exposed to particular suffering when they 
are separated from their babies. Pregnant women should not be deprived of their liberty unless 
there are absolutely compelling reasons to do so and their particular vulnerability should be 
borne in mind. If they need to be detained, the quality and quantity of food and the medical care 
provided to pregnant women should meet their specific requirements. Measures of physical

</p>
<p>restraint should be avoided during delivery.<b>38 </b>Poor hygiene is also an issue that has a greater 
adverse impact upon women detainees. For example, menstruating women need access to 
appropriate sanitary protection. 
</p>
<p>42. In many countries male staff work in &#8220;contact positions&#8221; with women detainees and this 
situation increases their risk of being sexually assaulted since male officers may take advantage 
of routine pat-frisks to touch a woman&#8217;s breasts, thighs, vagina etc. They may also abuse their 
responsibilities regarding surveillance in order to watch women prisoners when naked. Physical 
violence can entail rapes of women detainees, but the abuse of women by male staff can also be 
more subtly disguised. For instance, they may offer women special privileges or goods otherwise 
hard to obtain. Equally, they may threaten to deny them access to their entitlements. It is crucial 
to bear in mind that under such circumstances it can never be argued that a woman has 
&#8220;consented&#8221; to a sexual relationship, even if this appears to be the case. 
</p>
<p>43. Finally, in some countries, prolonged detention as such can become ill-treatment, as is the 
case for instance when women are detained for their &#8220;protection&#8221; for up to 14 years because they 
are at risk of becoming victims of honour crimes.<b>39</b>  
</p>
<p><b>2. Torture and ill-treatment in the private sphere:  
violence within the family and the community 
</b></p>
<p>44. While there is no exhaustive list of forms of violence that may constitute torture or cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment - rather it may encompass different types of so-called 
traditional practices (such as dowry-related violence, widow-burning, etc.), violence in the name 
of honour, sexual violence and harassment, as well as slavery-like practices often of a sexual 
nature - the Special Rapporteur would like to focus on three of them: domestic violence (in the 
form of intimate partner violence), female genital mutilation and human trafficking. The Special 
Rapporteur wishes to highlight these forms of violence for three reasons. First, they are 
widespread and touch millions of women around the world every year.<b>40</b> Second, in many parts

A/HRC/4/33/Add.3, paras. 39 and 72. 
<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>  The United Nations estimates that as many as 4 million women and children become victims 
of human trafficking every year, most of whom are exploited for sexual purposes. According to 
the World Health Organization, the number of girls and women who have undergone female 
genital mutilation (FGM) is estimated at between 100 and 140 million. Each year, a further 
2 million girls and women undergo FGM. However, the most current form of violence against 
women around the world is that perpetrated by husbands or other intimate partners. See, for 
example, <i>WHO Multi-country Study on Women&#8217;s Health and Domestic Violence against Women: 
Initial results on prevalence, health outcomes and women&#8217;s responses </i>(Geneva, 2005). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of the world they are still trivialized and the comparison between them and &#8220;classic&#8221; torture will 
raise awareness with regard to the level of atrocity that they can reach. Third, stating that these 
forms of violence can amount to torture if States fail to act with due diligence, illustrates the 
parallels between torture and other forms of violence against women. 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Intimate partner violence41 
</b>45. As with female detainees who experience torture, battered wives may be beaten with hands 
and objects, kicked, strangled, stabbed or burned. Rape and other forms of sexual abuse are used 
by intimate partners as well as by prison guards or police officers. In both scenarios, physical 
violence is usually accompanied by insults, varied forms of humiliation, and threats to kill or 
harm the victim or her family members (often children). Domestic violence, as well as torture, 
tends to escalate over time, sometimes resulting in death or leaving women&#8217;s bodies mutilated or 
permanently disfigured. Women who experience such violence, whether in their homes or in a 
prison, suffer depression, anxiety, loss of self-esteem and a feeling of isolation. Indeed, battered 
women may suffer from the same intense symptoms that comprise the post-traumatic stress 
disorder identified in victims of official torture as well as by victims of rape.<b>42</b> Another parallel 
between privately battering women and torture, which refers back to the element of 
powerlessness, is the intention to keep the victim in a permanent state of fear based on 
unpredictable violence by seeking to reduce the person to submission and destroy his/her 
capacity for resistance and autonomy with the ultimate aim of achieving total control. 
</p>
<p>46. State acquiescence in domestic violence can take many forms, some of which may be 
subtly disguised. For instance, &#8220;Civil laws that appear to have little to do with violence also have 
an impact on women&#8217;s ability to protect themselves and assert their rights. Laws that restrict 
women&#8217;s right to divorce or inheritance, or that prevent them from gaining custody of their 
children, receiving financial compensation or owning property, all serve to make women 
dependent upon men and limit their ability to leave a violent situation.&#8221;<b>43</b> The Special Rapporteur 
considers that States should be held accountable for complicity in violence against women, 
whenever they create and implement discriminatory laws that may trap women in abusive 
circumstances. State responsibility may also be engaged if domestic laws fail to provide 
adequate protection against any form of torture and ill-treatment in the home. For instance, in the 
case of <i>A. v. the United Kingdom</i>, the European Court of Human Rights considered a complaint 
concerning a minor whose stepfather had repeatedly beaten him. The stepfather had been 
acquitted by domestic courts under the defence of &#8220;reasonable chastisement&#8221; as provided under 
English law. The Court, referring to the beatings, found that &#8220;treatment of this kind reaches the

<p>level of severity prohibited by article 3&#8221;<b>44</b> of the European Convention on Human Rights. The 
Court further stated that &#8220;the failure to provide adequate protection constitutes a violation of 
article 3 of the Convention&#8221;.<b>45</b> 
</p>
<p>47. But even if there are national laws against domestic violence in place, law enforcement 
agencies and the prosecution services may still not consider cases of domestic violence as 
serious violations and may be therefore reluctant to bring complaints, conduct investigations and 
prosecute perpetrators. In 2001 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights considered 
the case of Maria da Penha, who had suffered physical and psychological violence at the hands 
of her husband since 1983. He twice tried to kill her and left her paralysed at the age of 38. 
Fifteen years later, the judicial investigation initiated by Maria da Penha had not been concluded. 
In this case, the Inter-American Commission held that the legislation was inadequate and that the 
State was responsible for not having acted with due diligence and added that &#8220;discriminatory 
judicial ineffectiveness creates a climate that is conducive to domestic violence, since society 
sees no evidence of willingness by the State, as the representative of the society, to take effective 
action to sanction such acts&#8221;.<b>46</b> 
</p>
<p>48. As can be seen from the above, international law has developed considerably over the 
years to become more gender-inclusive. In 1996, the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women stated that: &#8220;the argument that domestic violence should be understood and treated as a 
form of torture and, when less severe, ill-treatment, is one that deserves consideration by the 
rapporteurs and treaty bodies that investigate these violations together perhaps with appropriate 
NGO experts and jurists&#8221;.<b>47</b> In 2000, the Human Rights Committee indicated that domestic 
violence can give rise to violations of the right not to be subjected to torture or ill-treatment 
under article 7 of the ICCPR.<b>48</b> In line with this statement the Committee has mentioned the need 
for States to adopt specific legislation combating domestic violence,<b>49</b> including legislation 
criminalizing marital rape.<b>50</b> More specifically, it has called upon States to ensure that their 
justice systems incorporate restraining orders to protect women from violent family members,

domestic violence to the authorities,<b>51</b> and offer &#8220;material and psychological relief to the 
victims&#8221;.<b>52</b> The Committee against Torture has also referred to the prevalence of domestic 
violence, and the urgent need to protect women by adopting specific legislative and other 
measures.<b>53</b> The Committee has stressed  the need to take action in cases where a woman is 
reportedly being confined against her will by members of her family and the importance of 
ensuring that fair standards of proof are required.<b>54</b> 
</p>
<p>49. A side glimpse at refugee law shows that in cases of domestic violence where the State is 
unable or unwilling to intervene to provide protection, victims have increasingly been recognized 
as refugees. In one model case, the High Court of Australia granted refugee status to 
Mrs. Khawar, who claimed to be the victim of serious and prolonged domestic violence on the 
part of her husband and members of his family, and that the police in Pakistan refused to enforce 
the law against such violence or otherwise offer her protection. This refusal was considered not 
only to be a mere inability to provide protection, but also &#8220;alleged tolerance and condonation&#8221;.<b>55</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Female genital mutilation (FGM)56 
</b>50. Like torture, female genital mutilation (FGM) involves the deliberate infliction of severe 
pain and suffering. The pain is usually exacerbated by the fact that the procedure is carried out 
with rudimentary tools and without anaesthetic. Many girls enter a state of shock induced by the 
extreme pain, psychological trauma and exhaustion from screaming. The procedure can result in 
death through severe bleeding leading to haemorrhagic shock, neurogenic shock as a result of

<p>  The World Health Organization defines female genital mutilation (FGM) as all procedures 
involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female 
genital organs for non-medical reasons. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>pain and trauma, and overwhelming infection and septicaemia. Other immediate medical 
complications include ulceration of the genital region, injury to adjacent tissues and urine 
retention. Although the scientific research addressing the psychological consequences of FGM is 
limited, some studies have found an increased likelihood of fear of sexual intercourse, 
post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression and memory loss, and that the cultural 
significance of the practice might not protect against psychological complications.<b>57</b> 
</p>
<p>51. The pain inflicted by FGM does not stop with the initial procedure, but often continues as 
ongoing torture throughout a woman&#8217;s life. Depending on the type and severity of the procedure 
performed,<b>58 </b>women may experience long-term consequences such as chronic infections, 
tumours, abscesses, cysts, infertility, excessive growth of scar tissue, increased risk of 
HIV/AIDS infection, hepatitis and other blood-borne diseases, damage to the urethra resulting in 
urinary incontinence, painful menstruation, painful sexual intercourse and other sexual 
dysfunctions.<b>59</b> FGM increases the risk for both mother and child during childbirth, including 
higher incidences of caesarean section and post-partum haemorrhage. In addition, women who 
have been infibulated have to be deinfibulated upon marriage, and later again during childbirth, 
hence causing further pain and psychological trauma.<b>60</b> 
</p>
<p>52. With regard to the element of powerlessness it must be noted that the cutting is usually 
carried out before a girl&#8217;s tenth birthday.<b>61</b> In such circumstances, girls are clearly under

<p>  The Demographic and Health Survey carried out in 1997 in Yemen found that as many 
as 76 per cent of girls underwent FGM in their first two weeks of life. UNICEF mentions that 
about 90 per cent of girls in Egypt are cut between the ages of 5 and 14 years, while in Ethiopia, 
Mali and Mauritania, 60 per cent or more of girls surveyed underwent the procedure before their 
fifth birthday. In Sudan, a 2004 study found that at least 75 per cent of girls had undergone FGM 
by the age of 9 to 10 in South Darfur. Ibid., p. 6. </p>

resisting. On the other hand, adolescent girls and women very often agree to undergo FGM 
because they fear the non-acceptance of their communities, families and peers.<b>62</b> 
</p>
<p>53. It is clear that even if a law authorizes the practice, any act of FGM would amount to 
torture and the existence of the law by itself would constitute consent or acquiescence by the 
State. The &#8220;medicalization&#8221; of FGM, whereby girls are cut by trained personnel rather than by 
traditional practitioners is on the rise in some African countries.<b>63</b> The Special Rapporteur 
stresses that from a human rights perspective, medicalization does not in any way make the 
practice more acceptable.<b>64</b> Even in contexts where FGM has been recognized as a criminal 
offence, but where public hospitals offer this &#8220;service&#8221;, it constitutes torture or ill-treatment. 
Also in cases where FGM is performed in private clinics and physicians carrying out the 
procedure are not being prosecuted, the State de facto consents to the practice and is therefore 
accountable. 
</p>
<p>54. Many special procedures have found that female genital mutilation may constitute torture 
and that States have the responsibility to take all the necessary measures to eradicate it.<b>65</b> The 
Special Rapporteur on torture considers FGM a violation falling within his mandate, and has 
welcomed the adoption of legislation prohibiting female genital mutilation after his visits to 
Nigeria and Togo in 2007, but regretted at the same time that the practice and social acceptance 
of female genital mutilation persist, and that effective mechanisms to enforce prohibition are 
absent.<b>66</b> The Committee against Torture has expressed concern regarding the lack of domestic 
legislation outlawing female genital mutilation in specific countries.<b>67</b> Furthermore, the 
Human Rights Committee has stated that female genital mutilation is in breach of article 7 of the 
ICCPR and has raised concerns regarding its persistence.<b>68</b>

<p>55. UNHCR has stated that &#8220;FGM, which causes severe pain as well as permanent physical 
harm, amounts to a violation of human rights, including the rights of the child, and can be 
regarded as persecution. The toleration of these acts by the authorities, or the unwillingness of 
the authorities to provide protection against them, amounts to official acquiescence. Therefore, 
a woman can be considered as a refugee if she or her daughters fear being compelled to undergo 
FGM against their will; or, she fears persecution for refusing to undergo or to allow her 
daughters to undergo the practice.&#8221;<b>69</b> In the refugee context it has also been found that FGM 
amounts to &#8220;continuing and permanent persecution&#8221;.<b>70</b>

<p><b>(c) Human trafficking 
</b>56. Although all human trafficking cases have their individual characteristics, most follow the 
same stages: victims are abducted or recruited in the country of origin, transferred and then 
exploited in the destination country, where they are forced into sexual or labour servitude or 
other forms of exploitation. Victims of human trafficking are very often kept in forced 
confinement.<b>71</b> Women working in brothels often undergo constant surveillance through the use 
of video cameras and may be forced to use drugs or stimulants by their traffickers as a means of 
control. A recent study on trafficking in women from Romania to Germany shows that the level 
of psychological control held by the traffickers over their victims is generally so high that most 
of the victims are not able to act on any opportunity to escape.<b>72</b> During the exploitation phase 
victims are often forced to work up to 18-24 hours per day and subjected to severe forms of 
physical and mental violence, including beatings, sexual abuse, humiliations and threats that may 
amount to torture or at least cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.<b>73</b> Psychological problems 
observed in victims of trafficking include post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, 
overwhelming shame, loss of self-esteem, loss of sense of safety, dissociation, anxiety and

victims of classic torture are often used by organizations that assure psychological and medical 
assistance for trafficked women.<b>75</b> 
</p>
<p>57. Regarding State duties in this context, in the case of <i>Siliadin v. France</i>, the European Court 
of Human Rights found that the State failed to live up to the positive obligation to have in place a 
criminal law system to prevent, prosecute and punish non-State actors involved in domestic 
slavery.<b>76</b> States may also be held accountable for failing to provide appropriate protection to 
victims of human trafficking. In many instances trafficked women are not recognized as victims, 
often owing to the existence of &#8220;contracts&#8221; between them and their &#8220;employers&#8221;. The Special 
Rapporteur stresses that any initial consent becomes meaningless, once the element of 
powerlessness is fulfilled.<b>77</b> He also recalls that in the case of <i>Barar v. Sweden</i>, the European 
Court of Human Rights held that the expulsion of a person to a State where he/she would be 
subjected to slavery or forced labour might raise issues under the obligation to prohibit torture.<b>78</b>

closely intertwined and has repeatedly commented on the need for legislation and other 
measures.<b>79</b>

<p>Some forms of torture might constitute continuing and permanent violations and in some cases, 
re-exposure to the stimulus might constitute psychological torture (e.g. when medical expertise 
indicates that there might be a risk of suicide if a survivor is returned). In the refugee context, 
even if there is no risk of future persecution, past persecution may nonetheless warrant granting 
of international protection.<b>81</b> 
</p>
<p>60. Another gendered aspect of non-refoulement is the argument used with regard to the risk of 
women to be subjected to FGM, that there is a possibility of &#8220;internal flight&#8221;, meaning women 
can return and live safely in another part of the country. In particular in gender-based refugee 
claims, the lack of State protection in one part of the country is often an indication that the State 
is also not able or willing to protect the woman or girl in any other part of the country. 
Furthermore, if the woman or girl relocates, for example from a rural to an urban area to avoid 
FGM, the protection risks in the place of relocation would have to be carefully assessed.<b>82</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Justice for women-survivors of torture 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Access to justice 
</b>61. Whereas in many parts of the world women have to overcome a variety of hurdles, 
including financial and economic constraints, restricted movement, discriminatory laws etc. in 
order to access justice, victims of sexual violence face particular obstacles at all stages of the 
criminal justice system. While not widely used, international instruments lay the foundation for 
special temporary measures to be taken to ensure effective access to justice for women with 
respect to all forms of violence, including through the enjoyment of fundamental economic and 
social rights, without which women are less likely to seek justice. In addition, women often do 
not report sexual violence because of the stigma and sometimes rejection they fear from their 
family or community. In a recent decision the Committee against Torture held that &#8220;It is 
well-known that the loss of privacy and prospect of humiliation based on revelation alone of the 
acts concerned may cause both women and men to withhold the fact that they have been subject 
to rape and/or other forms of sexual abuse until it appears absolutely necessary. Particularly for 
women, there is the additional fear of shaming and rejection by their partner or family

</p>
<p>members.&#8221;<b>83</b> At the next stage, women victims of sexual violence may be interviewed and 
examined by personnel that have not been trained in gender-sensitive methods of recording 
evidence and interviewing. Moreover, collecting evidence of gender-based violence is a 
neglected area in many law enforcement contexts. In some countries, there might not be 
independent medical institutions to conduct such examinations; in others laws do not require 
police to send alleged rape victims for an immediate medical examination. One of the most 
egregious examples of re-victimization of rape victims, taken up on several occasions by the 
Committee against Torture, is when domestic laws and policies permit exemption from 
punishment of a rapist if he subsequently marries the victim.<b>84</b> 
</p>
<p>62. Also rules of procedure and evidence of national courts may overlook women-specific 
needs: they often require evidence of physical resistance by the victim in order to show lack of 
consent, which means that women who were too terrified to fight back and struggle with the 
perpetrator may be unable to prove that they were raped. Also courts frequently ignore &#8220;soft&#8221; 
evidence such as psychological assessments (&#8220;battered woman syndrome&#8221;). Furthermore, in 
some countries a rape victim must present eye witnesses in order to prove that the crime took 
place, which is obviously problematic in cases of sexual violence. Evidence of the prior sexual 
conduct of the victim is also frequently used during trials of crimes of sexual violence, in an 
attempt to prove that the victim is predisposed to promiscuity and therefore consented to sex on 
the occasion in question. The admission of this type of evidence increases the trauma of 
testifying, as women may be humiliated and forced to expose aspects of their private lives that 
are irrelevant for the crime being tried. Another particular dilemma is the double requirement for 
a victim to show that on the one hand the act of violence was traumatizing, but that on the other 
hand, this does not limit the credibility of the testimony. 
</p>
<p>63. In this regard, much can be learned from international criminal courts. The Furundzija 
decision of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia clearly stated that 
post-traumatic stress disorder does not affect the credibility of the witness. It was the first 
international court to adopt a rule prohibiting the admission of evidence relating to the prior 
sexual conduct of the victim.<b>85</b> Also the rules of the International Criminal Court (ICC) explicitly 
provide that silence or lack of resistance cannot be used to imply consent, and that consent 
cannot be inferred from the words or conduct of the victim if the victim was subjected to force, 
threats of force or a coercive environment.<b>86</b> The Special Rapporteur further stresses that in 
situations where the perpetrator has complete control over the victim the issue of consent 
becomes irrelevant.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>64. In addition, the ICC established a Victims and Witnesses Unit within the Registry, which 
applies protective measures and security arrangements, including counselling and other 
appropriate assistance.<b>87</b> During trial, victims and witnesses to crimes involving sexual violence 
can be protected from physical violence or further stigmatization. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Rehabilitation and reparation for women-survivors of torture 
</b></p>
<p>65. In the past the needs of female victims of torture, in particular victims of sexual violence 
have often drawn little attention. The case of the survivors of Japan&#8217;s military sexual slavery 
practices during the Second World War is a clear lesson of what happens when the needs of 
victims are completely ignored. As the Committee against Torture has stated: &#8220;The survivors of 
the wartime abuses, acknowledged by the State party representative as having suffered &#8216;incurable 
wounds&#8217;, experience continuing abuse and re-traumatization as a result of the State party&#8217;s 
official denial of the facts, concealment or failure to disclose other facts, failure to prosecute 
those criminally responsible for acts of torture, and failure to provide adequate rehabilitation to 
the victims and survivors.&#8221;<b>88</b> 
</p>
<p>66. As can be seen from this example, stigma is a central obstacle hindering justice for victims. 
It is the stigma that comes with sexual violence that means that sometimes victims, especially 
minors, do not use the word &#8220;rape&#8221; to describe what happened to them (they might rather use 
words like &#8220;make love&#8221;, which does not necessarily imply that violence was used; it is therefore 
critical to make an assessment of the circumstances). In this regard, it is interesting to underline 
the power of naming an act as torture at the individual level: victims of sexual violence in 
Guatemala have reported feeling more protected from social stigmatization when the crime is 
defined as torture rather than rape, forced impregnation or sexual slavery. Women who became 
mothers as a result of rape, as well as their children and partners, need special psychological 
support.

connection with gender-blind reparation following armed conflict in the past and enumerate 
guiding principles for future reparation policies. The Special Rapporteur would like to stress 
 that &#8220;truth-telling&#8221; is a crucial element of reparation and that criminal justice is at the core of 
any reparation process and must never be restricted.<b>91</b> Bringing perpetrators to justice is at

</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>With regard to a gender-sensitive definition of torture, the Special Rapporteur 
referred to the elements contained in the definition of the Convention against Torture and 
stressed that the purpose element is always fulfilled when it comes to gender-specific 
violence against women, in that such violence is inherently discriminatory and one of the 
possible purposes enumerated in the Convention is discrimination. He also proposed to 
introduce an additional element, &#8220;powerlessness&#8221; to underline that, whereas detention 
contexts are classic situations of powerlessness, it can also arise outside of detention or 
direct State control. Situations constituting of de facto deprivation of liberty may occur in 
different &#8220;private&#8221; settings. There are also contexts, where fear can create a situation of 
total control: battered wives, victims of trafficking, as well as women prisoners who have 
been abused are likely to experience a permanent state of fear based on the unpredictable 
behaviour of the perpetrator. The Special Rapporteur considers that the concept of 
&#8220;acquiescence&#8221;, aside from the protection obligations, entails a duty for the State to 
prevent acts of torture in the private sphere and recalls that the concept of due diligence 
should be applied to examine whether States have lived up to their obligations.</b> 
</p>
<p>69. <b>Echoing international and national jurisprudence, the Special Rapporteur stressed 
that rape and other serious acts of sexual violence by officials in contexts of detention or 
control not only amount to torture or ill-treatment, but also constitute a particular 
egregious form of it, due to the stigmatization they carry. He also recalled that forced 
abortions or sterilizations carried out by State officials in accordance with coercive family 
planning laws or policies may amount to torture and that any form of corporal punishment 
is forbidden under international law. Regarding women-specific aspects of detention, he 
stressed that special attention should be paid to pregnant women and mothers of young 
babies and the hygienic needs of women. He also pointed to the heightened risk of torture 
and ill-treatment if women are guarded by men or not strictly separated from male 
co-detainees. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Special Rapporteur concluded that torture and ill-treatment can occur in 
different private contexts. He pointed to the striking parallels between &#8220;official&#8221; and 
&#8220;private&#8221; torture in terms of strategies, process and resulting trauma, and showed that 
State acquiescence can occur at different levels. In order to ensure a gender-inclusive 
approach to torture, the Special Rapporteur underlined the need to perceive it as a process. 
Mental trauma does not happen at one point in time, but needs to be put in context. With 
regard to sexual violence, stigma is a crucial element at all stages, starting from its 
humiliating intention as well as its impact which, apart from the often devastating physical 
and mental consequences, often entails exclusion from the family and/or community and 
can lead to outright destitution. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Special Rapporteur underlined that it is crucial to interpret the torture 
protection framework in the light of a wide range of human rights guarantees, in particular 
the set of rules that has developed to combat violence against women, which can provide </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>valuable insights into the particular challenges posed by violence against women. 
Furthermore, many lessons can be drawn from international criminal law, in particular 
when it comes to conceptualizing what acts can be encompassed by the term &#8220;rape&#8221; and 
gender-sensitive rules of evidence and procedure. Refugee law provides valuable insights 
not only into the long-term effects of some types of violence, but also in regard to a lack of 
action to protect by a given State. Furthermore, other disciplines, such as psychology and 
medicine, should be looked to more systematically when analysing whether a specific 
violation may constitute torture or not. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>With regard to justice for women victims of torture, the Special Rapporteur found 
that in many contexts, the criminal law system, the court rules of procedure and evidence, 
as well as reparation and rehabilitation programmes and policies are not sufficiently 
gender-sensitive. He also stressed that the victim&#8217;s consent can never be implied in a 
de facto situation of powerlessness. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur therefore calls upon States to ensure that women victims 
of torture and ill-treatment by officials enjoy full protection under the law and that 
special measures are taken to prevent sexual violence in the contexts of detention and 
control. He also strongly recommends that torture and ill-treatment be understood in a 
gender-inclusive way and that States extend their prevention efforts to fully include torture 
and ill-treatment of women, even if it occurs in the &#8220;private&#8221; sphere. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon States to address stigma, as a central obstacle 
hindering women victims to search justice, in particular in cases of sexual violence, at all 
stages of the criminal process. Special measures need to be taken to ensure that women 
report torture and ill-treatment and that those who receive these complaints secure the 
necessary evidence in a gender-sensitive manner. Court rules need to be adapted to the 
special needs of victims of sexual violence and ensure that objective assessments of the 
de facto powerlessness of a victim are made on a case-by-case basis. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>As proclaimed by the Nairobi Declaration on Women&#8217;s and Girls&#8217; Right to a Remedy 
and Reparation, reparation and rehabilitation programmes should be inclusive and 
participatory at all stages. Truth-telling, criminal justice and ensuring non-repetition 
should be at their core. The categories of crimes that trigger reparation should explicitly 
mention gender-specific forms of torture and ill-treatment. Special attention needs to be 
paid to measures aimed at overcoming the stigmatization of victims of sexual violence and 
to address the socio-economic impact of violence against women. Victims should also have 
access to medical services and to support programmes that focus on the psychological 
trauma caused by sexual violence. The same is applicable to individual rehabilitation 
processes. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>With regard to gender-sensitive monitoring/fact-finding, the Special Rapporteur 
stresses that anti-torture monitoring mechanisms at the national and international levels 
should extend their scrutiny of the legal framework to a broad range of laws that might be </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>of particular concern to women.92 The network of partners should include women&#8217;s rights 
groups and relevant academic and research institutions. Further, social care centres and 
psychiatric institutions should be included in the visits. He also recommended that 
monitoring/fact-finding teams be composed in a gender-inclusive manner (including female 
doctors) and that all its members be trained to deal with sexual violence and other sensitive 
gender-specific issues. Fact-finders and monitors need to be able to ask the right questions 
using gender-sensitive language and to assess the psychological trauma that comes with 
violence, in particular sexual violence. Also, to the extent possible, fact-finding should pay 
attention to the private sphere: whereas it would not be feasible to visit private homes to 
assess whether domestic violence occurs, an effort can be made at accessing sources that 
would know about domestic violence, trafficking, female genital mutilation and other forms 
of &#8220;private&#8221; torture and ill-treatment of women. In such a scenario, fact-finding should 
include interviews with victims at shelters to assess the prevention and protection gaps, and 
medical institutions should be consulted.
