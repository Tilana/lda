<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association presents its first thematic report to the Human Rights Council, pursuant to 
Council resolution 15/21. 
</p>
<p> Following an introduction (chap. I), the Special Rapporteur provides in chapter II an 
overview of his activities during the first year of his mandate. 
</p>
<p> In chapter III, the Special Rapporteur highlights best practices that promote and 
protect the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. The right of peaceful 
assembly covers not only the right to hold and to participate in a peaceful assembly but also 
the right to be protected from undue interference. It further protects those monitoring 
peaceful assemblies. The right to freedom of association ranges from the creation to the 
termination of an association, and includes the rights to form and to join an association, to 
operate freely and to be protected from undue interference, to access funding and resources 
and to take part in the conduct of public affairs. This chapter ends with an emphasis on the 
right to an effective remedy and accountability for human rights violations and abuses. 
</p>
<p> In chapter IV, the Special Rapporteur outlines his conclusions and recommendations 
to relevant stakeholders.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special Rapporteur on 
the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association pursuant to Human Rights 
Council resolution 15/21. This is the first thematic report of the Special Rapporteur, who 
took up his functions on 1 May 2011. It introduces the activities of the Special Rapporteur 
over the period 1 May 2011 to 30 April 2012, and highlights, what he considers &#8220;best 
</p>
<p>practices, including national practices and experiences, that promote and protect the rights 
to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association&#8221; (para. 5 (b) of the resolution).  
</p>
<p>2. &#8220;Best practice&#8221; not only applies to what is required by international human rights 
law, but also includes principles that go beyond these legally binding obligations 
(A/HRC/16/51, para. 10). It refers to both legal and institutional frameworks and must be 
based on an existing or emerging practice, coming from State institutions, 
intergovernmental organizations, international treaty bodies, international, regional or 
domestic courts (jurisprudence) or scholars.  
</p>
<p>3. In order to identify such best practices, the Special Rapporteur sent a questionnaire 
to Member States, national human rights institutions, regional human rights mechanisms, 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other stakeholders. A total of 87 replies were 
received (see A/HRC/20/27/Add.1). The Special Rapporteur is grateful to those who 
responded to his questionnaire. For the sake of ensuring a balanced approach, he 
encourages any stakeholder to engage with him and to comment on any issues mentioned in 
the present report so as to ensure that the best practices identified rightly reflect the 
situation on the ground. As prescribed by Council resolution 15/21, the Special Rapporteur 
also used other &#8220;elements of work available within the Council&#8221; to prepare this report. He 
further referred to urgent appeals and allegation letters sent by special procedure mandate 
holders.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur underlines that, while the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association are clearly interrelated, interdependent and mutually 
reinforcing, they are also two separate rights. They are indeed in most cases governed by 
two different types of legislation and, as shown in the present report, they face different 
challenges. This implies that each should be treated separately. The present report therefore 
covers successively best practices related to the right of peaceful assembly and to the right 
to freedom of association. 
</p>
<p>5. Considering the very large scope of the rights at stake, this report does not pretend, 
nor intend to be exhaustive, but rather aims at presenting a first overview of legal and 
institutional frameworks that should be adopted and implemented to comply with the spirit 
and the letter of human rights in the context of the rights of freedom of peaceful assembly 
and of association. 
</p>
<p>6. Although the present report is related to best practices, the Special Rapporteur 
believes it is important to bear in mind that, in certain contexts, the rights of peaceful 
assembly and to freedom of association are totally or partially denied, as seen in many 
countries at the time of drafting the report. </p>


<p><b> II. Activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Communications  
</b></p>
<p>7. A total of 140 communications were sent by the Special Rapporteur from 1 May 
2011 to 30 April 2012. Observations on countries to which communications were addressed 
throughout the year are enclosed in an addendum of the present report 
(A/HRC/20/27/Add.4). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits  
</b></p>
<p>8. Since 1 May 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent 41 country visit requests. The 
Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Georgia for its collaboration during his first 
country mission from 6 to 13 February 2012 (see A/HRC/20/27/Add.2 for final conclusions 
and recommendations). He further thanks Azerbaijan, Guatemala, Honduras, the 
Kyrgyzstan, Maldives, Tunisia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland for extending an invitation. However, he deeply regrets that the Government of the 
Syrian Arab Republic did not respond to his letter dated 1 December 2011, in which he 
proposed dates for a mission, after the Government extended an invitation for a mission to 
take place &#8220;during the first months of [2012]&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Participation in various events  
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur took part in two regional consultations that helped him 
gather relevant inputs for the elaboration of the present report, organized by the Human 
Rights House Foundation and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights 
(ODIHR), and the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies and the International Service 
for Human Rights, respectively. From 2 to 4 February 2012, in Tbilisi, he had the 
opportunity to meet with representatives from civil society from, inter alia, Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Hungary, Norway, Poland, 
the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey and the 
United Kingdom; as well as with activists from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan 
in cooperation with the Open Society Institute. On 13 and 14 April 2012, in Cairo, he 
participated in a regional consultation, which brought together human rights defenders from 
the Middle East and North Africa region, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders and the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8223; Rights Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>10. In terms of conferences, on 12 July 2011, the Special Rapporteur met with the 
Secretary General of the Organization of American States in Washington, D.C. From 14 to 
16 September 2011, he participated in the sixth Dublin Platform for Human Rights 
Defenders, organized by Front Line, The International Foundation for the Protection of 
Human Rights Defenders. From 21 to 23 November 2011, he attended the conference 
&#8222;Protecting Democracy &#8211; Reclaiming Civil Society Space in Africa&#8221;, organized by the 
Centre for Citizens&#8223; Participation in the African Union, which took place in Johannesburg, 
South Africa. On 30 November 2011, he participated in the Fourth High Level Forum on 
Aid Effectiveness, held in Pusan, Republic of Korea. On 17 and 18 January 2012, in Addis 
Ababa, he participated in a consultation between special procedures mandate holders of the 
United Nations and the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8223; Rights. From 26 to 28 
January 2012, he participated in the 2012 Wilton Park conference, organized by the 
Governments of Norway and Switzerland and entitled &#8220;Peaceful protest: a cornerstone of 
democracy. How to address the challenges?&#8221; On 14 and 15 March 2012, he attended the </p>


<p>European Union Presidency Conference entitled &#8220;Civil Society Organisations, Human 
Rights and Development&#8221; in Copenhagen, organized by Concord Danmark and, on 16 
March 2012, he attended the Fiftieth Anniversary Conference of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of Denmark in Copenhagen. 
</p>
<p>11. On 13 September 2011, pursuant to Council decision 17/120, the Special Rapporteur 
participated in a panel discussion on the promotion and protection of human rights in the 
context of peaceful protest, organized during the eighteenth session of the Council. The 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights prepared a summary 
report of the discussion (A/HRC/19/40). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Best practices related to the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Common principles  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>12. The rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association serve as a vehicle for 
the exercise of many other civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. The rights 
are essential components of democracy as they empower men and women to &#8220;express their 
political opinions, engage in literary and artistic pursuits and other cultural, economic and 
social activities, engage in religious observances or other beliefs, form and join trade unions 
and cooperatives, and elect leaders to represent their interests and hold them accountable&#8221; 
(Council resolution 15/21, preamble). Such interdependence and interrelatedness with other 
rights make them a valuable indicator of a State&#8223;s respect for the enjoyment of many other 
</p>
<p>human rights.  
</p>
<p>13. Resolution 15/21 reaffirms that &#8220;<i>everyone</i> has the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association&#8221; (emphasis added). This provision must be read jointly with 
article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which stipulates that 
&#8220;each State Party undertakes to respect and to ensure to <i>all</i> individuals within its territory 
and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the Covenant, without distinction of 
any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or 
social origin, property, birth or other status&#8221;(emphasis added)., and article 26 thereof, which 
guarantees to all individuals equal and effective protection against discrimination on 
grounds identified in article 2. This applies inter alia to minors, indigenous peoples, persons 
with disabilities, persons belonging to minority groups or other groups at risk, including 
those victims of discrimination because of their sexual orientation and gender identity (see 
Council resolution 17/19), non-nationals including stateless persons, refugees1 or migrants, 
as well as associations, including unregistered groups. The rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association are key human rights in international human rights law, which 
are enshrined in article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>14. The right to freedom of peaceful assembly is guaranteed in article 21 of the 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the right to freedom of association in article 22. 
They are also reflected in article 8 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights and in other specific international2 and regional human rights treaties or 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Article 15 of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees  
 2 Article 7 (c) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; 
</p>
<p>International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 87 (1948) concerning Freedom of 
Association and Protection of the Right to Organise. </p>


<p>instruments,3 including the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, 
Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (art. 5). 
</p>
<p>15. According to article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
the right of peaceful assembly and the right to freedom of association are not absolute 
rights. Resolution 15/21 (OP 4) makes clear that they &#8220;can be subject to certain restrictions, 
</p>
<p>which are prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests 
of national security or public safety, public order (<i>ordre</i> <i>public</i>), the protection of public 
health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that only &#8220;certain&#8221; restrictions may be applied, 
which clearly means that freedom is to be considered the rule and its restriction the 
exception. He refers to general comment No. 27 (1999) of the Human Rights Committee on 
freedom of movement: &#8220;in adopting laws providing for restrictions &#8230; States should always 
be guided by the principle that the restrictions must not impair the essence of the right ... 
the relation between right and restriction, between norm and exception, must not be 
reversed&#8221;. As a result, when States would like to restrict these rights, all the above 
conditions must be met. Any restrictions must therefore be motivated by one of the above 
limited interests, have a legal basis (be &#8220;prescribed by law&#8221;, which implies that the law 
</p>
<p>must be accessible and its provisions must be formulated with sufficient precision) and be 
&#8220;necessary in a democratic society&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>17. As outlined by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), 
&#8220;the word &#8222;necessity&#8223; does not mean &#8222;absolutely necessary&#8223; or &#8222;indispensable&#8223;, but neither 
</p>
<p>does it have the flexibility of terms such as &#8222;useful&#8223; or &#8222;convenient&#8223;: instead, the term 
</p>
<p>means that there must be a &#8222;pressing social need&#8223; for the interference&#8221;.4 When such a 
pressing social need arises, States have then to ensure that any restrictive measures fall 
within the limit of what is acceptable in a &#8220;democratic society&#8221;. In that regard, longstanding 
</p>
<p>jurisprudence asserts that democratic societies exist only where &#8220;pluralism, tolerance and 
</p>
<p>broadmindedness&#8221;5 are in place. Hence, States cannot undermine the very existence of these 
attributes when restricting these rights. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur refers to 
general comment No. 31 (2004) of the Human Rights Committee on the nature of the 
general legal obligation imposed on States parties to the Covenant, which provides that 
&#8220;where such restrictions are made, States must demonstrate their necessity and only take 
such measures as are proportionate to the pursuance of legitimate aims in order to ensure 
continuous and effective protection of Covenant rights&#8221; (para. 6).  
</p>
<p>18. In addition, only propaganda for war or advocacy for national, racial or religious 
hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence (art. 20 of the 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) or acts aimed at the destruction of the rights and 
freedoms enshrined in international human rights law (art. 5) should be deemed unlawful.  
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur further particularly emphasizes that the right to life and the 
right to be free from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment should 
be guaranteed by States to all individuals under all circumstances and at all times, including 
in the context of the exercise of the rights to freedom of association and of peaceful 
assembly, as prescribed by article 4 of the Covenant. The Special Rapporteur recalls that, 
</p>
<p>  
 3 It is worth noting that the word &#8220;peaceful&#8221; is absent from article 11 of the African Charter on Human 
</p>
<p>and Peoples&#8223; Rights.

</i></p>
<p><i>Freedom of Association with an Emphasis on Non-Governmental Organizations</i>, para. 5.  
 5 European Court of Human Rights, <i>Handyside </i>v.<i> the United Kingdom</i>, application No. 5493/72, 7 
</p>
<p>December 1976, para. 49. </p>


<p>according to the Human Rights Committee, during a state of emergency, the rights to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and of association shall not be derogated since &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>possibility of restricting certain Covenant rights under the terms of, for instance &#8230; freedom 
of assembly is generally sufficient during such situations and no derogation from the 
provisions in question would be justified by the exigencies of the situation&#8221;.6  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Environment in which these rights are exercised  
</b></p>
<p>20. The rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are constitutionally 
guaranteed in most countries. In many States, specific domestic laws further govern the 
exercise of these rights. However, in many instances, domestic legislation in place listed 
grounds additional to those already prescribed by international human rights law or 
ambiguous. The Special Rapporteur warns against arbitrary interpretations of such grounds 
for restriction. He further cautions against an environment in which the enjoyment of these 
rights is seriously impeded. 
</p>
<p>21. The legitimate combat against terrorism, and other security considerations, has been 
used as a justification for the adoption of a state of emergency or other stricter rules to void 
the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. In many instances, 
emergency regulations have been used to clampdown on freedoms of peaceful assembly, of 
association and of expression. On different occasions, the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism has stressed in a report to the General Assembly that &#8220;States should not need to 
resort to derogation measures in the area of freedom of assembly and association. Instead, 
limitation measures, as provided for in ICCPR, are sufficient in an effective fight against 
terrorism&#8221; (A/61/267, para. 53). 
</p>
<p>22. Country-specific contexts sometimes extinguish the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association. In situations of armed conflict, individuals who desire to 
assemble and associate freely, even to address emergency needs or to call for the end of 
violence, may meet drastic restrictions that may amount to a strict denial of their rights.  
</p>
<p>23. The context of elections may also heavily impact on the rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association. This is particularly the case when assemblies are 
systematically prohibited or when individuals active in associations promoting transparent 
and fair electoral processes and defending democratic principles are subject to harassment 
and intimidation for their civic activism.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Best practices related to the right to freedom of peaceful assembly</b>7<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>1. Definition of a peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p>24. An &#8220;assembly&#8221; is an intentional and temporary gathering in a private or public space 
for a specific purpose. It therefore includes demonstrations, inside meetings, strikes,8 
processions, rallies or even sits-in. Assemblies play a vibrant role in mobilizing the 
population and formulating grievances and aspirations, facilitating the celebration of events 
and, importantly, influencing States&#8223; public policy.  
</p>
<p>  
 6 General comment No. 29 (2001) on derogations from provisions of the Covenant during a state of 
</p>
<p>emergency, para. 5.  
 7 The Special Rapporteur extensively refers to the OSCE/ODIHR <i>Guidelines on Freedom of Peaceful 
</i></p>
<p><i>Assembly</i> (2007, Warsaw, second ed.), which he considers the most advanced set of good practices 
available at the time of drafting. </p>
<p> 8 Due to word limit, the report will not cover strikes.   </p>


<p>25. The Special Rapporteur agrees that international human rights law only protects 
assemblies that are peaceful, i.e. those that are not violent, and where participants have 
peaceful intentions, which should be presumed. 9  According to the European Court of 
Human Rights, &#8220;an individual does not cease to enjoy the right to peaceful assembly as a 
result of sporadic violence or other punishable acts committed by others in the course of the 
demonstration, if the individual in question remains peaceful in his or her own intentions or 
behaviour&#8221;.10 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>2. The right to hold and to participate in a peaceful assembly  
</b></p>
<p>26. Fundamentally, the Special Rapporteur considers as a best practice the presumption 
in favour of holding peaceful assemblies, as stressed by the OSCE/ODIHR Panel of Experts 
on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly. Such a presumption should be &#8220;clearly and explicitly 
</p>
<p>established in the law&#8221;,11 enshrined either in constitutions or in laws governing peaceful 
assemblies (e.g. as in Armenia and Romania).  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur stresses that the enjoyment of the right to hold and 
participate in peaceful assemblies entails the fulfilment by the State of its positive 
obligation to facilitate the exercise of this right. In this regard, he highlights the Law on 
Assembly in Armenia, which states that the police shall be obliged to facilitate peaceful 
assemblies (art. 32, para. 2). He further notes with interest the statement of the Her 
Majesty&#8223;s Inspectorate of Constabulary of the United Kingdom, an independent assessment 
institution, which stated that &#8220;the police as a service has recognized and adopted the correct 
</p>
<p>starting point for policing protest as the presumption in favour of facilitating peaceful 
protest&#8221;.12 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur believes that the exercise of fundamental freedoms should 
not be subject to previous authorization by the authorities (as explicitly expressed in the 
Spanish Constitution), but at the most to a prior notification procedure, whose rationale is 
to allow State authorities to facilitate the exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and to take measures to protect public safety and order and the rights and 
freedoms of others.13 Such a notification should be subject to a proportionality assessment, 
not unduly bureaucratic14 and be required a maximum of, for example, 48 hours prior to the 
day the assembly is planned to take place. A notification procedure is in force in several 
countries, including Armenia, Austria, Canada, Cote d&#8223;Ivoire, Finland, Indonesia, Morocco, 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Portugal, Senegal, Serbia, and the United Republic of 
Tanzania. Prior notification should ideally be required only for large meetings or meetings 
which may disrupt road traffic.15 In the Republic of Moldova, any assembly of fewer than 
50 participants may take place without prior notification and the change from an 
authorization to a notification procedure fostered an increase in the number of individuals 
exercising their right to freedom of peaceful assembly. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur regrets that the law on demonstrations recently adopted by referendum in the 
canton of Geneva, Switzerland, provides for a fine of up to 100,000 Swiss francs for

<p>anyone who, inter alia, does not request an authorization to demonstrate or does not respect 
the content of the authorization.16 
</p>
<p>29. Should the organizers fail to notify the authorities, the assembly should not be 
dissolved automatically (e.g. as in Austria) and the organizers should not be subject to 
criminal sanctions, or administrative sanctions resulting in fines or imprisonment. This is 
all the more relevant in the case of spontaneous assemblies where the organizers are unable 
to comply with the requisite notification requirements, or where there is no existing or 
identifiable organizer. In this context, the Special Rapporteur holds as best practice 
legislation allowing the holding of spontaneous assemblies, which should be exempted 
from prior notification. This is the case for example, in Armenia, Estonia, Germany, the 
Republic of Moldova and Slovenia. In this connection, the European Court of Human 
Rights has emphasized that &#8220;in special circumstances when an immediate response, in the 
form of a demonstration, to a political event might be justified, a decision to disband the 
ensuing, peaceful assembly solely because of the absence of the requisite prior notice, 
without any illegal conduct by the participants, amounts to a disproportionate restriction on 
freedom of peaceful assembly&#8221;.17  
</p>
<p>30. In the case of simultaneous assemblies at the same place and time, the Special 
Rapporteur considers it good practice to allow, protect and facilitate all events, whenever 
possible. In the case of counter-demonstrations, which aim at expressing discontent with 
the message of other assemblies, such demonstrations should take place, but should not 
dissuade participants of the other assemblies from exercising their right to freedom of 
peaceful assembly. In this respect, the role of law enforcement authorities in protecting and 
facilitating the events is crucial. 
</p>
<p>31. With regard to the responsibilities of organizers, the Special Rapporteur is of the 
opinion that &#8220;organizers should not incur any financial charges for the provision of public 
</p>
<p>services during an assembly (such as policing, medical services and other health and safety 
measures)&#8221;.18 He is informed that, in Austria, there are no fees to be paid for the protection 
of assemblies.19 Most importantly, &#8220;assembly organizers and participants should not be 
considered responsible (or held liable) for the unlawful conduct of others&#8230; [and, together 
with] assembly stewards, should not be made responsible for the maintenance of public 
order&#8221;.20 The Special Rapporteur considers as a good practice, when necessary, the use of 
stewards appointed by the organizers of an assembly, i.e. persons who provide assistance to 
them by, inter alia, informing and orienting the public during the event. Stewards should be 
clearly identifiable and properly trained.   
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur notes the increased use of the Internet, in particular social 
media, and other information and communication technology, as basic tools which enable 
individuals to organize peaceful assemblies. However, some States have clamped down on 
these tools to deter or prevent citizens from exercising their right. In this connection, the 
Special Rapporteur refers to a recent report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, in which he recommended, 
inter alia, that &#8220;all States [should] ensure that Internet access is maintained at all times,

</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>3. The right to be protected from undue interference 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Positive obligation 
</i></p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur stresses that States have a positive obligation to actively 
protect peaceful assemblies. Such obligation includes the protection of participants of 
peaceful assemblies from individuals or groups of individuals, including agents 
provocateurs and counter-demonstrators, who aim at disrupting or dispersing such 
assemblies. Such individuals include those belonging to the State apparatus or working on 
its behalf. The organizers and stewards of assemblies should not assume this obligation. 
The Special Rapporteur believes that such responsibility should always be explicitly stated 
in domestic legislation, as it is in, inter alia, the Republic of Moldova, Serbia and Slovenia. 
In Armenia, organizers may request police officials to remove provocateurs from the 
assembly venue (even if in practice the implementation of this provision is reportedly 
sometimes problematic). The Special Rapporteur holds as a good practice the establishment 
in Estonia of a Police Rapid Response Unit (riot police) which aims at protecting peaceful 
demonstrators against attacks by provocateurs and counter-demonstrators and is trained in 
how to separate the main provocateurs from peaceful demonstrators.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur expresses his utmost concern in relation to peaceful 
assemblies that were either not allowed or violently dispersed in a number of countries, 
such as in Bahrain, Belarus, China, Egypt, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Malawi, Malaysia, 
Sri Lanka and the Syrian Arab Republic.21  
</p>
<p>35. The right to life (art. 3 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and art. 6 of 
the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) and the right to be free from torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (art. 5 of the Declaration and art. 7 of the 
Covenant) should be the overarching principles governing the policing of public 
assemblies, as stated by several countries. In this regard, soft law provisions &#8211; the Code of 
Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials (in particular articles 2 and 3) and the Basic 
Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (in particular 
principles 4, 9 and 13) &#8211; aim at guiding law enforcement officials when policing peaceful 
protests. In this connection, the Inter-American Court on Human Rights stated that the 
&#8220;pretext of maintenance of public security cannot be invoked to violate the right to life &#8230;  
the State must ensure that, if it is necessary to resort to physical means ... members of its 
armed forces and its security bodies will use only those means that are indispensable to 
control such situations in a rational and proportional manner, and respecting the rights to 
life and to humane treatment&#8221;.22 The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions also stated that &#8220;the only circumstances warranting the use of firearms, 
including during demonstrations, is the imminent threat of death or serious injury&#8221; 
(A/HRC/17/28, para. 60). With regard to the use of tear gas, the Special Rapporteur recalls 
that gas does not discriminate between demonstrators and non-demonstrators, healthy 
people and people with health conditions. He also warns against any modification of the 
chemical composition of the gas for the sole purpose of inflicting severe pain on protestors 
and, indirectly, bystanders. 
</p>
<p>  
 21 See, inter alia, reports on summaries of individual cases raised by special procedures mandate 
</p>
<p>holders, and on observations on communications transmitted to Governments and replies received, as 
well as press releases issued by such mandate holders and high-level United Nations officials. 
</p>
<p> 22 Inter-American Court of Human Rights judgement, <i>Caracazo v. Venezuela</i> (2002), para. 127.   </p>


<p>36. The Special Rapporteur also refers to the Inter-American Commission on Human 
Rights list of administrative controls that should be put in place at the State level to ensure 
use of force during public assemblies on an exceptional basis. Among others, &#8220;(a) 
implementation of mechanisms to prohibit, in an effective manner, the use of lethal force as 
recourse in public demonstrations; (b) implementation of an ammunition registration and 
control system; (c) implementation of a communications records system to monitor 
operational orders, those responsible for them, and those carrying them out&#8221;.23  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur is opposed to the practice of &#8220;kettling&#8221; (or containment) 
whereby demonstrators are surrounded by law enforcement officials and not allowed to 
leave. He notes with satisfaction the statement of the Toronto police (Canada) which 
decided to abandon the practice following controversy arising from the policing of the G-20 
Summit in Toronto in 2010. 
</p>
<p>38. In general, the Special Rapporteur stresses the utmost importance of genuine 
dialogue, including through negotiation, between law enforcement authorities and 
organizers in order to ensure the smooth conduct of the public assembly, as it has 
reportedly been the case in, inter alia, Guatemala, Hungary, Mexico and Switzerland. 
</p>
<p><i> (b)  Negative obligation 
</i></p>
<p>39. States also have a negative obligation not to unduly interfere with the right to 
peaceful assembly. The Special Rapporteur holds as best practice &#8220;laws governing freedom 
</p>
<p>of assembly [that] both avoid blanket time and location prohibitions, and provide for the 
possibility of other less intrusive restrictions &#8230; Prohibition should be a measure of last 
resort and the authorities may prohibit a peaceful assembly only when a less restrictive 
response would not achieve the legitimate aim(s) pursued by the authorities.&#8221;24  
</p>
<p>40. As mentioned earlier, any restrictions imposed must be necessary and proportionate 
to the aim pursued. Reference to the proportionality test is found in legislation governing 
peaceful assemblies in a number of countries, including New Zealand and Switzerland. In 
addition, such restrictions must be facilitated within &#8220;sight and sound&#8221; of its object and 
target audience,25 and &#8220;organizers of peaceful assemblies should not be coerced to follow 
the authorities&#8223; suggestions if these would undermine the essence of their right to freedom 
</p>
<p>of peaceful assembly&#8221;.26 In this connection, he warns against the practice whereby 
authorities allow a demonstration to take place, but only in the outskirts of the city or in a 
specific square, where its impact will be muted. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur further concurs with the assessment of the ODIHR Panel of 
Experts that &#8220;the free flow of traffic should not automatically take precedence over freedom 
</p>
<p>of peaceful assembly&#8221;.27 In this regard, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
has indicated that &#8220;the competent institutions of the State have a duty to design operating 
plans and procedures that will facilitate the exercise of the right of assembly ... [including] 
rerouting pedestrian and vehicular traffic in a certain area&#8221;.28 Furthermore, the Special 
Rapporteur points to a decision of the Spanish Constitutional Court which stated that &#8220;in a 
democratic society, the urban space is not only an area for circulation, but also for 
participation&#8221;.

<p>42. The Special Rapporteur stresses the importance of the regulatory authorities 
providing assembly organizers with &#8220;timely and fulsome reasons for the imposition of any 
restrictions, and the possibility of an expedited appeal procedure&#8221;.29 The organizers should 
be able to appeal before an independent and impartial court, which should take a decision 
promptly. In several States, the regulatory authority has the obligation to justify its decision 
(e.g. Senegal and Spain). In Bulgaria, the organizer of an assembly may file an appeal 
within three days of receipt of a decision banning an assembly; the competent 
administrative court shall then rule on the ban within 24 hours, and the decision of the court 
shall be announced immediately and is final. Similarly, in Estonia, a complaint may be filed 
with an administrative court, which is required to make a decision within the same or next 
day; the organizers may also launch a complaint with the Estonian Ombudsman.  
</p>
<p><i> (c)  Build and strengthen the human rights capacity of administrative and law enforcement 
</i></p>
<p><i>officials 
</i></p>
<p>43. It is important that States ensure that administrative and law enforcement officials 
are adequately trained in relation to the respect of the right to freedom of peaceful 
assembly. 
</p>
<p>44. In countries where a regime of authorization is in place, the Special Rapporteur 
believes that administrative officials in charge of issuing authorizations should be subject to 
oversight on a regular basis in order to make sure that they do not arbitrarily reject requests 
to hold public assemblies (e.g. Slovenia). In this context, a workshop on the implementation 
of the law on peaceful assembly for the attention of administrative officials in charge of 
implementing the law was organized in Slovenia. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that, in most countries which 
responded to the questionnaire, capacity-building activities on international human rights 
law, and sometimes on international humanitarian law, are provided to law enforcement, 
notably in police academies, and other authorities (e.g. Cote d&#8223;Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, 
</p>
<p>Estonia, Honduras, Germany, Guatemala, Iraq, Mexico, Morocco, Peru, Senegal, Spain, 
Switzerland, United Kingdom and Uruguay). Such trainings were delivered in cooperation, 
inter alia, with national human rights institutions (e.g. Denmark, Hungary, Indonesia, Iraq, 
Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Paraguay, 
United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda), the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (e.g. Mexico and Uganda), the OSCE/ODIHR (e.g. 
Armenia and Bulgaria), the European Commission (e.g. Bulgaria), NGOs (e.g. Armenia, 
Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Malaysia and Serbia), universities (e.g. Morocco and 
Mexico), and the International Committee of the Red Cross (Peru). The Special Rapporteur 
stresses the need to provide regular follow-up trainings. 
</p>
<p>46. Several good initiatives were brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur, 
which should be replicated. In Burkina Faso, a seminar on &#8220;public demonstration and 
</p>
<p>human rights: what strategy for a better collaboration between the different actors&#8221; was 
conducted by the Ministry of Justice and the Promotion of Human Rights for the benefit of 
security forces and NGOs. In Slovenia, training initiatives for law enforcements officials on 
the use of non-lethal instruments of constraint (such as batons, tear gas and water canons) 
when maintaining public order were delivered. In the United Kingdom, the police of several 
counties appointed an independent human rights lawyer to advise them on the legality and 
human rights implications of large-scale public order operations in relation to controversial 
protests. 
</p>
<p>  
 29 See submission by the OSCE/ODIHR Panel of Experts. </p>


<p>47. The Special Rapporteur further considers as best practices training materials 
developed with a view to preventing discriminatory treatment and measures against 
women, minors, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples, individuals and groups of 
individuals belonging to minorities and other marginalized groups (e.g. Mexico, Serbia, 
Slovenia and Spain). 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>4. Monitoring peaceful assemblies 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur refers to the report to the General Assembly of the then 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
who stated that &#8220;monitoring of assemblies can provide an impartial and objective account 
</p>
<p>of what takes place, including a factual record of the conduct of both participants and law 
enforcement officials. This is a valuable contribution to the effective enjoyment of the right 
to peaceful assembly. The very presence of human rights monitors during demonstrations 
can deter human rights violations. It is therefore important to allow human rights defenders 
to operate freely in the context of freedom of assembly&#8221; (A/62/225, para. 91).30 Such 
defenders include members of civil society organizations, journalists, &#8220;citizen journalists&#8221;, 
bloggers and representatives of national human rights institutions.  
</p>
<p>49. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur considers good practice the invitation of the 
London Metropolitan Police to Liberty, an independent human rights organization, to act as 
independent observers when they were policing a Trades Union Congress march in London 
in 2010. He also refers to the statement of the Vice-Chair of the Malaysian Human Rights 
Commission (SUHAKAM) made during the panel discussion on the promotion and 
protection of human rights in the context of peaceful protests, at the nineteenth session of 
the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/19/40, para. 33). The Vice-Chair highlighted, inter alia, 
the monitoring role played by SUHAKAM during a sensitive public demonstration, by 
deploying teams of observers. 
</p>
<p>50. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur supports the call of the ODIHR Panel of 
Experts to undertake capacity-building activities for the benefit of NGOs and human rights 
defenders on the ground to monitor assemblies and their policing on a systematic basis. In 
this context, ODIHR trained assembly monitors in Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan and Republic of Moldova, and issued the new <i>Handbook on Monitoring 
Freedom of Assembly</i> in September 2011.31 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Best practices related to the right to freedom of association 
</b></p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>1. Definition of an</b><i> <b></b></i><b>association</b> </p>
<p>51. An &#8220;association&#8221; refers to any groups of individuals or any legal entities brought 
together in order to collectively act, express, promote, pursue or defend a field of common 
interests (see report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights 
defenders, A/59/401, para. 46).  
</p>
<p>52. The word &#8220;association&#8221; refers, inter alia, to civil society organizations, clubs, 
cooperatives, NGOs, religious associations, political parties, trade unions, foundations or 
even online associations as the Internet has been instrumental, for instance, in &#8220;facilitating 
</p>
<p>active citizen participation in building democratic societies&#8221; (A/HRC/17/27, para. 2). The 
Special Rapporteur underscores that these various types of associations are, in most cases, 
regulated by different types of legislations. As he has mainly received information 
</p>
<p>  
 30 A/62/225, para. 91.  
 31 OSCE/ODIHR, 2011, Warsaw. Available from www.osce.org/odihr/82979. </p>


<p>regarding allegations impacting civil society&#8223;s work since the inception of his mandate, and 
due to the word limit, the present section of the report will primarily focus on this type of 
association, but will address others when relevant. This will not prevent him from focusing 
on other forms of associations in his future reports. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The right to form and to join an association 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the right to form and join an association is 
an inherent part of the right to freedom of association. It also includes the right to form and 
join trade unions for the protection of one&#8223;s interests, as enshrined in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>54. International human rights law stipulates that everyone has the rights to freedom of 
association. As a result, legislation that does not set any specific limitation on individuals, 
including children (e.g. national human rights institution of Cote d&#8223;Ivoire) and foreign 
</p>
<p>nationals (e.g. Burkina Faso and the United States of America) complies with international 
standards. However, under international human rights law, members of the armed forces 
and of the police may have their right lawfully restricted. Any restrictions must, 
nevertheless, comply with States&#8223; international human rights obligations as blanket 
</p>
<p>restrictions shall not be considered lawful. The Special Rapporteur further considers as a 
best practice the Armenian and Estonian legislation that require no more than two persons 
to establish an association. A higher number may be required to establish a union or a 
political party, but this number should not be set at a level that would discourage people 
from engaging in associations.  
</p>
<p>55. An important component of the right to freedom of association is that no one may be 
compelled to belong to an association (e.g. Chile, Guatemala, Portugal and Republic of 
Moldova). Likewise, associations should be free to choose their members and whether to be 
open to any membership.32 This aspect is particularly relevant for unions or political parties 
since a direct interference in their membership may jeopardize their independence.33 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur underlines that the right to freedom of association equally 
protects associations that are not registered (e.g. Canada, Republic of Moldova, Slovenia 
and the United States).  Individuals involved in unregistered associations should indeed be 
free to carry out any activities, including the right to hold and participate in peaceful 
assemblies, and should not be subject to criminal sanctions, as the Special Rapporteur 
regrets is the case in Algeria, Belarus, Cambodia or the Syrian Arab Republic.34 This is 
particularly important when the procedure to establish an association is burdensome and 
subject to administrative discretion, as such criminalization could then be used as a means 
to quell dissenting views or beliefs.  
</p>
<p>57. The European Court on Human Rights clearly ruled &#8220;that citizens should be able to 
form a legal entity in order to act collectively in a field of mutual interest is one of the most 
important aspects of the right to freedom of association, without which that right would be 
deprived of any meaning&#8221;.35 The procedure to establish an association as a legal entity 
varies from one country to another, but it is vital that Government officials act in good 
faith, in a timely and non-selective manner. The Special Rapporteur considers as best

<p>practice procedures which are simple, non-onerous or even free of charge (e.g. Bulgaria) 
and expeditious (e.g. Japan where registration applications may be directly filled in online).  
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that a &#8220;notification procedure&#8221;, rather than 
a &#8220;prior authorization procedure&#8221; that requests the approval of the authorities to establish an 
association as a legal entity, complies better with international human rights law and should 
be implemented by States. Under this notification procedure, associations are automatically 
granted legal personality as soon as the authorities are notified by the founders that an 
organization was created. In most countries, such notification is made through a written 
statement containing a number of elements of information clearly defined in the law, but 
this is not a precondition for the existence of an association. It is rather a submission 
through which the administration records the establishment of the said association. Such a 
notification procedure is in force in a number of countries (e.g. Cote d&#8223;Ivoire, Djibouti, 
</p>
<p>Morocco, Portugal, Senegal, Switzerland and Uruguay).  
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur believes the formation of branches of associations, foreign 
associations or unions or networks of associations, including at the international level, 
should be subject to the same notification procedure.  
</p>
<p>60. Under both notification and prior authorization regimes, registration bodies must be 
bound to act immediately and laws should set short time limits to respond to submissions 
and applications respectively. The Special Rapporteur echoes a ruling of the European 
Court which provided that &#8220;significant delays in the registration procedure, if attributable to 
the Ministry of Justice, amounts to an interference with the exercise of the right of the 
association&#8223;s founders to freedom of association&#8221;.36 During this period associations should 
be presumed to be operating legally until it is proven otherwise (e.g. Uruguay). Failure to 
provide a response within a clear and short time limit should result in a presumption that 
associations are operating legally (e.g. Austria).  
</p>
<p>61. Any decision rejecting the submission or application must be clearly motivated and 
duly communicated in writing to the applicant. Associations whose submissions or 
applications have been rejected should have the opportunity to challenge the decision 
before an independent and impartial court. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur refers to a 
decision of the Freedom of Association Committee of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO), in which it ruled that &#8220;the absence of recourse to a judicial authority 
</p>
<p>against any refusal by the Ministry to grant an authorization to establish a trade union 
violates the principles of freedom of association&#8221;.37 
</p>
<p>62. Newly adopted laws should not request all previously registered associations to re-
register so that existing associations are protected against arbitrary rejection or time gaps in 
the conduct of their activities. For instance, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its 
concluding observations on Nepal, expressed concerns over the wide-ranging restrictions, 
such as re-registration requirements, placed by the authorities on civil society organizations 
(CRC/C/15/Add.260, paras. 33 and 34). 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>3. The right to operate freely and to be protected from undue interference 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Positive obligation 
</i></p>
<p>63. The right to freedom of association obliges States to take positive measures to 
establish and maintain an enabling environment. It is crucial that individuals exercising this

 36 European Court of Human Rights, <i>Ismayilov v. Azerbaijan</i>, application No. 4439/04, 17 January 
</p>

 37 <i>Digest of decisions and principles</i>, para. 274. </p>


<p>right are able to operate freely without fear that they may be subjected to any threats, acts 
of intimidation or violence, including summary or arbitrary executions, enforced or 
involuntary disappearances, arbitrary arrest or detention, torture or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, a media smear campaign, travel ban or arbitrary 
dismissal, notably for unionists. One or several of such violations is/are found in, e.g., 
Belarus, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Israel, the Philippines, , 
Sri Lanka, Syrian Arab Republic and Zimbabwe.38  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Negative obligation 
</i></p>
<p>64. Furthermore, States have a negative obligation not to unduly obstruct the exercise of 
the right to freedom of association. Members of associations should be free to determine 
their statutes, structure and activities and make decisions without State interference (e.g. 
legislation in Bulgaria, Slovakia and Slovenia). Associations pursuing objectives and 
employing means in accordance with international human rights law should benefit from 
international legal protection. Associations should enjoy, inter alia, the rights to express 
opinion, disseminate information, engage with the public and advocate before Governments 
and international bodies for human rights, for the preservation and development of a 
minority&#8223;s culture39 or for changes in law, including changes in the Constitution.40 The 
Special Rapporteur recognizes that the formation of associations embracing minority or 
dissenting views or beliefs may sometimes lead to tensions, but he emphasizes the duty of 
the State to ensure that everyone can peacefully express their views without any fear. For 
instance, in Lesotho, the Registrar General registered the first ever lesbian, gay, bisexual 
and transgender organization in the country called Matrix in November 2010 (after 
numerous delays).  
</p>
<p>65. Authorities must also respect the right of associations to privacy as stipulated in 
article 17 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In this connection, authorities 
should not be entitled to: condition any decisions and activities of the association; reverse 
the election of board members; condition the validity of board members&#8223; decisions on the 
</p>
<p>presence of a Government representative at the board meeting or request that an internal 
decision be withdrawn; request associations to submit annual reports in advance; and enter 
an association&#8223;s premises without advance notice. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the 
</p>
<p>right of independent bodies to examine the associations&#8223; records as a mechanism to ensure 
transparency and accountability, but such a procedure should not be arbitrary and must 
respect the principle of non-discrimination and the right to privacy as it would otherwise 
put the independence of associations and the safety of their members at risk. As a best 
practice, the decision of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8223; Rights found that 
the right to freedom of association had been violated when the Government of Nigeria 
provided the Nigerian Bar Association with a new governing body and laid down that 97 of 
the 128 members constituting this body would be appointed by the Government (report of 
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, A/64/226, para. 34).  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Build and strengthen the human rights capacity of administrative officials 
</i></p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that in Slovenia the Ministry of 
Interior is reportedly regularly supervising the work of its administrative units and checking 
the legality of how the registration procedures are conducted. During the supervision, 
officers in charge of the procedures are offered expert help and interpretation of the law.

<p><i> <b></b></i><b>4. The right to access funding and resources 
</b></p>
<p>67. The ability for associations to access funding and resources is an integral and vital 
part of the right to freedom of association. The Special Rapporteur makes reference to ILO 
principles which underline that &#8220;provisions which give the authorities the right to restrict 
the freedom of a trade union to administer and utilize its funds as it wishes &#8230; are 
incompatible with the principles of freedom of association&#8221;.41 Numerous United Nations 
human rights bodies have also emphasized the principle that associations should access 
funding freely.42  
</p>
<p>68. Any associations, both registered or unregistered, should have the right to seek and 
secure funding and resources from domestic, foreign, and international entities, including 
individuals, businesses, civil society organizations, Governments and international 
organizations. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur notes with concerns that, in some 
countries, only registered associations are eligible for funding and resources. In this 
context, it appears essential that rules regulating the creation of associations comply with 
the aforementioned identified best practices to allow any associations to access funding and 
resources. 
</p>
<p>69. In many countries, domestic funding is very limited or non-existent, leading 
associations to rely on foreign assistance to conduct their activities. The Special Rapporteur 
echoes the recommendations put forward by the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders who affirmed that 
&#8220;governments must allow access by NGOs to foreign funding as a part of international 
cooperation, to which civil society is entitled to the same extent as Governments&#8221; 
(A/59/401, para. 82), He believes that the same principle should apply to any associations 
regardless of the goals, in line with international law, they pursue. He considers as best 
practice legislation that does not prescribe the approval of the authorities before receiving 
domestic and foreign funding (e.g. Lebanon, Morocco and the United States). The barriers 
to foreign funding range from undue delay in approval for funding an association&#8223;s project 
(e.g. Bangladesh) to the requirement of obtaining a prior authorization from the authorities. 
Some legislation even prohibits human rights associations from receiving more than 10 per 
cent of their overall resources from foreign sources. In Ethiopia where this legislation is in 
place, out of the 127 associations advocating for human rights active before the 2009 
Charities and Societies Proclamation entered into force, very few reportedly still operate.  
</p>
<p>70. States have a responsibility to address money-laundering and terrorism, but this 
should never be used as a justification to undermine the credibility of the concerned 
association, nor to unduly impede its legitimate work. In order to ensure that associations 
are not abused by terrorist organizations, States should use alternative mechanisms to 
mitigate the risk, such as through banking laws and criminal laws that prohibit acts of 
terrorism. In this context, all United Nations agencies, notably those focusing on actions 
countering terrorism, have a key role to play and bear the moral responsibility to ensure that 
human rights in general, and freedom of association in particular, are not impaired by 
counter-terrorism and anti-money-laundering regulations. All measures adopted in this 
context should promote transparency and engender greater confidence in the sector, across 
the donor community and with the general public so that charitable funds and services 
reach intended legitimate beneficiaries.

<p>71. As far as political parties are concerned, the Special Rapporteur considers that 
different rules may be applied. In any case, rules governing domestic funding and resources 
must be non-discriminatory and their implementation should not be arbitrary, with a view 
to not jeopardizing the independence of political parties and their ability to genuinely 
compete in elections. Foreign donations may be regulated, limited or prohibited to avoid 
undue influence of foreign interests in domestic political affairs. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur indicates the necessity for States not resort to tax pressure to 
discourage associations from receiving funds, notably from abroad. On a positive note, 
several States provide tax and other exemptions and privileges for associations (e.g. 
Bulgaria and Lithuania).  
</p>
<p><b> 5. The right to take part in the conduct of public affairs  
</b></p>
<p>73. Article 71 of the Charter of the United Nations provides that &#8220;the Economic and 
Social Council may make suitable arrangements for consultation with non-governmental 
organizations which are concerned with matters within its competence&#8221;. General comment 
No. 25 (1996) on the right to participate in public affairs, voting rights and the right of 
equal access to public service further provides that &#8220;the right to freedom of association, 
including the right to form and join organizations and associations concerned with political 
and public affairs, is an essential adjunct to the rights protected by article 25&#8221; (para. 26). In 
Lithuania, article 4 of the Law on Procedure for Drafting Laws provides that all legal and 
natural persons shall have the right to submit proposals on drafting of a legal act. Both 
individuals involved in association and the association itself must be protected by 
international human rights law and shall be able to participate in the State&#8223;s decision 
making process. This is particularly crucial for unions as the right to bargain collectively is 
a fundamental right, which is enshrined in ILO Convention No. 98 (1949) on Right to 
Organise and Collective Bargaining. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur recognizes that 
best practices are those that allow for genuine social dialogue with meaningful negotiation. 
</p>
<p>74. Furthermore, when State authorities intend to regulate the framework governing 
associations, beneficiaries of the law should be key partners of the drafting process. In 
Serbia, the law on association was prepared by a working group composed of 
representatives of the Ministry of Human and Minority Rights, and of associations. On 
another note, the 2011 New Zealand Disability Bill was reportedly drafted with the 
participation of the Disabled Persons&#8223; Association.  
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>6. Termination, suspension and dissolution of associations 
</b></p>
<p>75. The right to freedom of association applies for the entire life of the association.43 
The suspension and the involuntarily dissolution of an association are the severest types of 
restrictions on freedom of association. As a result, it should only be possible when there is a 
clear and imminent danger resulting in a flagrant violation of national law, in compliance 
with international human rights law. It should be strictly proportional to the legitimate aim 
pursued and used only when softer measures would be insufficient.  
</p>
<p>76. According to ILO jurisprudence, decisions to dissolve labour organizations &#8220;should 
only occur in extremely serious cases; such dissolutions should only happen following a 
judicial decision so that the rights of defence are fully guaranteed&#8221;.44 The Special 
Rapporteur values as best practice legislation that stipulates that such drastic measures be 
taken by independent and impartial courts. In the United Republic of Tanzania, the case of 
</p>
<p>  
 43 European Court of Human Rights, <i>United Communist Party of Turkey and Others </i>v.<i> Turkey</i>, No. 
</p>
<p>19392/92, para. 33. 
 44 <i>Digest of decisions and principles</i>, para. 699. </p>


<p>an association working on gender equality that had been deregistered by the authorities was 
successfully overturned by the Constitutional Court. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  The right to an effective remedy and accountability for human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations and abuses 
</b></p>
<p>77. States have an obligation to establish accessible and effective complaints 
mechanisms that are able to independently, promptly and thoroughly investigate allegations 
of human rights violations or abuses in order to hold those responsible accountable. This 
not only entails guarantees that the violation be stopped, but also that it will not be repeated 
in the future. Specific attention must be paid to members of the groups at risk identified in 
paragraph 13. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur considers as best practice legislation which provides for 
criminal and disciplinary sanctions against those who interfere with or violently disperse 
public assemblies through excessive use of force (e.g. Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Colombia, 
Cote d&#8223;Ivoire, Cuba, Estonia, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Portugal, Republic of Moldova, Serbia 
and Spain). More specifically, in Colombia, according to the law, the excessive or arbitrary 
use of force against peaceful demonstrators constitutes a grave breach, under the 
disciplinary regime for the national police. Similarly, in Portugal, a decree-law foresees 
sanctions against authorities who hinder the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, and 
article 382 of Criminal Code sets the applicable sanctions in relation to the abuse of power.  
</p>
<p>79. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur stresses the importance of police officers 
wearing visible identification numbers on their uniforms. As noted by the Hungarian Office 
of the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights, during a protest that was violently repressed 
in the country, many police officers could not be identified because they did not wear such 
identification numbers. 
</p>
<p>80. National human rights institutions, which comply with the principles relating to the 
status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris 
Principles), can also play a role in receiving and investigating allegations of human rights 
violations and abuses (e.g. Malaysia and Portugal). The work of these institutions should be 
respected and facilitated by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>81. Where the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are unduly 
restricted, the victim(s) should have the rights to obtain redress and to fair and adequate 
compensation. Once again, due attention must be paid to victims belonging to the groups 
most at risk in this process. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates the utmost importance of the rights to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, which are cornerstone in any 
</b></p>
<p><b>democracy.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Based on the best practices identified in the foregoing paragraphs, which 
should be considered as minimum standards, the Special Rapporteur anticipates that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the recommendations below will guide States in facilitating and protecting the rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, in law and in practice.  </b></p>


<p><b> A. General recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon States: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To recognize that the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</b></p>
<p><b>association play a decisive role in the emergence and existence of effective democratic 
</b></p>
<p><b>systems as they are a channel allowing for dialogue, pluralism, tolerance and 
</b></p>
<p><b>broadmindedness, where minority or dissenting views or beliefs are respected; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b)  To ensure that the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</b></p>
<p><b>association are enjoyed by everyone and any registered or unregistered entities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including women; youth; indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>belonging to minority groups or groups at risk, including those victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination because of their sexual orientation and gender identity, non-nationals, 
</b></p>
<p><b>as well as activists advocating economic, social, and cultural rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To ensure that no one is criminalized for exercising the rights to 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, nor is subject to threats or use of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence, harassment, persecution, intimidation or reprisals; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) To strictly and narrowly define the offence of terrorism in line with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) To ensure that any restrictions on the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly and of association are prescribed by law, necessary in a democratic society, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and proportionate to the aim pursued, and do not harm the principles of pluralism, 
</b></p>
<p><b>tolerance and broadmindedness. Any restrictions should be subject to an independent, 
</b></p>
<p><b>impartial, and prompt judicial review; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) To ensure no derogation is exercised to the rights to life and to be free 
</b></p>
<p><b>from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) To provide individuals exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly and of association with the protection offered by the right to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>expression; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) To ensure that administrative and law enforcement officials are 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequately trained in relation to the respect of the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly and of association; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) To ensure that law enforcement authorities which violate the rights to 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are held personally and fully 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountable for such violations by an independent and democratic oversight body, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the courts of law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) To ensure that victims of violations and abuses of the rights to freedom 
</b></p>
<p><b>of peaceful assembly and of association have to the right to an effective remedy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>obtain redress; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) To recognize that the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
</b></p>
<p><b>association can be exercised through new technologies, including through the Internet. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>National human rights institutions complying with the Paris Principles should 
play a role in fostering and monitoring the implementation of the rights to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>peaceful assembly and of association and in receiving and investigating allegations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>related human rights violations and abuses. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>United Nations institutions, bodies and mechanisms should continue promoting 
and protecting the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular, the Human Rights Committee should consider developing general </b></p>


<p><b>comments on articles 21 and 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights. Greater attention to violations and abuses of both rights should be paid in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework of the universal periodic review. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The international community should seriously consider adopting guiding 
principles in relation to the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, and the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of association, in consultation with all relevant stakeholders. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Specific recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>A presumption in favour of holding peaceful assemblies should be established 
in law in a clear and explicit manner.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>States should facilitate and protect peaceful assemblies, including through 
negotiation and mediation. Wherever possible, law enforcement authorities should not 
</b></p>
<p><b>resort to force during peaceful assemblies and ensure that, </b>&#8220;<b>where force is absolutely 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary, no one is subject to excessive or indiscriminate use of force</b>&#8221;<b> (Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>resolution 19/35, para. 6). 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly should not be subject 
to prior authorization by the authorities, but at the most to a prior notification 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedure, which should not be burdensome. In case an assembly is not allowed or 
</b></p>
<p><b>restricted, a detailed and timely written explanation should be provided, which can be 
</b></p>
<p><b>appealed before an impartial and independent court. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Spontaneous assemblies should be recognized in law, and exempted from prior 
notification. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Simultaneous assemblies should be allowed, protected and facilitated, whenever 
possible. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Assembly organizers and participants should not be held responsible and liable 
for the violent behaviour of others.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>States should also ensure the protection of those monitoring and reporting on 
violations and abuses in the context of peaceful assemblies. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Freedom of association 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>A regime of notification to establish an association should be in force. 
Associations should be established after a process that is simple, easily accessible, non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory, and non-onerous or free of charge. Registration bodies should provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>a detailed and timely written explanation when denying the registration of an 
</b></p>
<p><b>association. Associations should be able to challenge any rejection before an impartial 
</b></p>
<p><b>and independent court. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Any associations, including unregistered associations, should be allowed to 
function freely, and their members operate in an enabling and safe environment.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Associations should be free to determine their statutes, structure and activities 
and to make decisions without State interference. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Associations should enjoy the right to privacy. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Associations should be able to access domestic and foreign funding and 
resources without prior authorization. </b></p>


<p>100. <b>Suspension or involuntarily dissolution of associations should be sanctioned by 
an impartial and independent court in case of a clear and imminent danger resulting 
</b></p>
<p><b>in a flagrant violation of domestic laws, in compliance with international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights law.</b>
