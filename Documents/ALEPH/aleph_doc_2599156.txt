In contrast to the certificate required for non-venture issuers under National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and 
Interim Filings (NI 52-109), this Venture Issuer Basic Certificate does not include representations relating to the establishment and maintenance 
of disclosure controls and procedures (DC&P) and internal control over financial reporting (ICFR), as defined in NI 52-109. In particular, the 
certifying officers filing this certificate are not making any representations relating to the establishment and maintenance of:
NOTE TO READER
i) controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in its annual
filings, interim filings or other reports filed or submitted under securities legislation is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within 
the time periods specified in securities legislation; and
ii) a  process  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial    statements  for
external purposes in accordance with the issuer’s GAAP.
The issuer’s certifying officers are responsible for ensuring that processes are in place to provide them with sufficient knowledge to support the 
representations they are making in this certificate.
Investors should be aware that inherent limitations on the ability of certifying officers of a venture issuer to design and implement on a cost 
effective basis DC&P and ICFR as defined in NI 52-109 may result in additional risks to the quality, reliability, transparency and timeliness of 
interim and annual filings and other reports provided under securities legislation.
