</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness 
</p>
<p>of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the need for persons with disabilities to 
</p>
<p>be guaranteed the full enjoyment of their rights and freedoms without discrimination, </p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>all of its previous resolutions on the rights of persons with disabilities, 
</p>
<p>the most recent of which was resolution 25/20 of 28 March 2014, and welcoming the 
</p>
<p>efforts of all stakeholders to implement those resolutions,  </p>
<p><i>Recalling in particular </i>that article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
</p>
<p>with Disabilities reaffirms the right of persons with disabilities to live independently and be 
</p>
<p>included in the community on an equal basis with others, and provides that, with a view to 
</p>
<p>realizing this right without discrimination, States parties shall take effective and appropriate 
</p>
<p>measures to facilitate<b> </b>the full inclusion and participation in the community of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the general principles reflected in the Convention, namely respect for 
</p>
<p>inherent dignity, individual autonomy and independence, and full and effective 
</p>
<p>participation and inclusion in society, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the enjoyment of the right to<b> </b>living independently and being 
</p>
<p>included in the community on an equal basis with others is closely linked to the<b> </b>enjoyment<b> 
</b></p>
<p>of the full range of human rights by persons with disabilities, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that progress has been made, yet deeply concerned that many persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities in all regions continue to face significant obstacles in exercising their right 
</p>
<p>to live independently and be included in the community on an equal basis with others, 
</p>

<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that access to physical environment, transportation, information and 
</p>
<p>communications, including information and communications technology, and other services 
</p>
<p>and facilities provided to public are a key to independent, autonomous living and equal 
</p>
<p>participation in society for persons with disabilities, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming </i>the work undertaken by the task force on secretariat services, 
</p>
<p>accessibility for persons with disabilities and use of information technology of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council, and encouraging it to report orally to the Council on the progress made on 
</p>
<p>the full implementation of the recommendations contained in its reports1 and its future 
</p>
<p>work, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> at the negative impact of laws or practices on the rights of persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities that deprive them of their legal capacity or allow for their forced 
</p>
<p>institutionalization on the basis of a real or perceived disability, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned also </i>that girls and women of all ages with disabilities are subject 
</p>
<p>to multiple, aggravated or intersecting forms of discrimination,<b> </b>and bearing in mind the 
</p>
<p>particular risk of segregation, violence and abuse against women and girls with disabilities, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>the ongoing preparations for the post-2015 development agenda and its 
</p>
<p>consideration of persons with disabilities in both the report of the Open Working Group of 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly on Sustainable Development Goals2 and the report of the Secretary-
</p>
