</p>
<p><i> Recalling further </i>Human Rights Council resolution 17/23 of 17 June 2011,  
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating </i>the commitment to ensure the effective enjoyment of all civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights for everyone, including the right to development, and 
the obligation of all States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to 
promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms,  
</p>

<p><b> </b><i>Reaffirming</i> that all peoples may, for their own ends, freely dispose of their natural 
wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international 
economic cooperation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law, 
and that in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that corruption is a serious barrier to effective resource mobilization 
and allocation and diverts resources away from activities that are vital for poverty 
eradication, the fight against hunger, and economic and sustainable development,  
</p>
<p><i>Alarmed </i>at cases of corruption that involve vast quantities of assets, which may 
constitute a substantial proportion of the resources of States, the deprivation of which 
threatens the political stability and sustainable development of those States and has a 
negative impact on the application by States of the maximum available resources to the full 
realization of all human rights for all, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>that the enjoyment of human rights, be they economic, social and 
cultural, or civil and political, in particular the right to development, is seriously 
undermined by the phenomenon of corruption and the transfer of funds of illicit origin, 
which may endanger the stability and security of societies, undermine the values of 
democracy and morality and jeopardize social, economic and political development, 
especially when an inadequate national and international response leads to impunity, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the United Nations Convention against Corruption, and welcoming the 
growing number of States acceding to it,  
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the work carried out by different United Nations bodies, including 
the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, as well as international and regional 
organizations in preventing and combating all forms of corruption, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that supportive domestic legal systems are essential in preventing and 
combating corrupt practices and transfer of assets of illicit origin and returning such assets, 
and recalling that the fight against all forms of corruption requires strong institutions at all 
levels, including at the local level, able to take efficient preventive and law enforcement 
measures consistent with the United Nations Convention against Corruption, in particular 
chapters II and III thereof, 
</p>
<p><i> Appreciating<b> </b></i>the continued efforts of the Conference of the States Parties to the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption, through its various intergovernmental 
working groups, to overview the review process of the implementation of the Convention, 
to advise on the provision of technical assistance to building institutional and human 
capacity in States parties for the prevention of corruption, and to enhance international 
cooperation, including in the repatriation of funds of illicit origin,  
</p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> the responsibilities of requesting and requested States in the repatriation of 
funds of illicit origin, cognizant that countries of origin must seek repatriation as part of 
their duty to ensure the application of the maximum available resources to the full 
realization of all human rights for all, including the right to development, address human 
rights violations and combat impunity, and that recipient countries, on the other hand, have 
a duty to assist and facilitate repatriation as part of their obligation of international 
cooperation and assistance under chapters IV and V of the United Nations Convention 
against Corruption and in the field of human rights, and in line with the commitment made 
at the 2005 World Summit to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels and to 
curb the illicit transfer of funds,  
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> about the difficulties, particularly the practical difficulties, that both 
requested and requesting States face in the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, taking into 
account the particular importance of the recovery of stolen assets for sustainable 
development and stability, and noting the difficulties of providing information establishing </p>


<p>a link between proceeds of corruption in the requested State and the crime committed in the 
requesting State, which in many cases may be difficult to prove, bearing in mind that 
everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until 
proved guilty according to law, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging </i>the progress made towards the implementation of the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption<i>, </i>but recognizing that States continue to face challenges in 
recovering funds of illicit origin owing to, inter alia, differences in legal systems, the 
complexity of multijurisdictional investigations and prosecutions, lack of familiarity with 
the mutual legal assistance procedures of other States and difficulties in identifying the flow 
of funds of illicit origin, and noting the particular challenges in recovering them in cases 
involving individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions and 
their family members and close associates, and recognizing also that legal difficulties are 
often exacerbated by factual and institutional obstacles, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with deep concern</i> that, as indicated in the comprehensive study prepared by 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the negative impact of the 
non-repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin on the enjoyment of 
human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights,1 only around 2 per cent of 
the estimated funds of illicit origin annually leaving the developing world are repatriated to 
their countries of origin,  
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the particular concern of developing countries and countries with economies 
in transition regarding the return of assets of illicit origin derived from corruption, in 
particular to countries from which they originated, consistent with the principles of the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption, in particular chapter V thereto, so as to 
enable countries to design and fund development projects in accordance with their national 
priorities in view of the importance that such assets can have to their sustainable 
development, </p>
<p><i> Convinced </i>that the illicit acquisition of personal wealth can be particularly damaging 
to democratic institutions, national economies and the rule of law, and stressing that any 
resource that the State is deprived of because of corruption has potentially the same 
negative effect, regardless of whether it is exported or domestically retained, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the comprehensive study on the negative 
impact of the non-repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin on the 
enjoyment of human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights, contained in 
the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights;1  
</p>
<p> 2.  <i>Calls upon </i>all States that have not yet acceded to the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption to consider doing so as a matter of priority; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Asserts </i>the urgent need to repatriate illicit funds to the countries of origin 
without conditionalities, consistent with the United Nations Convention against Corruption 
and in line with the commitment made at the 2005 World Summit to make the fight against 
corruption a priority at all levels and to curb the illicit transfer of funds, and urges all<b> </b>States 
to step up their efforts to trace, freeze and recover those funds;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Acknowledges</i> the importance of compliance with international human rights 
law in relation to the repatriation of funds of illicit origin through, inter alia, promoting 
human rights-based policy coherence in the deliberations and actions by States Members of 
the Human Rights Council and in the intergovernmental process of implementing the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption;  
</p>

<p> 5. <i>Invites</i> the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention 
against Corruption to adopt a human rights-based approach in their implementation of the 
Convention, including when dealing with the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, and 
appreciates the continued efforts by the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group on 
Asset Recovery of the Conference to assist States parties in fulfilling their obligations under 
the Convention to prevent, detect and deter in a more effective manner the international 
transfer of funds of illicit origin and to strengthen international cooperation in asset 
recovery, bearing in mind that, regardless of the capacities, resources and willingness of the 
requesting State&#8217;s institutions and authorities, there is a victim society, which is suffering 
</p>
<p>the consequences of the transfer of those funds;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Welcomes</i> the decision made at the fourth session of the Conference of the 
States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption to convene open-ended 
intergovernmental expert meetings on international cooperation to advise and assist States 
with regard to extradition and mutual legal assistance, and notes with appreciation the 
Stolen Assets Recovery Initiative of the World Bank Group and the United Nations Office 
on Drugs and Crime,<b> </b>and encourages coordination among existing initiatives;  
</p>
<p><b> </b>7. <i>Calls for</i> further international cooperation through, inter alia, the United 
Nations system, in support of national, subregional and regional efforts to prevent and 
combat corruption practices and the transfer of assets of illicit origin, consistent with the 
principles of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, and, in this regard, 
encourages close cooperation at the national and international levels between anti-
corruption agencies, law enforcement agencies and financial intelligence units; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon</i> all States requested to repatriate funds of illicit origin to fully 
uphold their commitment to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels and to 
curb the illicit transfer of funds, and to acknowledge that, in fulfilling their obligations in 
this regard under the United Nations Convention against Corruption, they also<b> </b>have a 
responsibility towards societies affected by corruption to make every effort to achieve the 
repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin in order to diminish the 
negative impact of non-repatriation, including on the enjoyment of human rights, in 
particular economic, social and cultural rights in the countries of origin by, inter alia, 
lowering the barriers imposed on requiring jurisdictions at the tracing stage<b> </b>and enhancing 
cooperation in this regard between anti-corruption agencies, law enforcement agencies and 
financial intelligence units, especially taking into account the risks of dissipation of those 
funds, and, where appropriate, by delinking confiscation measures from a requirement of 
conviction in the country of origin;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also calls upon</i> all States requesting the repatriation of funds of illicit origin 
to fully uphold their commitment to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels 
and to curb the illicit transfer of funds, and<b> </b>to apply the principles of accountability, 
transparency and participation in the decision-making process regarding the allocation of 
repatriated funds to the realization of economic, social and cultural rights in order to 
improve prevention and detection procedures, correct identified weaknesses or 
mismanagement, prevent impunity, provide effective remedies directed at creating 
conditions for avoiding new human rights violations and improve the overall administration 
of justice; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Reaffirms</i> that it is the obligation of the State to investigate and prosecute 
corruption, calls upon all States to strengthen criminal proceedings directed at freezing or 
restraining funds of illicit origin, and encourages requesting States to ensure that adequate 
national investigative procedures have been initiated and substantiated for the purpose of 
presenting mutual legal assistance requests, and, in this context, encourages requested 
States to provide, when appropriate, information on legal frameworks and procedures to the 
requesting State;  </p>


<p> 11. <i>Underlines</i> that there is also<b> </b>a corporate responsibility to comply with and 
respect all applicable laws and human rights, and a need for greater access to effective 
remedies by victims in order to realize effective prevention of, and remedy for, business-
related human rights harm, as set out in the guiding principles on business and human 
rights;<footnote name="2">A/HRC/17/31, annex. </footnote>  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Stresses </i>the need for transparency in financial institutions and effective due 
diligence measures to be applied by financial intermediaries, calls upon<b> </b> States to seek 
appropriate means in accordance with their international obligations to ensure the 
cooperation and responsiveness of financial institutions to foreign requests to freeze and 
recover funds of illicit origin and the provision of efficient mutual legal assistance regime 
to States requesting repatriation of those funds, and encourages the promotion of human 
and institutional capacity-building in that regard;  
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Requests</i> the Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other 
related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights 
to present to the Human Rights Council, at its twenty-second<b> </b>session, an in-depth study on 
the negative impact of the non-repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin 
on the application by States<b> </b>of the maximum available resources to the full realization of all 
human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights, with special attention paid 
to developing countries and countries with economies in transition burdened by foreign 
debt;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to transmit the present resolution and her 
comprehensive study to relevant United Nations bodies to bring them to the attention of 
Member States for consideration of appropriate action; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this matter under the same agenda 
item.
