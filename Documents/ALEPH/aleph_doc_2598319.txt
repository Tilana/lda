Corporate Governance Statement
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
ASX PRINCIPLES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Pan  Pacific  Petroleum  NL  ACN  000  749  799  (the  "Company")  remains  committed  to  protecting 
shareholder interests and in doing so, endorsing the corporate governance principles which are relevant and 
appropriate to a corporation of comparable size and operations.
The  corporate  governance  arrangements  of  the  Company  are  reviewed  by  the  board  of  directors  (the 
"Board"), on an ongoing basis having regard to any amendments to the law and ASX Listing Rules, any 
changes to the Company’s operations and taking into account what is in the best interests of the Company’s 
shareholders.
This  statement  outlines  the  Company’s  approach  to  corporate  governance  for  the  financial  year  which 
ended on 30 June 2016 (the "Reporting Period"). It addresses each of the principles and recommendations 
set out by the ASX Corporate Governance Council in the 2014, third edition of the Corporate Governance 
Principles and Recommendations ("ASX Principles and Recommendations")..  
 
PRINCIPLE 1: 
LAY SOLID FOUNDATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT
Role and Responsibilities of the Board and Management
Recommendation 1.1 
 
The Constitution provides that the business of the Company is to be managed by or under the direction of 
the  Board. The  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  Board  are  formalised  in  the  Board  Charter. The  Board 
considers that its prime responsibility is to oversee the business activities and management of the Group 
for the benefit of shareholders. An extract from the Board Charter listing the Board’s responsibilities is set 
out below: 
 
Matters which are specifically reserved for the Board include: 
 
• 
•
approval of the budgets for the projects and joint ventures in which the Company is involved; 
approval  of  the  Company’s  strategy,  business  plans  and  objectives,  and  the  monitoring  of 
performance against them; 
approval of acquisitions and divestments;
• 
•  monitoring the financial performance and operations of the Company including approval of the half
yearly and annual Financial Statements and Reports; 
determining the capital structure of the Company and any dividend payments; 
recommendations  to  shareholders  with  respect  to  the  appointment  and  removal  of  the  Company’s 
auditors; 
succession planning having regard to any perceived skills gap and subsequent approval of any new 
Board appointments and review of the Board’s performance; 
appointing and determining the duration, remuneration and other terms of appointment of the Chief 
Executive Officer and approving the appointments of other Senior Executives; 
evaluating the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and other Senior Executives; 
approving 
effectiveness; 
responsibility for corporate governance systems and practices within the Company;

Company;

establishment of Board Committees, their membership and charters.
The Board has delegated to the chief executive officer (the "CEO") or an individual Executive Director 
and to other senior executives, responsibility for the everyday management of the business. The scope of 
and  limitations  of  the  authority  delegated  is  set  out  in  the  delegations  of  authority  document  (the 
"Delegations"). Those senior executives who are authorised or granted authority under the Delegations as 
well as any Executive Director are referred to as ("Senior Executives") for the purposes of this statement. 
The Delegations were reviewed during the Reporting Period with no amendments being made.
Recommendation 1.2
Director Checks
The Company does not have in place a policy to perform full checks on all potential directors.  The Board 
does not believe this is required where the potential Director is known as an industry participant to current 
board members.
The Directors’ biographical details including their, expertise and skills they are bringing to the Board are 
detailed  on  the  Companys  website  and  within  the  Annual  Report.    Details  of  any  other  material 
directorships currently held are also provided on the website and within the Annual Report.
Recommendation 1.3  Written Agreement with each Director and Senior Executive
When  new  directors  are  appointed  to  the  Board,  they  are  provided  with  details  pertaining  to  their 
appointment  and  obligations  as  specified  within  the  Board  Charter,  for  example,  their  obligations 
regarding  confidentiality.  New  directors  are  also  provided  with  other  relevant  information  such  as 
remuneration details, including superannuation and expense policies, copies of the Company’s policies, 
including  the  Company’s  securities  trading  policy  ("Security  Trading  Policy")    the  Company’s 
constitution,  details  pertaining  to  directors’  insurance  coverage  and  indemnification  and  prior  Board 
minutes and papers as and  when requested. New directors are also required to sign an  ASX disclosure 
agreement with the Company, which requires the director to notify the Company of any sale or purchase 
of the Company’s shares within three business days of the trade taking place.
The Company has not prepared formal letters of appointment for the existing directors of the Board as the 
Company considers that the items which would normally be referenced in a formal letter of appointment 
or provided to any new director as part of an induction pack, have either been explained to each current 
director or provided to them in the form of a Company policy or document.
Details  of  the  letters  of  appointment  and  service  contracts  for  senior  executives  are  provided  in  the 
Remuneration Report within the Annual Report.
Company Secretary
Recommendation 1.4 
 
The  appointment  and  removal  of  a  Company  Secretary  is  a  matter  for  decision  by  the  Board.  The 
Company Secretary, Ms Kim Ware, is accountable directly to the Board (through the Chairman) on all 
matters to do with the proper functioning of the Board. This arrangement is formalised in her employment 
contract.  Details of the Company Secretary are set out in the Annual Report.
Recommendation 1.5
Diversity Policy
The Company believes in creating fair and equal access for employees to all employment opportunities 
and that a diverse workforce, including, but not limited to, gender, age, ethnicity and cultural background, 
will provide the broadest and most effective talent pool. All appointments are, however, made on the basis 
of merit.
Due to the size of the Company’s workforce, the Company has not adopted a formal diversity policy or 
any  gender  diversity  objectives.  The  Board  believes  that  there  is  no  detriment  to  the  Company  in  not 
adopting  a  formal  diversity  policy  or  in  not  setting  gender  diversity  objectives  as  the  Company  is 
committed  to  providing  all  employees  with  fair  and  equal  access  to  employment  opportunities  and 
nurturing diversity within the Company. This is evidenced by 50% of the two senior positions within the 
Company, being occupied by a female Ms Kim Ware (Company Secretary/CFO (equivalent). The senior
Corporate Governance Statement -  2016
position referred to in this context are those of the CEO (if in office) or any Executive Director and the 
Company Secretary within the company defined as Senior Executives in Principle 1 of this statement.
For the year ending June 2016, females make up at least 66% of the Company’s general workforce and 
50% of the senior positions within the Company. Currently, there are no females on the Board.
Recommendation 1.6
Board Performance Assessment
Due  to  the  size  and  composition  of  the  Board,  the  Company  does  not  have  a  formal  process  for  the 
performance evaluation of the Board, or individual directors. However, the Chairman/Board undertakes an 
informal review of the Board’s performance as and when required, but no less than annually and this was 
most recently undertaken on 28th July 2016. The Board considers that given the many and diverse views 
of  the  directors  and  as  a  majority  of  directors  are  themselves  substantial  shareholders  or  represent  the 
views  of  a  substantial  shareholder  of  the  Company,  there  is  already  a  strong  alignment  between  the 
performance  of  the  Board  and  the  best  interests  of  the  Company.  Accordingly,  no  formal  performance 
evaluation for the Board or its members took place during the Reporting Period.
Recommendation 1.7
Performance Evaluation of Senior Executives
The  performance  of  the  Senior  Executives  including  the  CEO  or  an  Executive  Director  is  reviewed 
annually.  New  Senior  Executives  are  introduced  to  the  Company  through  an  informal  induction 
programme  and  as  part  of  this  programme  are  given  information  concerning  the  Company’s  financial 
position, strategies, operations, risk management and the Company’s various policies, procedures and the 
rights, duties and responsibilities and roles of the Board and Senior Executives.
The  Board  is  responsible  for  determining  the  performance  objective(s),  if  any  (the  "PO’s"),  for  Senior 
Executives and evaluating their performance against them. The PO’s, if set by the Board, are set annually 
for the upcoming twelve months and may vary from year to year depending on the financial and strategic 
goals of the Company.  As there is no CEO in office no performance objectives  were set for the 2016 
year.
The  Board  considers  the  performance  of  the  Senior  Executives  and  the  overall  performance  of  the 
Company,  when  awarding  either  short-term  or  long-term  incentives  for  the  year  completed  and  when 
assessing  fixed  remuneration  for  the  next  year.  The  Senior  Executive  performance  evaluations  for  the 
2016 Reporting Period were finalised during the Reporting Period.  Further information with respect to 
this process is contained within the remuneration report ("Remuneration Report")
PRINCIPLE 2:
STRUCTURE THE BOARD TO ADD VALUE
Nominations Committee
Recommendation 2.1 
 
Due to the size of the Company and the composition of the Board, a nomination committee has not been 
established.  No formal procedure governing the appointment of new directors has been established.  The 
Board  considers  that  the  Company  is  not  currently  of  a  size  to  justify  the  formation  of  a  Nomination 
Committee. The Board as a whole undertakes the process of reviewing the skills base and experience of 
existing directors to enable identification or attributes required in new directors and assumes responsibility 
for the appointment of any new directors, the formulation of any succession plans and the re-appointment 
of directors to the Board.
Retirement and rotation of directors is governed by the Company's constitution. Each year, one-third of 
the  directors  (rounded  down)  must  retire  by  rotation  and,  if  eligible,  may  offer  themselves  up  for  re-
election. Re-appointment of directors is not automatic and is subject to shareholder approval. Any casual 
vacancy filled between general meetings will be subject to a shareholder vote at the next annual general 
meeting of the Company. Shareholders are provided with relevant information on each of the candidates 
for election or, where applicable, re-election. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of 
the  Company  for  the  Board  to  determine  on  a  case  by  case  basis,  having  regard  to  any  relevant 
information at the time, whether or not to recommend the re-election of relevant directors. For this reason,
Corporate Governance Statement -  2016
the  Board  has  not  established  a  formal  procedure  in  relation  to  the  re-appointment  of  directors.  The 
permitted number of directors is  specified in the  Company’s constitution as a  minimum of three and a 
maximum of seven.
This is outlined in the Board Charter as a matter reserved for the Board (see recommendation 1.1)
Recommendation 2.2
Board Skills Matrix
The Board does not have a formal Board skills Matrix.  The Board considers that it is in the best interests 
of the Company for the Board as a whole to determine the criteria for the selection of new directors, based 
on any perceived “gaps” in the skill set of the Board, as and when a casual vacancy arises. 
 
However the mix of skills, experience and expertise that the Board currently has includes general skills 
expected  for  board  membership  (such  as  executive  leadership  and  management  experience,  financial 
acumen  and  corporate  governance  and  risk  management  experience),  those  areas  relevant  to  the 
Company’s strategy. In particular, these areas are Resource Industry Experience (commercial), Debt and 
Capital Market Experience.  Each of these areas is currently represented by the Board collectively. 
 
The  Board  is  of  the  view  that  the  current  Directors  possess  an  appropriate  mix  of  skills,  experience, 
expertise  and  knowledge  to  enable  the  Board  to  discharge  its  responsibilities,  deliver  the  Company’s 
corporate  objectives  and  direct  the  Company  in  accordance  with  appropriate  standards  of  corporate 
governance for its size.
Director Independence
Recommendation 2.3  
 
An  independent  director  is  defined  in  the  Recommendations  as  a  director  that  is  free  of  any  interest, 
position,  association  or  relationship  that  might  influence,  or  reasonably  be  perceived  to  influence,  in  a 
material respect his or her capacity to bring an independent judgment to bear on issues before the Board 
and to act in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders generally.  
 
The Board makes an annual determination in respect of the independence of each Board member.  The 
Board  in  making  such  a  determination  utilises  as  a  guide  the  considerations  set  out  in  Box  2.3,  the 
relationships affecting independent status, in Principle 2.3 of the ASX Principles and Recommendations.  
In  addition,  the  Directors  are  required  on  an  ongoing  basis  to  disclose  relevant  personal  interests  and 
conflicts of interest which may in turn trigger an ad-hoc review of a Director’s independent status.
On 23rd June 2016, at the conclusion of its annual review of director independence, the Board confirmed 
that,  in  its  view,  Mr  Tattersfield,  is  an  independent  directors.      Three  (3)  of  the  Directors  have  been 
determined as being non-independent including the Mr Sullivan chairman of the Board (“Chairman”) and 
Mr  Morrison  as  they  have  declared  that  they  are  an  associate  of  the  Company’s  largest  substantial 
shareholder – Zeta Energy Pte Limited with a holding of 50.432% (per last substantial shareholder notice 
dated 27 July 2016).  Mr Worner’s independence status had changed by virtue of his contract with the 
Company having engaged him in an executive capacity during financial year 2016.  Notwithstanding that 
Mr Tattersfield is a substantial shareholder of the Company.  The materiality of his holding at 7.6% is not 
seen to interfere with Mr Tattersfields commitment to the aims and ambitions of all shareholders of the 
Company and outweighs any apparent inference of non-independence that he may bring as a substantial 
shareholder.    Where  required  Mr  Sullivan,  Mr  Morrison  and  Mr  Worner  exclude  themselves  from  any 
items of business where there may be a conflict please see Recommendation 3.1 Code of Conduct.

Recommendation 2.4
Majority of Directors Independent
The recommendation of best  practice is that a  majority of  directors (and in particular, the chairperson) 
should be independent. 25% of the Board of the Company are independent Directors.  The Chairman is 
not  Independent.    The  Board  consider  that  there  are  appropriate  controls  such  that  where  required  Mr 
Sullivan  excludes  himself  from  any  items  of  business  where  there  may  be  a  conflict  please  see 
Recommendation 3.1 Code of Conduct.
Recommendation 2.5
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer/ Executive Director
Selection and Role of the Chairman
The Board selects and appoints the Chairman. The Board has determined that the Chairman, Mr Sullivan, 
is  not  independent.    It  has  been  determined  by  the  Board  that  the  association  has  been  assessed  to  not 
interfere with the Mr Sullivan’s capacity to bring an independent judgement to bear on issues before the 
board and to act in the best interests of the entity and its security holders generally.  Where required Mr 
Sullivan  excludes  himself  from  any  items  of  business  where  there  may  be  a  conflict  please  see 
Recommendation 3.1 Code of Conduct.
The  Chairman’s  role  and  responsibilities  are  separate  from  those  of  the  Executive  Director  and  the 
Company Secretary running the day to day management of the Company.
The Chairman's role and responsibilities are set out in the Board Charter and include the following:

•
•

and ensuring that minutes of meetings accurately record decisions taken and, where appropriate, the 
views of individual directors; and

Executives.
Company Induction and Professional Development of Directors
Recommendation 2.6  
 
New Directors are inducted into the Company by being provided with copies of the Company’s relevant 
policies, codes, risk profile and governing documentation. In addition new Directors are encouraged to

RECOGNISE AND MANAGE RISK 
 
Recommendation 7.1
Risk Committee
The  Company  does  not  have  in  place  a  Risk  Committee,  this  function  is  performed  by  the  Board  as a 
whole.  The Company has in place a risk management framework and Risk Management Policy for the 
effective  management  of  risk  across  its  business.  The  policy  sets  out  details  of  the  proactive  and 
systematic approach that the Company takes to managing risks and identifies the roles and responsibilities 
of  the  Board,  management  and  employees  in  the  oversight  and  management  of  the  Company’s  group

A summary of the Risk Management Policy is available on the Company’s website. 
 
Recommendation 7.2
Annual Risk Review
The Board requires management to design and implement the risk management framework in a way that 
proactively  and  systematically  identifies,  assesses  and  addresses  events  that  could  potentially  have  an 
adverse impact upon the Company’s business objectives.
This framework integrates the consideration of risk into activities of the Company, so that the key risks in 
relation  to  the  efficient  and  effective  operation  of  functions  and  the  successful  execution  of  the 
Company’s business strategy are identified, implemented in the form of business processes and control 
measures  which  are  regularly  evaluated  and,  where  required,  improvements  in  these  controls  are 
implemented.
The  Board  receives  operational,  new  venture  and  financial  reports  for  each  scheduled  Board  meeting 
which  contain  (where  applicable)  information  on  current  key  business  risks,  including  the  status  and 
effectiveness of control measures in relation to each of those risks.
In addition to the regular reports received by the Board, the Board receives from the Executive Director 
the  findings  of  an  annual  company  review  of  key  risks  with  respect  to  operational,  development  and 
corporate  activities.  This  report  identifies  major  risks  along  with  controls  and  risk  mitigations  plans 
(“Annual  Risk  Review”).  The  Executive  Director  (in  the  Annual  Risk  Review  presented  to  the  Board 
during  the  Reporting  Period),  confirmed  that  (to  the  best  of  his  knowledge  and  belief)  the  Company’s 
material  business  risks  were  being  managed  effectively.  The  Board  approved  the  effectiveness  of  the 
Company’s management of its material business risks. 
 
Recommendation 7.3 
 
Whilst the Company does not have a designated internal audit function, it has formulated internal control 
processes and procedures which are reviewed and modified by the CFO as and when there is a material 
change to the Company but no less than annually to ensure reasonable levels of control are maintained 
(“Internal Control Processes”). The Internal Control Processes are then provided to the external auditors 
for inclusion in the annual audit process. Due to the size of the Company, the Company currently does not 
require a full-time employee to assess internal controls; rather the CFO undertakes the internal assessment 
of controls as a function of the CFO role.

Corporate Governance Statement -  2016
Recommendation  7.4  Material  exposure  to  economic,  environmental  and  social 
sustainability risks 
 
The Company values economic, environmental and social sustainability within the areas it has a presence.  
In order to mitigate any material exposure to economic, environmental and social sustainability risks, the 
Board, assisted by the Executive Director, has oversight of risk management and meet annually or as 
required to review and assess risks. 
 
The Company’s review of Material Business Risks gives consideration to the specific risk areas of 
economic sustainability; environmental sustainability and social Sustainability and manages the following 
related risks. 
 
Oil price and Currency fluctuations  
 
•  Oil  price  volatility  and  ranges  are  factored  into  and  stress  tested  within  PPP  cash  forecasts.  The 
Company periodically considers the option of hedging Tui production, but does not currently hedge 
as in all but extreme scenarios the potential benefits are very low.
•  The mix of currencies is periodically reviewed to ensure that the Company is balancing investment 
revenue with the risk of decline in value. The Company has elected to retain the majority of funds in 
US$,  the  earning  currency,  which  provides  a  natural  hedge  against  meeting  dominantly  US$ 
expenses.
Joint Venture performance 
 
•  As a non-operator the Company is reliant on the performance of the respective operators to manage 
operations safely and effectively and to preserve and deliver value in its joint ventures. The Company 
plays  an  active  role  in  performance  management  of  the  joint  ventures  through  the  review  and 
approval of Work Program and Budgets (WP&B), project sanctioning, and performance monitoring. 
The Company’s joint venture budgeting provides for a contingency amount to mitigate the impact of 
cost over runs.
•  The  Company  insures  operational  risk  related  to  joint  venture  activities  when  prudent  to  do  so, 
including  Business  Continuity  insurance  in  respect  of  loss  of  Tui  production.  It  is  not  possible  to 
insure for failure related to wear and tear and hence asset integrity at Tui is routinely reviewed at joint 
venture meetings and discussed with the Board.
HSE and Social Sustainability 
 
•  As  a  non-operator  PPP  does  not  have  direct  impact  on  significant  HSE  impacts,  and  relies  on  the 
performance  of  the  JV  operators  which  is  reviewed  at  joint  venture  meetings  and  by  the  Board  in 
monthly  and  operational  progress  reports.  The  Company  HSE  Policy  indicates  a  commitment  to 
support  the  Operator  adopting  measures  and  standards  that  will  improve  health,  safety  and 
environmental performance. The financial consequences of a significant HSE incident are managed 
through insurance.
•  Social sustainability is recognised as of importance by the Company which supports the community 
discretionary  programs  proposed  by  its  operators  in  New  Zealand  and  Vietnam,  and  the  Local 
Content obligations included in Production Service Contracts. Performance is periodically reviewed 
at Board meetings.
Corporate Governance Statement -  2016
PRINCIPLE 8:  
REMUNERATE FAIRLY AND RESPONSIBLY 
 
Recommendation  8.1  Remuneration  Committee  and  8.2  Disclosure  of  Remuneration 
policies and Practices 
 
The  Board  disbanded  the  Remuneration  Committee  on  22  June  2015.    The  Board  decided  it  was 
unecessary  and  an  unjustified  diversion  of  shareholders’  funds  to  establish  a  separate  Remuneration 
Committee given the nature of the Company’s operations and its low direct employee count.  The Board 
have assumed the  key responsibilities of establishing the remuneration for non-executive directors and 
Senior Executives including the CEO (if in office), and setting and evaluating performance objectives for 
the Senior Executives. The role also includes formulation of the Company’s Remuneration Policy, (which 
was last reviewed but not subsequently updated, on 24th August 2015) and any relevant policies relating 
to recruitment, retention and termination, formulation of short term and long term incentive schemes and 
review of the Remuneration Report. The Remuneration Policy is available on the Company’s website.
The Board, in setting remuneration levels , is mindful of the level of the base salary component of salaries 
paid to employees in equivalent positions in comparable companies in the same industry and considers the 
extent  to  which  the  proposed  remuneration  will  motivate  Senior  Executives  to  pursue  the  long-term 
growth  and  success  of  the  Company,  and  weighs  this  up  against  the  Company’s  desire  not  to  pay 
excessive remuneration. The Board also ensures that no individual is directly involved in determining the 
remuneration they will receive.
The Board where and when needed will consult with external consultants and specialists.
The  remuneration  for  non-executive  directors  is  structured  separately  from  that  of  Senior  Executives. 
Information  on  remuneration  for  non-executive  directors,  and  Senior  Executives  is  set  out  in  the 
Remuneration Report. The Company does not have in place any schemes for retirement benefits, other 
than superannuation, for non-executive directors.
The  Company  prohibits  as  a  general  policy,  non-executive  directors  and  Company  employees  from 
entering into transactions in associated products which limit the economic risk of participating in unvested 
entitlements under any equity-based remuneration schemes.
Remuneration matters are dealt with  formally at least once a year by the Board.
If any shareholders have any concerns with the Remuneration Report, the Board invites them to contact 
the Company and  meet  with  the Board before each annual general  meeting. The Board will try,  where 
appropriate, to take reasonable steps to address their concerns; subject always to their directors’ duties to 
the Company as a whole.
Recommendation 8.3 Policy on Equity Based Remuneration Scheme 
 
The Company does not have a companywide equity-based remuneration scheme.  From time to time in 
accordance with an Employee’s  contract options have been issued as part of a remuneration package.  For 
details please see the Remuneration Report in the Annual Report.  As the Corporations Act prohibits the 
key management personnel of an ASX listed company established in Australia, or a closely related party 
of such personnel, from entering into an arrangement that would have the effect of limiting their exposure 
to risk relating to an element of their remuneration that either has not vested or has vested but remains 
subject to a holding lock, there is no additional policy in place regarding Equity based Remuneration.
To  safeguard  against  insider  trading  the  Company’s  Securities  Trading  Policy  prohibits  directors, 
employees,  contractors  and  consultants  ("Workers")  from  trading  the  Company’s  securities  if  they  are 
aware of any information that would be expected to have a material effect on the price of the Company 
securities.
The Company has in place a Securities Trading Policy. Under the Policy, Workers are not able to trade in 
the Company’s securities: 
 
•
between close of trade two calendar weeks prior to the day on which preliminary final results are
Corporate Governance Statement -  2016
released to the ASX and the New Zealand Exchange ("NZX") and close of trade a calendar week 
after release of the preliminary final results; 
between close of trade two calendar weeks prior to the day on which half yearly results are released 
to the ASX and the NZX, and close of trade a calendar week after release of the half yearly results; 
any other period determined by the directors and notified to the Workers; or
• 
•  where  it  would  result  in  a  breach  of  the  insider  trading  provisions  of  the  Corporations  Act  2001
The Securities Trading Policy is available on the Company’s website. 
 
 
All  information  referred  to  in  the  Corporate  Governance  Statement  as  being  on  the

Governance Council during the reporting period. If the entity has not followed a recommendation for any part of the reporting period, its corporate 
governance statement must separately identify that recommendation and the period during which it was not followed and state its reasons for not 
following the recommendation and what (if any) alternative governance practices it adopted in lieu of the recommendation during that period. 
Under Listing Rule 4.7.4, if an entity chooses to include its corporate governance statement on its website rather than in its annual report, it must 
lodge a copy of the corporate governance statement with ASX at the same time as it lodges its annual report with ASX. The corporate governance 
statement must be current as at the effective date specified in that statement for the purposes of rule 4.10.3.
