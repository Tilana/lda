<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its thirteenth session from 
21 May to 4 June 2012.  The review of Tunisia was held at the third meeting, on 22 May 
2012. The delegation of Tunisia was headed by Samir Dilou, Minister of Human Rights and 
Transitional Justice, Speaker of the Government. At its 10th meeting, held on 25 May 2012, 
the Working Group adopted the report on Tunisia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Tunisia: Romania, Senegal, United States of 
America. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Council resolution 5/1 and 
paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the 
review of Tunisia: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">0. Congo congratulated Tunisia on its willingness to implement recommendations from

</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">. In this spirit, Tunisia had prepared its second national report, in cooperation with 
various segments of civil society, whose contribution was contained in the report, and with 
the full participation of the Ministries responsible for human rights issues as well as the 
High Council for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The report had been prepared in 
the context of the radical changes following the revolution. Following the repression and 
marginalization of the past, Tunisia now sought to promote human rights, including by </footnote>/13/TUN/2);

<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, 
Iceland, Ireland, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden and 
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Tunisia 
through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Tunisia stated that it was pleased to present its second report under the universal 
periodic review (UPR), after over a year had passed since its glorious revolution, which had 
responded to the longing of the Tunisian people for freedom, dignity and social justice. 
This started a new era in the history of Tunisia. The democratic transition was characterized 
by the recognition of individual and collective rights, political pluralism and peaceful 
democratic dialogue, based on free and fair elections and the sovereignty of the people.  
Tunisia had put an end to practices of the past and was determined to continue on this path 
and create an atmosphere of trust, so that it could occupy the position it deserves among 
nations, as a country proud of its civilization, with an Arab Islamic identity, open to modern 
trends and attached to the values of peace, democracy and human rights. 
</p>

<p>following up on the recommendations of the UPR and other human rights mechanisms as 
well as the evaluation mission of the OHCHR to Tunis right after the Revolution. 
</p>
<p>7. Based on its will to consolidate its cooperation with international human rights 
mechanisms, Tunisia had prepared a number of reports to the human rights treaty bodies 
and extended a standing invitation to all special procedures.  Three mandate holders had 
accepted this invitation and visited Tunisia in 2011 and 2012, and four more visits were 
planned for this year.  Tunisia had also acceded, inter alia, to the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) as well as to the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OP-CAT) in June 2011, and it was completing 
consultations with civil society regarding the creation of a national mechanism for the 
prevention of torture. A national consultation was held last Saturday and has approved the 
creation of a national commission composed of 60 per cent of civil society representatives 
and 40 per cent of Government institutions representatives in order to draft a law on the 
creation of the national mechanism.   Furthermore, Tunisia had adopted additional 
measures to create a legal framework for the prevention of torture, including the definition 
of the crime of torture in conformity with CAT and to declare confessions obtained under 
torture null and void.  The National Constituent Assembly will soon consider a draft law to 
abolish the statutory limitation of 15 years prescribed for this crime.   Tunisia had also 
concluded a number of agreements to host offices by international organizations, including 
OHCHR and UNHCR, and it had removed remaining obstacles for the work of NGOs.   All 
measures demonstrated Tunisia&#8217;s commitment to implementing the recommendations of its 
first cycle report at the UPR. 
</p>
<p>8. Since January 2011, Tunisia had worked to build a democratic system by taking 
measures such as a general amnesty and the recognition of human rights defenders, 
ensuring rights for victims, launching the process of transitional justice on the basis of wide 
national consensus, developing national human rights institutions, establishing a Ministry 
for human rights and transitional justice, and reforming the judiciary.   Furthermore, it was 
reforming its national security service into a republican administrative body that would 
protect the rights of all without discrimination, conscious that the protection of fundamental 
freedoms was no less important than national security.  Thus, Tunisia was establishing a 
pluralist democratic State attaching great importance to civil and political rights, freedom of 
expression, and the right to create parties and associations. 
</p>
<p>9. At the same time, Tunisia sought to further incorporate women&#8217;s rights into its 
development plans, and to firmly establish gender equality and develop constitutional 
mechanisms to guarantee their full participation in social and political life. The Government 
was also working with civil society to prevent violence against women and assist victims.  
Furthermore, it was taking efforts to ensure sound educational conditions and to adopt the 
necessary measures, mechanisms, legislation and policies to protect child rights at all 
levels. 
</p>
<p>10. Tunisia was convinced that political reform and democracy were possible, because it 
was uniting all forces to ensure stability in its development efforts so as to have a balanced 
society with economic stability and the enjoyment of economic and social rights, including 
access to health care and adequate living conditions.  The Government was listening to the 
people&#8217;s choice and strove to overcome poverty and marginalization.  It had made efforts 
under its financial law of 2012 to adopt a budget that would help vulnerable groups and 
develop the infrastructure to provide basic services to all.  The protection of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms was a strategic choice.  A new Constitution is being drawn up 
by the Constitutional Assembly, following the first free and fair elections.  The Government 
would continue to work towards a pluralist democracy, in consultation with all segments of 
society.  In this process, it welcomed all constructive recommendations and support.   The 
lack of democracy in the past had not allowed the spread of a democratic culture, but the </p>


<p>political changes would help to overcome challenges and further open up society through a 
national dialogue. 
</p>
<p>11. Last week, Tunisia had signed an agreement with OHCHR and the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) for the support of the judiciary reform and transitional 
justice.  The experience of others could help Tunisia in efforts to overcome its difficulties, 
and cooperation and solidarity would strengthen economic and social development as well 
as the democratic process.  In this spirit, Tunisia welcomed all interventions and 
recommendations, from which it could only benefit at this delicate stage of its democratic 
transition. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>34. The United States of America saluted the Tunisian people for initiating a transition

determination of Tunisia to achieve gender equality, and for the ratification of the Optional 
Protocol to CEDAW. Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Tunisia stated that changes presently occurring did not only concern changes on the 
ground and legislative enactments, but rather the whole mentality of the nation. With 
respect to questions regarding torture and abuse, Tunisia stated that such practices had been 
a major cause of civil society struggle against the previous regime. The existence of torture 
and cruel and inhumane treatment had, for years, tarnished the image of Tunisia. Therefore, 
reforms had been undertaken in relation to legislation and prison conditions. In the context 
of the ratification of the OP-CAT, a committee to draft a law on the creation of national 
prevention mechanism had been established, mainly of members from civil society, with 
the participation of the Government. This committee would also organize human rights 
training programmes. 
</p>
<p>37. Tunisia emphasized the need to bring its legal framework in line with international 
standards. Human rights law had been introduced in the training programme, in particular 
for first-year studies at the Institut Sup&#233;rieur de la Magistrature, and training in human 
rights was provided for the judiciary, law enforcement officers and prison wardens. 
</p>
<p>38. Ratification of the third Optional Protocol to CRC was under consideration and 
would constitute an additional step to strengthen respect for human rights and to 
complement measures previously adopted to combat the sale of children and the use of 
children in pornography.  Significant steps had also been taken towards the ratification of 
other human rights instruments. </p>


<p>39. Tunisia drew attention to on the fact that the death penalty had not been 
implemented for over 20 years in Tunisia.  Although Tunisia aimed to meet international 
standards regarding the death penalty, it emphasized that this was not only a legal matter, 
but that it had also cultural and religious implications. Tunisia further stated that the 
abolition of the death penalty should be a result of a wide and credible national debate. 
</p>
<p>40. Regarding the decriminalization of homosexuality, Tunisia stated that it would be 
possible to conduct an objective and transparent national dialogue on the subject.  However, 
it was not ready at this stage to adopt a decision. 
</p>
<p>41. Questions concerning the independence of the judiciary would be addressed by the 
National Constitutional Assembly.  The intention was to separate the judicial system from 
all other authorities. Judges should only be bound by the dictates of their conscience and 
the law. Tunisia would reform the framework of the judiciary and ensure its independence 
through provisions in the new Constitution, although reform efforts would also require 
financial resources. 
</p>
<p>42. Tunisia further stated that the National Constitutional Assembly would uphold 
Tunisia&#8217;s international obligations regarding respect for human rights and gender equality, 
and that the religious and cultural authorities in the country would not work against its 
international undertakings. 
</p>
<p>43. Concerning the reform of the security services, Tunisia stated that a number of 
institutional reforms and legislation changes were under way. Many consultations had been 
held in conjunction with the United Nations and other organizations. Legal instruments and 
tools underpinning the reformed security services should also help to bring about a change 
in the public perception of these services.  Tunisia reported that the Ministry of the Interior, 
in cooperation with various organizations and agencies including UNDP, had organized 
several workshops to revise the law pertaining to public meetings and demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>44. Moreover, Tunisia stated that a decision had been taken to follow a participatory 
path for progress in transitional justice. Tunisia had involved all sectors of civil society, 
including the opposition, and held a national symposium on 14 April 2012.  Also in April, 
Tunisia held an open forum to listen to proposals put forward by civil society. Four 
meetings involving civil society had been held in May 2012, as a result of which a 
committee had been established to facilitate the national dialogue for the preparation of a 
draft law on transitional justice, to be ratified by the National Constituent Assembly within 
3 months. 
</p>
<p>45. Yemen wanted to know measures intended to be taken to strengthen the partnership 
between the Government and the society for the benefit of persons with disabilities. It made 
a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>46. Angola welcomed the reform of the judiciary system and the creation of a Ministry 
of Human Rights and Transitional Justice. However, despite the efforts undertaken, Angola 
noted that there still was progresseto be made in the area of human rights. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>

</p>

</p>

<p>51. Bahrain underlined that Tunisia was making progress in areas such as education, 
health and living conditions.  It also asked for more information on the indicators of success 
of programmes and plans for development and for meeting its Millennium Development 
Goals. 
</p>
<p>52. Belgium commended the efforts made in the area of human rights since the fall of 
the Ben Ali regime. Despite the progress accomplished, Belgium highlighted the need to 
remain vigilant so that Tunisia would pursue its path towards a full and modern democracy. 
It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Botswana noted that Tunisia had managed to make human rights a priority despite 
the pressures of a major political transition. Some of the milestones included ratification of 
the Rome Statute of the ICC and the OP-CAT as well as the election of the National 
Constituent Assembly. Botswana made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Brazil congratulated Tunisia for the remarkable achievements since last year, 
including the democratic, free and transparent elections; the ratification of several human 
rights treaties and the withdrawal of reservations to CEDAW. It underlined that special 
attention should be given to include in the new Constitution provisions which guarantee the 
rights to freedom of opinion and expression. Brazil made a recommendation. 
</p>
