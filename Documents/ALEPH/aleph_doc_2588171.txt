RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
The following discussion of PEMEX’s recent results should be read in conjunction with the annual report on Form 20-F of Petróleos Mexicanos for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2013, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (which we refer to as the SEC) on May 15, 2014 (which we
refer to as the Form 20-F) and, in particular, “Item 4—Information on the Company” and “Item 5—Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” in the Form
20-F, and with the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of PEMEX included in this report beginning on page F-1. In this document,
“PEMEX” refers to Petróleos Mexicanos, Pemex-Exploración y Producción (Pemex-Exploration and Production), Pemex-Refinación (Pemex-Refining),
Pemex-Gas y Petroquímica Básica (Pemex-Gas and Basic Petrochemicals) and Pemex-Petroquímica (Pemex-Petrochemicals) (which we refer to
collectively as the subsidiary entities), and to the subsidiary companies listed in Note 3(a) to the 2013 audited consolidated financial statements included in
the Form 20-F. Petróleos Mexicanos hereby designates this report on Form 6-K as being incorporated by reference into the Offering Circular dated
January 31, 2014, relating to its U.S. $42,000,000,000 Medium-Term Notes Program, Series C, due 1 Year or More from Date of Issue.
Exchange Rates
On August 22, 2014, the noon buying rate for cable transfers in New York reported by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was

Energy Reform
Energy Reform Decree
Following the approval of amendments to Articles 25, 27 and 28 of the Constitución Política de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos (Political Constitution of the
United Mexican States) by the Mexican Congress on December 12, 2013 and by a majority of Mexico’s state legislatures, the President of Mexico, Enrique
Peña Nieto, signed the amendments into law. On December 20, 2013, these amendments were published as the Decreto por el que se reforman y adicionan
diversas disposiciones de la Constitución Política de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, en Materia de Energía (Decree that amends and supplements various
provisions of the Mexican Constitution relating to energy matters, which we refer to as the Energy Reform Decree), in the Diario Oficial de la Federación
(Official Gazette of the Federation) and took effect on December 21, 2013. The Energy Reform Decree includes artículos transitorios (transitional articles)
that set forth the general framework for the implementing laws that are required to give effect to the Energy Reform Decree. For more information regarding
the Energy Reform Decree, please see “Item 4—Information on the Company—History and Development—Energy Reform” in the Form 20-F.
Secondary Legislation
On August 6, 2014, the Mexican Congress completed the process of approving bills implementing the new legal framework contemplated by the Energy
Reform Decree (which we refer to as the Secondary Legislation). The Secondary Legislation was signed into law by President Enrique Peña Nieto and
published in the Official Gazette of the Federation on August 11, 2014. Certain elements of the Secondary Legislation, including the new Ley de Petróleos
Mexicanos (Petróleos Mexicanos Law), are not yet effective as of the date of this report.
Table of Contents
2
The Secondary Legislation includes nine new laws, of which the following are most relevant to our operations:
•
Ley de Hidrocarburos (Hydrocarbons Law), which repeals the Ley Reglamentaria del Articulo 27 Constitucional en el Ramo del Petróleo
(Regulatory Law to Article 27 of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States Concerning Petroleum Affairs);
•
•
•
•
Petróleos Mexicanos Law, which will repeal the Petróleos Mexicanos Law that took effect on November 29, 2008;
Ley de Ingresos sobre Hidrocarburos (Hydrocarbons Revenue Law);
Ley de los Órganos Reguladores Coordinados en Materia Energética (Coordinated Energy Regulatory Bodies Law);
Ley de la Agencia Nacional de Seguridad Industrial y de Protección al Medio Ambiente del Sector Hidrocarburos (National Agency of Industrial
Safety and Environmental Protection for the Hydrocarbons Sector Law); and
•
Ley del Fondo Mexicano del Petróleo para la Estabilización y el Desarrollo (Mexican Petroleum Fund for Stabilization and Development Law).
The Secondary Legislation also includes amendments to several laws, including the following:
•
Ley Federal de las Entidades Paraestatales (Federal Law of Public Sector Entities);
•
•
•
•
•
Ley Federal de Presupuesto y Responsabilidad Hacendaria (Federal Law of Budget and Fiscal Accountability);
Ley General de Deuda Pública (General Law of Public Debt);
Ley Federal de Derechos (Federal Duties Law);
Ley de Obras PÚblicas y Servicios Relacionados con las Mismas (Law of Public Works and Related Services); and
Ley de Adquisiciones, Arrendamientos y Servicios del Sector PÚblico (Law of Acquisitions, Leases and Services of the Public Sector).
We describe below the key features of the Secondary Legislation that relate to our corporate structure and operations:
•
Third-party participation: The new regulatory framework established pursuant to the Hydrocarbons Law allows third parties to participate in
certain activities in the Mexican hydrocarbons industry that were previously reserved to us.
•
Our conversion to a productive state-owned company: Pursuant to the new Petróleos Mexicanos Law, on the day following the appointment of
the new Board of Directors of Petróleos Mexicanos, which must take place within 90 days of the publication of the new Petróleos Mexicanos
Law in the Official Gazette of the Federation, we will be converted from a decentralized public entity to an empresa productiva del Estado
(productive state-owned company) controlled by the Federal Government of Mexico.
•
Corporate reorganization: Within 45 days of the appointment of the new Board of Directors of Petróleos Mexicanos, the Director General of
Petróleos Mexicanos is to present a proposal for the corporate reorganization of PEMEX to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will
then have three months to modify or approve the Director General’s proposal.
3
Table of Contents
As part of such corporate reorganization, our existing subsidiary entities may be converted to empresas productivas subsidiarias (productive state-owned
subsidiary companies), which will assume all rights and obligations of the existing subsidiary entities. Pursuant to the new Petróleos Mexicanos Law, our
exploration and production activities may only be carried out through one or more productive state-owned subsidiary companies. Our corporate structure may
also include affiliates that undertake activities other than exploration and production. These affiliates may either be companies in which Petróleos Mexicanos
has a direct or indirect minority stake or companies with which Petróleos Mexicanos participates in a joint venture or other form of association.
•
Corporate actions: The new Petróleos Mexicanos Law will establish a framework for the regulation of certain of our corporate actions with
respect to acquisitions, leases and property, as well as our Board of Directors’ decision-making with respect to compensation, budgetary issues
and our level of debt, subject to certain restrictions.
•
Pension liabilities: The Secondary Legislation enables the Mexican Government to assume a portion of our unfunded reserve for retirement
pensions and seniority premiums, which as of December 31, 2013, was equal to approximately U.S. $85.6 billion. In turn, we will be required to
renegotiate the collective bargaining agreement between Petróleos Mexicanos and the Sindicato de Trabajadores Petroleros de la República
Mexicana (Petroleum Workers’ Union) and modify the Reglamento de Trabajo del Personal de Confianza de Petróleos Mexicanos y
Organismos Subsidiarios (Employment Regulation for White Collar Employees of Petróleos Mexicanos and Subsidiary Entities) in order to meet
the following conditions, among others, within a year:
•
•
•
offering our new employees individualized defined contribution plans through the Sistema de Ahorro para el Retiro (Retirement Saving
System) in Mexico;
adjusting the parameters of our retirement plans, including an increase in the retirement age; and
the audit of our pension liabilities by the Auditoría Superior de la Federación (Superior Audit Office of the Federation).
The Mexican Government may assume a portion of our pension liabilities equivalent to the reduction in liabilities achieved through changes to our pension
system. However, the actual amount of our pension liabilities that this portion will represent has not yet been determined as of the date of this report.

Round Zero
4
The transitional articles of the Energy Reform Decree outlined a process, commonly referred to as Round Zero, for the determination of our initial allocation
of rights to continue to carry out exploration and production activities in Mexico. The Ministry of Energy, with technical assistance from the NHC, evaluated
our request to be assigned oil and gas exploration and extraction rights in certain areas based on our technical, financial and operational capabilities. On
August 13, 2014, the Ministry of Energy published the results of Round Zero, pursuant to which we were assigned rights corresponding to areas that together
contain 95% of Mexico’s estimated proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas as of December 31, 2013. We believe that these assignments will allow us to
maintain our current production and provide sufficient exploration opportunities to increase our production in the long term, thereby permitting us to compete
effectively in the Mexican hydrocarbons industry.
Pursuant to the Secondary Legislation, we may modify our existing Integrated Exploration and Production Contracts (which we refer to as Integrated E&P
Contracts) and Financed Public Works Contracts (which we refer to as FPWC) to adopt the new contractual arrangements for exploration and extraction
activities provided for under the new legal framework.
By February 2015, we plan to modify the terms of the Integrated E&P Contracts corresponding to the Santuario and Magallanes fields in the Southern region
of Mexico and the Altamira, Pánuco, San Andrés, Tierra Blanca, Ébano, Nejo and Arenque fields in the Northern region of Mexico. We also plan to modify
the FPWCs corresponding to the Olmos and Misión fields of the Burgos business unit in the Northern region during the same period.
During the second half of 2015, we plan to modify 11 additional contracts, including the Integrated E&P Contracts corresponding to the Soledad, Amatitlán,
Humapa, Pitepec, Miquetla and Miahuapan fields located in the Chicontepec basin and the Carrizo field in the Samaria business unit, as well as the FPWCs
corresponding to the Pirineo, Cuervito, Fronterizo and Monclova fields of the Burgos business unit.
For more information regarding these contracts, please see Item 4—Information on the Company—Business Overview—Exploration and Production—
Integrated Exploration and Production Contracts.” and “—Financed Public Works Contracts” in the Form 20-F.

In the short term, we have identified ten opportunities for joint ventures with third parties, referred to as “farm-out” agreements, from the areas assigned to us
pursuant to Round Zero. The selected areas were identified on the basis of their technical complexity, capital requirements and other strategic
considerations. We hope that these strategic partnerships will help us increase production levels, accelerate field development, gain access to new
technologies and best practices in the industry and reduce our capital commitments. The following table sets forth, by field type, the areas that we plan to
explore and develop through strategic partnerships:
Mature onshore fields...................................................

As of the date of this report, we continue to evaluate the areas assigned to us pursuant to Round Zero to identify additional opportunities for strategic
partnerships to pursue as part of the Round One bidding process.
Round One
Areas that we did not request or were not assigned to us pursuant to Round Zero will be subject to a competitive bidding process open to participation by us
and third parties, which is commonly referred as Round One. The Mexican Government has announced that the tender process for Round One is scheduled
to begin by the end of 2014 and the corresponding contracts are expected to be awarded in 2015. Round One is expected to include 169 blocks—109
exploration blocks and 60 production blocks—covering an aggregate area of approximately 28,500 square kilometers.

Corporate Reorganization
On August 20, 2014, the Director General of Petróleos Mexicanos announced that he will present a proposal to the new Board of Directors of Petróleos
Mexicanos, once it is appointed, for the reorganization of PEMEX’s corporate structure. Pursuant to the proposal, our new corporate structure is expected to
include:
•
•
•
a new productive state-owned subsidiary company to carry out exploration and production activities;
a new productive state-owned subsidiary company to carry out industrial transformation activities; and
three new affiliates, each of which will conduct one of the following activities: providing drilling services to new participants in the energy sector;
coordinating logistics and transportation services; and cogenerating electricity in order to supply surplus power to the Mexican market, in
coordination with the Ministry of Energy and the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (Federal Electricity Commission).
Selected Financial Data
The selected financial data as of December 31, 2013 and June 30, 2014 and for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2014 have been derived

interest capitalized during the period, plus the amortization of capitalized interest during the period and plus dividends received on equity investments.
Pre-tax income (loss) is calculated after the deduction of hydrocarbon duties, but before the deduction of the hydrocarbon income tax and other income
taxes. Fixed charges for this purpose consist of the sum of interest expense plus interest capitalized during the period. Fixed charges do not take into
account exchange gain or loss attributable to our indebtedness. Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2013 and for the six months ended June 30,
2013 and 2014 were insufficient to cover fixed charges, which exceeded earnings by Ps. 163,803 million, Ps. 47,061 million and Ps. 81,797 million
during these periods, respectively.

Total Sales
Total sales increased by 3.4% in the first six months of 2014, from Ps. 789.4 billion in the first six months of 2013 to Ps. 816.0 billion in the first six months of
2014. This increase in total sales resulted primarily due to the factors described under “Domestic Sales” below.
Domestic Sales
Domestic sales increased by 6.1% in the first six months of 2014, from Ps. 445.7 billion in the first six months of 2013 to Ps. 472.8 billion in the first six
months of 2014, primarily due to increases in sales prices of natural gas and gasoline, which were partially offset by lower sales volumes of principal
petroleum products and fuel oil.
Domestic sales of dry natural gas increased by 35.9% in the first six months of 2014, from Ps. 34.0 billion in the first six months of 2013 to Ps. 46.2 billion in
the first six months of 2014, primarily due to increases in sales prices and an increase in demand from the Federal Electricity Commission, which transitioned
from using fuel oil to lower-cost natural gas to operate its plants during this period.
Table of Contents
10
Domestic sales of petroleum products increased by 3.5% in the first six months of 2014, from Ps. 393.9 billion in the first six months of 2013 to Ps. 407.5
billion in the first six months of 2014, primarily due to increases in the sales prices of gasoline and diesel. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in
the sales volumes of Magna gasoline and other major petroleum products, as well as diesel and fuel oil.
Domestic petrochemical sales (including sales of certain by-products of the petrochemical production process) increased by 7.9%, from Ps. 17.8 billion in the
first six months of 2013 to Ps. 19.2 billion in the first six months of 2014, primarily due to increases in the sales prices of propylene and polyethylene.
Export Sales
Total export sales (with U.S. dollar-denominated export revenues translated to pesos at the exchange rate on the date on which the corresponding export
sale was made), remained constant at Ps. 338.9 billion in the first six months of 2013 and the first six months of 2014, despite a 5.9% decrease in the
weighted average prices of export crude oil and a 6.9% decrease in export crude oil sales volume resulting from a decrease in the availability of crude oil for
export.
Excluding the trading activities of P.M.I. Comercio Internacional, S.A. de C.V. (which we refer to as PMI CIM), P.M.I. Trading, Ltd. and their affiliates (which,
together with PMI CIM, we collectively refer to as the PMI Group), and Mex Gas International, Ltd. (which we refer to as MGAS), export sales by the
subsidiary entities to the PMI Group and MGAS decreased by 3.2%, from Ps. 304.2 billion in the first six months of 2013 to Ps. 294.5 billion in the first six
months of 2014. In U.S. dollar terms, excluding the trading activities of the PMI Group and MGAS, total export sales decreased by 7.4%, from U.S. $24.2
billion in the first six months of 2013 to U.S. $22.4 billion in the first six months of 2014, primarily due to a decrease in export sales prices and volume.
Crude oil and condensate export sales accounted for 86.7% of export sales (excluding the trading activities of the PMI Group) in the first six months of 2014,
as compared to 88.5% in the first six months of 2013. Crude oil and condensate export sales decreased in peso terms by 5.1%, from Ps. 269.1 billion in the
first six months of 2013 to Ps. 255.3 billion in the first six months of 2014, primarily due to a 5.9% decrease in the weighted average export price of the
Mexican crude oil basket, from U.S. $100.78 per barrel in the first six months of 2013 to U.S. $94.80 in the first six months of 2014. The volume of crude oil
exports decreased by 2.7%, from 1,167 thousand barrels per day in the first six months of 2013 to 1,136 thousand barrels per day in the first six months of
2014, primarily due to a decrease in crude oil production.
Export sales of petroleum products represented 12.9% of export sales (excluding the trading activities of the PMI Group) in the first six months of 2014, as
compared to 11.2% in the first six months of 2013. Export sales of petroleum products increased by 7.6%, from Ps. 34.0 billion in the first six months of 2013
to Ps. 36.6 billion in the first six months of 2014, primarily due to an increase in the volume of fuel oil available for sale as a result of the Federal Electricity
Commission’s decreased demand for this product and an increase in the volume of liquefied petroleum gas sold.
Petrochemical products accounted for the remainder of export sales (excluding the trading activities of the PMI Group) in the first six months of 2013 and
2014 (0.39% and 0.34%, respectively). Export sales of petrochemical products (including certain by-products of the petrochemical process) decreased by
16.7%, from Ps. 1.2 billion in the first six months of 2013 to Ps. 1.0 billion in the first six months of 2014, primarily due to a decrease in the sales prices of
certain petrochemical products, such as sulfur and butadiene.

Services Income
11
Services income decreased by 10.4% in the first six months of 2014, from Ps. 4.8 billion in the first six months of 2013 to Ps. 4.3 billion in the first six months
of 2014, mainly as a result of a decrease in the amount of fees collected in connection with freight and pipeline transportation services provided to third
parties. This decrease was partially offset by insurance revenues from Kot Insurance Company, AG, one of our wholly-owned subsidiary companies, which
reinsures our policies held through local insurance carriers.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales increased by 8.0%, from Ps. 388.1 billion in the first six months of 2013 to Ps. 419.0 billion in the first six months of 2014. This increase was
primarily due to an increase in the costs of purchases of imported products, including (1) a Ps. 4.9 billion increase in the costs of purchases of imported
premium gasoline; (2) a Ps. 3.8 billion increase in the costs of purchases of imported diesel; (3) a Ps. 5.8 billion increase in the costs of purchases of
imported liquefied gas and imported natural gas; (4) a Ps. 3.5 billion increase in the costs of purchases of imported liquefied natural gas; and (5) a
Ps. 13.5 billion increase in the costs associated with our subsidiary companies, mainly due to the resumption of operations at the refinery located in Deer
Park, Texas. This increase in costs of sales is further explained by (1) a Ps. 3.4 billion increase in costs associated with maintenance and repair of our
productive business units; (2) a Ps. 3.3 billion increase in expenses incurred in connection with unsuccessful wells; and (3) a Ps. 2.4 billion increase in costs
associated with exploration activities carried out to maintain optimum hydrocarbon production. This increase was partially offset by a Ps. 6.2 billion decrease
in fuel oil purchases due to a decrease in the Federal Electricity Commission’s demand for fuel oil.
General Expenses
General expenses increased by 5.7%, from Ps. 65.2 billion in the first six months of 2013 to Ps. 68.9 billion in the first six months of 2014. This increase was
primarily due to a Ps. 2.1 billion increase in the net cost of employee benefits related to general expenses for the period as a result of salary increases, the
financial impact of an additional year of seniority granted to all employees and changes to the assumptions used in actuarial calculations.
Other Revenues and Expenses, Net
Other revenues and expenses, net, decreased by Ps. 38.6 billion, or 61.5%, from net revenues of Ps. 62.8 billion in the first six months of 2013 to net
revenues of Ps. 24.2 billion in the first six months of 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a lower credit attributable to the negative IEPS tax rate, which
is generated when the prices at which we sell gasoline and diesel in the domestic market are lower than the international market prices for such products.
The credit attributable to the negative IEPS tax rate decreased by Ps. 25.9 billion, from Ps. 56.8 billion in the first six months of 2013 to Ps. 30.9 billion in the
first six months of 2014, due to a decrease in the difference between domestic retail prices and international reference prices for gasoline and diesel in the
first six months of 2014 as compared to the corresponding period of 2013. In addition, other revenues and expenses, net, decreased due to a Ps. 8.7 billion
impairment of fixed assets at the Burgos business unit during the first six months of 2014 that resulted from a decline in international natural gas sales prices
and the negative effect of changes in the valuation of future cash flows from the hydrocarbons reserves corresponding to the Burgos business unit. Other
revenues and expenses, net, also decreased during the first six months of 2014 as a result of the positive effect during the first six months of 2013 of the
collection of a Ps. 5.0 billion judgment.

Financing Income
12
Our financing income increased by Ps. 3.7 billion, from Ps. 5.7 billion in the first six months of 2013 to Ps. 9.4 billion in the first six months of 2014. This
increase was primarily due to an increase in income associated with certain derivative financial instruments as a result of the appreciation of currencies
hedged against the U.S. dollar.
Financing Cost
Financing cost decreased by Ps. 2.1 billion, from Ps. 29.3 billion in the first six months of 2013 to Ps. 27.2 billion in the first six months of 2014. This
decrease was primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with certain derivative financial instruments.
Exchange Gain (Loss), Net
A substantial portion of our indebtedness, 81.6% as of June 30, 2014, is denominated in foreign currencies. Our exchange gain, net, decreased by Ps. 0.5
billion, from an exchange gain of Ps. 3.9 billion in the first six months of 2013 to an exchange gain of Ps. 3.4 billion in the first six months of 2014. This
decrease primarily resulted from the depreciation of the peso against the pound sterling during the first six months of 2014, which was only partially offset by
the appreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar during the first six months of 2014, in each case as compared to the same period of 2013.
Taxes and Duties
Hydrocarbon extraction duties and other duties and taxes paid decreased by 1.0%, from Ps. 432.5 billion in the first six months of 2013 to Ps. 428.0 billion in
the first six months of 2014, largely due to a 3.3% decrease in the weighted average price of the Mexican crude oil basket, from U.S. $100.78 per barrel in the
first six months of 2013 to U.S. $94.80 per barrel in the same period of 2014. As a result, taxes and duties represented 52.5% of total sales in the first six
months of 2014, as compared to 54.8% in the first six months of 2013.
Net Loss
In the first six months of 2014, we reported a net loss of Ps. 88.2 billion (U.S. $6.8 billion) on Ps. 816.0 billion in total sales, as compared to a net loss of
Ps. 53.4 billion (U.S. $4.1 billion) on Ps. 789.4 billion in total sales in the first six months of 2013. This increase in net loss during the first six months of 2014
is primarily explained by: (1) a decrease in other revenues and expenses, net, due primarily to a lower credit attributable to the negative IEPS tax rate and
(2) an increase in cost of sales and general expenses. This increase was only partially offset by a 6.1% increase in domestic sales during this period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows from Operating, Financing and Investing Activities
During the first six months of 2014, net funds used in operating activities totaled Ps. 22.0 billion, as compared to Ps. 113.9 billion in the first six months of
2013. During the first six months of 2014, our net cash flows from financing activities totaled Ps. 66.3 billion, as compared to net cash flows used in financing
activities of Ps. 40.8 billion in the first six months of 2013. During the first six months of 2014, new financings totaled approximately Ps. 177.8 billion and
payments of principal and interest totaled Ps. 113.3 billion, as compared to approximately Ps. 107.6 billion and Ps. 148.4 billion, respectively, during the first
six months of 2013. During the first six months of 2014, we applied net funds of Ps. 92.6 billion to acquisitions of wells, pipelines, properties, plant and
equipment, as compared to Ps. 87.2 billion in the first six months of 2013.

At June 30, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents totaled Ps. 88.4 billion, as compared to Ps. 80.7 billion at December 31, 2013.
Recent Financing Activities
During the period from May 16 to July 24, 2014, Petróleos Mexicanos participated in the following financing activities:
•
On July 2, 2014, Petróleos Mexicanos issued Ps. 11,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Certificados Bursátiles due 2024 at a fixed
rate of 7.19%, consisting of (1) an international offering outside of Mexico of Ps. 2,353,100,000 of Certificados Bursátiles in the form of global
depositary notes (or GDNs), and (2) a concurrent offering to the public in Mexico of Ps. 8,646,900,000 of Certificados Bursátiles not represented
by GDNs. The issuance represented the third reopening of its Certificados Bursátiles due 2024, which were originally issued on September 26,
2013 and subsequently reopened on December 11, 2013 and January 30, 2014. Concurrently, Petróleos Mexicanos issued, in the Mexican
market, Ps. 4,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Certificados Bursátiles in two tranches: one at a floating rate due 2019 in an aggregate
principal amount of Ps. 1,500,000,000, which was a reopening of the same series originally issued on September 19, 2013 and subsequently
reopened on December 11, 2013 and January 30, 2014; and the second at a fixed rate of 3.94% due 2026 in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the Unidades de Inversión (or UDI) equivalent of Ps. 2,500,000,000, which was a reopening of the same series originally issued on
January 30, 2014. These certificados bursátiles were issued under Petróleos Mexicanos’ Ps. 200,000,000,000 or UDI equivalent Certificados
Bursátiles Program. All debt securities issued under this program are guaranteed by Pemex-Exploration and Production, Pemex-Refining and
Pemex-Gas and Basic Petrochemicals.
•
On July 26, 2014, Petróleos Mexicanos entered into a syndicated credit facility in the amount of Ps. 26,000,000,000; the facility bears interest at
a floating rate linked to the Tasa de Interés Interbancaria de Equilibrio (Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate) and matures on July 25, 2024.
During the period from June 21 to August 15, 2014, P.M.I. Holdings, B.V. did not obtain any additional financing from its revolving credit line and repaid
U.S. $50,000,000.
Indebtedness
During the first six months of 2014, our total debt increased by 10.0%, from Ps. 841.2 billion at December 31, 2013 to Ps. 925.1 billion at June 30, 2014,
primarily due to the financing activities undertaken during this period, as described in Note 12 to the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements included herein.
At June 30, 2014 and as of the date of this report, we were not in default on any of our financing agreements.

Amendments to Certain Financing Agreements
In order to align certain of our financing agreements with the changes resulting from the Energy Reform Decree and the Secondary Legislation described
above under “Energy Reform,” we have sought to obtain consents from our bondholders and lenders to amend provisions in these financing agreements that
relate to Petróleos Mexicanos’ characterization as a legal entity under Mexican law and to our exclusive authority to participate on behalf of the Mexican
government in the oil and gas sector in Mexico, each of which is expected to change in the near future as a result of the Energy Reform Decree. On June 25,
2014, we obtained the requisite number of consents from bondholders to amend the instruments governing approximately U.S. $41.4 billion aggregate
principal amount of our outstanding debt securities and we continue to seek consents from banks and certain other creditors with respect to other financing
agreements that contain similar provisions.
For more information regarding the Energy Reform Decree and its potential impact on us, please see “Item 4—Information on the Company—History and
Development—Energy Reform” in our Form 20-F.

Crude oil production decreased by 2.0% in the first six months of 2014, from 2,530 thousand barrels per day in the first six months of 2013 to 2,480 thousand
barrels per day in the first six months of 2014. This decrease was mainly due to:
•
a 4.8% decrease in the production of heavy crude oil, primarily due to (1) an increase in the fractional water flow of wells; (2) a natural decline in
production at the fields located in the Cantarell business unit in the Northeastern Marine region; and (3) annual maintenance of equipment
located in the Yúum K’Ak’Naab Floating Production Storage and Offloading “FPSO” vessel located in the Ku-Maloob-Zaap business unit in the
Northeastern Marine region; and
•
a 2.6% decrease in the production of extra-light crude oil, primarily due to a natural decline in production at the Crudo Ligero Marino project in
the Southwestern Marine region, as well as an increase in the fractional water flow of wells at the Pijije and Sen fields of the Delta del Grijalva
project located in the Southern region.
This decrease was partially offset by a 4.2% increase in the production of light crude oil at the Kuil, Onel, Chuhuk and Tsimin fields in the Southwestern
Marine region, at the Kambesah field in the Northeastern Marine region, at the Artesa field in the Southern region and at the Gasífero and Bedel fields in the
Northern region. As of June 30, 2014, average aggregate production in these fields reached 176.8 thousand barrels per day.
Natural gas production increased by 2.4% in the first six months of 2014, from 6,369 million cubic feet per day in the first six months of 2013 to 6,523 million
cubic feet per day in the first six months of 2014. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in associated gas production at the Ku-Maloob-Zaap
and Cantarell business units in the Northeastern Marine region, at the Litoral de Tabasco business units in the Southwestern Marine region and at the
Samaria-Luna business unit in the Southern region. This increase was partially offset by a decline in non-associated gas production during the period,
primarily due to a scheduled reduction in drilling activities and the completion of wells at the Veracruz and Burgos business units in the Northern region.
Production of petroleum products decreased by 5.1% in the first six months of 2014, from 1,316 thousand barrels per day in the first six months of 2013 to
1,249 thousand barrels per day in the first six months of 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the total amount of crude oil processed
during this period due to scheduled maintenance activities and unscheduled refurbishing of certain plants. Nevertheless, the production percentage of
petroleum products with higher value added over total output recorded a slight increase.
Petrochemicals production increased by 3.6% in the first six months of 2014, from 3,777 thousand tons in the first six months of 2013 to 3,914 thousand tons
in the first six months of 2014. This increase was primarily due to increases in the production of:
•
the aromatics and derivatives chain due to the stabilization of the continuous catalytic regeneration (CCR) plant and regularized operations of
the aromatics plants at the Cangrejera petrochemical complex;
•
•
the propylene and derivatives chain, due to greater availability of propylene and to the stabilization of the acrylonitrile production plant; and
the methane derivatives chain due to the increased availability of natural gas, which increased ammonia output, and to the stabilization of the
methanol production plant.
This increase was partially offset by (1) a decrease in production in the ethane derivatives chain, mainly due to the transfer of production of vinyl chloride and
muriatic acid to the joint venture between Pemex-Petrochemicals and Petroquímica Mexicana de Vinilo, S.A. de C.V. in September 2013; and (2) an
unscheduled shutdown of the linear low density polyethylene production line and a decrease in production of other petrochemicals, primarily due to a
decrease in production of octane gasoline as a result of its increased use as an input for processing at the CCR plant.

Los Ramones Gas Pipeline
17
The Los Ramones pipeline project, which will be implemented in two phases, is part of a strategy to supply central Mexico with natural gas imported from the
United States. Phase one consists of the construction of a pipeline from the U.S. border near Ciudad Camargo, Tamaulipas to Los Ramones, Nuevo León.
Phase two of the project, which consists of a pipeline from Los Ramones to Apaseo el Alto, Guanajuato, is further subdivided into two stages, Ramones
Norte and Ramones Sur, which refer to the northern and southern portions of that pipeline, respectively.
On July 9, 2014, we announced that TAG Pipelines Norte, S. de R.L. de C.V. (an indirect subsidiary of Pemex-Gas and Basic Petrochemicals) had entered
into a contract with a consortium formed by Odebrecht, Techint and Arendal for the engineering, procurement and construction of Phase II of the Ramones
Norte stage of the pipeline. Ramones Norte consists of a 447 kilometer portion of the pipeline from Los Ramones to San Luis Potosí and will require an
estimated U.S. $1,052 million investment. Another indirect subsidiary of Pemex-Gas and Basic Petrochemicals, TAG Pipelines Sur, S. de R.L. de C.V., has
entered into a contract with ICA Fluor (a joint venture between Empresas ICA, S.A.B. de C.V. and Fluor Corporation) for the engineering, procurement and
construction of the Ramones Sur stage of the pipeline, which consists of a 291 kilometer portion of the pipeline from San Luis Potosí to Apaseo el Alto and
will require an estimated U.S. $795 million investment. For more information regarding the Los Ramones pipeline project, please see “Item 4—Information on
the Company—Gas and Basic Petrochemicals—Pipelines—Los Ramones Gas Pipeline” in the Form 20-F.

share capital, at a price of €20.10 per share. Prior to the sale, these shares were held by Petróleos Mexicanos and P.M.I. Holdings, B.V., a wholly owned
subsidiary. We have agreed not to dispose of any additional shares of Repsol for 60 days following the completion of the sale, subject to certain customary
exceptions. As of the date of this report, our share of the economic and voting rights in Repsol is 1.44%. For more information regarding our investment in
Repsol, please see “Item 4—Information on the Company—PEMEX Corporate Matters—Investment in Repsol” in the Form 20-F.
PEMEX’s Internal Monitoring
On August 8, 2014, there was an explosion at the refinery located in Ciudad Madero, Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico. As a result of the explosion, four
workers died and eight others were injured. The accident occurred at a coker plant, which was out of operation and undergoing maintenance at the time of
explosion. The explosion did not cause a fire or any damage to the refinery and its cause is being investigated.

NOTE 1—STRUCTURE AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF PETRÓLEOS MEXICANOS, SUBSIDIARY ENTITIES AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES:
Petróleos Mexicanos was created on June 7, 1938, and began operations on July 20, 1938 in accordance with a decree of the Mexican Congress
stating that all foreign-owned oil companies in operation at that time in the United Mexican States (“Mexico”) were thereby nationalized. Petróleos
Mexicanos and its four Subsidiary Entities (as defined below) are decentralized public entities of the Federal Government of Mexico (the “Mexican
Government”) and together comprise the Mexican oil and gas industry.
As of June 30, 2014, the operations of Petróleos Mexicanos and its Subsidiary Entities (as defined below) are regulated mainly by the Constitución
Política de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos (Political Constitution of the United Mexican States, or the “Mexican Constitution”), the Ley
Reglamentaria del Artículo 27 Constitucional en el Ramo del Petróleo (Regulatory Law to Article 27 of the Political Constitution of the United
Mexican States concerning Petroleum Affairs, or the “Regulatory Law”), the Ley de Petróleos Mexicanos (Petróleos Mexicanos Law) and the
Reglamento de la Ley de Petróleos Mexicanos (Regulations to the Petróleos Mexicanos Law), which establish the state will be entrusted with the
activities in the strategic areas of petroleum, hydrocarbons and basic petrochemicals through Petróleos Mexicanos and its Subsidiary Entities (as
defined below).
The Petróleos Mexicanos Law, which was published in the Diario Oficial de la Federación (Official Gazette of the Federation) on November 28,
2008, establishes that the four Subsidiary Entities (as defined below) will continue carrying out their activities in accordance with their objectives,
fulfilling the commitments they have already assumed in Mexico and abroad.
On March 21, 2012, the President of Mexico issued the Decreto que tiene por objeto establecer la estructura, el funcionamiento y el control de los
organismos subsidiarios de Petróleos Mexicanos (Decree to establish the structure, operation and control of the subsidiary entities of Petróleos
Mexicanos, or the “Subsidiary Entities Decree”), which was published in the Official Gazette of the Federation and became effective as of the
following day.
Under the Subsidiary Entities Decree:
•
Petróleos Mexicanos continues to have the authority to direct the central planning and strategic management of the Subsidiary Entities (as
defined below) in accordance with the Petróleos Mexicanos Law, and to provide general corporate services of an administrative and technical
nature, as requested by the Subsidiary Entities (as defined below);

•
the Subsidiary Entities (as defined below) will continue to undertake all activities related to technical and industrial operations that are strictly
productive and commercial in nature, in accordance with their purpose;
•
the organization continues to allocate the duties to each Subsidiary Entity (as defined below) in accordance with the rationale of distributing core
activities of a productive character as referred to in the Petróleos Mexicanos Law;
•
the activities related to petrochemical products, as opposed to basic petrochemicals, must be undertaken by the Subsidiary Entities (as defined
below), and such products will continue to be manufactured by Pemex-Petrochemicals (as defined below), notwithstanding undertakings by third
parties; and
•
the activities, operations or services required by the Subsidiary Entities (as defined below) for carrying out their respective objectives may be
undertaken by companies owned by Petróleos Mexicanos, the Subsidiary Entities (as defined below) or both. With respect to any activities not
reserved exclusively for the State, the Subsidiary Entities (as defined below) may enter into alliances or partnerships with third parties.
In addition, on September 4, 2009, the Board of Directors of Petróleos Mexicanos (the “Board”) approved the Estatuto Orgánico (Organic Statute)
of Petróleos Mexicanos, which became effective on September 25, 2009 and has since been modified on August 9, 2010, August 2, 2011,
February 23, 2012, March 27, 2013, September 30, 2013, February 4 and 7, 2014.
On March 28, 2013, the Organic Statutes of each Subsidiary Entity (as defined below) was published in the Official Gazette of the Federation. These
Organic Statutes establish the structure, organizational basis and functions of the administrative units of each of the Subsidiary Entities (as
defined below), and also delineate the duties and internal regulations of their respective Boards of Directors.
The Subsidiary Entities are decentralized public entities of a technical, industrial and commercial nature with their own corporate identity and
equity and with the legal authority to own property and conduct business in their own names. The Subsidiary Entities are controlled by and have
the characteristics of subsidiaries of Petróleos Mexicanos. The Subsidiary Entities are:

The key features of the Energy Reform Decree with respect to the hydrocarbons sector in Mexico and PEMEX’s operations are the following:
•
Ownership by Mexican Nation: Solid, liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons located in the subsoil of Mexico remain the property of the Mexican
nation.
•
Third-Party Participation: The Mexican Government will carry out the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons in Mexico through assignments
to empresas productivas del Estado (productive state-owned companies, as described below) or through agreements with such productive state-
owned companies or with third parties. As part of the Secondary Legislation, the Mexican Congress must make the necessary adjustments to the
legal framework regulating the contractual regime for exploration and extraction activities, which may include the creation of licenses, service
contracts, profit-sharing contracts and production-sharing contracts.
•
Conversion: Petróleos Mexicanos will be converted from a decentralized public entity to a productive state-owned company within two years
from the enactment of the Energy Reform Decree. During the two-year transition period, PEMEX will be entitled to be awarded the assignments
and agreements mentioned above. As a productive state-owned company, Petróleos Mexicanos’ corporate purpose will be to create economic
value and increase the income of the Mexican nation while adhering to principles of equity as well as social and environmental responsibility,
and it will be granted technical, managerial and budgetary autonomy, subject to certain controls. The Mexican Government will continue to
control Petróleos Mexicanos once it is converted to a productive state-owned company.
•
Round Zero: Pursuant to the Energy Reform Decree, PEMEX has requested that the Secretaría de Energía (Ministry of Energy) assign to it
certain exploration and extraction areas based on its operational capabilities. Any such areas that it does not request or are not assigned to it
will be subject to a bidding process that will be open to participation by third parties.
•
Booking of Reserves: Productive state-owned companies and third parties will be allowed to report assignments or contracts and the
corresponding expected benefits for accounting and financial purposes, with the understanding that any solid, liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons
that are in the subsoil will remain the property of the Mexican nation.
•
Pipeline System: The Centro Nacional de Control del Gas Natural (National Center of Natural Gas Control), a decentralized public entity of the
Mexican Government, will own and operate the national gas pipeline system and storage infrastructure. Pursuant to the Secondary Legislation,
PEMEX will transfer and assign to the National Center of Natural Gas Control the assets and contracts necessary for it to manage this system
and infrastructure.

•
Regulatory Oversight and Authority: The Ministry of Energy, the Comisión Nacional de Hidrocarburos (National Hydrocarbons Commission, or
the “NHC”) and the Comisión Reguladora de Energía (Energy Regulatory Commission) will be granted additional technical and administrative
authority over certain of PEMEX’s operations and the energy sector generally. In addition, the Ministry of Energy will be granted the authority to
issue permits for oil treatment and refining, and for natural gas processing.
On March 21, 2014, as part of Round Zero, Petróleos Mexicanos submitted to the Ministry of Energy a request that PEMEX be assigned the right to
continue to explore and develop areas that together contain 96% of Mexico’s estimated proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas as of
December 31, 2013. The transitional articles of the Energy Reform Decree provide that the Ministry of Energy will take the following factors into
consideration when determining whether to grant PEMEX an assignment:
•
with respect to areas that PEMEX was actively exploring in which it had made commercial discoveries or investments as of December 21, 2013,
its investment capacity and evidence of a detailed plan for exploration; and
•
with respect to areas that PEMEX already had under production as of December 21, 2013, a development plan for producing fields, including
evidence of proper development of such fields and the ability to efficiently and competitively carry out production activities.
On April 30, 2014, President Enrique Peña Nieto submitted to the Mexican Congress draft bills proposing Secondary Legislation intended to
implement provisions of the Energy Reform Decree.
The principal distinction between the Subsidiary Entities and the Subsidiary Companies (as defined below) is that the Subsidiary Entities are
decentralized public entities created by the predecessor law to the Ley Orgánica de Petróleos Mexicanos y Organismos Subsidiarios (Organic
Law of Petróleos Mexicanos and the Subsidiary Entities), whereas the Subsidiary Companies are companies that were formed in accordance with
the applicable laws of each of the respective jurisdictions in which they were incorporated. The “Subsidiary Companies” are defined as those
companies which are controlled by PEMEX (see Note 3(a)).
“Associates”, as used herein, means those companies in which Petróleos Mexicanos does not have effective control (see Note 3(a)).
Petróleos Mexicanos, the Subsidiary Entities and the Subsidiary Companies are referred to collectively herein as “PEMEX”.

NOTE 2—BASIS OF PREPARATION:
(a)
Statement of compliance
PEMEX prepared its unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, and for the
periods ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” of the International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all the information and disclosure required for full annual
consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with PEMEX’s audited consolidated financial statements for the three years
ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. PEMEX estimates that there is no significant impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements due to the seasonality of operations.
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of computation as the
most recent annual financial statements.
On August 15, 2014, these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements under IFRS and the notes thereto were authorized for
issuance by the following officers: Public Accountant Víctor M. Cámara Peón, Deputy Director of Accounting and Fiscal Matters, and C. Francisco
J. Torres Suárez, Associate Managing Director of Accounting.
(b)
Basis of measurement
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost basis method, except where it
is indicated that certain items have been measured using the fair value model or deemed cost basis. The principal items measured at fair value are
derivative financial instruments (“DFIs”). The principal item measured at amortized cost is debt, while the principal item measured at present value
is the provision for employee benefits.

(c)
Functional and reporting currency and translation of foreign currency operations
These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in Mexican pesos, which is both PEMEX’s functional
currency and reporting currency, due to the following:
(i)
the economic environment in which PEMEX operates is Mexico, where the legal currency is the Mexican peso;
(ii)
PEMEX is an entity owned and regulated by the Mexican Government; accordingly, PEMEX’s budget is subject to legislative approval and is
included in the Mexican annual budget, which is published in pesos;
(iii)
benefits to employees were approximately 50% of PEMEX’s total liabilities as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. The reserve
maintained to meet these obligations is computed, denominated and payable in Mexican pesos; and
(iv)
cash flows for payment of general expenses, taxes and duties are realized in Mexican pesos.
Although the prices of several products are based on international U.S. dollar-indices, domestic selling prices are governed by the economic and
financial policies established by the Mexican Government. Accordingly, cash flows from domestic sales are generated and recorded in Mexican
pesos.
Mexico’s monetary policy regulator, the Banco de México, requires that Government entities other than financial entities sell their foreign currency
to the Banco de México in accordance with its terms, receiving Mexican pesos in exchange, which is the legal currency in Mexico.
Translation of condensed consolidated interim financial statements of foreign operations
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and associates are translated into the reporting
currency by identifying if the functional currency is different from the currency for recording the foreign operations. If the currencies for a foreign
transaction are different, then the currency for recording the foreign transaction is first translated into the functional currency and then translated
into the reporting currency using the period-end exchange rate for assets and liabilities reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim
statements of financial position, the historical exchange rate at the date of the transaction for equity items and the weighted average exchange
rate for income and expenses reported in the statement of comprehensive income of the period.

relevant currency unit, except exchange rates and product and share prices.
NOTE 3—SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates and
assumptions made by PEMEX’s management that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities as of the date of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, as well as the recorded amounts of income
and expenses during the period.
Significant estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, and revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the
period in which any estimates are revised and in any future periods affected by such revision.

Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Below is a summary of the principal accounting policies followed by PEMEX in the preparation of its unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements:
(a)
Basis of consolidation
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include those of Petróleos Mexicanos, the Subsidiary Entities and the
Subsidiary Companies.
Investment in subsidiaries
The Subsidiary Entities and Subsidiary Companies are those controlled by Petróleos Mexicanos. Control requires exposure or rights to variable
returns and the ability to affect those returns through power over a company. The Subsidiary Entities and Subsidiary Companies are consolidated
from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The consolidated Subsidiary Entities are Pemex-Exploration and Production, Pemex-Refining, Pemex-Gas and Basic Petrochemicals and Pemex-
Petrochemicals.
The consolidated Subsidiary Companies are companies that are 100% owned by Petróleos Mexicanos (with the exception of Pemex Finance, Ltd.
(“FIN”) and P.M.I. Comercio Internacional, S.A. de C.V. (“PMI CIM”)), and are as follows: PMI CIM(i); P.M.I. Trading, Ltd. (“PMI Trading”)(i); P.M.I. Holdings
North America, Inc. (“PMI HNA”)(i); P.M.I. Holdings Petróleos España, S.L. (“PMI HPE”)(i); P.M.I. Holdings, B.V. (“PMI HBV”)(i); P.M.I. Norteamérica, S.A. de C.V. (“PMI NASA”)(i);
Kot Insurance Company, AG (“KOT”); Pemex Procurement International, Inc. (“PPI”)(ii); P.M.I. Marine, Ltd. (“PMI Mar”)(i); P.M.I. Services, B.V. (“PMI SHO”)(i); Pemex Internacional España, S.A.
(“PMI SES”)(i); Pemex Services Europe, Ltd. (“PMI SUK”)(i)(iii); P.M.I. Services North America, Inc. (“PMI SUS”)(i); P.M.I. Field Management Resources, S.L. (“FMR”)(i)(iv); P.M.I. Campos Maduros, S. de R.L. de C.V.
(“SANMA”)(iv); Mex Gas International, Ltd. (“MGAS”); FIN; Instalaciones Inmobiliarias para Industrias, S. A. de C. V. (“III”)(iv); III Servicios, S. A. de C. V. (“III Services”)(iv); PPQ Cadena Productiva, S.L.
(“PPQCP”)(iv) and Hijos de J. Barreras, S. A. (“HJ BARRERAS”)(iv).
The financial information of the Subsidiary Entities and Subsidiary Companies has been prepared based on the same period of Petróleos
Mexicanos’ financial statements applying the same accounting policies.
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv)
Member company of the “PMI Group”.
Formerly Integrated Trade Systems, Inc. (“ITS”).
As of December 2013, PMI SUK is no longer included in the consolidated financial statements of PEMEX due to its liquidation.
As of 2013, these companies are included in the consolidated financial statements of PEMEX.

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 AND 2013
(Figures stated in thousands, except as noted (Note 2))
Investments in associates and joint ventures
Investments in associates are those in which PEMEX has significant influence but not the power to control financial and operational decisions.
There is significant influence when PEMEX owns directly or indirectly between 20% and 50% of voting rights in another entity.
Joint ventures are those arrangements whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control. A joint
operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the
liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are recognized based on the equity method and recorded initially at cost, including any goodwill
identified on acquisition. With respect to joint operations, the assets, liabilities, income and expenses are recognized in relation to participation in
the arrangement and in accordance with the applicable IFRS. The investment cost includes transaction costs.
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the proportion of gains, losses and other comprehensive income
corresponding to PEMEX’s share in each investee, once these items are adjusted to align with the accounting policies of PEMEX, from the date
that significant influence and joint control begins to the date that such influence or joint control ceases.
When the value of the share of losses exceeds the value of PEMEX’s investment in an associate or joint venture, the carrying value of the
investment, including any long-term investment, is reduced to zero and PEMEX ceases to recognize additional losses, except in cases where
PEMEX is jointly liable for obligations incurred by those associates and joint ventures.
Eliminated transactions in consolidation
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements pursuant to IFRS 10, “Consolidated Financial Statements”.
Unrealized gains arising from transactions with entities whose investment is accounted for using the equity method are eliminated against the
investment to the extent of participation in such entities. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains but only to the
extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Non-controlling interests
The interests of third parties who do not have a controlling interest in the equity or comprehensive result of subsidiaries of PEMEX are presented
in the condensed consolidated interim statements of financial position, the condensed consolidated interim statements of changes in equity
(deficit) as “non-controlling interests”, and as net income and comprehensive income for the period, attributable to non-controlling interests, in
the condensed consolidated interim statements of comprehensive income.

(Figures stated in thousands, except as noted (Note 2))
Dividends paid in cash and assets other than cash
A liability for distributions of dividends in cash and non-cash assets to third parties is recognized when the distribution is authorized by the
Board. The corresponding amount is recognized directly in equity.
Distributions of non-cash assets are measured at the fair value of the assets to be distributed. Changes relating to re-measurements of the fair
value between the date on which the distribution is declared and the time when the assets are transferred are recognized directly in equity.
When distributing non-cash assets, any difference between the dividend paid and the carrying amount of the assets distributed is recognized in
the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
(b)
Transactions in foreign currency
In accordance with IAS 21, “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates” (“IAS 21”), transactions in foreign currencies are translated to
the functional currency at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were
translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they
arise. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in other comprehensive results, any exchange component of that gain or loss is
recognized in other comprehensive results. Conversely, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized in profit or loss, any exchange
component of that gain or loss shall be recognized in profit or loss for the period.
(c)
Fair value measurement
PEMEX measures certain financial instruments such as DFIs at fair value as of the closing date of the relevant reporting period.

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 AND 2013
(Figures stated in thousands, except as noted (Note 2))
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. A measurement at fair value assumes that the sale of the asset or transfer of a liability occurs:
(i)
in the principal market for the asset or liability; or
(ii)
in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal market or the most advantageous market must be accessible for PEMEX.
The fair value of an asset or liability is measured based on by using the same assumptions that market participants would make when pricing the
asset or liability under the premise that market participants take into account highest and best use of the asset or liability.
(d)
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are classified as: (i) financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss; (ii) financial instruments held to
maturity; (iii) available-for-sale financial assets; (iv) loans held to maturity; or (v) DFIs. PEMEX determines the classification of its financial
instruments at the time of initial recognition.
PEMEX’s financial instruments include cash and short-term deposits, equity investments, accounts receivable, other receivables, loans, accounts
payable to suppliers, other accounts payable, borrowings and debts, as well as derivatives.
Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss
A financial instrument is measured at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held for trading or designated as such upon initial
recognition. Financial assets are designated at fair value through profit or loss if PEMEX manages such investments and makes purchase and
sale decisions based on their fair value in accordance with PEMEX’s documented risk management or investment strategy. In addition, directly
attributable transaction costs are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the period. These financial instruments
are recognized at fair value and corresponding changes relating to dividend income are recognized in the consolidated statements of
comprehensive income.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial instruments that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified in any of
the previous categories. PEMEX’s investments in certain equity securities and debt securities are classified as available-for-sale financial assets.
Available-for-sale financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 AND 2013
(Figures stated in thousands, except as noted (Note 2))
Subsequent to initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. In addition, any gains or losses associated with
such instruments, as well as foreign exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive result and presented in the fair value reserve in
equity. When an investment is derecognized, any gains or losses accumulated in the equity are reclassified to profit or loss.
Sales and purchases of financial assets that require the delivery of such assets within a period of time established by market practice are
recognized as of the negotiation date (the date on which PEMEX commits to purchase or sell the asset).
Loans held to maturity
After initial recognition, loans and debt securities that bear interest are measured at amortized cost using the EIR method, less impairment losses.
The amortized cost is calculated based on any discount or premium on acquisition and fees and costs that are an integral part of the EIR method.
Amortization of costs is included under the heading of financing cost—net in the statement of comprehensive income.
Derivative financial instruments
DFIs presented in the consolidated statement of financial position are carried at fair value. In the case of DFIs held for trading, changes in fair
value are recorded in profit or loss; in the case of DFIs formally designated as and that qualify for hedging, changes in fair value are recorded
using cash flow or fair value hedge accounting, with gains or losses classified in accordance with the earnings treatment of the hedge transaction.
Embedded derivatives
PEMEX evaluates the potential existence of embedded derivatives, which may be found in the terms of its contracts, or combined with other host
contracts, which could be structured financial instruments (debt or equity instruments with embedded derivatives). Embedded derivatives have
terms that implicitly or explicitly meet the characteristics of a DFI. In some instances, these embedded derivatives must be segregated from the
underlying contracts and measured, recognized, presented and disclosed as DFIs, such as when the economic risks and terms of the embedded
derivative are not clearly and closely related to the underlying contract.
Impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost
At each reporting date, PEMEX evaluates whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired in
which case the value of the recoverable amount of the asset is calculated. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss
event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of the
financial asset.

(e)
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash balances on hand, deposits in bank accounts, foreign currency reserves and instruments with
maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, which are used in
the management of PEMEX’s short-term commitments.
With respect to the consolidated statement of cash flows, the cash and cash equivalents line item consists of the cash and cash equivalents
described above, net of bank overdrafts pending payment.
Cash subject to restrictions or that cannot be exchanged or used to settle a liability within twelve months is not considered part of this line item
and is presented in non-current assets.
(f)
Accounts, notes receivable and other
Accounts, notes receivable and other are recognized at recoverable value. The realizable value, if any, of a long-term account receivable is
determined by considering its present value. In addition, interest income from accounts receivable is recognized on an accrued basis, provided
that the amount can be reliably measured and collection is probable.
(g)
Inventories and cost of sales
PEMEX’s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined based on the cost of production or acquisition of
inventory and other costs incurred in transporting such inventory to its present location and in its present condition, using the average cost
formula. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the
estimated selling costs. The estimate takes into consideration, among other things, the decrease in the value of inventories due to obsolescence.
Cost of sales represents the cost of production or acquisition of inventories at the time of sale, increased, where appropriate, by declines in net
realizable value of inventories during the period.
Advances to suppliers are recognized as part of inventory when the risks and benefits of the ownership of the inventory have been transferred to
PEMEX.

(h) Wells, pipelines, properties, plant and equipment
Wells, pipelines, properties, plant and equipment are measured at acquisition or construction cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses.
PEMEX uses the successful efforts method for the exploration and production of crude oil and gas activities, considering the criteria mentioned in
IFRS 6, “Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources” in relation to the recognition of exploration and drilling assets. Costs of
development wells and related plant, property and equipment involved in the exploitation of oil and gas are recorded as part of the cost of assets.
The costs of exploratory wells in areas that have not yet been designated as containing proved reserves are recorded as intangible assets until it
is determined whether they are commercially viable. Otherwise, the costs of drilling the exploratory well are charged to exploration expense. Other
expenditures on exploration are recognized as exploration expenses as they are incurred.
Wells, pipelines, properties, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost, which includes their original purchase price or construction cost,
any costs attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use and the costs of dismantling and removing the items
and restoring the site on which they are located, including the estimated cost of plugging and abandoning wells, in accordance with IAS 16,
“Property, Plant and Equipment” (“IAS 16”).
The cost of financing projects that require large investments or financing incurred for projects, net of interest revenues from the temporary
investment of these funds, is recognized as part of wells, pipelines, properties, plant and equipment when the cost is directly attributable to the
construction or acquisition of a qualifying asset. The capitalization of these costs is suspended during periods in which the development of
construction is interrupted, and its capitalization ends when the activities necessary for the use of the qualifying asset are substantially
completed. All other financing costs are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income in the period in which they are
incurred.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labor, any other costs directly attributable to the commissioning and
interest on financing. In some cases the cost also includes the cost of dismantling and removal.
Expenditures related to the construction of wells, pipelines, properties, plant and equipment during the stage prior to commissioning are stated at
cost as intangible assets or construction in progress, in accordance with the characteristics of the asset. Once the assets are ready for use, the
costs are transferred to the respective component of wells, pipelines, properties, plant and equipment and depreciation or amortization begins.
The costs of major maintenance or replacement of a component of an item of wells, pipelines, properties, plant and equipment are recognized in
the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to PEMEX and its cost
can be measured reliably. The costs of recurring maintenance, repairs and renovations of wells, pipelines, properties, plant and equipment are
recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

Depreciation and amortization of capitalized costs in wells are determined based on the estimated commercial life of the field to which the wells
belong, considering the relationship between the production of barrels of oil equivalent for the period and proved developed reserves of the field,
as of the beginning of the year, with quarterly updates for new development investments.
Depreciation of other elements of wells, pipelines, properties, plant and equipment is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful life of the asset, beginning as of the date that the asset is available for use, or in the case of construction, from the date that the
asset is completed and ready for use.
When parts of an item of wells, pipelines, properties and equipment have different useful lives than such item and a cost that is significant relative
to the total cost of the item, the part is depreciated separately. Useful lives of items of properties, plant and equipment are reviewed if expectations
differ from previous estimates.
Pipelines, properties, and equipment received from customers are initially recognized at fair value as revenue from ordinary operating activities if
PEMEX has no future obligations to the customer who transferred the item. In contrast, if PEMEX does have future obligations to such a customer,
the initial recognition is as a deferred liability relating to the period in which the items will provide PEMEX with a service.
The capitalized value of finance leases is also included in the line item of wells, pipelines, properties, plant and equipment. Properties, plant and
equipment acquired through financial leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset.
Advance payments for the acquisition of pipelines, properties, plant and equipment are also recognized in the line item of wells, pipelines,
properties, plant and equipment when the risks and benefits of the ownership have been transferred to PEMEX.

(i)
Crude oil and natural gas reserves
Under the Mexican Constitution, all oil and other hydrocarbon reserves within Mexico are owned by the Mexican nation and not by PEMEX. As of
the date of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, under the Petróleos Mexicanos Law, the reserves assigned to
PEMEX by the Mexican Government are not registered for accounting purposes. Pemex-Exploration and Production estimates total proved oil
and natural gas reserve volumes in accordance with Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X of the SEC, as amended (“Rule 4-10(a)”), and where
necessary, in accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the
Society of Petroleum Engineers (the “SPE”) as of February 19, 2007. These procedures are consistent with international reserves reporting
practice. The estimation of these reserves depends on assumptions made and the interpretation of the data available, and may vary among
analysts. The results of drilling activities, test wells and production after the date of estimation are utilized in future revisions of reserves estimates.
Although PEMEX does not own the oil and other hydrocarbon reserves within Mexico, these accounting procedures allow PEMEX to record the
effects that such oil and other hydrocarbon reserves have on its unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, including, for
example, in the depreciation and amortization line item.
(j)
Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of PEMEX’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred taxes, are assessed for indicators of impairment at
the end of each reporting period. If the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount, PEMEX records an impairment charge in
its statement of comprehensive income.
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets which can generate cash inflows independently from other assets or groups of
assets.
The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of the fair value minus the cost of disposal and the use value. Value in use is the discounted
present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset, and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. In
measuring value in use, the discount rate applied is the pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the asset. Fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows determined by the assumptions that market participants would
apply in order to estimate the price of an asset or cash generating unit if such participants were acting in their best economic interest.
In the case of cash-generating assets or items dedicated to the exploration and evaluation of hydrocarbons reserves, the recoverable amount is
determined by adjusting the fair value, which is based on the proved and probable reserves, for the risk factor associated with such reserves.
Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. If an impairment loss subsequently improves, and such
improvement is greater than the carrying value of the asset and appears to be permanent, the impairment loss recorded previously is reversed
only up to the carrying amount of the item, as though no impairment had been recognized.

The determination of whether an agreement is or contains a lease is based on the content of the agreement at the date of execution. An agreement
contains a lease if performance under the agreement depends upon the use of a specific asset or assets, or if the agreement grants the right to
use the asset.
Finance leases, which transfer to PEMEX substantially all the inherent benefits and risks of the leased property, are capitalized at the date the
lease commences, and the value is recorded as the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease
payments. Payments on the lease are divided between the financial costs and the amortization of the remaining debt principal in order to achieve
a constant interest rate for the outstanding liability. The financing costs are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.
Operating lease payments that do not transfer to PEMEX substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the leased asset are recognized as
expenses in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease payments that do transfer
to PEMEX substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership are instead capitalized and treated as under the paragraph above.
(l)
Provisions
PEMEX recognizes provisions where, as a result of a past event, PEMEX has incurred a legal or contractual obligation for which the transfer of an
asset is probable and the amount of such transfer is reasonably estimable. In certain cases, such amounts are recorded at their present value.
Environmental liabilities
In accordance with applicable legal requirements and accounting practices, an environmental liability is recognized when the cash outflows are
probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. Disbursements related to the conservation of the environment that are linked to revenue from
current or future operations are accounted for as costs or assets, depending on the circumstances of each disbursement. Disbursements related
to past operations, which no longer contribute to current or future revenues, are accounted for as current period costs.
The accrual of a liability for a future disbursement occurs when an obligation related to environmental remediation, for which PEMEX has the
information necessary to determine a reasonable estimated cost, is identified.
Retirement of assets
The obligations associated with the future retirement of assets, are recognized at the date that the retirement obligation is incurred, based on the
discounted cash flow method. The determination of the fair value is based on existing technology and regulations. If a reliable estimation of fair
value cannot be made at the time the obligation is incurred, the accrual will be recognized when there is sufficient information to estimate the fair
value.

(Figures stated in thousands, except as noted (Note 2))
The obligations related to the costs of future retirement of assets associated with the principal refining processes for gas and petrochemicals are
not recognized. These assets are considered to have an indefinite useful life due to the potential for maintenance and repairs, and, accordingly,
PEMEX lacks sufficient information to reasonably determine the date on which they will be dismantled.
The abandonment costs related to wells currently in production and wells temporarily closed are recorded in the statement of comprehensive
income based on the units of production method. Total cost of abandonment and plugging for non-producing wells is recognized in the statement
of comprehensive income at the end of each period. All estimations are based on the useful lives of the wells, considering their discounted
present value. Salvage values are not considered, as these values commonly have not traditionally existed.
(m) Employee benefits
PEMEX operates a defined benefit pension plan under which it makes contributions to a fund that is administrated separately. PEMEX recognizes
the cost for defined benefit plans based on independent actuarial computations applying the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and
losses are recognized within other comprehensive result for the period in which they occur.
The costs of prior services are recognized within profit or loss for the period in which they are incurred.
PEMEX’s net obligation with respect to the defined benefit plan equals the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan
assets. The value of any asset is limited to the present value of available reimbursements and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
In addition, seniority premiums payable for disability are recognized within other long-term employee benefits.
Termination benefits are recognized in profit or loss for the period in which they are incurred.
(n)
Taxes and federal duties
Petróleos Mexicanos and the Subsidiary Entities are primarily subject to the following special tax laws: Derecho ordinario sobre hidrocarburos
(Ordinary Hydrocarbons Duty, or “DOSH”), Derecho sobre hidrocarburos para el fondo de estabilización (Hydrocarbons Duty for the Stabilization
Fund) and Impuesto a los rendimientos petroleros (Hydrocarbon Income Tax, or “IRP”), all of which are based mainly on petroleum production
and revenues from oil, gas and refined products taking into account certain tax deductions. These taxes and federal duties are recognized within
profit or loss for the period in which they are incurred.

Petróleos Mexicanos is not subject to the Ley del Impuesto Sobre la Renta (Income Tax Law) and the Ley del Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Única
(Flat Rate Business Tax, or “IETU”). The Subsidiary Companies are subject to these taxes. The IETU was repealed as of January 1, 2014.
Deferred taxes
Deferred taxes are recorded based on the assets and liabilities method, which consists of the recognition of deferred taxes by applying tax rates
applicable to the IRP and income tax to the temporary differences between the carrying value and tax values of assets and liabilities at the date of
these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that the
tax benefits will be utilized.
(o)
Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicio (Special Tax on Production and Services or “IEPS Tax”)
The IEPS Tax charged to customers is a tax on domestic sales of gasoline and diesel. The applicable rates depend on, among other factors, the
product, producer’s price, freight costs, commissions and the region in which the respective product is sold.
(p)
Contingencies
Liabilities for loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount thereof can be reasonably
estimated. When a reasonable estimation cannot be made, qualitative disclosure is provided in the notes to the unaudited condensed
consolidated interim financial statements. Contingent revenues, earnings or assets are not recognized until realization is assured.
(q)
Revenue recognition
Sales revenue is recognized the moment at which the risks and benefits of ownership of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, and derivative
and petrochemical products are transferred to the customers who acquire them, which occurs as follows:
•
•
in accordance with contractual terms;
the moment at which the customer picks up product at PEMEX’s facilities; or

Presentation of consolidated statements of comprehensive income
The costs and expenses shown in PEMEX’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income are presented based on their function, which
allows for a better understanding of the components of PEMEX’s operating income. This classification allows for a comparison to the industry to
which PEMEX belongs.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales represents the cost of inventories at the time of sale. Cost of sales includes depreciation, amortization, salaries, wages and benefits,
a portion of the cost of the reserve for employee benefits and operating expenses related to the production process.
Transportation, distribution and administrative expenses
Transportation, distribution and administrative expenses are costs in connection to the storage and delivery of products, as well as costs related
to PEMEX’s administrative personnel, such as depreciation, personnel-related expenses and operating expenses associated with these activities.
Other revenues and expenses, net
Other revenues consists primarily of income received due to the “negative” IEPS Tax rate.
Financing income and cost
Financing income and cost are comprised of interest income and expenses and the valuation effects of financial instruments, minus any portion
of the financing cost that is capitalized.
Exchange rate variations
Exchange rate variations relating to assets or liabilities governed by contracts denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in income of the
period.
(s)
Operating segments
Operating segments are identifiable components of PEMEX that pursue business activities from which PEMEX earns revenues and incurs
expenses, including those revenues and expenses from transactions with other segments of PEMEX, and for which information is available to
management on a segmented basis and is assessed by the Board management in order to allocate resources and assess the profitability of the
segments.

New accounting policies not yet adopted
The IASB issued the new IFRS mentioned below, which are effective for annual periods described therein. PEMEX is in the process of evaluating
the impact that these standards will have on its financial statements.
a)
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (2010) (“IFRS 9 (2010)”) and IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (2009) (“IFRS 9 (2009)”)
IFRS 9 (2009) introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets. Under IFRS 9 (2009), financial assets are classified and
measured based on the entity’s business model for the financial asset and the characteristics of the contractual cash flows associated with the
financial asset. IFRS 9 (2010) introduces additional changes relating to financial liabilities. Currently, the IASB intends to make limited
modifications to the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9 (2009) and IFRS 9 (2010) and to add new requirements to address the
impairment of financial assets and changes to hedge accounting.
IFRS 9 (2010) and IFRS 9 (2009) are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. It is
anticipated that the adoption of these standards will have an impact on PEMEX’s financial assets but not its financial liabilities.
In November 2013, the IASB announced the completion of a package of amendments to the accounting requirements for financial instruments.
The amendments:
i.
ii.
iii
bring into effect a substantial overhaul of hedge accounting that will allow entities to better reflect their risk management activities in the financial
statements;
allow the changes that address the so-called “own credit” issue that were already included in IFRS 9 to be applied in isolation without the need
to change any other accounting for financial instruments; and
remove the January 1, 2015 mandatory effective date of IFRS 9, to provide sufficient time for preparers of financial statements to make the
transition to the new requirements.

(Figures stated in thousands, except as noted (Note 2))
b)
Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets, which clarify the acceptable methods of depreciation and
amortization.
The amended IAS 16 prohibits entities from using revenue-based depreciation methods for items of property, plant and equipment.
The amended IAS 38 introduces a rebuttable presumption that revenue is not an appropriate basis for amortization of an intangible asset. This
presumption can only be rebutted in two limited circumstances: a) the intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue; or b) ordinary
revenue and the life of the assets are highly associated.
The expected future reductions in selling prices could be indicative of a reduction of the future economic benefits embodied in an asset.
These amendments will be applied prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016, and early application is permitted.
c)
Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, which provide guidance on the accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation.
The amendments to IFRS 11 address how a joint operator should account for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a
business. IFRS 11 now requires that such transactions be accounted for using the related principles to business combination accounting
established in IFRS 3, “Business Combinations,” and additionally requires certain related disclosures. These amendments also apply when a
business is contributed to the joint operation upon its creation. The most significant impact of the amendments to IFRS 11 will be the recognition
of goodwill (when there is an excess of the transferred consideration over the identifiable net asset) and the recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities.
These amendments will be applied prospectively become effective on January 1, 2016. Early application is permitted.
d)
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
The recently issued standard IFRS 15, “Revenue from contracts with customers” (“IFRS 15”) describes a single comprehensive model for the
accounting of revenue from contracts with customers and replaces the current guidelines on revenue recognition.
The core principle of the new IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognize revenue to represent the promised transfer of goods or services to the
customer, valued at the amount that the entity expects to be entitled in exchanged for those goods or services.

NOTE 4—SEGMENT FINANCIAL INFORMATION:
PEMEX’s primary business is the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas and the refining and marketing of petroleum products,
conducted through six business segments: Pemex-Exploration and Production, Pemex-Refining, Pemex-Gas and Basic Petrochemicals, Pemex-
Petrochemicals, the Trading Companies (as defined below) and Corporate and Other Subsidiary Companies. Management makes decisions
related to the operations of the consolidated business along these six strategic lines. Due to PEMEX’s structure, there are significant quantities of
inter-segment sales among the reporting segments, which are made at internal transfer prices established by PEMEX reflecting international
market prices.
The primary sources of revenue for the segments are as described below:
•
Pemex-Exploration and Production earns revenues from domestic crude oil sales, as well as from the export of crude oil through the
Trading Companies (as defined below). Export sales are made through PMI CIM to approximately 26 major customers in various foreign
markets. Approximately half of PEMEX’s crude oil is sold to Pemex-Refining.
•
Pemex-Refining earns revenues from sales of refined petroleum products and derivatives. Most of Pemex-Refining’s sales are to third
parties and occur within the domestic market. The entity sells a significant portion of its fuel oil production to the Comisión Federal de
Electricidad (Federal Electricity Commission, or “CFE”) and jet fuel to Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (the Airports and Auxiliary
Services Agency). Pemex-Refining’s most important products are different types of gasoline.

Pemex-Gas and Basic Petrochemicals earns revenues primarily from domestic sources. Pemex-Gas and Basic Petrochemicals also
consumes high levels of its own natural gas production. Most revenues of this entity are obtained from the sale of ethane and butane
gas.
Pemex-Petrochemicals is engaged in the sale of petrochemical products to the domestic market. Pemex-Petrochemicals offers a wide
range of products. The majority of Pemex-Petrochemicals’ revenues comes from methane derivatives, ethane derivatives and aromatics
and derivatives.
The trading companies, which consist of PMI NASA, PMI CIM, MGAS and PMI Trading (the “Trading Companies”), earn revenues from
trading crude oil, natural gas and petroleum and petrochemical products within international markets.
The Corporate and Other Subsidiary Companies provide administrative, financing, consulting and logistical services, as well as
economic, tax and legal advice to PEMEX’s entities and companies.
The following tables present the unaudited condensed financial information of these segments, including unrealized intersegment gain (loss) and

PEMEX’s management measures the performance of the entities based on operating income and net segment income before elimination of
unrealized intersegment gain (loss), as well as by analyzing the impact of the results of each segment in the consolidated financial information.
For certain of the items in these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements to agree with the individual financial statements
of the operating segments, they must be reconciled. The tables below present the financial information of PEMEX’s operating segments, before
intersegment eliminations:

Production in connection with the following: in December 2004, Corporación Mexicana de Mantenimiento Integral, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“COMMISA”)
filed an arbitration claim before the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the “ICA”) against Pemex-
Exploration and Production for, among other things, the breach of a construction agreement in connection with two platforms in the Cantarell
project. Since the initiation of such claim, COMMISA and Pemex-Exploration and Production have filed several additional claims against one
another. As a result of one of these additional claims, on September 25, 2013, the U.S. District Court ordered Pemex-Exploration and Production to
deposit with COMMISA Ps. 6,081,706, as described above. Pemex-Exploration and Production subsequently deposited the judgment amount in a
bank account in New York as a condition to filing a motion to appeal the resolution before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

c.
On January 23, 2014, Petróleos Mexicanos issued U.S. $4,000,000 of its debt securities under its U.S. $32,000,000 Medium-Term Notes
Program, Series C in three tranches: (i) U.S. $500,000 of its 3.125% Notes due 2019; (ii) U.S. $500,000 of its 4.875% Notes due 2024, which
was a reopening of its 4.875% Notes due 2024 originally issued on July 18, 2013; and (iii) U.S. $3,000,000 of its 6.375% Bonds due 2045. All

NOTE 13—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:
(a)
Fair value hierarchy
PEMEX values its financial instruments under standard methodologies commonly applied in the financial markets. PEMEX’s related assumptions
therefore fall under Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy for market participant assumptions, as described below.
The fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by
Level 2 inputs are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs other than quoted prices that are
observed for assets or liabilities. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities, and include situations where there is little, if any,
market activity for the assets or liabilities. Management uses appropriate valuation techniques based on the available inputs to measure the fair
values of PEMEX’s applicable assets and liabilities.
When available, PEMEX measures fair value using Level 1 inputs, which generally provide the most reliable evidence of fair value.
The following tables present information about PEMEX’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the
inputs utilized to determine the fair values as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.

(b)
Fair value of Derivative Financial Instruments
PEMEX periodically evaluates its exposure to international hydrocarbon prices, interest rates and foreign currencies and uses DFIs as a
mitigation mechanism when potential sources of market risk are identified.
PEMEX monitors the fair value of its DFI portfolio on a periodic basis. The fair value represents the price at which one party would assume the
rights and obligations of the other, and is calculated for DFIs through models used commonly in the international financial markets, based on
inputs obtained from major market information systems and price providers.
PEMEX’s DFI portfolio is composed primarily of swaps, the prices of which are estimated by discounting flows using the appropriate factors, and
contains no exotic instruments that require numerical methods for their valuation.
The options contained in PMI HBV’s DFI portfolio are European-style, consisting of plain vanilla calls or puts, and/or are valued internally based
on the traditional Black-Scholes model or certain variations thereof.
PEMEX values its DFIs under standard methodologies commonly applied in the financial markets. PEMEX’s related assumptions therefore fall
under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy for market participant assumptions.
(c)
Accounting treatment
As of January 1, 2012, PEMEX adopted the provisions of International Accounting Standards 32 and 39 and IFRS 7, 9 and 13 as issued by the
IASB, which detail the criteria for the recognition, valuation, registration, disclosure, presentation and, where appropriate, bifurcation from the host
contract, of DFIs entered into for trading and hedging purposes and of embedded derivatives.
PEMEX enters into derivatives transactions with the sole purpose of hedging financial risks related to its operations, assets or liabilities recorded
within its statement of financial position. Nonetheless, some of these transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment because they do
not meet the strict requirements of the accounting standards for designation as hedges under one of the accounting treatments allowed. They are
therefore recorded in the financial statements as non-hedge instruments or as instruments entered into for trading purposes, despite the fact that
their cash flows are offset by the cash flows of the positions to which they relate. As a result, the changes in their fair value affect the financing
cost.
As of June 30, 2014 and 2013, the net fair value of PEMEX’s outstanding DFIs was Ps. (630,225) and Ps. (4,613,929), respectively. As of June 30,
2014 and 2013, PEMEX did not have any DFIs designated as hedges.

For the periods ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, PEMEX recognized a net gain (loss) of Ps. 3,031,904 and Ps. (6,340,215), respectively, in financing
cost with respect to DFIs treated as instruments entered into for trading purposes.
PEMEX, in accordance with its accounting policy, analyzed the clauses of different contracts to identify possible embedded derivatives. PEMEX
determined that these agreements do not meet the criteria required to generate embedded derivatives and therefore, for the periods ended
June 30, 2014 and 2013, PEMEX did not recognize any effects related to embedded derivatives (either foreign currency or index) in its statement of
comprehensive income.
NOTE 14—PROVISIONS FOR SUNDRY CREDITORS:

NOTE 16—CONTINGENCIES:
(a)
PEMEX is subject to the provisions of the Ley General del Equilibrio Ecológico y la Protección al Ambiente (General Law on Ecological Equilibrium
and Environmental Protection). To comply with this law, environmental audits of PEMEX’s larger operating, storage and transportation facilities have
been or are being conducted. Following the completion of such audits, PEMEX has signed various agreements with the Procuraduría Federal de
Protección al Ambiente (Federal Attorney of Environmental Protection, or “PROFEPA”) to implement environmental remediation and improve
environmental plans. Such plans contemplate remediation for environmental damages, as well as related investments for the improvement of
equipment, maintenance, labor and materials.
As of June 30, 2014 and as of December 31, 2013, the reserve for environmental remediation expenses totaled Ps. 6,695,345 and Ps. 5,446,581,
respectively. This reserve is included as part of the reserve for sundry creditors and others as a long-term liability in the statement of financial
position.
(b)
PEMEX is involved in various civil, tax, criminal, administrative, labor and commercial lawsuits and arbitration proceedings. The results of these
proceedings are uncertain as of this date. As of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, PEMEX had accrued a reserve of Ps. 16,961,634 and
Ps. 17,624,737, respectively, for these contingent liabilities. The current status of the principal lawsuits in which PEMEX is involved is as follows:
•
In September 2001, Conproca, S.A. de C.V. (“CONPROCA”), the construction company performing construction and maintenance services for
Pemex-Refining’s Cadereyta refinery, filed a claim for arbitration before the ICA against Pemex-Refining and Petróleos Mexicanos (No.
11760/KGA). On January 11, 2012, the ICA notified the parties of its arbitration award. Pemex-Refining and Petróleos Mexicanos were ordered
to pay U.S. $311,178 and CONPROCA was ordered to pay U.S. $29,038. On July 27, 2012, Petróleos Mexicanos and Pemex-Refining filed a
claim (No. 485/2012) before the Juzgado Décimo Primero de Distrito en Materia Civil (Eleventh District Civil Court) in the Federal District
requesting that the arbitration award be declared null and void. On November 12, 2013, the Court issued a judgment declaring the arbitration
award valid without addressing the issue of expenses. Each party filed an amparo (No. D.C. 3/2014 and D.C. 4/2014, respectively) before the
Cuarto Tribunal Colegiado en Materia Civil del Primer Circuito (Fourth Civil Joint Court of the First Circuit). As of June 30, 2014, the Court’s
decision regarding the amparos is pending.
Previously, on December 14, 2011, CONPROCA filed a claim before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (“USDNY”)
seeking recognition of the award granted by the ICA. On October 17, 2013 the Court stayed the proceeding pending the final decision of the
Mexican court.
On December 12, 2012, Petróleos Mexicanos and Pemex-Refining filed a civil claim (1:12-cv-09070) in the USDNY against Siemens AG,
CONPROCA and SK Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. (SK Engineering) alleging, among other things, conspiracy and participation in a
scheme to defraud Petróleos Mexicanos and Pemex-Refining in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. On May 8,
2013, Petróleos Mexicanos and Pemex-Refining amended their complaint to name only SK Engineering and Siemens AG as defendants. On
May 24, 2013, SK Engineering and Siemens AG submitted briefs in support of a motion to dismiss the complaint. On July 30, 2013, the Court
granted the motion to dismiss and Petróleos Mexicanos and Pemex-Refining filed an appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit.

In December 2004, COMMISA filed an arbitration claim (No. 13613/CCO/JRF) before the International Court of Arbitration of the ICA against
Pemex-Exploration and Production for, among other things, the breach of a construction agreement in connection with two platforms in the
Cantarell project (Project No. IPC-01). On December 16, 2009, the ICA issued an arbitration award requiring Pemex-Exploration and Production
to pay U.S. $293,645 and Ps. 34,459, plus interest. On January 11, 2010, Pemex-Exploration and Production was notified that COMMISA had
filed a motion (No. 10-cv-00206-AKH) before the USDNY requesting the enforcement of the arbitration award in its favor. On November 2, 2010,
the Court issued a judgment recognizing the award and Pemex-Exploration and Production was ordered to pay U.S. $355,864. On
November 15, 2010, Pemex-Exploration and Production filed an appeal against this resolution before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pemex-Exploration and Production deposited U.S. $395,009 in an account of the Court on December 30, 2010 as a guarantee. Previously,
Pemex-Exploration and Production had filed a motion before the Juzgado Quinto de Distrito en Materia Civil (Fifth Civil District Court) in the
Federal District, requesting that the arbitration award be declared null and void, which was granted on October 24, 2011. Based on this
resolution, Pemex-Exploration and Production filed a motion before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals requesting that the judgment against
Pemex-Exploration and Production be declared void, that the guarantee deposit be returned to Pemex-Exploration and Production and that the
COMMISA request for enforcement be rejected. On February 16, 2012, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals granted Pemex-Exploration and
Production’s motion, and vacated the U.S. District Court’s judgment and remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for reconsideration in light
of the intervening decision of the Mexican court. COMMISA then requested that the arbitration award be confirmed. On September 25, 2013, the
Court issued a final judgment confirming the arbitration award. Pemex-Exploration and Production was ordered to pay to COMMISA
U.S. $465,060. Each party will pay its value added taxes. In November 2013, Pemex-Exploration and Production deposited this amount in an
account of the Court as a guarantee and subsequently filed an appeal before the Court of Appeals on January 28, 2014 and a rejoinder on
May 9, 2014. As of the date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, hearings are scheduled to be held in September
and October of 2014.
On January 22, 2013 COMMISA requested from and was granted by the authorities in Luxembourg an execution of the arbitration award and the
attachment of assets of Pemex-Exploration and Production and Petróleos Mexicanos located in several financial institutions. Pemex-Exploration
and Production filed a motion before the Supreme Court of Luxembourg on November 15, 2013 and COMMISA filed an additional motion on
January 15, 2014. On February 11, 2014, Pemex-Exploration and Production requested an extension to file its response to the execution process,
which was granted on February 14, 2014. The Court ordered Pemex-Exploration and Production to file its pleadings on March 25, 2014 and
August 5, 2014, and ordered COMMISA to file its pleadings on May 25, 2014 and October 5, 2014. On March 25, 2014, Pemex-Exploration and
Production filed its response. As of the date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the hearings are still pending.

damages. On August 5, 2011, Pemex-Exploration and Production filed its response to this claim. A judgment was issued ordering Pemex-
Exploration and Production to pay only contractual penalties. Pemex-Exploration and Production subsequently filed an appeal, which as of the
date of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, is still pending.
On July 8, 2011, Pemex-Exploration and Production was summoned in connection with an administrative claim (No. 4334/11-11-02-6) filed by
Compañía Petrolera La Norma, S.A., against the Director General of Petróleos Mexicanos and the Director General of Pemex-Exploration and
Production before the Segunda Sala Regional Hidalgo-México (Hidalgo-Mexico Second Regional Court) of the Tax and Administrative Federal
Court in Tlalnepantla, State of Mexico. The plaintiff is seeking compensation in connection with the cancellation of its alleged petroleum rights
concessions and damages for up to Ps. 1,552,730. On March 4, 2013, the Court notified the parties that it had amended the claim on
April 2, 2013. In addition, on April 9, 2013 a new claim was filed before the same court (438/12-11-02-3) and the defendants requested that it be
joined with the previous claim, which was granted on May 2, 2013. On July 18, 2013, the response to the amended claim was filed by the
defendants (No. 438/12-11-02-3). On November 19, 2013, the Court accepted the expert opinion filed by the defendants. As of the date of these

The results of these proceedings are uncertain until their final resolutions are issued by the appropriate authorities. PEMEX has recorded
liabilities for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount thereof can be reasonably estimated. When
a reasonable estimation could not be made, qualitative disclosure was provided in the notes to these unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements. PEMEX does not disclose amounts accrued for each individual claim because such disclosure could adversely affect
PEMEX’s legal strategy, as well as the outcome of the related litigation.
NOTE 17—SUBSEQUENT EVENTS:
During the period from July 1 to August 15, 2014, Petróleos Mexicanos participated in the following financing activities:
•
On July 2, 2014, Petróleos Mexicanos issued Ps. 11,000,000, aggregate principal amount of its Certificados Bursátiles due 2024 at a fixed rate
of 7.19%, consisting of (1) an international offering outside of Mexico of Ps. 2,353,100, of Certificados Bursátiles in the form of GDNs, and (2) a
concurrent offering to the public in Mexico of Ps. 8,646,900, of Certificados Bursátiles not represented by GDNs. The issuance represented the
third reopening of its Certificados Bursátiles due 2024, which were originally issued on September 26, 2013 and subsequently reopened on
December 11, 2013 and January 30, 2014. Petróleos Mexicanos concurrently issued in the Mexican market Ps. 4,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of Certificados Bursátiles in two tranches: one at a floating rate due 2019 in an aggregate principal amount of Ps. 1,500,000, which was
a reopening of the same series originally issued on September 19, 2013 and subsequently reopened on December 11, 2013 and January 30,
2014; and the second at a fixed rate of 3.94% due 2026 in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Unidades de Inversión (“UDI”) equivalent
of Ps. 2,500,000, which was a reopening of the same series originally issued on January 30, 2014. These certificados bursátiles were issued
under Petróleos Mexicanos’ Ps. 200,000,000 or UDI equivalent Certificados Bursátiles Program. All debt securities issued under this program
are guaranteed by Pemex-Exploration and Production, Pemex-Refining and Pemex-Gas and Basic Petrochemicals.
•
On July 26, 2014, Petróleos Mexicanos entered into a syndicated credit facility in the amount of Ps. 26,000,000; the facility bears interest at a
floating rate linked to TIIE and matures on July 25, 2024.
On August 15, 2014, the exchange rate was Ps. 13.1113 per U.S. dollar, which represents a 0.61% depreciation of the value of the peso in
U.S. dollar terms as compared to the exchange rate as of June 30, 2014, which was Ps. 13.0323 per U.S. dollar.

In connection with CONPROCA’s arbitration claim against Petróleos Mexicanos and Pemex-Refining in September 2001 and their subsequent
filing of an amparo before the Fourth Civil Joint Court of the First Circuit, on July 4, 2014, the Court denied the amparos of Petróleos Mexicanos
and Pemex-Refining. As of the date of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, Petróleos Mexicanos and Pemex-
Refining are considering filing a motion for review before the Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación (Supreme Court of Justice).
On July 16, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second District affirmed the decision of the USDNY to dismiss the complaint filed by Petróleos
Mexicanos and Pemex-Refining against SK Engineering and Siemens AG. The Court ordered each party to pay its own costs and expenses.
On July 25, 2014, in connection with the claim filed by EMS and Energy Maintenance against Pemex-Exploration and Production, the defendants
filed rejoinders with the Third District Court. As of the date of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, a final
judgment is pending. In a concurrent administrative proceeding, Pemex-Exploration and Production was summoned before the Séptima Sala
Regional Metropolitana (Seventh Regional Metropolitan Court) of the Tax and Administrative Federal Court on April 4, 2011 in connection with an
administrative claim (No. 4957/11-17-07-1) filed by the plaintiffs seeking that Pemex-Exploration and Production’s termination of the public works
contract be declared null and void. As of the date of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the defendants had
filed a rejoinder with the Court and the final judgment is pending.
On August 6, 2014, the Mexican Congress completed the process of approving the Secondary Legislation, which was subsequently signed into
law by President Enrique Peña Nieto and published in the Official Gazette of the Federation on August 11, 2014. Certain elements of the
Secondary Legislation, including the new Petróleos Mexicanos Law, are not yet effective as of the date of these unaudited condensed
consolidated interim financial statements.

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 AND 2013
(Figures stated in thousands, except as noted (Note 2))
The key features of the Secondary Legislation with respect to the hydrocarbons sector in Mexico and PEMEX’s operations are the following:
•
Third-party participation: The new regulatory framework established pursuant to the Ley de Hidrocarburos (Hydrocarbons Law) allows third
parties to participate in certain activities in the Mexican hydrocarbons industry that were previously reserved to Petróleos Mexicanos and the
Subsidiary Entities.
•
Conversion to a productive state-owned company: Pursuant to the new Petróleos Mexicanos Law, on the day following the appointment of the
new Board, which must take place within 90 days of the publication of the new Petróleos Mexicanos Law in the Official Gazette of the
Federation, Petróleos Mexicanos will be converted from a decentralized public entity to a productive state-owned company controlled by the
Mexican Government.
•
Corporate reorganization: Within 45 days of the appointment of the new Board, the Director General of Petróleos Mexicanos is to present a
proposal for the corporate reorganization of PEMEX to the Board. The Board will then have three months to modify or approve the Director
General’s proposal. As part of such corporate reorganization, the Subsidiary Entities may be converted to empresas productivas subsidiarias
(productive state-owned subsidiary companies), which will assume all rights and obligations of the existing Subsidiary Entities. Pursuant to the
new Petróleos Mexicanos Law, exploration and production activities may only be carried out through one or more productive state-owned
subsidiary companies. The corporate structure of PEMEX may also include affiliates that undertake activities other than exploration and
production. These affiliates may either be companies in which Petróleos Mexicanos has a direct or indirect minority stake or companies with
which Petróleos Mexicanos participates in a joint venture or other form of association.
•
Corporate actions: The new Petróleos Mexicanos Law will establish a framework for the regulation of certain corporate actions of Petróleos
Mexicanos with respect to acquisitions, leases and property, as well as the Board’s decision-making with respect to compensation, budgetary
issues and PEMEX’s level of debt, subject to certain restrictions.

(Figures stated in thousands, except as noted (Note 2))
•
Pension liabilities: The Secondary Legislation enables the Mexican Government to assume a portion of PEMEX’s unfunded reserve for
retirement pensions and seniority premiums, which as of December 31, 2013, was equal to approximately U.S. $85.6 billion. In turn, the
collective bargaining agreement between Petróleos Mexicanos and the Sindicato de Trabajadores Petroleros de la República Mexicana
(Petroleum Workers’ Union) must be renegotiated and the Reglamento de Trabajo del Personal de Confianza de Petróleos Mexicanos y
Organismos Subsidiarios (Employment Regulation for White Collar Employees of Petróleos Mexicanos and Subsidiary Entities) must be
modified in order to meet the following conditions, among others, within a year:
•
•
•
offering PEMEX’s new employees individualized defined contribution plans through the Sistema de Ahorro para el Retiro (Retirement
Saving System) in Mexico;
adjusting the parameters of PEMEX’s retirement plans, including an increase in the retirement age; and
the audit of PEMEX’s pension liabilities by the Auditoría Superior de la Federación (Superior Audit Office of the Federation).
The Mexican Government may assume a portion of PEMEX’s pension liabilities equivalent to the reduction in liabilities achieved through changes
to its pension system. However, the actual amount of PEMEX’s pension liabilities that this portion will represent has not yet been determined as of
the date of these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
In connection with the Round Zero request that PEMEX submitted on March 21, 2014, the Ministry of Energy, with technical assistance from the
NHC, evaluated PEMEX’s request that it be assigned oil and gas exploration and extraction rights in certain areas based on its technical, financial
and operational capabilities. On August 13, 2014, the Ministry of Energy published the results of Round Zero, pursuant to which PEMEX was
assigned rights corresponding to areas that together contain 95% of Mexico’s estimated proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas as of
December 31, 2013.
