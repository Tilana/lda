</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report provides information on the status of implementation of 
paragraph 3 of Human Rights Council resolution 15/1 on follow-up to the report of the 
independent international fact-finding mission on the incident of the humanitarian flotilla. 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 15/1 of 
29 September 2010. In paragraph 3 of that resolution the Council endorsed the conclusions 
contained in the report of the international fact-finding mission to investigate violations of 
international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law, resulting 
from the Israeli attacks on the flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian assistance 
(A/HRC/15/21). It also called upon all concerned parties to ensure their immediate 
implementation. In paragraph 5 of the same resolution, the Council also requested the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit a report on the status of 
the implementation of paragraph 3 of the resolution to the Council at its sixteenth session. 
</p>
<p>2.  On 1 November 2010, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
addressed notes verbales to the Permanent Missions of Israel and Turkey, as well as the 
Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine, requesting information about any steps their 
respective Governments had taken, envisaged taking, or were otherwise aware of 
concerning the implementation of paragraph 3 of resolution 15/1.  
</p>
<p>3. At the time of the preparation of the present report, no reply had been received from 
the Permanent Mission of Israel or the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine. 
</p>

<p>4. In a submission dated 18 November 2010 addressed to the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, the Government of Turkey expressed its strong interest in 
ensuring accountability for the violations of international law committed in the context of 
the attack on the flotilla as concluded by the report of the international fact-finding mission. 
To that end, it indicated its willingness and readiness to contribute to actions by the Human 
Rights Council. Noting that the conclusions of the report of the international fact-finding 
mission endorsed by the Council in paragraph 3 of resolution 15/1 were directed at Israel, 
the Government of Turkey expressed its readiness to assist Israel to implement the 
conclusions if and when Israel decides to take action.  
</p>
<p>5. Turkey regrets Israel&#8217;s lack of cooperation with the international fact-finding 
mission on the flotilla incident and views this lack of cooperation as a way of delaying the 
efforts of the international community to ensure accountability for violations. Turkey also 
regrets that, in his meeting with the commandos who perpetrated the attacks against the 
Mavi Marmara, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to their 
&#8220;professionalism&#8221;, &#8220;heroism&#8221; and &#8220;restraint.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>6. In its submission, the Government of Turkey points to complaints lodged with the 
Istanbul Prosecutor&#8217;s Office against Israel by the survivors of the attack on the flotilla as 
well as the family members of those killed. It notes that the work of the Prosecutor is still at 
the investigation phase and that it may lead to legal proceedings against those Israeli 
officials deemed responsible for the attack. In addition, the Government of Turkey noted 
with interest similar lawsuits that have been filed against Israeli officials in Spain and the 
United Kingdom as well as a complaint filed by a group of non-governmental organizations 
before the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on behalf of those killed and 
injured during the attack. The Government of Turkey reiterates its commitment to ensuring 
an end to impunity for violations committed as a result of the attack on the flotilla and its 
expectation that the Government of Israel will contribute to all efforts towards this end. 
</p>
<p>7. Finally, the Government of Turkey records that the remit of the Panel of Inquiry 
established by the Secretary-General and the international fact-finding mission established 
by the Human Rights Council are distinct. It notes that the former is a political process 
whereas the latter was mandated to address violations of international law. Turkey 
expresses its concern regarding the misrepresentation of the mandate of the international 
fact-finding mission and reaffirms the authority and mandate of the Human Rights Council 
to address violations of human rights law. The Government of Turkey further notes its 
cooperation with both the Panel of Inquiry and the international fact-finding mission on the 
flotilla. 
</p>
<p>8. In light of the short timeframe between the passing of the resolution on 29 
September 2010 and the deadline for the submission of the present report, the High 
Commissioner will provide in due course any relevant updated information, if available, 
with regard to significant developments pertaining to the implementation of paragraph 3 of 
resolution 15/1.
