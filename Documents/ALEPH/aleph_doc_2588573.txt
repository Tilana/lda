Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the
period covered by this report;
Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in

and cash flows of the Registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;
The Registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-
15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f)) for the Registrant and have:
Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and
procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating
to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within
those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;
Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over
financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance

that occurred during the Registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter (the Registrant’s fourth fiscal
quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and
The Registrant’s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Registrant’s auditors and the audit
committee of the Registrant’s board of directors:
All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Registrant’s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

significant role in the Registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.
