</p>
<p>General Assembly resolutions 57/219, 58/187, 59/191, 60/158, 61/171 and 62/159, 
</p>

</p>
<p>terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, in particular 
</p>
<p>international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>2.<i> Deeply deplores</i> the suffering caused by terrorism to the victims and their 
</p>
<p>families, expresses its profound solidarity with them, and stresses the importance of 
</p>
<p>providing them with proper assistance; </p>
<p>3. <i>Reaffirms </i>its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and practices 
</p>
<p>of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomsoever 
</p>
<p>committed, regardless of their motivation, as criminal and unjustifiable, and renewing 
</p>
<p>its commitment to strengthen international cooperation to prevent and combat 
</p>
<p>terrorism, and in that regard calls upon States and other relevant actors, as appropriate, 
</p>
<p>to continue to implement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, 
</p>
<p>which, inter alia, reaffirms respect for human rights for all and the rule of law to be 
</p>
<p>the fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Also reaffirms</i> the obligation of States, in accordance with article 4 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to respect that certain rights are 
</p>
<p>non-derogable in any circumstances, and recalls, in regard to all other Covenant rights, 
</p>
<p>that any measures derogating from the provisions of the Covenant must be in </p>

<p>accordance with that article in all cases, and underlines the exceptional and temporary 
</p>
<p>nature of any such derogations;<footnote name="1">See, for example, general comment No. 29 (2001), on article 4 of the Covenant (derogations 
during a state of emergency) adopted by the Human Rights Committee. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Calls upon</i> States to raise awareness of the importance of these obligations 
</p>
<p>among national authorities involved in combating terrorism; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Reaffirms </i>that counter-terrorism measures should be implemented in full

</p>
<p>discriminatory on grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Calls upon</i> States not to resort to profiling based on stereotypes founded on 
</p>
<p>grounds of discrimination prohibited by international law, including on racial, ethnic 
</p>
<p>and/or religious grounds; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Urges</i> States, while countering terrorism, to fully comply with their 
</p>
<p>obligations in respect of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment, in particular the absolute prohibition of torture; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Also urges</i> States to fully respect non-refoulement obligations under 
</p>
<p>international refugee and human rights law and, at the same time, to review, with full 
</p>
<p>respect for these obligations and other legal safeguards, the validity of a refugee status 
</p>
<p>decision in an individual case if credible and relevant evidence comes to light that 
</p>
<p>indicates that the person in question has committed any criminal acts, including 
</p>
<p>terrorist acts, falling under the exclusion clauses under international refugee law; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Calls upon</i> States to refrain from returning persons, including in cases 
</p>
<p>related to terrorism, to their countries of origin or to a third State whenever such 
</p>
<p>transfer would be contrary to their obligations under international law, in particular 
</p>
<p>human rights law, international humanitarian law and international refugee law, 
</p>
<p>including in cases where there are substantial grounds for believing that they would be 
</p>
<p>in danger of subjection to torture, or where their life or freedom would be threatened 
</p>
<p>in violation of international refugee law on account of their race, religion, nationality, 
</p>
<p>membership of a particular social group or political opinion, bearing in mind 
</p>
<p>obligations that States may have to prosecute individuals not returned; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to ensure that guidelines and practices in all border 
</p>
<p>control operations and other pre-entry mechanisms are clear and fully respect their 
</p>
<p>obligations under international law, particularly refugee law and human rights law, 
</p>
<p>towards persons seeking international protection; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Urges </i>States, while countering terrorism, to ensure due process guarantees, 
</p>
<p>consistent with all relevant provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>and their obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
</p>
<p>and of the Geneva Conventions and their additional Protocols, and the 1951 
</p>
<p>Convention relating to the status of refugees and the 1969 Protocol relating to the 
</p>
<p>status of refugees, in their respective fields of applicability; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Also urges</i> all States to take all necessary steps to ensure that persons 
</p>
<p>deprived of liberty, regardless of the place of arrest or of detention, benefit from the 
</p>
<p>guarantees to which they are entitled under international law, including the review of 
</p>
<p>their detention and, if subjected to trial, fundamental judicial guarantees; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Opposes</i> any form of deprivation of liberty that amounts to placing a 
</p>
<p>detained person outside of the protection of the law, and urges States to respect the 
</p>
<p>safeguards concerning the liberty, security and dignity of the person and to treat all 
</p>

</p>
<p>be a significant event; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that their laws criminalizing terrorist conduct

</p>
<p>retroactive and in accordance with international law, including human rights law; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Urges</i> States while ensuring full compliance with their international 
</p>
<p>obligations, to include adequate human rights guarantees in their national procedures 
</p>
