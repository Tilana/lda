</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present document consolidates the findings of the high-level task force on the 
implementation of the right to development, submitted pursuant to a request by the 
Working Group on the Right to Development (A/HRC/12/28, para. 44). 
</p><p>2. In 2004, when the task force was established, the Working Group decided that it 
should examine (a) the obstacles and challenges to the implementation of the Millennium 
Development Goals in relation to the right to development; (b) social impact assessments in 
the areas of trade and development at the national and international levels; and (c) best 
practices in the implementation of the right to development (E/CN.4/2004/23, para. 49). 
The task force decided that it would consider the issue of best practices within the scope of 
the other two mandated themes, to facilitate a focus in its discussions and analyses. 
</p>
<p>3. In 2005, the Working Group requested the task force to examine Millennium 
Development Goal 8, on a global partnership for development, and to suggest criteria for its 
periodic evaluation with the aim of improving the effectiveness of global partnerships with 
regard to the realization of the right to development (E/CN.4/2005/25, para. 54 (i)). 
</p><p>4. In 2006, the Working Group adopted the right to development criteria and requested 
the task force to apply them, on a pilot basis, to selected partnerships, with a view to their 
operationalization and progressive development, and thus contributing to mainstreaming 
the right to development in policies and operational activities of relevant actors at the 
national, regional and international levels, including multilateral financial, trade and 
development institutions (E/CN.4/2006/26, para. 77). Application of the criteria continued 
for the period 2007&#8211;2009 (A/HRC/4/47, para. 53; A/HRC/9/17, para. 41 and A/HRC/12/28, 
para. 46). 
5. The conclusions and recommendations present the task force&#8217;s assessment of the 
potential value of developing criteria from the perspective of its basic approach of assisting 
the Working Group to move the right to development from political commitment to 
development practice, thus paving the way to its suggestions for further work as outlined in 
the report on its sixth session (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2, paras. 75&#8211;88). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Summary of main findings 
</b>6. The greatest challenge for the implementation of the right to development, in theory 
and practice, is to reconcile a holistic vision of human rights, implying indivisible and 
interdependent norms aimed at maximizing the well-being of all individuals and peoples, 
with development, which requires sound economic policies that foster growth with equity. 
It is easier to affirm their mutually reinforcing nature in principle than to apply this 
principle to decisions of policy and resource allocation. 
</p>
<p>7. Development implies establishing policy priorities and addressing trade-offs in 
resource allocations and benefits, intra- and inter-temporally, consistent with human rights, 
in processes and outcomes. In an increasingly interdependent world, States and non-State 
actors help to shape these priorities and trade-offs. The primary responsibility of meeting 
priorities and ensuring enjoyment of human rights still rests with States, through national 
policy and commitments under international arrangements. These broad concepts underlie 
the following summary of findings. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.10-12555 
</p>
<p><b> A. Obstacles and challenges to the implementation of the Millennium 
Development Goals in relation to the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Millennium Development Goals represent a measurable set of human 
development milestones, the attainment of which is critical to building a more humane, 
inclusive, equitable and sustainable world, as envisaged in the Millennium Declaration. The 
achievement of the Goals has been variously constrained by threats to peace and security, 
environmental degradation, policy inadequacies and poor governance, and lack of a 
supportive external environment for the improvement of conditions for developing 
countries in terms of international trade, debt sustainability and internationally agreed 
levels of aid. 
</p>
<p>9. Four distinctive features of human rights, including the right to development, pose 
challenges to the implementation of the Goals: (a) specific and explicit inclusion of 
universally recognized and legally binding human rights standards in strategies for meeting 
the Goals; (b) indivisibility and interdependence of human rights in formulating coherent 
policies and holistic development strategies in addressing the Goals; (c) clearly defined 
accountability mechanisms through judicial or other means at the national and international 
levels, which are participatory, accessible, transparent and effective; and (d) mobilization of 
civil society to use the human rights framework in participating in and monitoring 
development efforts, towards achieving the Goals in a rights-based manner. 
</p>
<p>10. Policymakers and development practitioners need a clear and rigorous mapping of 
the Goals against relevant international human rights instruments in order to mobilize, 
strengthen and sustain efforts to implement them at the national and international levels. 
Such a framework should draw upon the work of treaty bodies and special procedures in 
informing strategies and policies to implement the Goals.1 Significant advances in realizing 
the Goals and the right to development require effective action to strengthen institutional 
capacities, bridge information gaps, address accountability failures and give them local 
content and national ownership. 
</p>
<p>11. Beyond mapping human rights obligations with the Goals, policymakers and 
development practitioners need practical tools, including guidelines and objective 
indicators, to help translate human rights norms and principles into processes like social 
impact assessments. In 2005, the task force examined a seminar paper on indicators for 
assessing international obligations in the context of Goal 8 
(E/CN.4/2005/WG.18/TF/CRP.2) and shared the consultant&#8217;s view that the framework to 
monitor that Goal was inadequate from the perspective of the right to development, for 
reasons including its lack of quantitative indicators, time-bound targets, appropriate 
measures to address current policy challenges and ownership of the development process. It 
agreed on the need for a conceptual framework on indicators of human rights to measure 
conduct of policies for the realization of human rights and international responsibility. 
</p>
<p>12. The task force has favoured the creation and operation of research and advocacy 
groups applying human rights principles and gender dimension to development, which 
would proactively inform and participate in the formulation and implementation of the 
Millennium Development Goals in the context of country development strategies, including 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers. It has also encouraged a participatory approach in 
allocation of social sector expenditures in public budgets. 
</p>

 Since the task force formulated this finding, OHCHR has published <i>Claiming the MDGs: A Human 
</i></p>
<p><i>Rights Approach</i>, United Nations, New York/Geneva, 2008; and UNDP published a primer, <i>Human 
Rights and the Millennium Development Goals: Making the Link</i>, Governance Centre, Oslo, 2007. </p>

</b></p>
<p>13. When unexpected shocks put poor and vulnerable populations at risk, efforts to 
achieve the Goals may require temporary use of institutional measures encompassing social 
safety nets, such as well-targeted transfers and subsidies. From a right to development 
perspective, the issue of institutional and financial capacity to support social safety nets, 
particularly in the context of addressing effects of external shocks on the well-being of 
people, entails an international dimension. In such situations, the multilateral trade and 
development institutions should take steps to support national efforts to facilitate and 
sustain such measures. 
</p>
<p>14. Social safety nets correspond to the right to an adequate standard of living, including 
social security, as defined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and an instrument of the International Labour Organization. In times of crisis and in 
chronic poverty, States must ensure, with the help of international cooperation when 
necessary, that everyone enjoys economic, social and cultural rights. Failure to do so would 
be detrimental to attaining the Goals and implementing the right to development. Although 
this conclusion was formulated by the task force in December 2004, it is even more 
relevant in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Social impact assessments in the areas of trade and development at the 
national and international levels 
</b></p>
<p>15. The need for social impact assessments in informing policy decisions and addressing 
the dislocative impact of new policies was highlighted at the fifth session of the Working 
Group and the preceding high-level seminar (E/CN.4/2004/23/Add.1), as important in 
implementing the right to development at national and international levels. The task force 
considered broadening the concept and methodology of assessments to explicitly include 
human rights and to identify possible complementary policies for implementing the right to 
development in the global context (E/CN.4/2005/WG.18/2, paras. 23&#8211;24). 
</p><p>16. Such assessments provide important methodological tools to promote evidence-
based policy formulation by including distributional and social effects in the ex ante 
analysis of policy reforms and agreements. It is potentially useful in bringing about policy 
coherence at both the national and international levels, and in promoting adherence to 
human rights standards, as required by the right to development. 
</p>
<p>17. Impact assessments are still evolving as a means of determining the consequences of 
specific interventions in a society and have only recently been extended to examine the 
impact of trade agreements on people&#8217;s well-being. Caution is required in undertaking such 
assessments, as the complex dynamics of economic transactions do not always lend 
themselves to clearly defined causation analysis. 
</p>
<p>18. Policymakers and development practitioners could only benefit from social impact 
assessments that have integrated human rights standards and principles into their normative 
framework and methodology. While several institutions have initiated work on social 
impact assessment methodologies, the approach of OECD and the World Bank have 
provided a useful analytical framework, including indicators for measuring empowerment, 
which take human rights into account.2 Assessments can only be effective if there is

<p>genuine demand, ownership and availability of appropriate quantitative data and the will of 
the authorities to apply the findings of relevant analysis. 
</p>
<p>19. The right to development framework makes it imperative that the application of 
social impact assessments result in the identification of the dislocative effects of adopted 
policies on the poor and most vulnerable, and provide corresponding remedial measures. 
States should be encouraged to undertake independent assessments of the impact of trade 
agreements on poverty, human rights and other social aspects, and these assessments should 
be taken into account in the context of the Trade Policy Review Mechanism process and 
future trade negotiations. Use of such assessments would be consistent with the &#8220;need for 
positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries, and especially the least 
developed among them, secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate 
with the needs of their economic development&#8221;, as recognized in the preamble to the 
Marrakesh Declaration establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO). Despite the 
limited experience, human rights impact assessment would add further value, given the 
normative content of the right to development.3 States should also consider special and 
differential treatment provisions under the WTO agreements with a view to enhancing their 
effectiveness as instruments to harmonize human rights and multilateral trade requirements. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Global partnerships 
</b></p>
<p>20. Millennium Development Goal 8, with its focus on international cooperation, is a 
framework consistent with international responsibilities outlined in the Declaration on the 
Right to Development. Following the Working Group recommendations, the task force 
engaged in constructive dialogue and collaboration with multilateral institutions responsible 
for development aid (paras. 23&#8211;38), trade (paras. 39&#8211;45), access to medicines (paras. 46&#8211;
55), debt sustainability (paras. 56&#8211;60) and transfer of technology (paras. 61&#8211;66). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Development aid 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Economic Commission for Africa/Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development-Development Assistance Committee: Mutual Review of Development 
Effectiveness in the context of the New Partnership for Africa&#8217;s Development 
</i>21. Development aid figures prominently among the means essential, particularly for 
some developing countries, to attain the Millennium Development Goals, and in related 
commitments made at the 2001 Doha round, the 2002 Monterrey Consensus, the 2005 
Gleneagles G-8 summit and the 2009 London G-20 summit. 
</p>
<p>22. The Mutual Review of Development Effectiveness in the context of the New 
Partnership for Africa&#8217;s Development (NEPAD) broadly complies with several right to 
development criteria, especially regarding national ownership, accountability and 
sustainability, and can build upon and elaborate related processes in the context of the 
Cotonou Agreement between the European Union and African, Caribbean and Pacific 
countries, the African Peer Review Mechanism and Bretton Woods processes, such as 
Poverty Reduction, Strategy Papers (A/HRC/4/WG.2/TF/2, para. 64). The task force shared 
the consultant&#8217;s assessment that the key challenges for African partners included lack of 
peace and security and economic growth, corruption, which continued to undermine socio-

<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 &#8220;The right to development is clearly also relevant in this context, but has not been the subject of any 
</p>
<p>discussion in the context of impact assessment, possibly because of a lack of clarity on how to define 
its substantive content.&#8221; J. Harrison and A. Goller, &#8220;Trade and human rights: what does &#8216;impact 
assessment&#8217; have to offer?&#8221;, <i>Human Rights Law Review</i>, vol. 8, No. 4 (2008), pp. 587&#8211;615. </p>

<p>economic growth and development, and capacity gaps in governance institutions 
(E/CN.4/2005/WG.18/TF/3, para. 31). 
</p><p>23. There is less congruence with criteria relating to the incorporation of human rights in 
national and international development policies. The governance component of the Mutual 
Review is a useful entry point, and the process should integrate regionally determined and 
owned human rights standard-setting instruments (African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights and protocols thereto), and the OECD Action-Oriented Policy Paper on Human 
Rights and Development (A/HRC/4/WG.2/TF/2, para. 64). It is necessary to make clear 
references to human rights instruments and cover all human rights. The review should 
complement the African Peer Review Mechanism.4 
</p>
<p>24. The process of preparing Mutual Review reports provided opportunities to improve 
the framework and integrate concepts derived from the right to development and rights-
based approaches to development. The task force accepted the consultant&#8217;s assessment that 
&#8220;action frontiers&#8221; and &#8220;performance benchmarks&#8221; should be more specific, useful to 
policymakers and clearly connected to existing commitments. The inclusion of benchmarks 
informed by human rights and other treaties could strengthen the review&#8217;s contribution to 
the right to development. Often, the Mutual Review framework does not appear to be 
informed by existing standards in the field (A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/CRP.5, para. 53). 
</p><p>25. The Mutual Review could undertake evaluations of the extent to which OECD and 
African countries have lived up to specific commitments in each area, summarizing and 
providing an analysis of the existing monitoring work rather than seeking to replicate it. 
The mechanism does not focus specifically on the poor and most marginalized. This defect 
should be remedied through integration into its questions, Millennium Development Goals, 
concerns about non-discrimination and vulnerable groups, especially in disadvantaged 
regions and non-dominant ethnic groups, as well as rural populations, women, children and 
the disabled (A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/CRP.5, paras. 55&#8211;56). 
26. The value of the Mutual Review for the right to development lies in the 
effectiveness of the accountability mechanism and in enhancing the negotiating position of 
African countries with regard to aid effectiveness. The task force remains concerned that 
many dimensions of the right to development, such as explicit reference to human rights, a 
focus on gender and priority for the vulnerable and marginalized populations, were not 
adequately addressed. The task force also concludes that policy priorities should be revised 
in the light of the increased needs of African countries owing to the failure of the Doha 
round and the current financial crisis (A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/2, para. 64). 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness 
</i>27. The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, a non-binding document on ways to 
disburse and manage official development assistance more effectively, did not establish a 
formal global partnership, but rather created a framework for bilateral partnerships between 
donors and creditors, and individual aid recipient countries. It is thus indirectly relevant to 
Goal 8. The Working Party on Aid Effectiveness, housed and administered by the OECD-
Development Assistance Committee and supported by the World Bank, has sought to 
provide a mechanism to address asymmetries in power and to give more voice to 
developing countries and civil society representatives since the third High-Level Forum on 
Aid Effectiveness, held in Accra in 2008.

</p>
<p>28. Although human rights are not mentioned in the Paris Declaration, they are referred 
to twice in the Accra Agenda for Action, and some of its principles are consistent with the 
right to development support for ownership and accountability. However, several of its 
indicators and targets prior to the Accra Forum appeared to work against the right to 
development and erode national democratic processes. The task force welcomed the 
willingness of OECD to adjust these deficiencies. Human rights, including the right to 
development, should be explicitly included as goals in the Paris Declaration and ministerial 
declarations. An additional review and evaluation framework with corresponding targets 
and indicators should be included, according to which the results of the declaration should 
be assessed in terms of its impact on the right to development, human rights and the 
Millennium Development Goals (A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/CRP.7, paras. 86&#8211;87). 
</p><p>29. The Paris Declaration focuses on aid effectiveness and not explicitly on 
development outcomes. It is therefore less useful as a framework for enhanced development 
effectiveness, human rights realization, gender equality and environmental sustainability 
(A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/CRP.1, para. 14). The main causes of ineffective aid (that is, tied aid 
and unpredictability of aid income) are not properly addressed and pose a significant 
problem from a right to development perspective, particularly in the light of the ownership 
of partner countries and policy coherence (A/HRC/4/WG.2/TF/2, para. 66). Progress has 
been made, however, in untying aid of OECD-Development Assistance Committee donors 
since the Paris Declaration of 2005. Right to development criteria and human rights 
precepts and practice could reinforce the declaration&#8217;s principles of ownership and mutual 
accountability, to which more importance was attached by the Accra Agenda for Action. 
Progress in improving the predictability of aid flows (albeit considerably less than in 
untying aid) also deserves attention. Several major donors have recently moved to medium-
term programming of their aid programmes with priority partner countries, thus enhancing 
the medium-term predictability of aid commitments. Similar progress is required in the 
predictability of aid disbursements. 
</p>
<p>30. The right to development can add value to aid effectiveness by framing the debate 
without overemphasizing aid efficiency or introducing conditionality language 
(A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/CRP.1, para. 19). There is considerable congruence between the 
principles of aid effectiveness and those underlying this right. By focusing on ownership 
and commitment, ensuring the removal of resource constraints and providing an enabling 
environment, the right to development helps developing countries to integrate human rights 
into development policies. While there is synergy between the principles of country 
ownership and mutual accountability and the right to development, their implementation 
and assessment could result in a disregard for other principles of the right to development 
without complaint mechanisms or other means of redress (A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/CRP.7, para. 
85). 
</p><p>31. The focus of right to development principles is resonant in the Paris Declaration and 
increases the relevance of applying the criteria to the evaluation of global partnerships. 
While ownership is a key principle in the Declaration, country experiences indicate the 
need for more progress towards aligning aid with national priorities, ensuring that aid is 
untied and using country systems for procurement and financial management 
(A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/CRP.7, para. 86; A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/CRP.1, para. 20). Here, the 
Accra Agenda took steps to remedy certain shortcomings of existing development 
cooperation partnerships by stressing country ownership, encouraging developing country 
Governments to take stronger leadership on their own development policies and to engage 
with their parliaments and citizens in shaping those policies. The agenda creates space for 
domestic procedures and processes and is intended to reduce reliance on donor-driven 
systems that undermine domestic accountability in recipient countries.  </p>

<p>GE.10-12555 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><i>  (c) African Peer Review Mechanism  
</i>32. The task force acknowledged the relevance to the right to development of the 
Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate Governance, adopted in 
2002 by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African 
Unity. The declaration and the African Peer Review Mechanism could be used to monitor 
progress in the implemention of the right to development (E/CN.4/2005/WG.18/TF/3, para. 
31). 
</p>
<p>33. The African Peer Review Mechanism is a unique process that enables the 
assessment and review of African governance through a South-South partnership. It 
preserves the autonomy of States and opens them to scrutiny, introducing benefits and 
incentives that can strengthen domestic accountability. It can provide implementable 
criteria for measuring development progress and considerable space for participation by 
civil society. 
</p>
<p>34. The task force acknowledged proposals to revise the mechanism&#8217;s questionnaire 
guiding country self-assessments and the process of reviewing reports. Such revision 
should aim at downsizing and making it a more efficient tool for assessment; harmonizing 
with other processes, such as Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers; and explicitly 
incorporating human rights criteria.  
</p>
<p>35. The mechanism&#8217;s process could also be improved with regard to follow-up and 
implementation of the programme of action. The focus on making recommendations to 
Member States and ensuring their implementation is an entry point to introduce elements of 
the right to development, while developing clear prioritization, measurable indicators, 
better integration into existing development plans, broad-based policy review and 
monitoring of development progress. 
</p>
<p>36. As part of reforms of African Union structures, more collaboration between the 
African Peer Review Mechanism, NEPAD and the African Union would enhance the 
effective integration of work under the mechanism with African human rights institutions, 
particularly the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, thus supporting the 
realization of the right to development under article 22 of the African Charter on Human 
and Peoples Rights (A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/2, para. 54). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Trade  
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and European Union Partnership Agreement and 
Economic Partnership Agreements 
</i></p>
<p>37. The Cotonou Agreement contains mechanisms for both positive (incentives, 
additional assistance) and negative (sanctions, suspending aid) measures of European 
Union-African, Caribbean and Pacific human rights policies. The right to development is 
not mentioned explicitly in the Cotonou Agreement, nor in subsequent Economic 
Partnership Agreements between the European Union and regional groupings among 
African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. 
</p>
<p>38. The task force suggested that more attention be paid to the mutually-reinforcing 
obligations of the Cotonou Agreement and right to development criteria, and favoured 
monitoring benchmarks in subsequent agreements. Continued special and differential 
treatment of African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and recognition of the need for 
country specific adjustment, compensation and additional resources for trade capacity-
building, independent monitoring and evaluation were also favoured 
(A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/2, para. 64). Non-tariff barriers to trade, such as overly restrictive 
sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers and rules of origin procedures, were 
a matter of concern. Although the human rights clauses of the agreement were increasingly </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.10-12555 
</p>
<p>viewed as conditionalities, punitive measures, such as the withdrawal of trade preferences, 
may at times be justified in response to human rights violations. A positive approach may, 
however, contribute structurally to realizing the right to development. Positive measures to 
create an enabling environment may include trade diversification, aid for trade, support for 
trade unions and institutional capacity-building (A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/2, para. 23). 
</p><p>39. There were apparent gaps and shortcomings in transparency and consultation with 
partner Governments and civil society actors. Human rights are part of economic 
partnership agreements because of the overall applicability of relevant provisions in the 
Cotonou Agreement. 
</p>
<p>40. The conclusion and ratification of economic partnership agreements and the revision 
of the Cotonou Agreement should be transparent and involve parliamentary scrutiny and 
consultation with civil society (A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/2, para. 66). Consultations on the 
second review of the Cotonou Agreement, planned for 2010, present an opportunity to 
appraise its human rights provisions and consider proposals consistent with right to 
development criteria. The task force was concerned that regionalization through the 
agreements risked eroding the general negotiating position of weaker trading partners, and 
supporting their development efforts should therefore be a priority 
(A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/CRP.1, para. 69). 
</p><p>41. The task force noted problems of coherence among the various complex European 
Union and European Commission policies, particularly with regard to how to deal with 
human rights and transparency in the context of the political dialogue under article 8 of the 
Cotonou Agreement and the conclusion of economic partnership agreements. The general 
human rights provisions in the agreement should in practice be broadened to reflect the 
indivisibility of human rights by extending coverage to economic, social and cultural rights, 
as provided in its preamble.  
</p>
<p>42. The Cotonou Agreement provides for impact assessments. These should ideally take 
into account human rights, including right to development considerations and criteria both 
in trade and development cooperation, thus enhancing space for development monitoring 
benchmarks, as suggested by African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and also voiced by 
European Parliament members. 
</p>
<p><b> 3.  Access to essential medicines  
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Intergovernmental Working Group on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property  
</i>43. The Intergovernmental Working Group on Public Health, Innovation and 
Intellectual Property was established by the World Health Assembly in 2006 to develop a 
global strategy and plan of action for needs-driven, essential health research and 
development relevant to diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries, 
promote innovation, build capacity, improve access and mobilize resources. It is 
specifically concerned with target 8-E on access to essential medicines. Through the Global 
Strategy and Plan of Action, adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2008, it seeks to 
facilitate access by the poor to essential medicines and promote innovation in health 
products and medical devices. The incentive schemes aim to delink price from research and 
make health products cheaper and more easily available (A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/CRP.1, para. 
26). 
44. The task force stressed the potential synergy between the strategy and plan and the 
right to development (A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/CRP.1 para. 27). Although these documents 
could not be amended, there is leeway to introduce right to development principles in the 
interpretation of the principles and elements and implementation of the strategy and plan 
(A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/CRP.2, para. 11). The task force found congruence between the eight </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12555 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>elements designed to promote innovation, build capacity, improve access, mobilize 
resources and monitor and evaluate implementation of the strategy itself, and duties of 
States to take all necessary measures to ensure equality of opportunity for all in access to 
health services, pursuant to article 8.1 of the Declaration on the Right to Development.  
</p>
<p>45. The task force acknowledged the reference in the strategy and plan to the 
constitutional commitment of the World Health Organization (WHO) to the right to health, 
but regretted that reference to article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights had been deleted. It was noted with concern that the strategy and plan 
do not caution against adoption of Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 
(TRIPS)-plus protection in bilateral trade agreements, or refer to the impact of bilateral or 
regional trade agreements on access to medicines. Nevertheless, these documents contain 
elements of accessibility, affordability and quality of medicines in developing countries, 
corresponding to the normative content of the right to health. In accordance with general 
comment No. 17 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, States parties 
should ensure that their legal or other regimes protecting intellectual property do not 
impede their ability to comply with their core obligations under the rights to food, health 
and education (E/CN.4/2005/WG.18/TF/3, para. 67; A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/2, para. 74). 
Regarding accountability, the monitoring, evaluation and reporting systems of actions of 
Governments, as primary duty-holders, and of industry were consistent with right to 
development criteria, although improvements could be made to the indicators. Regarding 
the role of the pharmaceutical industry, the task force and WHO saw the potential of 
exploring with stakeholders the Human Rights Guidelines for Pharmaceutical Companies in 
relation to Access to Medicines and the right to health. On participation, provisions for 
web-based hearings, regional and inter-country consultations, direct participation of non-
governmental organizations and experts, and funding to enable attendance of least-
developed countries were commended. 
</p>
<p><i> (b)  Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases  
</i>46. While not explicit in its vision, the Special Programme for Research and Training in 
Tropical Diseases has an implicit commitment to human rights and the Millennium 
Development Goals. Its overall aim is to deliver research and implement practical solutions 
to many of the world&#8217;s neglected diseases. Consistent with right to development criteria, 
recent projects are community-driven in that communities decide how a particular medicine 
will be used and distributed, check compliance with quality and quantity standards, and 
ensure record-keeping. These community-driven interventions increase the distribution of 
some drugs, lead to better public services and contribute to political empowerment and 
democratization, all contributing to the realization of the right to development 
(A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/CRP.1, para. 25). 
47. The impact of the programme on innovation through research and development 
regarding infectious diseases has been limited owing to underfunding and the high price of 
medicines (A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/2 para. 79). Concurrently, the governance structures of 
newer private foundations and non-governmental organizations do not provide for 
accountability to the public at large. It is of concern that global efforts for financing 
initiatives to fight diseases of the poor heavily depend on sources outside public institutions 
and public accountability systems. 
</p>
<p>48. The task force concluded that the Special Programme&#8217;s strategy is rights-based as its 
core feature is empowerment of developing countries and meeting needs of the most 
vulnerable. Transparency and accountability could be strengthened, particularly as concerns 
contractual agreements with pharmaceutical companies regarding pricing and access to 
medicines, broadening scope of independent reviews for mutual accountability. The 
Programme&#8217;s efforts to design and implement relevant programmes in ways that reflect </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-12555 
</p>
<p>right to development principles and explicitly use a right to health framework were 
welcomed. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria 
</i>49. The Special Programme and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria share a common objective to fight major diseases afflicting the world&#8217;s poorest 
people. Both attempt to improve access to health and equitable development, and their 
procedures are generally participatory and empowering. Elements in the right to 
development criteria, which the task force considered particularly relevant to the work of 
the Global Fund, include equity, meaningful and active participation and the special needs 
of vulnerable and marginalized groups (A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/CRP.1, para. 20).  
50. The impact of the Global Fund on national capacity to control the three diseases was 
especially relevant to the context of Goal 8. Transparency, commitment to good governance 
and sensitivity to human rights concerns were emphasized as characteristics of the Global 
Fund, albeit with some limitations in its programming.  
</p>
<p>51. The Fund programmes are generally consistent with right to development principles, 
although it does not take an explicit rights-based approach. The task force also noted the 
challenges of monitoring mechanisms for mutual accountability. The Fund has a vital role 
to play in developing a more enabling international environment for both health and 
development and contributing to the policy agenda for promoting public health, human 
rights and development.  
</p>
<p><b>  Debt Sustainability  
</b></p>
<p>52. Borrowing under conditions of sustainable debt is an important form of international 
cooperation through which developing countries acquire appropriate means and facilities to 
foster their comprehensive development, pursuant to article 4 of the Right to Development 
Declaration. Target 8-D of Goal 8 calls for the international community to deal 
comprehensively with the debt problems of developing countries through national and 
international measures in order to make debt sustainable in the long term.  
</p>
<p>53. The task force observed that the poverty afflicting least-developed countries is 
exacerbated by an unsustainable debt burden and that the billions of dollars they paid in 
debt servicing obligations divert a large part of scarce resources from crucial programmes 
of education, health and infrastructure, severely limiting prospects for realizing the right to 
development (A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/2, para. 87). A State&#8217;s obligation to service national 
debt must balance national human development and poverty reduction priorities consistent 
with its human rights obligations and the need to maintain the sanctity of contracts in the 
financing system (E/CN.4/2005/WG.18/TF/3, para. 63). 
</p>
<p>54. Heavy debt burdens pose major obstacles for a few low-income developing 
countries in achieving the Goals and meeting obligations on economic, social and cultural 
rights. While debt-relief initiatives contribute to the right to development, debt cancellation 
alone is insufficient, and must be accompanied by enhanced State capacity, governance, 
respect for human rights, promotion of equitable growth and sharing the benefits thereof 
(A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/2, para. 88).  
</p>
<p>55. Debt relief provided by the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the 
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative have resulted in the writing off of more than $117 billion 
of unpayable debt, which clearly contributes to realizing the right to development, 
particularly articles 2 (3), 4 and 8 of the Declaration, by allowing debt service payments to 
be reallocated to stimulate and invest in infrastructure and a range of social purposes, 
assuming required resources are generated domestically or through international 
cooperation (A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/2, para. 89). Further consideration should be given to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12555 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>how this right can be incorporated into development financing mechanisms, in particular 
through increased attention by both lender and borrower to the principles of participation, 
inclusion, transparency, accountability, rule of law, equality and non-discrimination. The 
task force agreed with the Bretton Woods Institutions that, while debt relief frees up 
resources that can be used for development objectives, it needs to be complemented by 
additional financing if the Goals are to be reached (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2, para. 52).  
</p><p>56. Giving developing countries greater voice and representation and improving 
democratization, transparency and accountability of international financial institutions 
would help realize the right to development. Policies of these institutions are determined by 
the same States that have committed elsewhere to the right to development (as well as to 
legally-binding obligations on economic, social and cultural rights) and therefore have 
shared responsibility for acting in the global financial system in accordance with the right 
to development (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2, para. 64). 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Transfer of technology 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Development Agenda of the World Intellectual Property Organization 
</i>57. The assessment of the Development Agenda of the World Intellectual Property 
Organization (WIPO) highlighted the significant connections between intellectual property 
rights and the right to development. Comprising 45 recommendations, the agenda, adopted 
in 2007, is a key contemporary global initiative towards realizing the right to development. 
Intellectual property is a policy tool serving the important public and developmental 
purpose of providing incentives for investing in new technology. But it can also have a 
negative consequence on the diffusion of technology, since the temporary monopoly it 
creates can restrict the sharing of the benefits of technology. The Development Agenda 
does not include any reference to human rights or the right to development, but contains 
many provisions that could respond to the imperatives of this right. The task force supports 
the recommendation of the agenda, that intellectual property policies be considered within 
the context of national economic and social development priorities; that close cooperation 
be sought with other United Nations agencies involved in the development dimensions of 
intellectual property (in particular the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development (UNCTAD), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), WHO, 
the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the United Nations 
Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and other relevant international 
organizations, especially WTO); 5 and that advice be provided on the use of flexibilities in 
the Agreement on TRIPS.6 These factors are crucial to a comprehensive and human-centred 
development approach. The agenda also includes provisions for the protection of traditional 
knowledge and folklore, transparency, participation and accountability. 
</p>
<p>58. Implementation of the Development Agenda is in its initial stage. Towards 
implementation consistent with the right to development, the task force recommends 
greater attention to policy research, to develop innovative approaches to mainstream 
development objectives into intellectual property policy rather than simple transfer of 
intellectual property systems to developing countries; greater collaboration with 
development agencies, especially those of the United Nations system and civil society; and 
the development of a monitoring and evaluation system. The task force reiterates the 
importance of the implementation of article 66.2 of the TRIPS agreement, which is one of

</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.10-12555 
</p>
<p>the few legal obligations on developed countries to establish incentives for technology 
transfer to least developed countries. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Clean Development Mechanism  
</i>59. The task force recognized the value of the Clean Development Mechanism to the 
climate change dimension of the right to development and for target 8-F of Goal 8 insofar 
as the transfer of green technology can enhance the prospects for sustainable development 
in developing countries. Although there is no specific reference to human rights in this 
Mechanism, from a rights-based approach, it includes elements of equity, participation, 
empowerment and sustainability, which all underscore its relevance to promoting the right 
to development and importance of close monitoring of these elements to ensure that it 
makes a positive contribution to this right (A/HRC/12/WG.2/TF/2, paras. 83 and 85). 
60. The criticisms levelled against the mechanism in literature include its emphasis on 
emissions reductions without preventing or minimizing the negative impact on human 
rights of peoples and communities and inequitable distribution of mechanism projects to 
only a few developing countries like Brazil, China and India, reflecting the direction of 
foreign direct investment flows (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2, para. 39). The decision on the 
mechanism made at the Copenhagen meeting of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol also 
introduced steps to promote equitable distribution, although further training and capacity-
building activities in developing countries are required. Some mechanism projects do not 
generate real emissions reductions. Other shortcomings from the right to development 
perspective include increasing delays in the rigorous approval process and lack of 
transparency, equity, non-discrimination, participation and accountability, although several 
measures had recently been taken to improve the methodology and approval process, 
including steps to enhance transparency. As a market mechanism, it has been more 
effective in reducing mitigation costs than contributing to sustainable development and 
green technology transfer. 
</p>
<p>61. Some human rights concerns could be addressed when adopting greenhouse gas 
mitigation and climate change adaptation measures, for example, through environmental 
and social impact assessments on outcomes of mechanism projects and a more transparent 
and participatory process through better communication with stakeholders and providing 
affected stakeholders with the possibility of recourse where required procedures have not 
been properly followed or outcomes violate the human rights of communities.  
</p>
<p>62. Despite the criticisms, the mechanism remains important for greenhouse gas 
mitigation and promoting sustainable development and technology transfer. It should be 
reinforced by enhancing its effectiveness, ensuring its social and environmental integrity, 
and incorporating a right to development perspective. Negotiations for a new climate 
change agreement in Mexico in 2010 will provide an opportunity to include such right to 
development components into the mechanism.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations: from political 
commitment to development practice 
</b></p>
<p>63. The essential message of the above consolidated findings of the task force is that, 
while only Member States can move the right to development from political commitment to 
development practice, we, in our capacity as experts, can draw relevant lessons for the 
international community from detailed examination of how this right is considered by 
numerous actors and processes of development. The lessons we have drawn relate to the 
strengths and weaknesses of the Millennium Development Goals, structural impediments to 
economic justice, the resistance to addressing trade and lending from a right to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12555 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>development perspective, the imperative and pitfalls of measurement tools, the ambiguity 
of &#8220;global partnership&#8221;, the lack of policy coherence and incentives to move from 
commitment to practice, and the necessary balance between national and international 
responsibilities. These reflections provide the rationale for the suggestions for future work 
contained in the report on the sixth session of the task force (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2, paras. 
74&#8211;88). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Strengths and weaknesses of the Millennium Development Goals 
</b></p>
<p>64. It has been frequently noted that, even before the current global financial crisis, the 
Millennium Development Goals were not likely to be realized, especially in sub-Saharan 
Africa. Nevertheless, from the right to development perspective, the mobilization of 
resources and the political commitment of United Nations agencies and Governments was a 
positive development in priority setting, indirectly relevant to the right to development but 
formally delinked from the Millennium Summit commitment to &#8220;making the right to 
development a reality for all&#8221;. It can be argued that the existence of poverty on the scale we 
know it today is a flagrant violation of the right to development. A breakdown of the Goals 
into sectoral targets is consistent with the underlying approach of the right to development 
to acknowledge that poverty is a broader concept than not having enough income and 
requires, as stated in article 8 of the Declaration on the Right to Development: &#8220;equality of 
opportunity for all in their access to basic resources, education, health services, food, 
housing, employment and the fair distribution of income&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>65. The task force is also aware that the Goals are divorced from a human rights 
framework. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has drawn attention 
to this gap and focused on their interrelationship by disseminating charts on the 
intersection, and published an exhaustive analysis on how human rights can contribute to 
the Goals, as has the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
(E/CN.4/2004/23/Add.1). The task force completes its task as Member States and 
international agencies are reviewing the entire architecture of the Goals, specifically at the 
high-level meeting in September 2010 to review progress towards them as well as other 
international development goals. This seems a propitious occasion for the Working Group 
to introduce concerns expressed by the task force and to ensure that the new structure for 
focused attention to meeting the most urgent needs of developing countries is more 
consistent with the right to development. 
</p>
<p>66. The tension between macroeconomic goals and human rights cannot be resolved, 
however, by a general commitment to moderating certain policies it requires a partnership 
of the type envisaged by Goal 8. The task force shares the view &#8220;that slow action on key 
initiatives in the areas of aid, trade and debt will seriously reduce the likelihood of 
achieving the MDGs by 2015&#8221; and &#8220;continued inaction in these crucial areas of MDG 8 
which impact on the possibility of achieving the other seven MDGs for most developing 
countries also casts doubt on the seriousness with which developed nations are addressing 
the global partnership embodied in MDG 8 and its inherent notion of mutual accountability 
and joint responsibility&#8221;.7 Mutual accountability and joint responsibility are at the heart of 
the right to development, and the shortcomings in the Goals from the right to development 
perspective should be addressed in the new architecture to emerge from the September 
meeting.

</p>
<p><b> B. Structural impediments to economic justice  
</b>67. The concern of the right to development with structural impediments to equitable 
development on the global scale is frequently interpreted as a push from the &#8220;South&#8221; for 
transfer of resources from the &#8220;North&#8221;, often as aid flows. Failure to meet the objective of 
0.7 per cent of gross national income devoted to official development assistance is 
frequently a proxy for failure to realize the right to development. These perceptions are 
misguided. Firstly, OECD countries are concerned about structural impediments to 
development in the context of negotiated modifications of the rules governing trade, foreign 
direct investment, migration and intellectual property, as well as in decisions affecting the 
flow of capital and labour. Their active participation in &#8220;development agendas&#8221; bears 
witness to this shared concern. However, the stalemate of the Doha &#8220;development&#8221; round of 
trade negotiations is also evidence of the limits of this commitment. The right to 
development suffers profoundly from the entrenched positions of parties to negotiations on 
development agendas. Formal commitment to the right to development cannot by itself 
move these negotiations to a mutually beneficial outcome.  
</p>
<p>68. Along with shared commitment, the promise of the right to development depends on 
an honest assessment of the approach taken to aid effectiveness. The task force welcomed 
the statement in the Accra Agenda for Action of recognition, that &#8220;gender equality, respect 
for human rights, and environmental sustainability are cornerstones for achieving enduring 
impact on the lives and potential of poor women, men, and children. It is vital that all our 
policies address these issues in a more systematic and coherent way&#8221; (see also paragraph 27 
above). Realizing the right to development requires a systematic rethinking of aid 
effectiveness in the light of all policy implications of that statement. 
</p>
<p>69. Aid is a relatively small part of development; it has not placed recipient societies on 
a sustainable path of development and some even argue that it has done more harm than 
good.8 Goal 8 calls for &#8220;more generous official development assistance for countries 
committed to poverty reduction&#8221; the Millennium Project assumed a major role for aid,9 as 
does the Gap Task Force.10 The reference in the Declaration on the Right to Development 
to providing developing countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their 
comprehensive development (art. 4) strongly supports the argument for increased aid. 
While acknowledging the limitations of aid, the task force stresses the importance of donor 
States keeping their commitments in the Doha Round, Monterrey Consensus, Gleneagles 
G-8 summit and London G-20 summit to increase assistance. The task force shares the 
conviction of the Accra summit, that country ownership is a key factor. The declaration 
defines the appropriate national development policies, which States have the right and the 
duty to formulate, namely those &#8220;that aim at the constant improvement of the well-being of 
the entire population and of all individuals, on the basis of their active, free and meaningful 
participation in development and in the fair distribution of the benefits resulting therefrom 
(art. 2). Furthermore, &#8220;States should take steps to eliminate obstacles to development 
resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights, as well as economic, social and

<p>cultural rights&#8221; (art. 6). The implications of these norms for country ownership and &#8220;policy 
space&#8221; have not been adequately explored. They mean, at least, that a high level of 
responsibility falls on developing countries to ensure that they pursue policies consistent 
with the right to development and that they should be entitled to more international 
cooperation and assistance to the extent that their policies and practices reflect that 
responsibility. This interpretation should not be misconstrued as favouring &#8220;conditionality&#8221;, 
but that progress in implementing this right depends on shared responsibilities by donor and 
developing countries. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Resistance to addressing trade and debt from a human rights 
perspective 
</b></p>
<p>70. The active participation of WTO in the work of the task force, and of UNCTAD as a 
fully participating institutional member, assisted considerably in grappling with this issue. 
However, it must also be acknowledged that the task force was never asked to examine the 
principal institutional framework for an open trading system, WTO. Furthermore, the 
encouragement of the European Commission to engage the task force in examining the 
Cotonou Agreement and economic partnership agreements was not sustained, and the initial 
interest of countries in the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) was not followed 
by a formal invitation to include that partnership. Similarly, on the issue of debt, the active 
and highly appreciated participation of the Bretton Woods institutions as institutional 
members, especially in taking responsibility for organizing a special meeting of the task 
force on debt (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2, paras. 49&#8211;64), including personal involvement of the 
directors of relevant divisions at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, 
were valuable for the task force to collect information but not to pilot-test criteria. On the 
other hand, the World Bank suggested, but the Working Group did not accept, that the task 
force evaluate the Africa Action Plan, a comprehensive strategic framework addressing aid, 
trade, debt relief and role of non-State actors supporting the development of the continent&#8217;s 
poorest countries (A/HRC/4/47, para. 27 and A/HRC/4/WG.2/TF/2, paras. 86&#8211;87). 
Similarly, the task force considered the Inter-American Development Bank, which also 
deals with debt, regional integration, human development and the environment. However, 
no explicit tasks were assigned. 
</p>
<p>71. There are no doubt good reasons for European Community and African, Caribbean 
and Pacific countries, MERCOSUR countries, the Inter-American Development Bank, 
WTO and international financial institutions to assist the task force in ways other than a 
dialogue on the application of right to development criteria to their own policies. The task 
force was frequently reminded of the legal constraints limiting potential for deeper 
involvement from these institutions. Such resistance did not arise with the access to 
medicines and transfer of technology institutions. 
</p>
<p>72. It is in the nature of the right to development that the issues addressed touch on all 
aspects of the global economy and domestic policy that affect development and the constant 
improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals. This 
imperative is not without tension, and resistance is inevitable from global and regional 
institutions created for purposes other than human rights, and national Government officials 
whose policies and practices would be subject to scrutiny. The Working Group will have to 
deal with this reality in its effort to ensure an impact of the right to development on 
development practice. Whether in the form of guidelines or a binding international legal 
document, monitoring is essential, and resistance (apart from some exceptions) will be an 
obstruction to implementation mechanisms for the right to development. </p>

<p><b> D. Imperative and pitfalls of measurement of progress 
</b></p>
<p>73. In its report (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.2), the task force explains the evolution of 
its efforts to develop tools for the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of progress in 
implementing the right to development. Some Governments are apprehensive about 
&#8220;indicators&#8221;, presumably concerned that domestic actions, which are the prerogative of the 
State, will be judged by others. As explained, the development of indicators was not an 
exercise in ranking or even judging countries, but rather in providing to the Working Group 
operational sub-criteria in the form of a set of methodologically rigorous tools that can be 
used in determining where progress is occurring or stalling, and the next steps for 
promoting implementation of the right to development.  
</p>
<p>74. It is also important to underscore the limits of measurement. Undue expectations 
must not be placed on indicators and benchmarks, especially if they are to lead to 
guidelines or a legally-binding standard. Any use of such indicators must be rigorous and 
strike a balance between selectivity and comprehensiveness, usability and attaining a 
complete representation of all obligations inherent in the right to development. The task 
force does not purport to provide a complete description of all obligations and entitlements 
entailed by this right, but rather an illustrative set of examples on which the Working Group 
can build. 
</p>
<p>75. The tools of measurement serve two major purposes. First, they open the way for a 
monitoring mechanism, informal or treaty-based. The decision regarding the preferred basis 
for monitoring depends on the political decisions of Governments. However, the right to 
development cannot be useful to alter approaches to development unless and until the 
actions of those responsible for development are assessed using professionally crafted tools 
of measurement. This is true for all development parameters, and having tools is the first 
step when responding to the legitimate question from development practitioners: &#8220;What do 
you want us to do differently?&#8221; Unless criteria and sub-criteria answer that question, the 
right to development is not likely to advance in the field. Second, Governments have 
affirmed that the right to development must be treated on a par with other human rights. 
Other human rights, in the practice of treaty bodies monitoring them, are assessed using 
indicators. Unless the right to development is subject to assessment using indicators, it will 
not be on a par with other human rights. A similar argument applies to including this right 
in the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Ambiguity of &#8220;global partnership&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Working Group requested the task force to focus mostly on the global 
partnership for development, as used in Goal 8, which is an ambiguous concept. The task 
force interpreted it to mean treaty regimes, arrangements and commitments, multi-
stakeholder strategies and mechanisms, and multilateral institutions that epitomize global or 
regional efforts to address Goal 8 issues. None of these was established as a direct 
consequence of commitment to Goal 8, but tend to see themselves as contributing to that 
Goal. None has a mandate to promote the right to development. Nevertheless, they are 
among the array of right to development stakeholders and have sometimes acknowledged 
that this right is pertinent, but have more commonly considered it a matter of inter-agency 
information sharing rather than policy guidance.  
</p>
<p>77. This selection of putative right to development stakeholders and duty-bearers is the 
result of the Working Group requesting the task force to focus on Goal 8. The task force 
also considered other regional instruments that might be examined (the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations Charter and Arab Charter on Human Rights, containing an explicit 
article on the right to development), but the States concerned considered this to be </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12555 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>premature (A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/2, para. 82). If the full range of pertinent duty-bearers were 
to be considered, the Working Group would need to identify meaningful ways to place 
States in front of their responsibilities towards their own people, persons in other countries 
affected by their policies, and multilateral institutions whose mandates and programmes 
depend on the decisions of their members. The task force has sought to clarify the diverse 
responsibilities of partnerships thus understood in order to engage with stakeholders not 
hitherto part of the dialogue. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Lack of policy coherence and incentives to move from commitment to 
practice 
</b></p>
<p>78. A further complication of the responsibility for the right to development is that 
States have not translated their commitment to this right into their decision-making in these 
partnerships. In all 12 partnerships examined at the request of the Working Group and all 
others considered without an explicit mandate, none referred to the right to development in 
its resolutions or founding documents. It is therefore difficult to expect them to introduce 
right to development considerations as such in their policies and programmes.  
</p>
<p>79. The motivation to introduce right to development concerns cannot be generated 
without incentives. The right may be contrasted with most other strategies for development 
by the lack of incentives to take far-reaching measures based on political and legal 
commitments to it. Where there is a legal commitment, such as in Africa, States parties 
have, generally, not acted in any significant way nor have treaty bodies reported in detail on 
the fulfilment of legal obligations. African Governments do take their commitment to the 
right to development seriously. However, the African Commission on Human and People&#8217;s 
Rights has not taken any significant steps to monitor this right and hold States parties 
accountable, with the notable exception of a very recent landmark decision concerning the 
violation of the right to development as a result of an eviction of an indigenous group from 
a wildlife reserve.11 Institutions with a stake in promoting international cooperation in 
accordance with the right to development have not been able to modify their policies or 
behaviour of their partners in accord with an explicit invocation of it. Many of their 
policies, such as those relating to gender equality and action on behalf of vulnerable 
populations, contribute to the realization of this right but its value alone cannot be 
considered the motivation for such policies and programmes. In other development 
strategies, such as Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, there are clear incentives to comply 
with standards and procedures, often resulting in targeted funding or debt forgiveness. The 
right to development can only be compelling for those who find the principles on which it 
is based to be compelling. The ultimate advantage of respecting this right is a more just 
global and national environment to ensure constant improvement of the well-being of all. 
However, the behaviour of decision-makers in development is rarely determined by the 
compelling value of an idea. This too is a matter that the Working Group should consider 
when determining how to move forward. 
</p>
<p>80. Beyond the power of the concept of an international (moral or legal) obligation to 
pursue development that is comprehensive, human-centred and respectful of human rights,

Peoples&#8217; Rights, February 2010, available from www.minorityrights.org/download.php?id=748. In 
May 2009, the Commission found the Government of Kenya guilty of violating the rights of the 
Endorois, an indigenous community, including their right to development, by evicting them from their 
lands to make way for a wildlife reserve. The African Union approved of the decision at its January 
2010 meeting in Addis Ababa. </p>

</p>
<p>the incentive to take this right seriously should be based on evidence, on the demonstrated 
advantage to be gained by making explicit reference to it in specific development actions 
and policies. The activities reviewed in the consolidated findings above have made the first 
step towards generating such evidence. The task force is firmly convinced that, in spite of 
benign tolerance and even resistance to seeing this right as useful in development practice, 
the more common reaction has been one of acknowledging the congruence between the 
objectives of those policies and the normative content of the right to development. The next 
step is to generate evidence that such altered policies make a positive difference. The task 
force therefore urges the Working Group to consider applying the criteria through context-
specific reporting templates and to collect evidence of the difference, if any, of pro-right to 
development actions, as recommended in the main report.12 
</p>
<p><b> G. Necessary balance between national and international responsibilities 
for the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>81. The final issue the task force wishes to address borders on the political, which is not 
its purview, as an expert body. However, it has examined the history of efforts to bring 
clarity to the concept of the right to development and is acutely aware that balancing the 
national and international dimensions of this right have been front and centre, because each 
dimension is the preference for different groups of States and because the Declaration is 
clear that both dimensions are essential. It is the ardent hope of the task force that these 
dimensions can be seen as complementary rather than conflicting. National policies must be 
supportive of human rights in development and redressing social injustice nationally and 
internationally. Equally, the failure of many nations, especially in Africa, to benefit from 
significant increases in the well-being of their populations is due to the unjust structures of 
the global economy that must be addressed through genuine development agendas, that is, 
negotiated and agreed modifications in terms of trade, investment and aid allowing 
developing countries to overcome the disadvantages of history and draw the full benefit of 
their natural and human resources.  
</p>
<p>82. The greatest challenge that lies ahead in bringing the right to development into the 
realm of practice is for all States to embrace the indivisibility and interdependence of &#8220;all 
the aspects of the right to development&#8221; as set forth in article 9 of the Declaration on the 
Right to Development. Those with political reasons for favouring the international 
dimension and a collective understanding of the right must seek adjustments in their 
national policies and take the individual rights involved seriously. Similarly, those that 
stress that this right is essentially a right of individuals through human rights-based national 
policies must do their part to ensure greater justice in the global political economy by 
agreeing to and achieving outcomes of the various development agendas consistent with the 
affirmation in the Declaration that, &#8220;as a complement to the efforts of developing countries, 
effective international cooperation is essential in providing these countries with appropriate 
means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development&#8221;.
