<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present study is submitted pursuant to paragraph 24 of Human Rights Council 
resolution 19/36, in which the Council requested the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to draft a study on common challenges facing States in 
their efforts to secure democracy and the rule of law from a human rights perspective, and 
on lessons learned and best practices in the engagement of the State with the international 
community to support such processes. Several Member States provided input and their 
views are reflected in the study. 
</p>
<p> The study concludes that securing democracy is a continuous exercise. Challenges 
to democracy can arise in both settled democracies and States transitioning towards 
democracy. Human rights and the rule of law can be endangered in both contexts in 
different ways. These challenges can be manifested by the absence, interruption, or 
abridgement of democratic rules and processes. Democracy is rendered insecure by 
encroachments on human rights, the lack of empowerment opportunities for all, limits to 
participation, and poor or absent public debate. More profoundly, democracy is challenged 
at the political, security and social levels, domestically and globally, by weak or 
dysfunctional institutions, the erosion of the rule of law, poor leadership, violence, 
sectarianism, radicalism, extremism, terrorism, intolerance, corruption and impunity.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 23 March 2012, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 19/36, in which it 
acknowledged that by promoting the normative content and the realization of the human 
rights enshrined in various international instruments, it could play a role in developing and 
promoting the fulfilment of the principles, norms and standards that constituted the basis of 
democracy and the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>2. The present study is submitted in accordance with paragraph 24 of the above-
mentioned resolution, in which the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) was requested to, in consultation with States, national human 
rights institutions, civil society, relevant intergovernmental bodies and international 
organizations, draft a study on common challenges facing States in their efforts to secure 
democracy and the rule of law from a human rights perspective, and on lessons learned and 
best practices in the engagement of the State with the international community to support 
such processes. 
</p>
<p>3. By note verbale dated 11 July 2012, OHCHR invited all Member States, relevant 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and national human rights 
institutions to provide OHCHR with pertinent information relating to the challenges, 
lessons learned and best practices referred to in paragraph 24 of the resolution. The 
responses received by OHCHR1 are summarized under section VI below.  
</p>
<p>4. The study is set against the normative framework provided under international law. 
This framework was explored in an expert seminar on democracy and the rule of law held 
by OHCHR in 2005. The seminar identified the main challenges to democracy as including 
deepening poverty, worsened human security, infringements of rights, erosion of the rule of 
law, escalation of armed conflicts, illegal occupations involving the use of force, unequal 
access to justice by disadvantaged groups, and impunity.2  
</p>
<p>5. While reaffirming the aforementioned findings, the study endeavors to contribute 
further to the promotion and strengthening of the interdependence of human rights, 
democracy and the rule of law by examining more specifically the nature of common 
challenges faced by States in their efforts to secure democracy. It tackles the complexity of 
the concept of democracy, identifying its different dimensions and restating its definition 
from the human rights perspective. It is argued that, transcending important historically 
informed specificities, the concept of democracy is demonstrably universal. Following the 
analysis of the centrality of the rule of law and of human rights to democracy as a system of 
governance, and to democratization as a process, the study sheds light on the most common 
political, security, and social challenges to securing democracy. It highlights the 
components of a viable, albeit often fragile process of transition towards democracy, and 
the role of State and non-State actors. The study concludes with lessons learned and best 
</p>
<p>  
 1 As at 15 November 2012, responses to the note verbale had been received from 16 Member States 
</p>
<p>(Austria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Japan, Jordan, 
Mauritius, Montenegro, Qatar, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland) and 
from the Human Rights Commission of Mexico. Owing to the late transmission of the response 
received from the Russian Federation, its translation was not available for incorporation in the study 
at the time of submission for publication. 
</p>
<p> 2 The seminar was designed to promote an analytical approach leading towards practical and action-
oriented conclusions on the subject of democracy and the rule of law. The complete list of 
conclusions and recommendations is included in the report of the seminar (E/CN.4/2005/58, paras. 
26-85). </p>


<p>practices drawn from national experiences and international and regional cooperation for 
the promotion of democracy and the rule of law.  
</p>
<p><b> II. The concept of democracy 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Definition 
</b></p>
<p>6. Although all civilizations feature different forms of democracy, the concept is a 
disputed one and there exists a multiplicity of perspectives in understanding its content. The 
lack of unanimity about the concept of democracy is not, however, inherently problematic, 
as its contours are identifiable. Etymologically derived from the Greek word <i>demokratia</i>, 
democracy is, in its basic understanding, indicative of a system where the people (<i>demos</i>) 
exercise rule (<i>kratos</i>). This original dimension captures the fundamental characteristic of 
democracy, the rule of the many&#8212;as opposed to non-democratic systems such as autocracy 
(the rule of one), oligarchy (the rule of the few) and aristocracy (the rule of &#8213;the best&#8214;)&#8212;but 
it does not fully account for the breadth of the notion, in particular the mechanics of such 
exercise of power and their societal articulation. 
</p>
<p>7. In addition to opposition to tyranny, three elements characterize the understanding 
and the practice of democracy. First, democracy is an institutional arrangement relied upon 
for arrival at political decisions in which citizens hold power through elections. Second, 
democracy is a system of governance in which rulers are held accountable for their actions 
in the public realm by citizens acting indirectly through the competition and cooperation of 
their representatives. Third, democracy is a political norm predicated upon equality and 
justice.3 
</p>
<p>8. These elements were broadly captured by the former Commission on Human Rights 
in a landmark resolution (2002/46), further developed by the Human Rights Council in 
resolution 19/36, in which the Council stated that democracy includes respect for all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, freedom of association and of peaceful 
assembly, freedom of expression and opinion, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or 
belief, the right to be recognized everywhere as a person before the law and the right to take 
part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives, to 
vote in a pluralistic system of political parties and organizations and to be elected at 
genuine, periodic, free and fair elections by universal and equal suffrage and by secret 
ballot guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the people, as well as respect for the 
rule of law, the separation of powers, the independence of the judiciary, transparency and 
accountability in public administration and decision-making and free, independent and 
pluralistic media. 
</p>
<p>9. This definition illustrates the fact that democracy is not confined to the organization 
of democratic elections, however central those are to it. Citizens must control the political 
process continuously, beyond the electoral moment. Moreover, democracy is not solely the 
articulation of popular sovereignty (government of the people, by the people and for the 
people) but also encompasses values of responsibility and accountability. 
</p>
<p>  
 3 These three elements appear variously throughout the literature on democracy. See, notably, Joseph 
</p>
<p>Schumpeter, <i>Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</i> (New York, Harper and Brothers, 1942); Philippe 
Schmitter and Terry Lynn Karl, &#8213;What democracy is &#8230; and is not&#8214;, <i>Journal of Democracy</i>, vol. 2, 
No. 3 (1991), pp. 75-88; and David Held, <i>Models of Democracy</i>, 2nd ed. (Stanford, California, 
Stanford University Press, 1996), p. 2. </p>


<p>10. Furthermore, democracy infers a type of behavior or performance which is 
necessary for its formal integration, safeguarding and sustainability, and which is essential 
for (a) the protection of institutions, (b) the accountability of power-holders and (c) the 
respect and protection of the rule of law and human rights. Such performance is a 
determining factor in the quality of any transitional process as an open-ended attempt at the 
realization of democracy. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Universality of the concept, and diversity of mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Universality of the concept 
</b></p>
<p>11. There is no preeminent tradition of democracy that imposes itself on others. 
Democracy is not linked to one specific cultural context more than another. However, while 
the values of democracy are similar, their expression can differ according to specific 
contexts. It is the conditions prevalent in a given context that qualify it as more democratic 
than another. Hence, the strengthening of local democratic infrastructures reinforces the 
global advance of democracy. Ultimately, democracy is stronger and more resilient when it 
is grounded in legitimate, representative and fair mechanisms of sociopolitical interaction.  
</p>
<p>12. Narrow interpretations of democracy, such as those confining it to a procedural 
concept irrespective of its context, do not reflect adequately its inherently universal 
dimensions. If, in effect, the practice of democracy can and indeed should be 
contextualized, its core values are demonstrably universal, and this universality is best 
encapsulated in the fact that everywhere around the world, people demand respect for their 
rights and this demand is ultimately best accomplished in a state of democracy respectful of 
the rule of law.  
</p>
<p>13. Participants at the third International Conference of New or Restored Democracies, 
held in Bucharest in 1997, noted that there was &#8213;an almost universal recognition that a 
democratic system of government is the best model to ensure a framework of liberties&#8214;.4 
The majority of States have adhered to the international instruments that establish the 
values of democracy, including in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Diversity of mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p>14. The mechanisms adopted to give practical meaning to the principles of democracy 
come in different guises. As noted by the Secretary-General, democracy is not a model to 
be copied from certain States, but a goal to be attained by all peoples and assimilated by all 
cultures. It may take many forms, depending on the characteristics and circumstances of 
societies (A/50/332, para. 5). 
</p>
<p>15. Checks and balances mechanisms are necessary to give substance to democracy and 
exercise proper control. Holding free and fair elections, administering transparent rules and 
effective regulations, teasing out participatory dynamics and protecting and promoting 
rights and freedoms, all of which governed by the rule of law, constitute a complex set of 
activities that require the effective establishment and functioning of self-sustaining 
institutions. 
</p>
<p>  
 4 Note verbale dated 10 September 1997 from the Permanent Representative of Romania to the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, addressed to the Secretary General (A/52/334, appendix, p. 3). </p>


<p>16. Non-institutional actors can also play a useful role in furthering democracy. For 
example, while traditional leadership may have non-representative features, some 
traditional authorities have provided an important basis for promoting democratic 
governance through consensus-based mechanisms. When available, the legitimacy of those 
arrangements proceeds from their harmonious relationship with their traditional community 
and their social environment.  
</p>
<p><b> III. The imperatives of the rule of law and human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Interdependence of human rights, democracy and the rule of law  
</b></p>
<p>17. In 1993, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World 
Conference on Human Rights stated that democracy, development and respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, and that the 
international community should support the strengthening and promoting of democracy, 
development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the entire world.5 
Furthermore, the former Commission on Human Rights adopted a series of resolutions 
between 1999 and 2005 re-emphasizing the interconnection among democracy, human 
rights, development and the rule of law.  
</p>
<p>18. Almost 20 years after the World Conference on Human Rights, the Human Rights 
Council affirmed in resolution 19/36 that democracy is vital for the promotion and 
protection of all human rights (para. 4), stressing that States are guarantors of democracy, 
human rights, good governance and the rule of law, and bear responsibility for their full 
implementation (para. 12). 
</p>
<p>19. As demonstrated in the above-mentioned 2005 expert seminar,6 the indivisibility of 
human rights and the interdependence of human rights and the rule of law are core 
components of democracy as a concept and as a practice. 
</p>
<p>20. The primacy of the law ensures the legitimacy of power holders and that of a system 
of governance adhered to by all. The interlinkage between human rights and the rule of law 
broadens the observance of democratic values. In established democracies, the legal 
authority to govern and to exercise power is subject to compliance with the fundamental 
principles of the rule of law as well as to respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms. 
</p>
<p>21. The interdependence between democracy and human rights is established in several 
international human rights instruments, notably the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provide that (a) 
everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through 
freely chosen representatives; (b) everyone has the right of equal access to public service in 
his country; (c) the will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this 
will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and 
equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures 
(art. 21). 
</p>
<p>22. The Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 25 (1996), stresses 
further this interdependence by demonstrating that article 25 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, which recognizes and protects the right of every citizen to 
</p>
<p>  
 5 Para. 8.  
 6 See para. 4. </p>


<p>take part in the conduct of public affairs, the right to vote and to be elected and to have 
access to public service, is inherently tied to other key rights and democratic principles, 
such as the right to freedom of expression (para. 12), non-discrimination (para. 3), and 
accountability (para. 9). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Effectiveness of the rule of law and human rights as democratic 
</b></p>
<p><b>benchmarks 
</b></p>
<p>23. The rule of law is anchored in a system of government aimed at establishing 
equality, limiting control and ensuring liberty. Such representative government is 
envisioned as producing a just social model with positive freedoms so that the principle of 
legality is itself an element of democracy.7 
</p>
<p>24. Thus, the principles of the rule of law, including the supremacy of the law, the 
independence and impartiality of the judiciary, legal certainty, equality, non-discrimination, 
the separation of powers, transparency and accountability are inseparable from those of a 
functioning democratic order. 
</p>
<p>25. Democracy constitutes a natural environment for the protection, promotion and 
effective realization of human rights and the achievement of justice. An objective 
assessment of the level of respect for human rights and the rule of law enables a proper 
evaluation of the state of democracy in a given country. In particular, evidence of access to 
and participation in public affairs and the expression of the people&#8217;s sovereign choice 
provide tangible indications of respect for democratic values and the effectiveness of 
governance institutions under a democratic order. 
</p>
<p>26. Respect for the rule of law and human rights is also illustrative of respect for the 
expression of the people&#8217;s will as the legitimate source of authority. In this context, all 
human rights, including civil, political or economic, social and cultural rights, should be 
granted the same level of relevance and legal protection. In parallel, compliance with the 
rule of law provides the most effective safeguards against bias, selectivity, arbitrariness and 
abuse of power. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Challenges to the securing of democracy 
</b></p>
<p>27. In recent decades, the world has witnessed a steady and increasing drive towards 
democracy. The number of democracies or countries in transition towards democracy has 
been on the rise in Southwestern Europe, Latin and Central America, Asia and the Pacific, 
Eastern and Central Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa. 
Throughout the post-cold-war, post-September 11, and post-Arab Spring eras, transitional 
processes have been underwritten by a continuous effort to secure democracy or 
democratization. The quantitative expansion of democracy and its contemporary centrality 
in global politics have not, however, brought an end to the threats that can endanger both 
nascent and established democracies. 
</p>
<p>28. The elements essential to democracy noted above can be challenged in these two 
contexts. The most salient features of democratic deficits are those caused by institutional 
impediments to democratic practice, deliberate encroachments on freedoms, limits to 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Electoral, 2001), p. 10. </p>


<p>citizen participation, poor or absent public debate, lack of effective empowerment policies 
and access to justice, and unconstitutional access to power or change of government. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Political and security challenges 
</b></p>
<p>29. Weak or dysfunctional institutions are among the most serious challenges to 
democracy. As highlighted above, democracy does not need to follow a uniform pattern. It 
requires political commitment based on respect for human rights and institutional 
compliance with the principles of the rule of law. Such interaction and cooperation can be 
disrupted if all contending forces do not agree to work hand in hand. 
</p>
<p>30. Continuously weakened institutions can collapse, leading to the breakdown of State 
order. Among the primary generators of disruption are: an autocratic executive, an 
inefficient or non-accountable Parliament, attempts to manipulate the constitutional order 
and the outcome of elections, a military subservient to political interest instead of national 
security, and the corrosive effects of corruption. The vacuum of authority is another serious 
challenge for democracy and democratization.  
</p>
<p>31. Unremitting societal engagement is indispensable to fend off disruption and reversal 
of democracy. It also allows the community to keep at bay &#8213;dictatorship nostalgia&#8214; and 
temptations to step beyond the rule of law (lynching, vigilante groups). Ultimately, there 
exists an &#8213;ever-present connection between the security of persons and democratic 
coexistence&#8214;.8 
</p>
<p>32. Globalization can also constitute a threat to democracy if States&#8217; ability to control 
the management of their resources, environment and economics is constantly challenged. 
Similarly, the transnational nature of some prevailing security challenges, such as armed 
groups operating across several countries, increases the threat on States&#8217; political stability. 
In recent years, this element has taken on a new dimension relating to the increase of 
transnational terrorism whereby armed groups moving across boundaries represent serious 
challenges for national, regional and global security. States&#8217; responses to such threats must 
be calibrated to avoid a further weakening of democracy. The post-September 11 era 
witnessed several examples of infringements of human rights and erosions of the rule of 
law in the context of countering terrorism. In this respect, it is particularly important to 
stress that human rights may be limited only by law and to such an extent necessary to meet 
the purpose for which the limitation is allowed in an open and democratic society.  
</p><p>33. Violence is a major challenge to democracy. The responsibility of States to prevent 
or contain violence is paramount before, during and after a political transition. In 
addressing violence, they should tackle its proximate and deeper causalities as well as its 
local, national and international dimensions. The institutionalization of strategic peace 
processes in conflict and post-conflict societies has a significant effect on both the 
prevention and management of violence in order to protect human rights under the rule of 
law. 
</p>
<p>34. Violence can also erupt when the introduction of democracy challenges the 
foundations of a pre-existing undemocratic political order. Transitions to democracy are 
inherently disorderly and multifaceted. Specifically, during transitions, members of the 
former State apparatus may attempt to regain power. Within this context, the peaceful

www.cidh.org/pdf%20files/SEGURIDAD%20CIUDADANA%202009%20ENG.pdf. </p>


<p>resolution of conflicts may be particularly challenging for the newly established State 
institutions.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Social and economic challenges 
</b></p>
<p>35. Growing inequalities represent a particularly acute challenge to democracy, as they 
render formal democracy devoid of meaning for destitute citizens. The persistence of 
poverty and dispossession are a continuous threat to democracy,9 stripping people of their 
right to determine their future; a weakening of the social fabric can result.10 
</p>
<p>36. Corruption, in all its forms, also constitutes a major impediment to democratic 
advance. It can harm democratic values, erode the fabric of society, circumvent the rule of 
law and lead to violations of human rights. In reinforcing accountability, the preventative 
and protective roles of democratic laws and institutions strengthen the fight against 
corruption and impunity and consolidate the promotion of the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>37. Another social challenge to democracy is disenchantment, which can occur in both 
young and old democracies. In young ones, it is often triggered by the deterioration of 
economic and security conditions during transitions. With unrealistic expectations of 
immediate progress unmet, the people can also be dismayed by the staccato entry of new 
voices, views, agents and ideas. This cumulative disruptive phenomenon could result in 
exclusionary attitudes and politics. 
</p>
<p>38. In established democracies, challenges can take different forms. Citizens deprived of 
their freedom of expression and the right to voice opposition to political decisions are, in 
effect, deprived from exercising their right to sovereign deliberation and decision-making. 
Under these conditions, democracy is rendered insecure.   
</p>
<p>39. In her speech at the Bali Democracy Forum held in November 2012, the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights emphasized that &#8213;democratic global governance can also 
be undermined at the national level, by measures that restrict and even punish freedom of 
expression, the right to receive and impart information, the right to peaceful assembly and 
the right to freedom of association&#8214;, and that &#8213;when we talk about participation, some 
groups of society merit specific attention and inclusion. In this regard, empowerment of 
groups which have been excluded or marginalized &#8230; and their full participation in 
decision-making processes are fundamental for the achievement of equality, development 
and peace&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>40. Democracy is no panacea and democratization is not a miraculous answer to all the 
societal expectations for prosperity. Increased disenchantment can become a catalyst for the 
emergence of detrimental social phenomena, such as radicalization, exclusion, racism, 
discrimination, xenophobia and the stigmatization of non-citizens. 
</p>
<p>41. In such a context, human rights education, an independent and pluralist media, and 
efficient national human rights institutions are fundamental to securing democracy. 
Guarantees for the freedom of expression and opinion are important, yet the challenges for 
journalists and other media professionals are manifold. They include, notably, censorship 
and the concentration of media ownership.11

<p><b> V. The process of transition to democracy 
</b></p>
<p>42. Just as the concept of democracy encompasses a variety of traditions, the routes to 
democracy are variegated. Used interchangeably, the terms &#8213;transition to democracy&#8214;, 
</p>
<p>&#8213;political liberalization&#8214; and &#8213;democratization&#8214; refer to a political process. The departure 
from a repressive State to a democratic one and the improvement of existing democratic 
systems invariably will entail facing obstacles. At the same time, transitions are a deliberate 
course of sequential societal transformation and this allows for the proper integration and 
enforcement of the normative values of human rights and the rule of law.  
</p>
<p><b> A. From protest to transition 
</b></p>
<p>43. The congruence among democracy, human rights and the rule of law is, importantly, 
manifested when a society expresses its shared sense of nationhood in the context of an 
uprising meant to achieve democracy. Such a key shift away from the monopolization of 
power revolves around the adoption of institutions suited for democratic advance. 
</p>
<p>44. Social volatility and unrest are major impediments to the securing of democracy. 
There is an important correlation between national unity and the viability of transition. Of 
the many prerequisites of democracy, this one seems overriding.12 
</p>
<p>45. The expansion of political and electoral competition to facilitate participation is, in 
that regard, a formative challenge. This was, for instance, the case during the Spanish 
transition in the 1970s.13 Democracy is an integrative process and the opening of electoral 
competition during the early phase of a transition is a sine qua non condition of a proper 
democratization project. 
</p>
<p>46. A second incipient challenge concerns the dismantling of the structure of a former 
authoritarian regime. This is particularly sensitive as regards the role of armed forces. As 
the State must retain the legitimate exercise and control over its national forces, the 
successful dismantlement of the old order (e.g., disbanding party militias) is an arduous 
task whose consequences can be disruptive if not properly planned. 
</p>
<p>47. A third challenge is linked to the need to engage in redistribution of political power 
with a view to secure effective government underwritten by the rule of law and human 
rights. This is achieved through constitutional reform. The introduction of laws legalizing 
political association and the recognition of political pluralism are central to this exercise. 
The principle of separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial 
branches must be codified constitutionally and implemented effectively. 
</p>
<p>48. The quality of a transition process is another challenge in this phase. Regime 
transitions are diverse and do not always lead to democracy as an outcome. While 
democracy is contingent on the respect of rights and freedoms, the enactment of civic 
responsibility, the tolerance of difference, and the sharing of communal burden, 
democratization rests on action based on firm political commitment to achieve its 
objectives.  
</p>
<p>  
 12 This was argued in particular in Dankwart Rustow&#8217;s founding transitology text, &#8213;Transitions to 
</p>
<p>democracy: toward a dynamic model&#8214;, <i>Comparative Politics</i>, vol. 2, No. 3 (April 1970), pp. 337-363. 
 13 See Jos&#233; F&#233;lix Tezanos, Ram&#243;n Cotarelo, and Andr&#233;s de Blas, eds., <i>La Transici&#243;n Democr&#225;tica 
</i></p>
<p><i>Espa&#241;ola</i> (Madrid, Sistema, 1989). </p>


<p><b> B. The role of State and non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p>49. Both State and non-State actors should contribute to the furtherance or slowing 
down of transitions to democracy. A successful or viable transitional process is contingent 
on its anchoring in nationwide reforms to ensure respect for human rights and the rule of 
law. The second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies, held in 
Managua in 1994, noted the structural vulnerability of new democracies. The encumbrance 
of the process by the lack of a credible opposition, weak civil society, weak economies, 
political monopoly by ruling party, potential military intervention, weak democratic 
political culture, and incumbency continuity that precludes regime change, is vexing.14 
</p>
<p>50. Newly elected authorities must address the question of impunity, and ensure 
accountability for serious and systematic violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law involving State and non-State actors, through effective redress and 
remedial strategies. This includes, inter alia, criminal prosecution and national investigation 
commissions. 
</p>
<p>51. Transitional justice, a conception of justice associated with periods of political 
change, characterized by legal responses to confront the wrongdoings of repressive 
predecessor regimes,15 emerges as an imperative to successful transitions to democracy. 
The notion of transitional justice &#8213;comprises the full range of processes and mechanisms 
</p>
<p>associated with a society&#8217;s attempts to come to terms with a legacy of large-scale past 
abuses, in order to ensure accountability, serve justice and achieve reconciliation. These 
may include both judicial and non-judicial mechanisms, with differing levels of 
international involvement (or none at all) and individual prosecutions, reparations, truth-
seeking, institutional reform, vetting and dismissals, or a combination thereof.&#8214;16 Persons 
unlawfully deprived of liberty or convicted without due process must be granted 
compensation and rehabilitation. The role of an independent and efficient judiciary is 
crucial in this context.  
</p>
<p>52. The empowerment and involvement of civil society in the practice of democracy is 
essential to its good functioning. To facilitate a democratic transition, civil society 
organizations must actively advocate tolerance, trust and mutual respect. Ultimately, the 
manifold contribution of civil society to democracy can be identified as agenda-setter, 
educator, counterpart of the Government and source of new political alternatives.17 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Lessons learned and best practices 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. National experiences

<p>54. Austria identified corruption as a main obstacle to the realization of the rule of law. 
Its intensified anti-corruption activities included the creation of the Central Office for the 
Prosecution of Economic Offences and Corruption, with countrywide jurisdiction, and the 
International Anti-Corruption Academy. The Austrian Development Cooperation gives 
priority to combating corruption, which affects governance and development policy. 
Training in human rights, democracy and the rule of law have become mandatory for 
judges and prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>55. Azerbaijan reported on its efforts to build a democratic and secular State respecting 
human rights and the rule of law. They include the establishment of the Institute of Human 
Rights, which investigates the infringement of fundamental freedoms in democratic 
processes; the adoption of the National Action Plan for the Protection of Human Rights; 
and the establishment of the office of the Ombudsman to ensure the protection of national 
minorities, freedom of speech and religious tolerance. Among lasting challenges, 
Azerbaijan noted the protection of the rights of refugees and internally displaced persons, 
the harmonization of national legislation with international human rights standards and the 
adverse effects of corruption.  
</p>
<p>56. Bosnia and Herzegovina reported on the measures adopted at the legislative, judicial 
and administrative levels to remedy inconsistencies in its legal system with the principles of 
international law, that is, with respect to equality before the law, the legal protection of its 
17 national minorities and the elimination of racial discrimination, through the adoption of 
an anti-discrimination law. It noted the importance of the principles of predictability and 
accessibility upheld by the European Court of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>57. Bulgaria reported on national measures to ensure compliance with due legal process 
with regard to lengthy judicial proceedings, the lack of efficient domestic remedies for the 
victims of crimes, and excessive use of force by police forces. Those measures included the 
amendment of the Judiciary System Act to introduce efficient compensatory mechanisms. 
Bulgarian authorities are expected to develop those mechanisms within a reasonable period 
of time.   
</p>
<p>58. The Czech Republic referred to its transitional experience, noting that effective 
support of democracy is a long-term strategic goal, based on partnership with civil society 
and encouraged as a common political commitment through bilateral and multilateral 
diplomacy. The Transition Promotion Programme set up in 2005 recognizes the linkage 
between democracy, the rule of law and human rights as the most effective instrument to 
control, prevent and redress human rights violations. The principles of democratic 
governance, including media freedom, access to information and the empowerment of civil 
society, were given priority in the transition policy.  
</p>
<p>59. Greece reported on the guarantees provided for civil servants under the Code of 
Civil Servants to criticize the action of a superior authority. Lifelong training for civil 
servants, in compliance with their right to continuing education, is an important factor for 
developing staff skills. It contributes to improving the quality and effective functioning of 
public administration and enhances its capacity to combat corruption.  
</p>
<p>60. Japan reported on its international support for democratization, notably through the 
Partnership for Democratic Development. This support includes the development of legal, 
judicial and electoral systems; training programmes for the judiciary, public administrations 
and police officers; women&#8217;s empowerment; and strengthening of civil society. The 
principles guiding the support are partnership with developing countries based on 
consultations and agreement and self-help efforts by the partner country.     
</p>
<p>61. Jordan reported on legislative and practical measures adopted in conformity with 
international human rights standards to ensure the independence of the judiciary and 
military courts, access to justice by all, including minorities, equality before the law, fair </p>


<p>trial and due legal process, equal access of persons with disabilities to public affairs, 
transparency and accountability of public and private institutions, and accountability for 
serious human rights violations, such as torture and honour crimes. Additional measures 
included training for legal professionals and the elaboration of a professional guide to assist 
public prosecutors in investigating torture crimes and protecting the rights of the victims of 
torture and of persons deprived of their liberty. 
</p>
<p>62. Mauritius referred to the principles of constitutionalism and the rule of law, which 
constitute the democratic anchor of its society. These are further ensured by the role of the 
National Human Rights Commission, the National Preventive Mechanism Act, and the 
National Human Rights Action Plan. Access to and administration of justice have been 
improved through professional training for legal practitioners and police officers. 
</p>
<p>63. Montenegro reported on constitutional provisions guaranteeing the protection of 
individual rights and freedoms, the separation of powers and the protection of minority 
groups, prohibiting their forced assimilation. An independent body, the Protector of Human 
Rights and Freedoms, ensures protection for the values of democratic society, in 
cooperation with civil society. A code of ethics was developed to strengthen the 
independence and effectiveness of the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>64. Qatar reported on measures to promote democracy and the rule of law, including the 
elaboration of the new Constitution and the Qatar National Vision 2030. The Constitution 
and laws enacted since 1994 guarantee the protection of human rights and basic democratic 
principles (i.e., equality before the law, the right to fair trial, the independence of the 
judiciary and separation of powers). Several institutions were established to serve the same 
purpose, including the National Human Rights Committee, the Doha International Center 
for Interfaith Dialogue, the Doha Centre for Media Freedom, and the Administrative 
Control and Transparency Authority. 
</p>
<p>65. Romania reported on the importance of minority representation in Parliament. The 
Council of National Minorities was established to serve as a consultative body to ensure the 
participation of national minorities in political life through institutional and decision-
making mechanisms. The use of minority languages in local public administration and 
before the courts ensures the enjoyment of human rights and fair administration of justice. 
The National Council for Combating Discrimination and the Permanent Election Authority 
were also established to guarantee and supervise the implementation of the principles of 
equality and non-discrimination among citizens and the good functioning of electoral 
consultations. 
</p>
<p>66. Slovenia stressed that, in times of significant changes under a constitutional 
democracy, there should be no infringement of human rights or freedoms. Human rights 
institutions, the judiciary and the Constitutional Court should fulfil their respective 
missions as guardian institutions. Under the &#8213;Ombudsman Plus&#8214; system, representatives of 
NGOs have been involved in the monitoring of the treatment of persons deprived of their 
liberty. In addition to the adoption of human rights-compliant legislation, a specialized 
department was established within the Office of the State Prosecutor to prosecute criminal 
offences committed at work by police officers. 
</p>
<p>67. Spain reported on initiatives taken by several ministries to promote a national 
security policy conducive to the enjoyment of human rights. Members of the police forces 
and the State Secretariat for Security receive training in human rights and crisis 
management, in cooperation with countries in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. 
Special attention is paid to the protection of victims of domestic violence, equality and non-
discrimination, the rights of detainees, children and the elderly, the eradication of ethnic 
and racial profiling, independent legal representation for unaccompanied foreign minors </p>


<p>subject to repatriation, the study of international humanitarian law, bilateral human rights 
dialogue, and engagement with civil society.  
</p>
<p>68. Switzerland referred to two questions debated at the national and international 
levels, namely, the preventive control of conformity with the law in general, and the 
process of initiatives aimed at modifying the Constitution. It noted that democracy, the rule 
of law, and federalism are among the defining features of the Swiss constitutional structure. 
These principles have equal value, condition each other and are mutually reinforcing. The 
State must determine which organs will oversee the conformity of the Constitution and 
national laws with international law. Similarly, cantonal initiatives aimed at modifying the 
Constitution should be compatible with Swiss federal law or international law. 
</p>
<p>69. The National Human Rights Commission of Mexico reported on the introduction&#8212;
following extensive national consultations&#8212;of a constitutional reform on human rights 
aimed at harmonizing national legislation with international human rights law, 
strengthening the rule of law and ensuring greater efficiency of the system of human rights 
protection. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International and regional cooperation for the promotion of democracy 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>70. Over the years, sustained support bringing legitimacy and competence to the 
securing of democracy has generated some good practices. Nation-owned and -driven 
democracy processes enjoy the support of the international community, which endeavors to 
provide tangible assistance at the inception of transition to democracy and encourage 
democratic changes. 
</p>
<p>71. In 1996, the Secretary-General issued <i>An</i> <i>Agenda for Democratization</i>, in which he 
noted that &#8213;democratization is a process which leads to a more open, more participatory, 
less authoritarian society&#8214;.18 Subsequently, in 2007, the General Assembly decided to 
observe on 15 September of each year the International Day of Democracy19 with a view to 
raising awareness about the subject. The activities of the Community of Democracies and 
each International Conference of New or Restored Democracies held between 1994 and 
2006 illustrate, among other processes, an expanding international interest in the promotion 
of democracy. 
</p>
<p>72. The Department of Political Affairs has provided the secretariat support for the 
International Conference of New or Restored Democracies. Moreover, in 1991, the General 
Assembly adopted resolution 46/137, through which it set up an electoral assistance unit, 
later reorganized as the Electoral Assistance Division within the Department of Political 
Affairs, to provide electoral assistance to a large number of interested Member States.  
</p>
<p>73. OHCHR and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) seek to address 
the challenges of democracy deficit through their respective advisory services and technical 
cooperation programmes. Given the scope of its operational capacity, UNDP is the primary 
international assistance provider for promoting good governance and democracy 
worldwide, notably at the level of elections, Parliament effectiveness and accountability, 
civil society participation, and training of government officials. In response to the 2011 
</p>
<p>

 19 General Assembly resolution 62/7. </p>


<p>Arab Spring, UNDP has developed a guide for peaceful transformational change processes 
embracing youth as a positive force.20 
</p>
<p>74. The promotion of democracy and the rule of law is also a programmatic objective of 
OHCHR, inherently linked to its mission to ensure respect for and protection of all human 
rights. Under the OHCHR Technical Cooperation Programme, the focus is placed on 
training activities to strengthen the legal and judicial framework for human rights 
protection, the provision of legal expertise in constitutional and legislative reforms, training 
for parliamentarians, the empowerment of vulnerable and disadvantaged segments of 
society, advocacy, awareness and human rights education. OHCHR has also been active in 
supporting democratization and transitional justice processes, including by engaging in the 
design and implementation of inclusive national consultations; supporting the establishment 
of truth-seeking processes, judicial accountability mechanisms and reparations 
programmes; and enhancing institutional reform. 
</p>
<p>75. The universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council is a unique mechanism 
that enables a review of the human rights record of all Member States and provides, 
through its regular scrutiny, potential incentives for change and reforms aimed at 
strengthening democracy.  
</p>
<p>76. The United Nations Democracy Fund was established in 2005 to support projects 
aimed at building and strengthening democratic institutions and ensuring the participation 
of all groups in democratic processes. The Fund focuses on several themes, including 
strengthening democratic dialogue, promoting human rights, civil society empowerment, 
civic education, accountability and transparency. 
</p>
<p>77. Several regional intergovernmental organizations have integrated democracy 
promotion into their work programme and/or governing charter. These include the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Organization of American States, 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the European Commission and the African 
Union. The integration of clauses on human rights and democracy in international aid and 
commerce agreements, such as the Cotonou Agreement between the European Union and 
African, Caribbean and Pacific States, has been an important codification of the 
interlinkages among human rights, democracy and economic development. 
</p>
<p>78. Some of these organizations, such as the African Union, the Organization of 
American States, the Economic Community of West African States and the International 
Organization of la Francophonie have systematically suspended the membership of 
countries opting for unconstitutional changes of government. The African Union introduced 
specific measures against the unconstitutional overthrow of democratically elected 
governments. The Biketawa Declaration of the Pacific Islands Forum and the Warsaw 
Declaration, both adopted in 2000, make similar commitments in respect of 
unconstitutional changes of power and attempts to modify national Constitutions to extend 
presidential terms of office. 
</p>
<p>79. The Inter-Parliamentary Union assists in establishing parliamentary systems 
worldwide. It has developed guidelines for good practice in parliaments and methods for 
assessing parliamentary performance.  
</p>
<p>80. Promoting and advancing democracy has also been a priority for a large number of 
civil society organizations around the world. These include the International Institute for 
Democracy and Electoral Assistance, the International Center for Transitional Justice, the 
</p>

Security Policy, the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces and the 
European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Securing democracy should be an overarching and permanent concern for 
Member States. Systematic violations of human rights and the rule of law inevitably 
</b></p>
<p><b>lead to a retreat of democracy. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The contemporary global spread of democracy is a dynamic movement 
responding to a popular impulse and aspirations for adherence to the principles of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights and the rule of law, for greater justice and liberty. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>There is no single model of democracy. Democracy does not belong to any 
country or region more than another. The constitutive norms, standards and values of 
</b></p>
<p><b>democracy are universal. They are grounded in the Charter of the United Nations, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Universal Declaration of Human Rights and core international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>instruments. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Democracy, human rights and the rule of law are interdependent and mutually 
reinforcing. They enjoy a symbiotic relationship within a system of governance. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>weakening of one endangers the enjoyment or even the existence of the others. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Democracy is a platform for inclusive participation, empowerment and 
accountability. It can be made resilient through solid institutions led by 
</b></p>
<p><b>constitutionally invested and accountable officials and by human rights-compliant 
</b></p>
<p><b>laws, policies and practices. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Challenges to democracy arise in both settled and transitional democracies. 
The main threats to democracy include violence, sectarianism, extremism and 
</b></p>
<p><b>intolerance. Additional challenges, such as poverty, abuse of power, endemic economic 
</b></p>
<p><b>and political corruption, impunity and the curtailment of fundamental freedoms, lead 
</b></p>
<p><b>to serious setbacks. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>As, inevitably, a trial-and-error process, democratization is a complex and 
unpredictable path beset with challenges. The quality of the transition, the nature of 
</b></p>
<p><b>leadership commitment and the enactment of the transition requirements determine 
</b></p>
<p><b>its achievements. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Democracy takes root over time. Its safeguarding is a lengthy and continuous 
exercise. It requires steady investment and astute agency. Contemporary transitions 
</b></p>
<p><b>are eminently complex, involving an ever-growing number of State and non-State 
</b></p>
<p><b>actors. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Democratization is about the crystallization of a new system. The ensuing 
transformations can spell disorder and potential conflict and violence. Leadership 
</b></p>
<p><b>must grasp these complex phenomena and adopt flexible and competent approaches. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The international community has been more successful at providing support in 
the early stages of a transition, notably through electoral assistance, than during the 
</b></p>
<p><b>subsequent phases of democracy consolidation. The United Nations should remain on 
</b></p>
<p><b>course to respond to the continuing concerns of Member States. </b></p>


<p>91. <b>There is a need for an internationally concerted and endorsed strategic 
framework of <i>accompagnement</i> of nascent democracies. Such a framework would 
</b></p>
<p><b>highlight comparative advantages and complementarities and would reinforce 
</b></p>
<p><b>coherence and cooperation throughout the United Nations system.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  National efforts to promote democracy and the rule of law  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>States should strive to respect the principles of the rule of law, in particular, the 
separation of powers, the independence of the judiciary, the independence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability of Parliament and institutional checks and balances, as guarantors of 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection against impunity, corruption and abuse of power. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Democracy, development and human rights have important conceptual and 
practical affinities.</b>21<b> The suppression of impediments to participation in public life 
</b></p>
<p><b>and decision-making, reductions in income disparities, improved access to economic 
</b></p>
<p><b>opportunities and social safety nets are markers of a healthy democracy. State-
</b></p>
<p><b>building should not be merely a technocratic exercise. Building or rebuilding 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusive, resilient and responsive States requires inclusive and participatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>governance, accountability and constructive State-society relations.</b>22<b> 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>There is momentum for an interactive approach, synergies and coordination 
among national actors, including parliaments and national human rights institutions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the United Nations system and regional organizations, with respect to the development 
</b></p>
<p><b>of guidelines and codes of conduct and the exchange of experiences and lessons 
</b></p>
<p><b>learned. Human rights indicators</b>23<b> should be further developed to include the 
</b></p>
<p><b>translation of democratic principles into operational benchmarks. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>All components of civil society must be able to exercise their right to participate 
in decision-making structures and mechanisms and to be actively involved in 
</b></p>
<p><b>democratization processes. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Incitement to hatred, discrimination or intolerance on any ground is a threat to 
democracy and should be appropriately countered.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>National security and counter-terrorism strategies must not serve as pretexts to 
undermine democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Human rights education and civic education foster democratic culture and 
practices and promote a culture of peace. They should be systematically incorporated 
</b></p>
<p><b>into school and academic curricula.  </b></p>
<p><b>  International efforts to promote democracy and the rule of law  
</b></p>
<p>99. Democracy assistance should revolve around building States&#8217; capacities to 
<b>undertake comprehensive reforms. A constructive promotion of democratic ideals, 
</b></p>
<p><b>anchored in respect for human rights, including the right to self-determination, serves 
</b></p>
<p><b>to advance global peace and security. 
</b></p>

<p>100. <b>The international community should continue supporting transitional 
processes. Constructive dialogue among Member States would enrich their 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding of the challenges specific to each process. Lessons drawn from the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recent experiences in the Middle East and North Africa could be of particular interest 
</b></p>
<p><b>in this regard.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>International cooperation strategies for the promotion of a </b>&#8220;<b>holistic</b>&#8221;<b> 
democracy should focus on the advancement of all human rights, including civil, 
</b></p>
<p><b>political, economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development. Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention should be devoted to promoting equality and combating discrimination, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>to protecting the rights of women and disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>poor people, indigenous peoples, minorities and persons with disabilities.   
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>By weakening the social fabric of societies, the global economic crisis represents 
a threat to democracy. Efforts should be invested in alleviating the debt burden of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries confronted with drastic austerity measures. The protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be taken into account in devising financial remedies and aid packages. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>International exchanges, such as the World Forum for Democracy, held in 
Strasbourg in October 2012, and the fifth Bali Democracy Forum, held in November 
</b></p>
<p><b>2012, must be encouraged in order to foster links and to provide further opportunities 
</b></p>
<p><b>for experience-sharing and comparative learning on democracy and the promotion of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights.
