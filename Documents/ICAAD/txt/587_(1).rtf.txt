INTERLOCUTORY RULING OF FINNINGAN J

On 15 October 2004 the Plaintiff by writ commenced an action in defamation against the Defendants. He wanted damages and an injunction so that they would not defame him again The same day he filed an ex-parte motion for that injunction and a judge declared that application should proceed on notice. On 21 January he again applied ex-parte for that injunction and it was granted. The Defendants were ordered by the Court not to defame the Plaintiff. That order lasted until 15 April 2005 whereafter it was forgotten and the need for it was proved by its demise. 

What I have been asked to decide is an application to set aside an interlocutory judgment that was entered against the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants on 21 February 2005. There is actually before me a motion filed on 24 February 2005 by the 4th Defendant to set aside the judgment against him. With it is an affidavit in support sworn by the 3rd Defendant and annexing his proposed statement of defence said to be in support of his motion to set aside the judgment against him, but that motion is not on the file. On 15 March 2005 the 2nd Defendant filed an affidavit said to be in support to his application to set aside the judgment against him. It annexes his proposed statement of defence, but there is no motion on the file. 

As one might expect, in these first steps taken the 2nd Defendant he raises the primary issue of whether he has been served with the proceedings. Both the 2nd Defendant and 4th Defendant are described in the entituling as Parliamentary leader and Member of Parliament respectively.

I have not been advised in the submissions or otherwise about the law governing service of Court documents on parliamentarians while the House is sitting. I do know from the affidavits that a firm of lawyers in Suva sent a clerk to Parliament House on 16 November 2004 to serve the 2nd Defendant and that the clerk claims she was advised by the 2nd Defendant that nobody was allowed to serve any documents on him in the Parliament House and if anybody made an attempt to do so he would call the police. From another affidavit I learn that another firm of Suva lawyers sent a Bailiff to Parliament House on 19 October 2004 and there served the 1st Defendant. They said they were unable to serve the other Defendants because Parliament was in Session. Subsequently this Court made an order for service on all 4 Defendants by one advertisement in the Fiji Times. 

All 4 Defendants have now taken one step or another in the action. The 1st Defendant filed a statement of defence. The service issue is probably academic, but it is important nonetheless. 

It would be a very serious issue if the judgment were to remain, but clearly it cannot. Any of the authorities governing the entry of default judgment and setting aside the same will support the proposition that the concern of the Courts for justice is greater then their concern for the rules of procedure. The Plaintiff has filed a substantial claim setting out the details of his grievance and the responsibility which he claims each of the Defendants bear for it. He quantifies his claim in money terms at 1 million dollars. All of the Defendants are high profile public figures. There were special requirements of service which may have been overcome by a single advertisement in a Daily Newspaper. To uphold a default judgment in liability under those circumstances would contrary to all principle.

I have considered all of the submissions and the affidavits. The default judgment against the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants is set aside.

Costs on this interlocutory application will lie where they fall and I made no order.

The matter will be called in the callover on 25 November 2005 and it will be given a hearing date. Counsel should now proceed with pre-trial steps and if necessary directions can be sought and given at the hearing on 25 November 2005.
