<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 At the invitation of the Government of the United States of America, the Working 
Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the 
exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination visited the United States from 20 July 
to 3 August 2009. This opportunity has allowed the Working Group to engage in a 
constructive dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders on issues related to its 
mandate. 
</p>
<p> The Government of the United States relies heavily on the private military and 
security industry in conducting its worldwide military operations. Private military and 
security companies (PMSCs) from the United States dominate this new industry, which 
earns an estimated 20 billion to 100 billion dollars annually. The overall number of 
contractors in 2009 amounted to 244,000. Private forces constitute about half of the total 
United States force deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
</p>
<p> In the last few years, and largely in reaction to incidents involving PMSCs, the 
Government of the United States and Congress adopted various measures increasing the

<p>Government oversight over PMSCs and expanding and clarifying jurisdiction over offences 
committed by private militaries and security personnel operating abroad. The Working 
Group welcomes the adoption of these measures, which have improved the situation, but 
notes that much remains to be done to ensure effective oversight, accountability and legal 
remedy when human rights violations occur.  
</p>
<p> With a view to improving its oversight mechanism and ensuring a climate of 
accountability, the Working Group recommends that the Government of the United States, 
inter alia: (a) support the Stop Outsourcing Security (SOS) Act, which clearly defines the 
functions which are inherently governmental and that cannot be outsourced to the private 
sector; (b) rescind immunity to contractors carrying out activities in other countries under 
bilateral agreements; (c) carry out prompt and effective investigation of human rights 
violations committed by PMSCs and prosecute alleged perpetrators; (d) ensure that the 
oversight of private military and security contractors is not outsourced to PMSCs; (e) 
establish a specific system of federal licensing of PMSCs for their activities abroad; (f) set 
up a vetting procedure for awarding contracts to PMSCs; (g) ensure that United States 
criminal jurisdiction applies to private military and security companies contracted by the 
Government to carry out activities abroad; and (h) respond to pending communications 
from the Working Group, including its long-standing case related to Lu&#237;s Posada Carriles.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of the United States, the Working Group on the 
use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the 
right of peoples to self-determination visited the United States from 20 July to 3 August 
</p><p>2009. It was represented by its Chair, Shaista Shameem, and Jos&#233;-Luis G&#243;mez del Prado.1 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group is grateful to the United States Government for its cooperation 
throughout the visit, which demonstrated the willingness of the Government to engage with 
the Working Group in a constructive dialogue on the oversight and accountability of private 
military and security companies (PMSCs) to ensure the effective protection of human 
rights.  
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group notes with satisfaction that in the last few years and especially 
following the involvement of PMSCs in the abuses in Abu Ghraib and in the 2007 shooting 
incident at Nisoor Square in Iraq, the Government of the United States and Congress have 
taken serious corrective actions to improve the oversight over and the accountability of 
PMSCs, including through the adoption of the necessary legislations and regulations. The 
Working Group welcomes the adoption of these new rules. It also notes with satisfaction a 
change in attitude of the Administration, from a perceptible sense of effective denial 
regarding any wrongdoing by the security industry, towards a more rigorous debate around 
the role of PMSCs and the need for oversight. 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group held discussions in Washington, D.C. and New York City with 
senior officials from the Government of the United States, Congresswoman Jan 
Schakowsky and senior staff of other members of Congress who sit on Congressional 
Committees, lawyers, journalists and civil society organizations, the United States trade 
association of PMSCs as well as with representatives of PMSCs themselves. 
</p>
<p>5. For the purpose of this report, the Working Group defines a PMSC as a corporate 
entity which provides on a compensatory basis military and/or security services by physical 
persons and/or legal entities.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal status of private military and security companies 
</b></p>
<p>6. Under international humanitarian law, if private military and security contractors do 
not directly participate in hostilities, they are considered civilians. As such, they are entitled 
to protection against direct attack unless and for such time as they take a direct part in 
hostilities. Their activities or location may, however, expose them to an increased risk of 
incidental death or injury even if they do not take a direct part in hostilities.2 
</p><p>7. However, the legal status of PMSC personnel performing functions closely linked to 
military operations &#8212; such as analysing intelligence data, maintaining weapon systems, 
and resupplying forward-based forces &#8212; is less certain.3 Those performing such functions

 The Working Group was established pursuant to resolution 2005/2 of the Commission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (para. 11). It is composed of five independent experts serving in their personal capacities. The 
members are Shaista Shameem (Chairperson-Rapporteur from March 2009 to March 2010, Fiji), 
Jos&#233;-Luis G&#243;mez del Prado (Spain), Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez (Colombia), Alexander Nikitin 
(Russian Federation) and Najat al-Hajjaji (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya).

<p>could be deemed to take an active part in hostilities, in which case they would no longer 
qualify as non-combatants. A contractor who participates in hostilities could therefore be 
charged with both violations of the laws of war and violations of the relevant domestic law.  
</p>
<p>8. In situations of non-armed conflict, the legal status of private military and security 
contractors is governed by international human rights laws and relevant national laws. The 
Human Rights Committee has stated that &#8220;the contracting out to PMSCs of core State 
activities which involve the use of force and the detention of persons does not absolve a 
State party of its obligations under international human rights law&#8221;.4 
</p>
<p><b> III. Mapping and activities of private military and security 
companies (PMSCs) 
</b>9. The United States has relied and continues to rely heavily on private military and 
security contractors in conducting its military operations. The State used private security 
contractors to conduct narcotics intervention operations in Colombia in the 1990s and 
recently signed a supplemental agreement that authorizes it to deploy troops and contractors 
in seven Colombian military bases.5 During the conflict in the Balkans, the United States 
used a private security contractor to train Croat troops to conduct operations against Serbian 
troops. Nowadays, it is in the context of its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in particular 
that the State is massively contracting out security functions to private firms. Though the 
Government of the United States is the main employer of PMSCs, companies are also 
providing their services to international organizations, non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), private companies and individuals. Estimates of the size of the industry vary from 
US$ 20 billion a year as stated by the industry6 to US$ 100 billion a year according to some 
researchers.7  
</p>
<p>10. Despite attempts to increase coordination between agencies employing PMSCs, the 
Government of the United States could not provide comprehensive figures regarding 
private military and security companies it has under contract. Each agency has its own 
figures and the intelligence agencies do not provide any figures. The Department of 
Defense figures provided to the Working Group indicate that in Iraq and Afghanistan alone, 
the Department employed 218,000 private contractors (all types) while there were 195,000 
uniformed personnel.8 According to the figures, about 8 per cent of these contractors are 
armed security contractors, i.e. about 20,000 armed guards. If one includes other theatres of 
operations, the figure rises to 242,657, with 54,387 United States citizens, 94,260 third-
country nationals and 94,010 host-country nationals.9  
</p>
<p>11. The State Department relies on about 2,000 private security contractors to provide 
United States personnel and facilities with personal protective and guard services in

<p>Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel and Pakistan, and aviation services in Iraq.10 The contracts for 
protective services were awarded in 2005 to three PMSCs, namely, Triple Canopy, 
DynCorp International and the U.S. Training Center, part of the Xe (then Blackwater) 
group of companies. These three companies still hold the State Department protective 
services contracts today.11 
</p>
<p>12. The Working Group also found that the Government of the United States has a very 
restrictive definition of what constitutes a PMSC, restricting consideration to those 
companies that provide guard services and protection for persons or physical objects. For 
example, the Government does not consider a company such as CACI, which provided 
contracted interrogators at the prison run by the United States in Abu Ghraib, Iraq, a private 
security company. The CACI website states it is an information technology company &#8211; it is 
therefore not included in the figures provided. Such a company, however, falls within the 
Working Group definition of a PMSC because of the specialized service it supplies in 
respect of the United States military activity in Iraq. 
</p>
<p>13. In other cases the involvement of PMSCs can be seen as controversial and therefore 
contracts have not been disclosed. This is the case in Pakistan, where despite allegations in 
the media, both Xe (Blackwater) and the Government of the United States denied that the 
company operated in Pakistan until it was finally acknowledged by the Secretary of 
Defense. However, the Secretary of Defense did not provide information on the type of 
services it is providing.12 
</p>
<p>14. PMSCs are typically hired to provide personnel protection, site security and convoy 
security for military and civilian personnel working for international institutions, 
Governments or private entities. In addition, PMSCs may be involved in policing and 
security protection services, strategic planning, intelligence collection and analysis, 
interrogation of detainees and covert operations.  
</p>
<p>15. According to government policy, the United States bars security contractors from 
engaging in &#8220;combat&#8221; or in &#8220;offensive&#8221; military operations and from performing inherently 
governmental functions.13 Contractors are limited to a &#8220;defensive response to hostile acts or 
demonstrated hostile intent&#8221;.14 
</p>
<p>16. However, the situation on the ground is often very different from these policy 
statements. Contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan are tasked to protect military facilities in 
combat zones where there is a strong likelihood that they will have to engage in combat. In 
such cases, the Department of Defense advises only that &#8220;contracts shall be used cautiously 
in contingency operations where major combat operations are ongoing or imminent&#8221;.15 
</p><p>17. According to a congressional report on the behaviour of Xe/Blackwater in Iraq, 
Xe/Blackwater guards were found to have been involved in nearly 200 escalation-of-force 
incidents that involved the firing of shots since 2005. Despite the terms of the contracts

<p>which provided that the company could engage only in defensive use of force, the company 
reported that in over 80 per cent of the shooting incidents, its forces fired the first shots.16 
</p>
<p>18. The Government of the United States has not yet clearly defined what constitutes 
&#8220;inherently governmental functions&#8221;. The existing definition states that that an inherently 
governmental function is &#8220;a function so intimately related to the public interest as to require 
performance by federal Government employees&#8221;.17 Given the concerns that the lack of 
clarity regarding this definition might have led to the contracting out of inherently 
governmental functions by the Department of Defense and other agencies, Congress passed 
legislation in September 2008 requiring the Office of Management and Budget to develop a 
single consistent definition of inherently governmental functions.18 
</p>
<p>19. The Department also specifically authorizes its contractor personnel to &#8220;conduct or 
support intelligence interrogations, detainee debriefings, or tactical questioning&#8221; when such 
functions are specified in the contract. However, following the many accounts of the 
participation of contractors in detainee abuses in Abu Ghraib, Congress, in the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, recommended a specific ban on the use of 
contractors in the interrogation of detainees.19 However, the Executive Office of the 
President explicitly rejected this limitation, stating that &#8220;in some limited cases, a contract 
interrogator may possess the best combination of skills to obtain critical intelligence&#8221;.20 
</p>
<p>20. The Act eventually reflected a compromise: it provides that &#8220;no enemy prisoner of 
war &#8230; or any other individual who is in the custody or under the effective control of the 
Department of Defense &#8230; may be interrogated by contractor personnel&#8221;. However, 
contractor personnel with proper training and security clearances may be used as linguists, 
interpreters, report writers and information technology technicians in interrogations 
provided (a) they are covered by the same rules governing detainee interrogations as 
government personnel performing the same interrogation functions and (b) that Department 
of Defense personnel will oversee the contractor&#8217;s performance. The prohibition may be 
waived if such a move is vital to the national security interests of the United States.21 
</p>
<p>21. The Working Group received information from several sources that up to 70 per cent 
of the budget of United States intelligence is spent on contractors.22 These contracts are 
classified and very little information is available to the public on the nature of the activities 
carried out by these contractors.  
</p>
<p>22. Media reports, however, have indicated that a number of private security guards 
were playing central roles in some of the most sensitive activities of the Central Intelligence

<p>Agency (CIA) &#8211; clandestine raids against alleged insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan and 
the involvement in CIA rendition flights23 as well as joint covert operations.24 
</p><p>23. These examples raise concerns about the extent to which private security companies, 
hired for defensive guard duty, have joined in offensive military and intelligence 
operations. These reports also highlight that the relationship between the intelligence 
agencies and PMSCs &#8212; and perhaps Xe/Blackwater in particular &#8212; likely runs far deeper 
than what is publicly acknowledged. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Oversight of PMSCs and applicable jurisdiction 
</b>24. In the last few years and largely in response to specific incidents involving PMSCs, 
such as abuses of detainees and killings of civilians, the Government of the United States 
and Congress have adopted a series of measures increasing Government oversight over 
PMSCs and expanding and clarifying criminal jurisdiction over offences committed by 
PMSC personnel contracted by the United States and operating abroad. The Working 
Group welcomes the adoption of these measures but notes that much remains to be done to 
ensure effective oversight and legal remedy when violations occur. It is particularly 
concerned by oversight mechanisms which grant the responsibility of oversight to PMSCs 
themselves. In addition and as illustrated below, the clarification of applicable jurisdiction 
has yet to lead to a successful prosecution and punishment of those responsible for human 
rights abuses and other crimes. The Government argues that insofar as prosecutions under 
the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 have resulted in guilty pleas, there 
have been successful prosecutions. However, in most cases, those prosecutions have not led 
to the punishment of those responsible in accordance with international law.   
</p>
<p><b> A. Oversight mechanism of the Department of Defense 
</b></p>
<p>25. Officials from the Department of Defense emphasized to the Working Group that no 
organization had more at stake than their Department in ensuring the accountability of 
PMSCs, and underlined the measures the department had taken to improve oversight, build 
accountability and develop coordination with host nations on jurisdiction and 
accountability.  
</p>
<p>26. A 2005 Department of Defense instruction specifies the functions that private 
military and security contractors are authorized to carry out. It states that &#8220;contractors may 
support military operations as civilians accompanying the force, so long as such personnel 
have been designated by the force they accompany and are provided with an appropriate 
identification card under the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention relative to the 
Treatment of Prisoners of War&#8221;. It also stipulates that contractor personnel may &#8220;support 
contingency operations through the indirect participation in military operations, such as by 
providing communications support, transporting munitions and other supplies, performing 
maintenance functions for military equipment [and] providing security services&#8221;.25 
Department contractors are required to follow military orders. It reiterated that contingency 
contractor personnel retain the inherent right of individual self-defence.

<p>27. A United States Congressional study released in August 2008 noted that military 
commanders do not have direct control over PMSC contractors, as the duties of contractor 
personnel are set out in a fixed written contract. Rather, it is the contracting officer &#8212; the 
official civilian designee of the head of the agency &#8212; who oversees the implementation of 
the contract.26 The Government indicated that, in many cases, Department of Defense 
contracting officers are not civilian but uniformed military officers reporting to the military 
chain of command.  
</p>
<p>28. The Working Group is particularly concerned by situations where oversight has been 
contracted out to PMSCs themselves. This is the case in Afghanistan, for example, with the 
Armed Contractor Oversight Division (ACOD), which is responsible for overseeing and 
developing policies for PMSCs and for investigating and reporting incidents that involve 
the use of force by Department of Defense security contractors. While in Iraq ACOD is 
managed by Department of Defense officials, in Afghanistan the responsibility for the 
oversight of PMSCs is outsourced to a PMSC, namely, the British firm Aegis. Aegis had 
received US$ 624.4 million for those services, as of November 2008. The United States 
Commission on Wartime Contracting expressed concerns at this situation in its interim 
report, stating that since its establishment, ACOD in Afghanistan has been run primarily by 
contractor personnel from Aegis and had received limited supervision from the Government 
of the United States. The Commission stated that the oversight of security contractors in 
Afghanistan did not reflect the lessons learned from Iraq.27 The Government pointed out 
that although certain staff functions are performed by a contractor, ACOD is directly 
managed by United States military personnel with all oversight and decisions remaining the 
responsibility of United States officers.  
</p>
<p>29. In July 2009, the Department of Defense published a new binding federal regulation 
&#8212; the interim final rule on private security contractors (PSCs) operating in contingency 
operations28 &#8212; to clarify policy and guidance regulating the actions and movements in the 
operational area of PMSCs contracted by the Department and also those contracted by other 
governmental departments and agencies. It regulates the selection, accountability, training, 
equipping, and conduct of personnel performing private security functions. It also 
establishes procedures for incident reporting. The Department underlined the critical 
importance of this interim final rule, which should help close existing gaps in the oversight 
of PMSCs and ensure compliance with laws and regulations pertaining to the outsourcing 
of inherently governmental functions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Oversight mechanism of the State Department 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Bureau of Diplomatic Security of the State Department bears the responsibility 
for the protection of its personnel and facilities in the United States and abroad. The Bureau 
of Diplomatic Security has become increasingly reliant on PMSCs and today approximately 
90 per cent of all Diplomatic Security personnel are contractors.29 
</p>
<p>31. The Working Group was briefed about the State Department Worldwide Personal 
Protective Services contract, which is the programme established to &#8220;pre-plan, organize, set 
up, deploy and operate Contractor protective service details for the protection of U.S.

<p>and/or certain foreign government high-level officials&#8221;.30 It includes provisions for 
selection of personnel, as well as procedures for the vetting of staff and compulsory 
training. 
</p>
<p>32. Officials from the State Department explained that following the 2007 Nisoor 
Square incident, their Department enhanced oversight of its PMSCs, notably through an 
increased number of supervisory staff, use of video and audio recording systems to track 
missions, and policy revisions regarding private security contractors and firearms.  
</p>
<p>33. Oversight is reportedly ensured by a contracting officer based in Washington, D.C. 
and not in the theatre of operation. The Government specified that some aspects of 
oversight are the responsibility of State Department employees in the theatre of operations. 
The Regional Security Officer provides general oversight and has responsibility to 
investigate any incidents involving PMSCs. According to the Government, State 
Department special agents are assigned to provide oversight of protection operations and 
represent the designated contracting officer.  
</p>
<p>34. Regarding the reporting of serious incidents, the Working Group was informed that 
between 2001 and 2007, 400 cases were reported and reviewed by the State Department. 
Out of those 400, 15 were referred to the Department of Justice. Since September 2007, 15 
incidents in Iraq and Afghanistan have been referred for Department of Justice review, 
including incidents that occurred prior to September 2007. 
</p>
<p>35. Officials from the State Department were keen to stress to the Working Group that 
there were no loopholes in the oversight of its security contractors. Nevertheless, the 
Working Group was informed of recent allegations of misconduct among employees of 
ArmorGroup North America, contracted by the State Department to protect the United 
States Embassy and personnel in Kabul. The company, a unit of Wackenhut Services, Inc., 
came under scrutiny after the release of a report and photos by the Project on Government 
Oversight showing their employees engaging in hazing, alcohol abuse and sexual 
misconduct.31  
</p>
<p>36. Following these allegations, the Commission on Wartime Contracting conducted a 
hearing on 14 September 2009 on State Department selection, management, and oversight 
of security and other contractors in support of the United States Embassy in Kabul.32 The 
Senate Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight also initiated an investigation and reported 
a pattern of ineffectual Department of State oversight of the ArmorGroup North America 
contract. The report noted that despite repeated warnings, the contractor was failing to meet 
major contract requirements, with allegations of inadequate training, insufficient number of 
guards, inadequate language skills and supervisors engaging in &#8220;deviant hazing and 
humiliation&#8221;. The contract was repeatedly extended, a situation which may have put the 
security of the United States Embassy in Kabul at risk.33 The ArmorGroup North America 
Kabul contract is currently in the second option year, which expires on 30 June 2010. The 
State Department has decided that the next option year should not be exercised and work 
has begun to complete a new contract. However, due to delays in the procurement process, 
the Department has extended ArmorGroup North America for six months beyond the 
option expiration.

<p>37. The Working Group also took this opportunity to remind State Department officials 
of pending communications, including its long-standing communication dated 11 June 
2007 regarding the case of Luis Posada Carriles, allegedly involved in mercenary activities 
in the Americas in the 1980s and residing in the United States (see A/HRC/7/7/Add.1, 
paras. 84&#8211;87). The Working Group invites the Government to demonstrate its full 
cooperation with the mandate given to the Working Group by the General Assembly and 
the Human Rights Council by responding to all pending communications. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Inter-agency coordination 
</b></p>
<p>38. The urgent need for systematic coordination between the different departments 
contracting PMSCs was finally acknowledged after the Nisoor Square killings. The 
Department of Defense and State Department signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 
December 2007 to increase coordination. Before that date, both departments ran their 
operations independently. The Memorandum of Understanding requested the departments 
to jointly develop and implement core standards, policies and procedures for the 
accountability, oversight and conduct of private security contractors. 
</p>
<p>39. In July 2008, the Department of Defense, the State Department and the United States 
Agency for International Development (USAID) signed a Memorandum of Understanding 
in which they agreed to use a Department of Defense database to collect and maintain 
information on contracts and contractor personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Working 
Group was told that the system would improve the agencies&#8217; ability to report on the number 
and value of the contracts and the number of contractor personnel, including the agencies&#8217; 
capacity to track information on killed or wounded contractor personnel.  
</p>
<p>40. However, the database shortcomings were underlined in a memorandum of the 
Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight.34 The memo stresses that personnel are not 
systematically entered, and that the system lacks the capability to track all required data 
elements, including the value of the contract, whether it was completed, descriptions of the 
service performed, and the number of personnel killed and wounded. The Government 
indicated that the Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) system 
now does track complete descriptions of service contracts and the number of personnel 
killed or wounded.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Audits, inspections and investigations 
</b></p>
<p>41. To assess the oversight carried out by the Department of Defense, State Department 
and USAID, several new legislative and investigative bodies have been established &#8212; 
mostly since 2007 &#8212; to conduct audits, inspections and investigations into contracting 
practices for Afghanistan and Iraq. None of these bodies is mandated to assess contracts 
entered into by United States intelligence agencies.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Commission on Wartime Contracting 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Commission on Wartime Contracting, an independent bipartisan legislative 
commission, was set up in 2008 by Congress to study federal agency contracting for the 
reconstruction, logistical support of coalition forces, and the performance of security

</p>
<p>functions in Iraq and Afghanistan.35 The Commission looks at ways to improve the system, 
in particular from the perspective of cost-effectiveness. Officials from the Commission 
informed the Working Group that the current model of extensive contracting out (at a ratio 
of approximately one contractor for every government employee), has not yet proved it is 
more cost-effective than a model with fewer contractors.  
</p>
<p>43. In its interim report, the Commission drew several important conclusions regarding 
the contracting of security functions. It criticized the Government for not having &#8220;clear 
standards and policy on inherently governmental functions&#8221; and called for the development 
of a single consistent definition to ensure that only officers or employees of the federal 
Government or members of the armed forces perform inherently governmental functions 
and other critical functions.36  
</p>
<p>44. The Commission also stated that the Department of Defense failed to provide 
enough staff to perform adequate contract oversight, which contributed to billions of dollars 
in wasteful spending in the army&#8217;s largest contract for support service, and underlines 
problems with the selection, training, equipping, arming, performance and accountability of 
private security.37 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Government Accountability Office  
</b></p>
<p>45. The Government Accountability Office is an independent and non-partisan 
investigative arm of Congress that investigates how the federal Government spends public 
funds. Regarding the issue of PMSCs, the Office issues regular reports on the oversight and 
coordination of PMSCs by United States departments and agencies. In the most recent of 
these reports, issued in July 2009, the Office expressed concerns at the lack of adequate 
background screening of foreign nationals hired by PMSCs under Department of Defense 
contracts.38 
</p>
<p>46. An official from the Government Accountability Office told the Working Group that 
the Office had found insufficiencies in the Department of Defense screening mechanisms, 
especially in respect of foreign nationals that would be working for PMSCs contracted by 
the Department. In such cases, screening was at times left to the contracting PMSC. The 
report recommended that the Department establish a department-wide approach and 
procedures for conducting and adjudicating background screenings of foreign national 
contractor personnel. The official emphasized that, in comparison, the State Department 
had fairly good screening standards and was using its network of embassies to ensure that 
screening was carried out in more depth.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Offices of the Inspector Generals for Iraq and Afghanistan  
</b></p>
<p>47. Established by Congress respectively in 2004 and 2008, the Office of the Special 
Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) and the equivalent office for 
Afghanistan (SIGAR) conduct audits and investigations to promote the efficiency and 
effectiveness of reconstruction programmes, and to detect and prevent waste, fraud and 
abuse of public funds.39<b>

<p>GE.10-14385 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>48. SIGAR is conducting a review to identify the number and volume of contracts to<b> 
</b>provide private security services in Afghanistan, to determine the adequacy of the 
contracting process and to assess the agencies&#8217; management of security contractors. SIGAR 
reported that its preliminary findings indicate that at least 14,000 private security 
contractors are working directly for United States agencies in Afghanistan. It is also trying 
to identify private security subcontractors, but noted in the report that most federal agencies 
still do not keep track of subcontracts in their contracts databases. The Government of the 
United States also does not know how many other private companies or individuals are 
providing security services to reconstruction contractors.40 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Senate Armed Services Committee  
</b></p>
<p>49. The Working Group met with staff of this Committee, and was briefed about their 
ongoing investigation into the use of PMSCs in Iraq and Afghanistan and the existing 
oversight mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>50. The Committee is investigating in particular a shooting incident by two private 
security contractors that killed one Afghan civilian and injured two others in Kabul on 5 
May 2009. The contractors were working for the private security firm Paravant LLC &#8212; a 
Xe (formerly Blackwater) subsidiary &#8212; which provides contracted services to the United 
States Army in Afghanistan and Iraq.41 The Senate is also looking into allegations that the 
men were issued AK-47s despite a letter of authorization from the Department of Defense 
specifically stating that the Xe/Blackwater personnel would not be armed. 
</p>
<p>51. The Working Group welcomes this investigation and urges the Committee to release 
its findings when completed. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Laws governing the conduct of PMSCs and their personnel supporting 
military operations 
</b></p>
<p>52. PMSC personnel allegedly responsible for committing crimes and human rights 
abuses can be prosecuted under different statutes and laws. There may be occasions 
whereby both the military justice system and the civilian justice system have jurisdiction. 
For example, with respect to killings by PMSC personnel in the context of armed conflicts, 
the military justice system may have jurisdiction (under the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice), and the civilian justice system may also have jurisdiction under a variety of 
statutes. The current arrangement in cases implicating contractors is that the Department of 
Justice will generally prosecute the case in the federal courts, and the military justice 
system will act only if the Department declines to do so.42<b> </b>However, attempts to apply that 
jurisdiction so far have led to challenges in court.43 
53. Private military and security contractors are also subject to local laws and could in 
theory also be tried in local courts. In reality, however, due to agreements signed between 
the United States and other countries, for example with Iraq until the end of 2008 or 
currently with Colombia and Mexico, PMSC personnel supporting the United States

<p>frequently enjoy immunity from prosecution or suit in local courts. The United States can 
always waive that immunity but has chosen not do so in any case thus far.44 
</p>
<p><b>  Alien Tort Claims Act of 1789 
</b></p>
<p>54. Civil cases can be brought under the Alien Tort Claims Act of 178945 which allows 
United States courts to hear human rights cases brought by foreign citizens for conduct 
committed outside the United States.46 For example, a civil suit was filed under this act in 
the case of <i>Abtan et al. v. Blackwater USA et al.</i>47 brought by those injured and the family 
of those killed following the Nisoor Square shooting in Baghdad on 16 September 2007. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>55. An action has also been submitted under this Act by two former employees of 
Xe/Blackwater against the owner of the company, Erik Prince. The two men alleged that 
Mr. Prince may have murdered or facilitated the murder of individuals who were 
cooperating with federal authorities investigating the company on alleged criminal 
conduct.48 <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  War Crimes Act of 1996 
</b></p>
<p>56. PMSCs may be prosecuted for certain war crimes if their conduct is found to violate 
the War Crimes Act. However this act has never been used.  
</p>
<p><b>  Uniform Code of Military Justice 
</b>57. Traditionally, Department of Defense contractor personnel have been subject to the 
Uniform Code of Military Justice only when they participated in a declared war or were 
&#8220;retired members of a regular component of the armed forces who are entitled to pay&#8221; (art. 
2, para. a (4)). In 2006, Congress expanded the jurisdiction of the Code to &#8220;persons serving 
with or accompanying an armed force in the field&#8221; whether &#8220;in time of declared war or a 
contingency operation&#8221; (art. 2, para. a (10)). Therefore, the Code may cover Department of 
Defense contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan.49 
</p>
<p>58. The first and only conviction of a private security contractor under this provision 
occurred in June 2008 in response to a contractor-stabbing incident in Iraq. The contractor 
was sentenced to five months of confinement.50 
</p>
<p><b>  Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 
</b>59. The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act extended jurisdiction of the United 
States courts to contractor personnel supporting Department of Defense missions who 
commit a felony (an offence punishable by more than one year in prison) outside sovereign 
United States territory while accompanying United States forces.51 The defendants may be 
tried in federal court after being brought to the United States. The jurisdiction of the Act 
applies only if contractor personnel have not been prosecuted by the host nation&#8217;s legal

<p>system or under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. It applies to Department of Defense 
employees and contractors, as well as to the employees and contractors of any other federal 
agency to the extent their employment relates to supporting the mission of the Department 
overseas. Contractors working for the State Department are therefore not automatically 
subject to the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act.52 
</p><p>60. The Department of Justice has a key role to play to ensure application of the stated 
commitment of the Government that crimes and violations of human rights committed by 
PMSCs will not remain unpunished. The Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section53 
of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice is the Department&#8217;s central point of 
contact regarding investigations and prosecutions related to the Military Extraterritorial 
Jurisdiction Act. 
</p>
<p>61. With respect to crimes committed by contractors abroad, the Section provides 
support to the United States Attorneys&#8217; Offices. In many cases, the cases are prosecuted 
solely by the Attorneys&#8217; Offices, which commit their own limited resources to these 
invariably complex and expensive prosecutions. In some cases, the Section also litigates 
Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act cases, solely or in partnership with the Attorneys&#8217; 
Offices. 
</p>
<p>62. Prosecution is carried out by United States attorneys at the district level, with a 
grand jury of 23 civilians ultimately deciding if an indictment can be brought or not. As of 
March 2008, the Department of Defense had referred 58 cases related to the Military 
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act to the Department of Justice, 12 of which have been 
indicted in federal court and 1 in State court. Of those, eight resulted in a conviction and 
five await trial.54 The Government informed us that to date the Department of Justice has 
initiated action or prosecution in 34 cases related to the Act.55 
</p>
<p>63. When the Department of Justice considers it has insufficient information to pursue a 
contractor under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, the contractor is usually 
simply taken out of the country under an administrative disciplinary action. 
</p>
<p><b>  Special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States 
</b>64. Certain federal criminal statutes govern actions in United States facilities overseas, 
including the premises of the United States military in foreign States that qualify as part of 
the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Examples of such 
statutes include those addressing murder, torture and assault committed by or against 
United States nationals. 
</p>
<p>65. The USA Patriot Act of 2001, adopted after 9/11 to enhance the ability of domestic 
security services to prevent terrorism, expanded the coverage of the special maritime and 
territorial jurisdiction to include the &#8220;premises of the United States diplomatic, consular, 
military, or other United States Government missions or entities in foreign States&#8221; with 
respect to offences committed by or against a citizen of the United States.56 
</p>
<p>66. The only successful prosecution of a private security contractor in the civilian justice 
system was under this statute &#8211; a case of beating a detainee to death during an interrogation 
in Afghanistan (see A/HRC/11/2/Add.5, appendix 3, para. 2).

<p>67. None of the above-mentioned legislation applies to contractors for the United States 
intelligence agencies, except for the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act in cases in 
which the employment of contractors by intelligence agencies relates to supporting the 
mission of the Department of Defense overseas. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Recent initiatives by Congress representatives 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Working Group was briefed on a number of initiatives in the United States 
Congress aimed at further clarifying the jurisdiction applicable to PMSCs. Among these 
initiatives, then Senator Obama introduced the Security Contractor Accountability Act of 
2007, which was to apply to all federal agency contractors, and on 6 May 2008 
Representatives David Price and Jan Schakowsky introduced a bill &#8220;to enhance oversight of 
intelligence community contractors and prohibit the use of such contractors in prisoner 
detention operations, including such sensitive and controversial areas as interrogation and 
international prisoner transport&#8221;.57 Neither of these bills received the necessary support. 
</p>
<p>69. Recently, on 2 February 2010, Senator Patrick Leahy and Congressman David Price 
introduced similar companion bills in the House and Senate. The bills would allow the 
Government to prosecute government contractors and employees for other federal agencies 
than the Department of Defense, such as the State Department, even when those employees 
are not directly supporting a Department of Defense mission. The bill, among other things, 
directs the Department of Justice to create new investigative units to investigate, arrest and 
prosecute contractors and employees who commit serious crimes and requires the Attorney 
General to report annually to Congress on the number of instances of offences received, 
investigated and prosecuted under the statute.58 
</p>
<p>70. On 23 February, Representative Jan Schakowsky and Senator Bernie Sanders 
introduced legislation that would phase out private security contractors in war zones. This 
bill is based on a previous draft of the Stop Outsourcing Security (SOS) Act introduced in 
November 2007. The draft requires that, inter alia, within 180 days of enactment, all 
personnel providing security to United States diplomatic and consular missions in Iraq and 
Afghanistan are employees of the United States Government, effectively banning the use of 
private security contractors for diplomatic security.59 
</p>
<p>71. The Working Group is encouraged by these initiatives but notes with regret that at 
the time of writing none of these draft bills had been adopted.

<p>72. Workers&#8217; compensation benefits for employees of federal contractors performing

<p>government contractor employees working overseas. It provides disability compensation 
and medical care to employees disabled from injured or occupational diseases and benefits 
to survivors of covered employees. Compensation can also be claimed by host country and 
third country nationals hired under federal contracts. The Act requires that federal 
contractors purchase workers&#8217; compensation insurance from authorized insurance carriers. 
The War Hazards Compensation Act, enacted in 1942 and also administered by the Office 
of Workers&#8217; Compensation Programs, completes the protection provided to federal 
contractors&#8217; employees by providing compensation and medical benefits for injury or death 
due to a war-risk hazard that is not compensable under the Defense Base Act. All liability 
for injury, death and detention benefits under the Act is assumed by the Government of the 
United States. 
</p>
<p>73. The agency has failed to enforce key provisions of the law, including informing 
employees of their rights and ensuring that companies purchase such insurance. The system 
has produced hundreds of millions of dollars in outsized profits for the private insurance 
companies in the United States. The top four providers received US$ 1.5 billion in 
premiums through 2008, yet paid out only US$ 900 million in benefits &#8211; a profit margin of 
nearly 40 per cent.60 In some instances, the insurance policies are faked or can be enforced 
only in the United States. There have also been reports of insurance brokers paying 30 per 
cent of the claims, and the rest only once an administrative tribunal compels them. The 
Government of the United States challenged the assessment of the Working Group and 
stated that the agency has responded to the difficulties of enforcing the provisions of the 
law, through, inter alia, employees being notified by the insurance carrier in the appropriate 
languages and through the holding of various seminars in which the Office of Workers&#8217; 
Compensation Programs participated. 
</p>
<p>74. In response to public requests for data following the extension of civilian contracting 
activities, the Office of Workers&#8217; Compensation Programs began to compile and issue 
statistics on the cumulative number of newly reported Defense Base Act cases sorted by 
employer, by insurance carrier and by country.61 For these statistics, the Office compiles 
reports of injury or death received from employers or insurance companies in a workers&#8217; 
compensation context, and therefore they do not constitute complete or official casualty 
statistics of civilian contractor injuries and deaths. Reports received by the Office from 
employers and carriers indicate that, since 2001, more than 1,700 civilian contractors were 
killed in Iraq and Afghanistan and nearly 40,000 were injured during the period 10 January 
2008 to 30 September 2009.62 
</p>
<p><b> V. Impact on human rights 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Working Group was briefed by a number of civil society representatives, 
journalists and lawyers on reported cases of human rights abuses and criminal misconduct 
by private military and private contractors contracted by the Government of the United 
States. While the Working Group commends the steps taken so far by the Government and 
Congress to improve oversight, it remains concerned at the continuing lack of transparency 
regarding the activities of PMSCs and at the failures of the civilian justice system to 
effectively prosecute those responsible for human rights violations.

</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> GE.10-14385 
</p>
<p><b> A. Lack of transparency 
</b></p>
<p>76. The information accessible to the public on the scope and type of contracts between 
the Government of the United States and PMSCs is scarce and opaque. The lack of 
transparency is particularly significant when companies subcontract to others. Often, the 
contracts with PMSCs are not disclosed to the public despite extensive freedom of 
information rules in the United States, either because they contain confidential commercial 
information or on the argument that non-disclosure is in the interest of national defence or 
foreign policy. 
</p>
<p>77. The situation is particularly opaque when United States intelligence agencies 
contract PMSCs. Given the agencies&#8217; power to invoke confidentiality in the interest of 
national security, the public does not have access to information on the company hired, the 
activities it is contracted to do and its area of deployment. Some of these contracts have 
later been revealed through the media. For example, in January 2010 a magazine revealed 
that the CIA allegedly deployed a team of Blackwater operatives on a clandestine operation 
in Hamburg, Germany, after the 9/11 attacks, ultimately aimed at assassinating a German-
Syrian citizen with suspected ties to Al-Qaida.63 German authorities have reportedly 
launched a preliminary investigation into the matter.64 
</p>
<p>78. The American Civil Liberties Union has also been arguing that State secrets 
privilege has been improperly used to prevent several national security-related lawsuits 
from proceeding against the federal Government. This privilege, which is intended to 
protect discrete pieces of sensitive evidence at trial, has been asserted by the Government to 
block entire lawsuits before any specific evidence has been considered.65 
</p>
<p>79. The Working Group believes that private military and security contractors of 
intelligence agencies should not operate outside democratic control and that the public 
should have the right to access information on the scope, type and value of the contracts 
between United States intelligence agencies and PMSCs. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Challenges to accountability 
</b></p>
<p>80. In the course of litigation, several recurring legal arguments have been used in the 
defence of PMSCs and their personnel, including the Government contractor defence, the 
political question doctrine and derivative immunity arguments. PMSCs are using the 
Government contractor defence to argue that they were operating under the exclusive 
control of the Government of the United States when the alleged acts were committed and 
therefore cannot be held liable for their actions. This argument has been asserted in current 
litigations against contractors in cases of torture and abuse of Iraqi detainees in prisons 
across Iraq as well as that regarding the shooting of Iraqi civilians in Nisoor Square in 
2007.66

<p>media release, 4 June 2009. 
 
</p>
<p>66
 Information provided by the Center for Constitutional Rights to the Working Group on 31 July 2009. 
</p>
<p>The Government of the United States said that the fact that an argument was made in court by a non-
United States Government attorney is not evidence of United States law or any position or practice of 
the United States. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14385 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>81. In current litigations contractors also invoke the political question doctrine to argue 
that the lawsuits deal with fundamental policy decisions or powers constitutionally reserved 
to the executive and legislative branches and therefore that the courts should refrain from 
reviewing. Even where the court does have jurisdiction over a case, a court may decline to 
hear it under the premise that it would be second-guessing a sensitive political decision. 
</p>
<p>82. Contractors also submit that they have &#8220;derivative immunity&#8221;. Given that the 
Government of the United States enjoys immunity, and that contractors are carrying out 
government functions delegated to them by the Government, they argue that they too 
should enjoy such immunity. Further, PMSCs have argued their immunity for illegal and 
even offensive conduct, explicitly arguing that private military and security contractors 
should be immune from prosecution for committing torture acts.67 
</p>
<p>83. In several cases, contractors have also challenged the applicability of international 
law to them, claiming that international law obligations &#8212; including the prohibitions on 
torture and war crimes &#8212; do not extend to them as they are &#8220;non-State actors&#8221;. This 
argument has been successful in at least two cases.68 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Specific cases of abuses 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Xe/Blackwater 
</b></p>
<p>84. Blackwater Worldwide &#8212; also known as Xe or U.S. Training Center &#8212; is one of the 
largest of the United States private security contractors; up to 90 per cent of the company&#8217;s 
revenue comes from government contracts. State Department contracts and task orders with 
Blackwater in Iraq topped US$ 1 billion as of 29 May 2008.69 
</p><p>85. Following the shooting by Blackwater personnel of innocent civilians in Nisoor 
Square, which killed 17 people and severely injured many others on 16 September 2007, 
the Iraq Ministry of the Interior revoked Blackwater&#8217;s licence and threatened to expel the 
company&#8217;s employees. Despite this, the United States renewed the company&#8217;s contract. 
Only after the entry into force of a new Status of Forces Agreement in January 2009 and the 
cancellation of Coalition Provisional Authority Order 17 which granted immunity to 
contractors, was the Government of Iraq able to deny Blackwater&#8217;s application for an 
operating licence. However, the company is still under contract with the State Department 
and some Blackwater personnel were working in Iraq at least until September 2009.70 
</p>
<p>86. According to a congressional memorandum, Blackwater guards had been involved 
in nearly 200 shootings in Iraq between 2005 and 2007.71 The document also raises serious 
questions about how State Department officials responded to reports of Blackwater killings 
of Iraqis. For example, in the case of a shooting of the guard of Iraqi Vice-President Adil 
Abd-al-Mahdi in December 2006 by a Blackwater contractor, the State Department had 
allowed Blackwater to transport the contractor out of Iraq within 36 hours of the shooting 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>67
 The Government of the United States specified that this theory of immunity applied to civil liability 
</p>
<p>and not to criminal prosecution.

</p>
<p>and suggested a payment of $15,000.72 A similar approach was taken in other cases 
involving the shooting of innocent Iraqi civilians. 
</p>
<p>87. When the Working Group asked both the Department of Defense and the State 
Department why Xe/Blackwater was still under contract, both Departments commented that 
there was &#8220;no basis for not employing Xe/Blackwater&#8221;. While the Working Group fully 
recognizes the presumption of innocence, it believes there was enough evidence of grave 
acts of misconduct to at least temporarily suspend contracts with Blackwater until all 
judicial processes were concluded. 
</p><p>88. On 8 December 2008, the Department of Justice unsealed a 35-count indictment in 
the District of Columbia charging five Blackwater security guards with voluntary 
manslaughter, attempt to commit manslaughter, and weapons violations for their alleged 
roles in the 16 September 2007 shooting at Nisoor Square in Baghdad, Iraq. The defendants 
were charged with killing 14 unarmed civilians and wounding 20 other individuals. In 
addition, a sixth Blackwater security guard pleaded guilty on 5 December 2008 to charges 
of voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter.73 
</p>
<p>89. The Blackwater lawsuit is the first case to be filed under the Military Extraterritorial 
Jurisdiction Act against non-Department of Defense private contractors. In a motion to 
dismiss filed by Blackwater in July 2009, the defendants invoked the political question 
doctrine, immunity under Iraqi law and the Government contractor defence. The defendants 
also argued that their actions were covered by absolute immunity because they were 
performing &#8220;delegated actions&#8221; that would have otherwise been performed by the State 
Department. On 31 December 2009, Judge Ricardo M. Urbina of the United States Federal 
District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the indictment, stating that evidence 
against them was inadmissible under the United States Constitution.74 
</p>
<p>90. Following this decision, the Working Group publicly expressed its concerns in a 
press release dated 7 January 2010.75 It said that this decision may lead to a situation where 
no one would be accountable for grave human rights violations. The Working Group has 
been encouraged by the statement of Vice-President Joe Biden in Baghdad that the &#8220;United 
States is determined &#8230; to hold accountable anyone who commits crimes against the Iraqi 
people&#8221; and by the initiative of the Government to appeal the court decision on 29 January 
2010.76 
</p>
<p>91. The Working Group was also informed of a civil lawsuit against Xe/Blackwater. 
The allegations include a spate of unprovoked civilian shootings by Xe/Blackwater 
personnel in Iraq between 2005 and 2008 and are presented by the families of those killed 
and wounded in six different incidents. The company is accused of committing war crimes, 
assault and battery, wrongful death, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent 
infliction of emotional distress, negligent hiring, training and supervision and tortious 
spoliation of evidence.77

 Center for Constitutional Justice, &#8220;Xe-Blackwater faces new claims over civilian shootings in Iraq, 
</p>
<p>according to U.S. legal team for Iraqi families&#8221;, 27 March 2009. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14385 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. CACI International, Inc. and L-3 Services/Titan 
</b></p>
<p>92. The Working Group was briefed about the alleged involvement of two United 
States-based corporations, CACI and L-3 Services (formerly Titan Corporation), in the 
torture of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib. CACI and L-3 Services, contracted by the 
Government of the United States, were responsible for interrogation and translation 
services, respectively, at Abu Ghraib prison and other facilities in Iraq. 
</p>
<p>93. The Center for Constitutional Rights and a team of lawyers brought claims against 
the two companies under the Alien Tort Claims Act in 2004 on behalf of over 250 
plaintiffs. The plaintiffs claimed they were &#8220;subjected to rape and threats of rape and other 
forms of sexual assault; electric shocks; repeated beatings, including beatings with chains, 
boots and other objects; prolonged hanging from limbs; forced nudity; hooding; isolated 
detention; being urinated on and otherwise humiliated; and being prevented from praying 
and otherwise abiding by their religious practices&#8221;.78 
</p>
<p>94. CACI and L-3 Services argued that they should receive immunity because they were 
contractors and because the violations in this case arose out of detentions in Iraq. The 
plaintiffs argued that torture is clearly against the law and that anyone who commits acts of 
torture must be held accountable. 
</p>
<p>95. In September 2009, a federal appeals court dismissed a lawsuit against CACI and L-
3 Services, saying the companies had immunity as Government contractors. The judge 
explaining the ruling said that &#8220;during wartime, where a private service contractor is 
integrated into combatant activities over which the military retains command authority, a 
tort claim arising out of the contractor&#8217;s engagement in such activities shall be pre-empted&#8221;. 
One judge dissented, stating that &#8220;no act of Congress and no judicial precedent bars the 
plaintiffs from suing the private contractors &#8211; who were neither soldiers nor civilian 
government employees&#8221;.79 
</p>
<p>96. No employee of either company has been convicted of an offence in relation to this. 
The Working Group requested a meeting with CACI but the request was denied. CACI 
stated that the company was not a PMSC &#8212; but an information technology company &#8212; 
and therefore did not fall under the mandate of the Group. Nevertheless it recognized that at 
the request of the United States Army, the company did provide intelligence analysts and 
interrogators at Abu Ghraib prison.80 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>97. <b>The Working Group reiterates its appreciation to the Government of the 
United States for extending to the Working Group an invitation to discuss the 
measures taken by the Government to ensure oversight and accountability of private 
military and security companies (PMSCs) it has contracted. The Government is not 
only one of the main users of PMSCs, but it is also the corporate home to many of the 
PMSCs. United States leadership in ensuring their accountability is therefore crucial. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Working Group is pleased that the Government has since taken serious 
corrective actions and welcomes the recent adoption by the United States authorities

<p><b>of legislation and regulations aimed at strengthening further the oversight and 
accountability of PMSCs. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Working Group is also encouraged by the initiatives of some 
representatives of Congress, who have introduced draft legislation that would 
comprehensively provide criminal jurisdiction over contractors and civilian 
employees of all federal agencies. This additional legislation is crucial to remove the 
existing loophole on the accountability of contractors. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Working Group wishes to recall that States have the responsibility to take 
appropriate measures at all times or to exercise due diligence in order to prevent, 
punish, investigate and redress the harm caused by acts of private military and 
security companies or their employees that impair human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>With a view to improving its oversight mechanism and ensuring a climate of 
accountability, the Working Group recommends that the Government of the United 
States: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Urge Congress to clarify and expand the reach of United States criminal 
jurisdiction over contractors abroad, either by amending the Military Extraterritorial 
Jurisdiction Act or by enacting new legislation specific to private contractors of the 
Government of the United States abroad; 
 (b) Support the Stop Outsourcing Security (SOS) Act, presently in 
Congress, which clearly defines the functions which are inherently governmental and 
that cannot be outsourced; 
 (c) Specify the rules of engagement for PMSCs to minimize the risks of 
direct participation in hostilities, including in covert operations and the manning of 
unmanned aerial vehicles; 
 (d) Renounce the inclusion of immunity provisions in bilateral agreements 
for United States contractors working abroad; 
 (e) Ensure that the Department of Justice carries out prompt and effective 
investigation of any allegations of human rights violations committed by PMSCs and 
prosecutes alleged perpetrators. For that purpose, Congress should allocate 
appropriate additional resources to investigating and prosecuting contractor crime 
and the Department of Justice should strengthen its investigative resource capacity 
and appoint an independent prosecutor for such crimes; 
 (f) Direct the Department of Justice to promptly make public the statistical 
information on the status of the investigations launched into PMSC human rights 
abuses and criminal activities as well as on prosecutions and penalties; 
 (g) Reduce the application of classified information and State secret 
privileges in court, in particular regarding alleged human rights violations involving 
PMSCs; 
 (h) Release regular statistics on the number of private military and security 
contractors injured or killed while supporting United States operations; 
 (i) Allocate appropriate substantial new resources to federal agency 
contracting, acquisition, audit and Inspector General operations to ensure effective 
management and oversight of private security and other contractors; 
 (j) Ensure that the oversight of private military and security contractors is 
not outsourced to PMSCs; </b></p>

 (l) Establish a more vigorous vetting procedure before awarding contracts. 
This would require an assessment of past performance, including steps taken to 
provide victims with remedy and compensation for past abuses and to prevent further 
abuses. Otherwise, suspended or convicted companies and employees involved in 
human rights abuses should be banned;
