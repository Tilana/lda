and consolidating democracy, 57/221 of 18 December 2002 on strengthening the rule of 
law, and 59/201 of 20 December 2004 on enhancing the role of regional, subregional and

relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, in particular resolutions 1999/57 
of 27 April 1999 on the promotion of the right to democracy, 2000/47 of 25 April 2000 on 
promoting and consolidating democracy, 2001/41 of 23 April 2001 on continuing dialogue

of law, and Human Rights Council resolution 18/15 of 29 September 2011 on the 
incompatibility between democracy and racism, </p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that democracy, development and respect for all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that priority should 
be given to national and international action aimed at their promotion and strengthening, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of people to 
determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full 
participation in all aspects of their lives, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>that States are responsible for the promotion of all human rights, including 
the right to development, and the elimination of poverty and extreme poverty, all of which 
can contribute substantially to the promotion and consolidation of democracy and constitute 
a common and shared responsibility of States, and that good governance, including through 
transparency and accountability, is indispensable for building peaceful, prosperous and 
democratic societies, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming </i>the adoption by various regional, subregional and other organizations 
and initiatives of institutional rules and structures that recognize the interdependent 
relationship between democracy and the protection of human rights, and the adoption of 
mechanisms designed to promote it, to prevent situations which affect or threaten 
democratic institutions or to implement measures for the collective defence of democracy 
in the event of a serious disturbance or disruption of the democratic system, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that democracy and the rule of law are strengthened when States work 
to eliminate discrimination on account of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or 
other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, disability or other status and when 
they strive to ensure gender equality in decision-making, 
</p>
<p><i>Encouraged</i> by the wish of an increasing number of countries all over the world to 
devote their energy, means and political will to the building of democratic societies where 
individuals have the opportunity to shape their own destiny,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the democratization processes taking place in various regions of the 
world, which are motivated by the aspirations of peoples for justice, democracy and respect 
for human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> <i>also</i> General Assembly resolution 65/32 of 6 December 2010, in which 
the Assembly decided to convene a high-level meeting on the rule of law at the national and 
international levels during the high-level segment of its sixty-seventh session, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that, while democracies share common features, as laid out in the 
present resolution, there is no single model of democracy and that democracy does not 
belong to any country or region, and reaffirming also the necessity of due respect for 
sovereignty and the right to self-determination, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Stresses</i> that democracy includes respect for all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, inter alia, freedom of association and of peaceful assembly, freedom 
of expression and opinion, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, the right to be 
recognized everywhere as a person before the law and the right to take part in the conduct 
of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives, and to vote in a 
pluralistic system of political parties and organizations and to be elected at genuine, 
periodic, free and fair elections by universal and equal suffrage and by secret ballot 
guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the people, as well as respect for the rule of 
law, the separation of powers, the independence of the judiciary, transparency and 
accountability in public administration and decision-making and free, independent and 
pluralistic media;  
</p>
<p>2. <i>Reaffirms</i> the right of every citizen to vote and be elected at genuine periodic 
elections without discrimination of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, religion or 
belief, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, 
and stresses that persons entitled to vote must be free to vote for any candidate for election 
and free to support or to oppose government, without undue influence or coercion of any 
kind that may distort or inhibit the free expression of the elector&#8217;s will, and that the results </p>


<p>of genuine elections should be respected and implemented by all parties and stakeholders 
concerned;  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Stresses</i> that everyone must be able to express their grievances or aspirations, 
including through public and peaceful protests without fear of being injured, beaten, 
arbitrarily arrested and detained, tortured or killed or subjected to enforced disappearance;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reaffirms</i> that democracy is vital for the promotion and protection of all 
human rights;  
</p>
<p>5.  <i>Recalls</i> that the interdependence between a functioning democracy, strong 
and accountable institutions, transparent and inclusive decision-making and effective rule 
of law is essential for a legitimate and effective Government that is respectful of human 
rights;  
</p>
<p>6. <i>Emphasizes</i> the crucial role played by political parties in opposition in the 
proper functioning of a democracy;  
</p>
<p>7.  <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure a conducive environment for free and 
independent media;

rights defenders to the promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and to 
create a safe and enabling environment for their work;  
</p>
<p>9. <i>Stresses</i> the need for the international community to assist and support 
countries emerging from conflict or undergoing democratization, as they may face special 
challenges in addressing legacies of human rights violations during their transition and in 
moving towards democratic governance and the rule of law;  
</p>
<p> 10.  <i>Welcomes</i> the encouraging developments in countries on all continents where 
free elections have taken place for the first time, positive constitutional changes have been 
enacted and democratic institutions have been strengthened, thus building confidence in 
representational governance and contributing to greater national and regional peace and 
stability;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recalls</i> that democratization can be a fragile process and that the respect of 
human rights and the rule of law are essential for the stability of democratic societies, 
including in the context of using information and communication technologies such as the 
Internet, mobile networks and social media tools; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Also recalls</i> that States are guarantors of democracy, human rights, good 
governance and the rule of law and bear responsibility for their full implementation;  
</p>
<p>13. <i>Reaffirms</i> that any form of impunity condoned by public authorities for 
crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of 
law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such acts;  
</p>
<p>14. <i>Condemns</i> political platforms and organizations based on racism, xenophobia 
or doctrines of racial superiority and related discrimination, as well as legislation and 
practices based on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, as 
incompatible with democracy and transparent and accountable governance;  
</p>
<p>15. <i>Acknowledges</i> the fundamental importance of human rights education and 
training in contributing to the promotion, protection and effective realization of all human 
rights;  
</p>

legislative bodies, and acknowledges their fundamental role in the promotion and 
protection of human rights, democracy and the rule of law;  </p>

</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Upholding the separation of powers by taking appropriate constitutional, 
legislative, judicial and other institutional measures;
