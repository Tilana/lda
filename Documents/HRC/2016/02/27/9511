OF 15 MARCH 2006 ENTITLED &#8220;HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>Report of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>GE.07-10530  (E)    160207 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> Established by resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 February 1980 of the Commission on 
Human Rights, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances was the first 
United Nations human rights thematic mechanism to be established with a global mandate.  
This report, submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council decision 1/102, reflects 
communications and cases examined by the Working Group during its sessions in 2006.  The 
total number of cases transmitted by the Working Group to Governments since the Working 
Group&#8217;s inception is 51,531.  The number of cases under active consideration that have not yet 
been clarified or discontinued stands at 41,232 and concerns 79 States.  The Working Group has 
been able to clarify 2,791 cases over the past five years.  During the period under review, the 
Working Group transmitted 335 new cases of enforced disappearances to the Governments of 
Algeria, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, India, the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, the 
Syrian Arab Republic and Thailand.  Of the newly reported cases, 79 allegedly occurred in 2006.  
A summary of activities during the last year is presented in a table for each country, with a 
detailed text description of the areas of activity. 
</p>
<p> Concerns of the Working Group include that in numerous post-conflict situations or 
where democratic transition follows a period of widespread human rights violations, 
disappearances frequently remain unresolved and persecution of people working on 
disappearance cases continues for many years.  It has been reported that in some countries, 
new Governments need to do more to clarify past cases of disappearances and ensure a strong 
system of rule of law whereby people are free to pursue truth and justice.  In addition, new 
Governments need to be assisted with judicial reforms, strengthening State institutions and 
re-establishing the rule of law. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group reiterates its concern that the enactment of amnesty laws and the 
implementation of other measures that lead to impunity are contrary to article 18 of the 
Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and may perpetuate 
continuing human rights abuses for many years. 
</p>
<p> In connection with the above, the Working Group is gravely concerned about increasing 
numbers of reports it has received in the past year concerning the disappearance of human rights 
defenders and acts of intimidation, persecution or reprisal against human rights defenders, 
witnesses, legal counsel and relatives of disappeared persons seeking to discover the fate or 
whereabouts of those who have disappeared.  States are reminded of their obligation under 
article 13 (3) of the Declaration to protect against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal all 
persons involved in the investigation of disappearances. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group is concerned that in some regions, non-governmental organizations 
are not present, organized, or well-funded enough to be able to work effectively on 
disappearances. 
</p>
<p> During the reporting period November 2005 to November 2006 the Working Group 
conducted a country visit to Guatemala.  The report of the country visit to Guatemala is 
contained in an addendum to this report. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The mandate 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances was the first 
United Nations human rights thematic mechanism to be established with a universal mandate.  
The Working Group derives its original mandate from Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 February 1980.  This resolution followed General Assembly 
resolution 33/173 of 20 December 1978, in which the Assembly expressed concern over reports 
from various parts of the world relating to enforced disappearances and requested the 
Commission on Human Rights to consider the question of missing or disappeared persons. 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group&#8217;s mandate was elaborated in General Assembly resolution 47/133 
of 18 December 1992, entitled &#8220;Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance&#8221;.  The mandate was most recently extended by Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 2004/40 of 19 April 2004 and Human Rights Council decision 1/102 of 30 June 2006. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group&#8217;s mandate is humanitarian.  It serves as a channel for 
communication between family members and Governments.  The primary task of the Working 
Group is to clarify the fate or whereabouts of persons who are reported to have disappeared.  
</p>
<p>4. In addition to its core mandate, the Working Group has also been entrusted, according to 
Commission resolution 2004/40, with the task of monitoring the progress of States in fulfilling 
obligations derived from the Declaration. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>5. The methods of work were most recently revised by the Working Group 
(E/CN.4/2002/79, annex I) and approved by the Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>6. The Working Group does not deal with situations of international armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>7. The Working Group&#8217;s mandate is defined to cover violations carried out by State agents 
or non-State actors acting with the acquiescence or consent of the State. 
</p>
<p>8. <b>Standard procedure</b>.<b> </b> Reported cases of disappearances are placed before the Working 
Group for detailed examination during its sessions.  Those which fulfil the requirements as 
described in the methods of work are transmitted by letter from the Working Group&#8217;s 
Chairperson-Rapporteur to the Government concerned through the Permanent Representative to 
the United Nations Office at Geneva or New York with the request to inform the Working Group 
about the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared persons (generally the current address or 
documented record of death or absence).  It is common for the Working Group to facilitate 
subsequent exchanges of information between the source and the Government until the case is 
clarified (see paragraph 11). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>9. <b>Urgent actions</b>.  Cases that reportedly occurred within the three months preceding 
receipt of the report by the Working Group and otherwise fulfil the requirements for standard 
cases are transmitted directly to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the country concerned by 
the most direct and rapid means.  The Working Group provides the source with a copy of the 
summary of each urgent action, thus helping it to enter into communication with the authorities 
on the case concerned. 
</p>
<p>10. <b>Follow-up on cases</b>.  All cases of enforced disappearance remain under active 
consideration by the Working Group until they are clarified.  The crime of enforced 
disappearance, as defined in the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, is a continuous crime until the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person 
becomes known. 
</p>
<p>11.<b> Clarification</b>.  A case is clarified when information is provided which can clearly 
establish the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person.  In general, the Working Group has 
found information sufficient to clearly establish a person&#8217;s whereabouts when the Government 
provides the address where the person is currently living, whether the address of the person&#8217;s 
home or that of the place where the person is being imprisoned or detained.  As information 
establishing a person&#8217;s fate, i.e. when the person is reported dead, in general, a copy of a death 
certificate has been sufficient. 
</p>
<p>12. <b>Six-month rule</b>.  In all cases where the Working Group considers that a government 
reply contains sufficient information on the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person that 
could constitute a clarification, it applies the six-month rule.  This means that if the source does 
not respond within six months of the date on which the reply was communicated to it, or if it 
contests the Government&#8217;s information on grounds that are considered to be unreasonable by the 
Working Group, the case is considered clarified. 
</p>
<p>13. <b>Prompt intervention actions</b>.<b>  </b>The Working Group also takes prompt intervention 
actions in connection with acts of intimidation, persecution or reprisal against relatives of 
missing persons and private individuals or persons who seek to discover the fate or whereabouts 
of disappeared persons.  Prompt intervention letters are sent to the Government concerned with 
the appeal that it take immediate steps to protect all the fundamental rights of the persons 
affected. 
</p>
<p>14. <b>General allegations</b>.<b>  </b>In addition to dealing with individual cases of disappearance, the 
Working Group also reports upon general allegations.  These general allegations derive from a 
summary of allegations received from relatives of missing persons and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) with regard to obstacles encountered in the implementation of the 
Declaration in their respective countries, inviting them to comment.  The Working Group 
transmits the general allegations to Governments for their response. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Disappearance as a global problem 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Working Group was initially formed to address the legacy of disappearance arising 
from authoritarian rule in Latin America.  Now, however, disappearance is a global problem. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>16. Today, disappearances tend to occur in States suffering from internal conflict, such as 
Colombia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, the Philippines and the Russian Federation.  In some cases radical 
political changes created conditions that led to hundreds of cases of disappearance.  Elsewhere, 
hundreds and in some countries thousands of cases of disappearance remain unresolved and as 
such are ongoing crimes.  Countries such as Algeria, Iraq, some countries in Central America, 
Peru, Chile and Argentina may be mentioned in this regard. 
</p>
<p>17. The Working Group would also draw attention to the phenomenon of underreporting of 
disappearance cases.  Reasons include poverty, illiteracy, feelings of powerlessness, fear of 
reprisal, weak administration of justice, ineffectual reporting channels, institutionalized systems 
of impunity, a practice of silence and, in some regions, restrictions on the work of civil society 
on this sensitive issue.  Nevertheless, the Working Group continues to receive positive 
information on the development of a cross-regional network of associations of families of 
victims and NGOs that are dealing with this issue and commends these efforts. 
</p>
<p>18. In the context of internal armed conflict, such as in Nepal, Uganda and Colombia, 
opposition forces have reportedly perpetrated disappearances.  While the mandate of the 
Working Group is limited to violations carried out by State agents or non-State actors acting with 
the consent or acquiescence of the State, the Working Group condemns the practice of 
disappearance irrespective of who the perpetrators may be. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  The present report 
</b></p>
<p>19. The report reflects communications and cases examined by the Working Group during its 
sessions in 2006 and covers the period November 2005 to November 2006. 
</p>
<p>20. A summary of activities during the reporting period is presented in a table for each 
country, with a detailed text description of the areas of activity.  Where there has been no 
correspondence or other activity during the period, only the table is provided and a reference is 
made to a description of cases. 
</p>
<p>21. In countries where the number of newly reported cases is less than 10, the names of the 
persons appear in the country section.  If the number of newly reported cases is greater than 10, 
the list of names appears in annex IV. 
</p>
<p>22. The total number of cases transmitted by the Working Group to Governments since the 
Working Group&#8217;s inception is now 51,531.  The total number of cases under active consideration 
that have not yet been clarified or discontinued stands at 41,232 and concerns 79<b> </b>States.  Over 
the past five years, the Working Group has been able to clarify 2,791 cases. 
</p>
<p>23. With respect to staffing, the situation has now stabilized.  The Working Group looks 
forward to maintaining its improved ability to act as an effective channel of communication 
between Governments and families or representatives of victims.  It is recalled that recent cases 
of disappearance are the priority of the Working Group.  Large volumes of cases submitted to the 
Working Group many years after the person disappeared are processed by the secretariat and 
reviewed by the Working Group as an ongoing process. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Areas of particular concern during the reporting period 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Working Group is concerned that in numerous post-conflict situations or democratic 
transitions following a period of widespread human rights violations, disappearances frequently 
remain unresolved and persecution of people working on disappearance cases continues for 
many years.  It has been reported that in some countries, new Governments need to do more to 
clarify past cases of disappearances and ensure a strong system of rule of law whereby people 
are free to pursue truth and justice.  In addition, new Governments need to be assisted with 
judicial reforms, strengthening State institutions and re-establishing the rule of law. 
</p><p>25. The Working Group reiterates its concern that the enactment of amnesty laws and the 
implementation of other measures that lead to impunity are contrary to article 18 of the 
Declaration and may perpetuate human rights abuses for many years. 
</p>
<p>26. In connection with the above, the Working Group is gravely concerned about increasing 
numbers of reports it has received during the reporting period concerning the disappearance of 
human rights defenders and acts of intimidation, persecution or reprisal against human rights 
defenders, witnesses, legal counsel and relatives of disappeared persons seeking to discover the 
fate or whereabouts of those who have disappeared.  Particular concern is noted in such countries 
as Algeria, Argentina, Colombia, Guatemala, the Russian Federation and Thailand. 
</p>
<p>27. States are reminded of their obligation under article 13 (3) of the Declaration to protect 
against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal all persons involved in the investigation of 
disappearances. 
</p>
<p>28. The Working Group is concerned that in some regions, NGOs are not present, organized, 
or well-funded enough to be able to work effectively on disappearances. 
</p>
<p><b>II. ACTIVITIES OF THE WORKING GROUP ON ENFORCED 
OR INVOLUNTARY DISAPPEARANCES FROM 
NOVEMBER 2005 TO NOVEMBER 2006 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>29. During the period under review, the Working Group held three sessions in Geneva.  
The seventy-eighth session was held from 24 to 28 April 2006, the seventy-ninth session 
from 24 to 28 July 2006 and the eightieth session from 20 to 29 November 2006. 
</p>
<p>30. At its seventy-ninth session, the Working Group elected a new Chairperson-Rapporteur, 
Mr. Santiago Corcuera.  The other members of the Working Group are Mr. J. &#8216;Bayo Adekanye, 
Mr. Saied Rajaie Khorasani, Mr. Darko G&#246;ttlicher, and Mr. Stephen J. Toope. 
</p><p>31. Mr. Corcuera attended the annual meeting of the special rapporteurs/representatives, 
independent experts and chairpersons of working groups of the special procedures of the 
Commission on Human Rights/Human Rights Council in June 2006. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>32. During the period under review, the Working Group met formally with representatives of 
the Governments of Argentina, Guatemala, Japan, Kuwait, Nepal, Venezuela and Yemen.  The 
Working Group also met with representatives of human rights organizations, associations of 
relatives of disappeared persons and families or witnesses directly concerned with reported cases 
of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>33. During the second session of the Human Rights Council, the former 
Chairperson-Rapporteur, Mr. Toope, met with the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka 
to the United Nations.  He also met with NGOs from Asia and with representatives of 
Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists to 
discuss specific country situations and the work of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>34. On 22 November 2006, the Chairperson-Rapporteur, Mr. Corcuera, participated in the 
meeting of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Review of Mandates of the Council, 
where he spoke of the relationships between the mandate holders and between the 
mandate holders and other human rights mechanisms and actors, as well as the support to the 
special procedures offered by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Communications 
</b></p>
<p>35. During the period under review, the Working Group transmitted 335 new cases of 
enforced disappearances to the Governments of Algeria, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, 
Guatemala, Honduras, India, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, the 
Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Thailand. 
</p>
<p>36. The Working Group sent 87 of these cases under the urgent action procedure to the 
Governments of Algeria, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, Honduras, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 
Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, the Syrian Arab 
Republic and Thailand. 
</p>
<p>37. Of the newly reported cases, 79 allegedly occurred during the reporting period and 
relate to Algeria, China, Colombia, Honduras, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Nepal, Pakistan, 
the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, the Syrian Arab Republic and Thailand. 
</p>
<p>38. During the same period, the Working Group clarified 152 cases in the following 
countries:  Algeria, Brazil, Chad, Chile, China, Honduras, Morocco, Mexico, Nepal, Turkey, 
Uruguay, Uzbekistan and Yemen. 
</p>
<p>39. During the reporting period, the Working Group sent five prompt intervention 
communications addressing harassment of and threats to human rights defenders and relatives 
of disappeared persons in Algeria, Argentina, Nepal and Thailand.  The Working Group also 
sent seven general allegations to the Governments of Algeria, Colombia, Nepal, Peru, the 
Russian Federation, Sri Lanka and the United States of America. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>40. At the invitation of the Government of Guatemala, Working Group members 
Santiago Corcuera and Darko G&#246;ttlicher, with staff from the Secretariat, visited Guatemala City </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>from 19 to 21 September.  The mission fulfilled part of a request by the Working Group to 
conduct a regional visit to Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, countries with 
significant numbers of cases that have been outstanding for many years.  The delegation met 
with numerous high-ranking public officials, as well as with NGOs and families of the 
disappeared. 
</p>
<p>41. The report of the country visit to Guatemala is contained in an addendum to this report.  
It contains an overview of the constitutional and legal framework on disappearances.  It reviews 
the institutional steps the country has taken to address disappearances and the measures adopted 
to guarantee victims&#8217; rights under the Declaration.  It examines the gap between the advanced 
legal framework and clear expressions of political will on the part of the Government and the 
lack of significant results.  The Working Group makes specific recommendations to the 
Government, including a request for information providing for the clarification of the more 
than 2,000 cases of disappeared persons still pending with the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>42. The Working Group has requested visits to Algeria, Argentina, El Salvador, 
Honduras, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nepal, Nicaragua, the Philippines, the 
Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, the Sudan and Timor-Leste.  The Working Group will visit 
Argentina in March 2007, immediately after holding its eighty-first session in Buenos Aires.  A 
mission to El Salvador and Honduras has been confirmed for February 2007, and the Working 
Group is still awaiting a reply to its request for a visit to Nicaragua.  The Russian Federation has 
agreed in principle to a country visit and the Working Group has proposed that it take place in 
September 2007.  The Government of Sri Lanka stated that it would not be possible to schedule a 
visit by the Working Group in early 2007 because other special rapporteurs would be visiting the 
country at that time, but that it had taken note of the Working Group&#8217;s request.  The Government 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran agreed to a visit by the Working Group in 2005, which was 
delayed at the request of the Government.  Regretfully, the Government of Algeria has not 
responded to repeated interest expressed by the Working Group in visiting the country. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Participation in the intersessional working group on a  
draft legally binding normative instrument for the  
protection of all persons from enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances participated in all the 
meetings of the intersessional working group to draft a legally binding normative instrument for 
the protection of all persons from enforced disappearance.  The Working Group supported the 
approval of the draft international convention for the protection of all persons from enforced 
disappearance by the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Statements and studies </b></p>
<p>44. For the report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session 
(A/61/289) on the question of enforced or involuntary disappearances, the Working Group 
prepared a submission which identified obstacles to the realization of the provisions of the 
Declaration and recommended various ways of overcoming those obstacles. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>45. On 26 August 2006, to commemorate the International Day of the Disappeared  
on 30 August, the Working Group issued a press release reiterating its solidarity with all  
those who suffer from enforced disappearance and paying tribute to human rights defenders 
working on behalf of disappeared persons and their relatives. 
</p>
<p>46. The Working Group issued statements on 30 March and 28 June 2006 
and 3 November 2006 urging the approval of the draft international convention for  
the protection of all persons from enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>47. At its seventy-fifth session, the Working Group decided to prepare a comparative study 
on the criminal law treatment of enforced or involuntary disappearances in States around the 
globe.  Article 4 of the Declaration requires that States treat all acts of enforced disappearance as 
&#8220;offences under criminal law punishable by appropriate penalties which shall take into account 
their extreme seriousness&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>48. The Working Group sent a note verbale inviting all Governments to provide information 
concerning the treatment of enforced or involuntary disappearances within their national law as 
part of input into the comparative study.  Many of the 18 Governments which responded to the 
invitation provided very detailed information.  A preliminary analysis reveals that outside of 
Latin America, very few States have created a specific criminal offence of enforced 
disappearance.  Work on the comparative study is continuing.

<p><b>Urgent action 
</b></p>
<p>50. One case was sent to the Government of Algeria under the urgent action procedure.   
The case concerned <b>Nouaman Meziche</b>, who disappeared from Houari Boumediene airport  
on 5 January 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Working Group transmitted 31 newly reported cases<b> </b>of disappearance which 
allegedly occurred in the 1990s. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>52. No information was received from the Government regarding outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Working Group received new information from sources on 44 cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarifications 
</b></p>
<p>54. Based on information provided by sources, the Working Group decided to clarify 
two cases.  Regarding the disappearance of Nouaman Meziche, it was reported that he was 
released after 45 days of secret detention.  In the second case, regarding a man who disappeared 
in 1999, the source reported where he is being imprisoned. 
</p>

</b>  See annex IV for the list of the newly reported cases of disappeared persons. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group and the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions continued a dialogue with the Government 
regarding the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation.  On 2 March 2006, the two mandate 
holders expressed further concern regarding the latest legislation based on the Charter.  The 
authors congratulated the Government for its decision to refuse amnesty for the gravest crimes 
but regretted the fact that perpetrators of extrajudicial executions, torture and enforced 
disappearances could be granted amnesty.  They also noted that the Government&#8217;s decision 
regarding compensation to victims&#8217; families reflected in chapter five violated articles 17 and 18 
of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>56. In a reply dated 24 March 2006 the Government recalled that its position was based on 
the will of the sovereign people and on a clearly realistic solution.  It recalled that the ordinance 
that brought the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation into effect was adopted on the 
basis of a democratic referendum.  The Government stated that all victims of the national tragedy 
would be taken into account.  The communication stressed that protecting human rights was 
indeed the responsibility of the State which had spared no effort to investigate and prosecute  
the perpetrators of human rights violations in any form.  
</p>
<p>57. The mandate holders wrote on 17 May 2006, agreeing that it was up to the Algerian 
people to decide on their own internal solutions for a lasting peace.  The letter highlighted the 
commitments the Government had made to the international community and to its own people, 
which included conducting exhaustive investigations with respect to disappeared persons where 
the right to life was jeopardized. 
<b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>58. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning alleged obstacles 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration by the Government of Algeria (see 
paragraph 14).  This information was transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>59. It was reported that the arrest and disappearance of thousands of people by security 
forces and State-armed militias since 1992 have not yet been investigated and that this remains a 
key obstacle to addressing the legacy of the recent conflict.  
</p>
<p>60. With respect to the amnesty laws introduced in February 2006, it was reported that these 
grant security forces impunity for crimes under international law, including crimes against 
humanity and other serious violations, committed during the conflict of the 1990s.  Allegedly, 
complaints against security forces cannot be investigated by Algerian courts and criticism of the 
forces is punishable by imprisonment.  The amnesty laws reportedly are based on the Charter for 
Peace and National Reconciliation, which denies the responsibility of State security forces for 
massive human rights violations in the exercise of their duties.   
</p>
<p>61. NGOs have expressed concern about members of armed groups who have been granted 
measures of clemency and exemption from prosecution, including for acts constituting crimes 
under international law.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>62. Victims of human rights abuses, human rights defenders and others have criticized the 
new measures for failing to uphold the rights of victims and their families to truth and justice.  
Some have reportedly been intimidated by State agents to stifle criticism.  
</p>
<p>63. Finally, it has been reported that the President of the National Consultative  
Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights publicly declared that 183  
of the 6,146 disappeared persons registered in the Commission&#8217;s files had been found alive.  
NGOs have reported that the veracity of this statement could not be confirmed.  A list of the 
names of these persons has not been published.   
</p>
<p>64. No response was received from the Government regarding the general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Working Group first transmitted a request for an invitation to undertake a visit to 
Algeria in 2000.  The Working Group has sent reminders of this request but has not yet received 
a reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>66. The majority of the cases reported to the Working Group in the past involved persons 
who reportedly disappeared between 1993 and 1997 and concerned a wide variety of persons 
from across Algerian society, including children, women and elderly people.  The 
disappearances were attributed to the army, the security services, the gendarmerie, the police, 
civil defence forces, or the militia. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>67. In the past and during the period under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 1,640 cases to the Government; of those, 9 cases have been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the Government, 9 cases have been clarified on the basis of information 
provided by the source and 1,622 cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Working Group expresses deep concern that little progress has been made in 
clarifying cases of disappearance in Algeria.  New cases arising from the 1990s continue to be 
received by the Working Group and are being transmitted to the Government of Algeria.  
</p>
<p>69. The Working Group strongly recommends that the Government of Algeria allow 
NGOs to undertake their work freely and without impediment, that families of victims of 
disappearances be left free to organize without bureaucratic restriction or legislative obstacles, 
and that witnesses be protected. 
</p>
<p>70. The Working Group reminds the Government of Algeria of its obligations under 
article 14 of the Declaration &#8220;to bring to justice all persons presumed responsible for an act of 
enforced disappearance&#8221;.<b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>71. The Working Group reaffirms its request to the Government of Algeria for a country visit 
aimed at clarifying the 1,622 outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p>72. The Working Group recalls the guidelines contained in paragraphs 2 and 8 (c) of the 
Working Group&#8217;s general comment on article 18 of the Declaration.  Paragraph 2 of the general 
comment on article 18 states that &#8220;[a]n amnesty law should be considered as being contrary to 
the provisions of the Declaration even where endorsed by a referendum or similar consultation 
procedure&#8221;.  Moreover, paragraph 8 (c) of the general comment specifies that &#8220;[p]erpetrators of 
disappearances shall not benefit from such laws if the State has not fulfilled its obligations to 
investigate the relevant circumstances surrounding disappearances, identify and detain the 
perpetrators, and ensure the satisfaction of the right to justice, truth, information, redress, 
reparation, rehabilitation and compensation to the victims&#8221;.

<p>77. Communications reviewed by the Working Group during the last year, 
dated 15 March 2005, 20 September 2005 and 14 June 2006, contained a total of 82 replies to 
cases.  The Working Group decided that in 55 cases, the replies had sufficient information on the 
fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person and could constitute clarifications, provided the 
source did not raise an objection within six months (see paragraph 12).  With respect to the 
remaining 27 cases, the Government responses were not considered sufficient to constitute 
clarifications. 
</p>
<p>78. The replies received by the Working Group included information from the Government 
involving 10 children who were born to women who were reported to the Working Group as 
disappeared.  The Government informed the Working Group that these children were &#8220;located 
and their identities were reinstated&#8221;.  The fate or whereabouts of the mothers of these children 
has not yet been clarified and their cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p>79. Another two communications dated 19 October and 3 November 2006 were received by 
the Working Group, but the information could not be translated by the United Nations translation 
services in time for consideration for inclusion in the present report.  
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>80. No information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Prompt intervention  
</b></p>
<p>81. On 18 October 2006, a prompt intervention letter (see paragraph 13) was sent by the 
Working Group to the Government of Argentina regarding alleged reprisals and witness 
protection.  One witness, Ms. Nilda Eloy, who had testified at a trial of a perpetrator of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>disappearances, was reportedly threatened and intimidated.  Another key witness in the same 
trial, Mr. Jorge Julio L&#243;pez, who himself was a former victim of enforced disappearance, went 
missing on Monday, 18 September. 
</p>
<p>82. The Government replied to the prompt intervention letter and informed the Working 
Group regarding the extensive actions undertaken in the search for the missing witness and the 
creation of a plan to protect all witnesses in highly political cases.  
</p>
<p><b>Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>83. During the seventy-ninth session, the Working Group met with government 
representatives to discuss outstanding cases and action being taken to clarify outstanding cases.  
</p>
<p>84. During the same session, the Working Group met with NGO representatives to discuss 
issues in relation to past disappearances in Argentina and recent related events. 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>85. During its seventy-fifth session, the Working Group gratefully accepted the invitation of 
the Government to conduct a mission to Argentina.  It was decided that the mission would take 
place immediately following the session of the Working Group to be held in Buenos Aires in 
March 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>86. The vast majority of the 3,445 previously reported cases of disappearance<b>1</b> occurred 
between 1975 and 1978 under the military Government, in the context of its campaign against 
left wing guerrillas and their alleged sympathizers.  Two cases occurred in 2000 and concerned 
persons allegedly arrested in the city of Mendoza by members of the local police investigation 
office (Direcci&#243;n de Investigaciones de la Polic&#237;a).  The other seven cases concerned persons 
who were allegedly detained by the police in 2002, following a demonstration. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>87. Of the 87 cases previously clarified by the Working Group, 44 were clarified on the basis 
of information provided by the Government and 43 on the basis of information provided by the 
source.  In respect of the 3,358 outstanding cases, the Working Group is unable to report on the 
fate or whereabouts of the disappeared persons. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>88. The Working Group welcomes the creation of a comprehensive database to establish the 
fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons in that country by the Government.  As well, the 
commencement of trials against perpetrators is highly commended, and should be an example to 
other countries.  The Working Group hopes that through continued cooperation with the 
Government and NGOs, progress can be made towards the clarification of the 3,358 cases that 
remain unresolved. </p>

<p>89. The Working Group transmitted one case to the Government of Bangladesh under its

allegedly abducted at gunpoint on her way home from school in November 2005, by people from 
the trade union wing of the ruling Bangladesh National Party. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>90. The Government of Bangladesh sent two communications to the Working Group on 
developments concerning the investigation of the case of the 14-year-old girl (see paragraph 89).  
In the first communication, dated 7 February 2006, the Government reported that the case had 
been forwarded to the concerned Bangladeshi authorities.  On 9 June 2006, the Government 
stated that one of the alleged perpetrators was her fianc&#233; and that she had left voluntarily.

<p>107. The majority of the 63 cases of disappearances reported in the past occurred 
between 1969 and 1975, under the military Government, in particular, during the period 
of guerrilla warfare in the Aerugo region.  The majority of the cases were clarified by the 
Working Group in 1996 on the basis of legal provisions (Law No. 9.140/95), whereby persons 
who disappeared by reason of their political activities in the period 1961-1979 are considered to 
have died.  Relatives of the victims are legally entitled to decline this legal provision or exercise 
the right to request death certificates.  Four recent cases concern land workers in the State of 
Pernambuco, who disappeared on 31 May 2004 after having allegedly been arrested by police 
officers. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding

received too late for review by the Working Group and will be examined at the eighty-first 
session in early 2007.  
</p>
<p><b>Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>141. During the eightieth session, the Working Group met with NGO representatives to 
discuss the situation of disappearances in Colombia.  
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>142. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning alleged obstacles 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration by the Government of Colombia (see 
paragraph 14).  This information was transmitted to the Government. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>143. According to reports, the Justice and Peace Law, approved in 2005 to facilitate the 
demobilization of members of illegal armed groups, has failed to uphold international standards 
on the right of victims to truth, justice and reparation.  
</p><p>144. Reportedly, this law gives judicial investigators strict time limits to investigate each case, 
with little incentive for potential beneficiaries of mitigation to collaborate with investigators.  
The participation of victims in legal proceedings is limited, and there are no provisions to reveal 
the involvement of third parties, such as the security forces, who have reportedly played an 
integral part in supporting human rights violations carried out by paramilitaries.  
</p>
<p>145. No reply was received from the Government regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>146. The majority of the 1,165 cases of disappearance reported in the past occurred beginning 
in 1981.  In a large number of these cases, those responsible were allegedly members of 
paramilitary groups whose actions were believed to have been undertaken with the complicity or 
acquiescence of members of the State security forces.  Those disappeared included members of 
trade unions, peasants and community workers. 
</p>
<p>147. The Working Group undertook a mission to Colombia from 5 to 13 July 2005.  The 
report of the mission is contained in document E/CN.4/2006/56/Add.1.  The Working Group&#8217;s 
recommendations included to halt the continuing pattern of disappearances in the country, to 
protect the families of victims and non-governmental organizations working to discover the fate 
or whereabouts of disappeared persons, to address the problem of underreporting of cases of 
disappearance, to align domestic legislation with the State&#8217;s obligations under the Declaration on 
the Protection of the Rights of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and to more effectively 
implement the existing legal mechanisms on disappearances in Colombia. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>148. In the past and during the period under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 1,224 cases to the Government; of those, 67 cases have been clarified on the basis 
of information provided by the source, 201 cases have been clarified on the basis of information 
provided by the Government and 956 cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>149. The Working Group is deeply concerned about the new cases that continue to occur in 
Colombia.  
</p>
<p>150. The Working Group welcomes the decision of the Constitutional Court of Colombia 
declaring ineffective the relevant provisions of the Justice and Peace Law, which the Working 
Group had identified as potentially contrary to international human rights law, in particular the 
right to truth of victims. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>151. The Working Group again urges the Government of Colombia to take effective measures 
to clarify outstanding cases and to implement the recommendations contained in the report of the 
Working Group issued after its country visit of 5-13 July 2005.  The Working Group invited the 
Government to submit a report within one year on the measures taken to implement the 
recommendations and looks forward to receiving this.

<p>153. The Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea transmitted a 
communication to the Working Group on 24 May 2006 in which it replied concerning all nine 
outstanding cases.  The Government stated that with regard to the eight cases of Japanese 
nationals, it had already provided the Government of Japan with detailed information on those </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>persons.  With regard to the other outstanding case concerning a national of the Republic of 
Korea who allegedly disappeared on the border between China and the Democratic People&#8217;s 
Republic of Korea, the Government stated that it had undertaken an investigation into the case 
and that neither that incident nor any similar act had occurred in the border area.  
</p>
<p>154. In a reply dated 12 September 2006, the Government reported that in a recent press

<p>172. The majority of the 2,661 reported cases of disappearance occurred between 1980 
and 1983, in the context of the armed conflict between the Government of El Salvador and the 
Farabundo Mart&#237; National Liberation Front.  Many people disappeared following arrest by 
uniformed soldiers or police, or were abducted in death-squad style operations carried out by 
armed men wearing civilian clothing and reportedly linked to the Army or to the security forces.  
Abductions of this kind in some cases subsequently became formal detentions, thus giving rise to 
allegations of links with the security forces. </p>

three periods:  1981-1985, 1986-1990 and 1991-1994.  Most of the cases that occurred during the 
first period concerned members or supporters of the Haitian Christian Democrat Party who were 
allegedly arrested by members of the Armed Forces or by the Tonton Macoutes.  The cases that 
occurred during the second period concerned persons who were reportedly arrested by armed 
men in civilian clothes, members of the Anti-Gang and Investigation Service, and by the police.  
The last wave of cases took place in the aftermath of the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat which ousted 
President Aristide in 1991.

<p><b>Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>202. The Working Group transmitted one case to the Government under its urgent action 
procedure concerning the disappearance of Jorge Ruiz, who was travelling from Tegucigalpa 
toward Cocoa when he was reportedly arrested by five agents from the Direction of Criminal 
Investigation.  
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>203. The Government provided information on 28 September 2006 on the case referred to in 
the preceding paragraph.  The information could not be translated by the United Nations 
translation services in time for consideration by the Working Group for inclusion in the present 
report.  
</p>
<p>204. The Working Group reviewed government replies concerning 125 cases.  In 118 cases, 
the Working Group decided that the information provided was not sufficient to consider the 
cases clarified and decided to retransmit these cases to the authorities.  In five others, the 
Working Group decided to apply the six-month rule (see paragraph 12).  
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>205. The Working Group received new information from sources regarding 20 outstanding 
cases of disappeared persons which had taken place in the 1980s.  The information detailed the 
efforts carried out by the families of the victims to learn the whereabouts of their disappeared 
relatives.  
</p>
<p><b>Clarifications 
</b></p>
<p>206. Based on the information received from the Government, the Working Group decided to 
clarify the five cases mentioned in paragraph 204 following the expiration of the six-month rule 
(see paragraph 11).  In all cases the deaths of the subjects were confirmed and the families 
received compensation from the Government. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>207. Following a decision of the Working Group at the seventy-eighth session, a request for a 
visit as part of a four-country initiative in Central America was sent to the Government of 
Honduras on 23 May 2006.  The Government agreed and dates are being finalized for the 
mission to take place in February 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>208. The majority of the 202 previously reported cases occurred between 1981 and 1984.  
Reportedly, the Armed Forces and heavily armed men in plain clothes seized people perceived to 
be ideological enemies and took them to clandestine detention centres.  Four cases reportedly 
occurred in 1983 and concerned leaders of the Revolutionary Party of Central American 
Workers-Honduras, including a Jesuit priest, who were allegedly captured by the Honduran 
Army.  Two of these persons were reportedly citizens of the United States.  Allegedly, the 
United States Army and Central Intelligence Agency personnel may have helped the Honduran 
Army in the Olancho operation in which, according to the Honduran Army, these persons were 
killed.   
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding

<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>211. The Working Group transmitted one newly reported case of disappearance, concerning 
<b>Sukwinder Singh Batti</b>, a criminal defence lawyer who had represented victims of human rights 
abuses.  He was reportedly last seen in 1994 in an unofficial detention centre located in Bahadur.  
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>212. In a communication dated 10 April 2006, the Government replied on three outstanding 
cases.  In one case the Government stated that the subject, a militant from a pro-Pakistani group, 
Al-Jehad, had been released and was now at home.  In another case, concerning the 
disappearance of an owner of a hardware shop, the Government reported that the subject&#8217;s dead 
body was recovered from an orchard and handed over to the relatives.  The Working Group 
considered that both replies could be clarifications, provided that the source did not raise 
objections within six months (see paragraph 12).  In the third case, the Government provided 
new information on the subject, a 33-year-old watchman, and the circumstances concerning  
his arrest, but the Working Group considered it to be insufficient to determine the fate or 
whereabouts of the person.  
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>213. A source replied concerning one case of a criminal defence lawyer who reportedly 
disappeared in 1994 (see paragraph 211), stating that an inquiry report remains pending before 
the Supreme Court.  
</p>
<p><b>Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>214. The Working Group decided to clarify one case, concerning a 17-year-old student who 
disappeared in 1999, where the six-month rule had been previously applied (see paragraph 11).  
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>215. On 13 July 2005, the Working Group requested to undertake a mission to India in the 
course of 2006.  The request was based on an expected significant increase in the number of 
cases to be submitted by an NGO.  However, these cases were not submitted.  As a result, the 
Working Group decided at its eightieth session to withdraw its request for a visit to India.  
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>216. Most of the cases of disappearance reported to the Working Group occurred 
between 1983 and 2004, in the context of ethnic and religious disturbances in the Punjab and 
Kashmir regions.  The disappearances were allegedly related to wide powers granted to the 
security forces under emergency legislation, in particular the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities 
Act and the Public Security Act, which allow for both preventive and prolonged detention in the 
absence of normal safeguards available under the criminal codes.  The victims included 
two children, one aged 13 and one aged 16, students, a religious leader, journalists and human </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>rights activists.  Regarding a case of a Kashmiri who disappeared in Kathmandu, it was reported 
that the Indian Embassy in Nepal was involved in his arrest.  In accordance with the Working 
Group&#8217;s methods of work, a copy of this case was sent to the Government of India (see also 
section on Nepal, paragraph 300). 
</p>
<p>217. Three cases concerned members of the Akhil Bharatiya Nepali Ekta Samaj (All India 
Nepalese Unit Society), who were reportedly arrested in New Delhi by the Indian Special Branch 
Police and handed over to Nepali security officials.  In accordance with its methods of work, the 
Working Group sent copies of those cases to the Government of Nepal (see section on Nepal, 
paragraph 300).  Four cases concerned members of the ULFA who were allegedly arrested by 
the Bhutanese Army and handed over to the Indian Army.  Copies of those cases were sent to the 
Government of India (see section on Bhutan, paragraph 101).   
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>218. In the past and during the period under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 383 cases to the Government; of those, 10 cases have been clarified on the basis 
of information provided by the source, 48 cases have been clarified on the basis of information

</b></p>
<p>221. Following a decision made at its eightieth session, the Working Group decided to request 
a mission to Indonesia in order to facilitate the clarification of outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>222. The majority of the cases of disappearance reported to the Working Group occurred 
in 1992 and between 1998 and 2000 in Jakarta, Aceh and East Timor (formerly under Indonesian 
control); a large number concerned students involved in anti-Government demonstrations in 
East Timor, Jakarta and Sumatra, among them the leader of the Indonesian Students Solidarity 
for Democracy.  Eight other cases that occurred in 2002 and 2003 in Aceh concerned three trade 
unionists and the Head of the Aceh Besar District Branch of the Information Centre for a 
Referendum in Aceh, two students, and the Head of the production unit of TVR1 Studio at 
Gue Gajah.  The one case transmitted in 2004 concerned a person who was reportedly abducted 
in Sanggeue village by Indonesian Army and Mobile Brigade troops during their joint operation 
in Delima and Garut areas, Pidie regency.  Other cases concerned the personal driver of the 
leader of the Papua independence movement who was allegedly abducted by government forces 
in 2001, a man who allegedly disappeared when an Islamic lecture was broken up by military 
gunfire in 1984, and eight men who reportedly disappeared during a riot in 1998 near a 
department store in Jakarta. 
</p>
<p>223. In 2002, in accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group decided to transfer 
cases of disappearances that occurred in the past in East Timor and were listed under Indonesia 
to the authorities of Timor-Leste.   
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>224. In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group transmitted 157 cases to 
the Government; of those, 3 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
source and 154 cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>225. The Working Group encourages the Government of Indonesia to communicate with the 
Working Group to further the clarification of the 154 outstanding cases.  
</p>
<p>226. The Working Group encourages Indonesia, in cooperation with Timor-Leste, to 
communicate with the Working Group to further the clarification of the 425 cases of 
disappearance which occurred on the territory of Timor-Leste during Indonesian rule. 
</p>
<p>227. The Working Group urges the Government of Indonesia to respond positively to its 
request for a country visit. 
</p>
<p>228. The Working Group requests information concerning the investigation and prosecution 
for the death of Mr. Munir, the Chairman of the Asian Federation Against Involuntary 
Disappearances, who was the subject of a prompt intervention letter in 2004 (see 
E/CN.4/2006/56, para. 276). </p>

<p><b>Information from the Government

<p>246. The Government replied concerning its two outstanding cases, stating that in one case it 
had no new information.  In the other case, concerning a member of the Lao Students Movement 
for Democracy, who reportedly disappeared after being arrested in 1999, the Government stated 
that in 2002, upon completion of his prison term, the subject was freed and transferred to 
guardians to further educate him to become a good citizen. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>247. The source replied on the case of the disappeared member of the Lao Students 
Movement for Democracy (see paragraph 246), stating that the subject was being held at 
Samkhe prison.

<p>249. The Working Group decided, in accordance with paragraph 21 of its methods of work, 
exceptionally, to discontinue consideration of one case.  Over the years, the Working Group has 
made numerous attempts to contact the source, but to no avail.  The Working Group believes that 
it no longer has a useful role to play in trying to elucidate the whereabouts of the persons 
involved, as no follow-up can be given to the case.  The case can be reopened at any time if 
presented again to the Working Group. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>

Army.  In 2003, the two reported cases concerned a member of an indigenous organization, 
allegedly arrested in the State of Chiapas, and a member of the Democratic Revolution Party 
who was allegedly abducted in the State of Guerrero by agents of the Federal Investigation

</b></p>
<p>267. Prior to the period under review, all enforced disappearances which reportedly occurred 
on the territory of Serbia and Montenegro were transmitted by the Working Group to the 
Government of Serbia and Montenegro.  Following the 21 May 2006 referendum, Montenegro 
declared independence on 3 June 2006 and was admitted as a Member of the United Nations 
on 28 June 2006. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>268. Following its seventy-ninth session, in accordance with its methods of work, the 
Working Group decided to address to the newly formed Government of Montenegro 15 of the 
16 outstanding cases of disappearances that had reportedly occurred in the past on the territory of 
Montenegro, but had previously been listed under Serbia and Montenegro. 
</p>
<p>269. Most of the outstanding cases occurred in 1999 and 2000 and include the disappearance 
of a group of men who were allegedly detained in 1999 while travelling by bus from the 
Province of Kosovo to Albania through Montenegro and the disappearance of the Chairperson of 
the Kosovo-Albanian Women&#8217;s League.  One outstanding case which occurred in 1992 concerns 
a man who was allegedly arrested by officers from the police headquarters of Bar, and was last 
seen entering a police car and being driven away to an unknown location.

</b></p>
<p>275. The majority of the 248 cases the Working Group has transmitted to the Government 
occurred between 1972 and 1980.  Most of them concerned persons who reportedly disappeared 
because they or their relatives were known or suspected supporters of the Polisario Front.  The 
disappeared persons were reportedly confined in secret detention centres, such as Laayoune, 
Qal&#8217;at M&#8217;gouna, Agdz and Tazmamart.  Cells in some police stations or military barracks and 
secret villas in the Rabat suburbs were also allegedly used to hide the disappeared persons.

</p>
<p><b>Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>281. The Working Group transmitted 12 cases to the Government under its urgent action 
procedure.  In seven of these cases, the subjects were allegedly rearrested by security forces 
immediately following their release on court orders issued following habeas corpus petitions.  
Three of these involved women in Biratnagar District. 
</p>
<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>282. One hundred and sixty cases were transmitted under the standard procedure to the 
Government.  These cases reportedly took place between 2001 and 2005, in various districts of 
the country.  The subjects included 20 persons under 18 years of age and a total of 22 females.  
One of these cases was the disappearance of a young French woman in a park, near Kathmandu.  
She was last seen on 3 September 2005 and allegedly, members of the Nepalese Army were 
responsible for the disappearance.   
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>283. The Government sent replies regarding 202 cases.  These included responses regarding 
nine of the urgent actions referred to in paragraph 281. 
</p>
<p>284. The Working Group decided that for 49 cases, the Government&#8217;s reply could constitute a 
clarification, provided the source did not object within six months.  The subjects were either 
reported released or the location of the place of detention was provided.   
</p>
<p>285. In 153 cases, the Working Group decided that the information was not sufficient for 
clarification.   
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>286. In the case of a 24-year-old Nepalese man who was last seen 8 October 2003, the source 
presented many questions regarding the case to the Working Group and requested that they be 
transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>287. Sources also replied concerning 18 other cases of disappearances which occurred 
between 1995 and 2005.  According to its methods of work, the Working Group decided to 
clarify all of them.  In most cases, the subject was reported released.   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>288. During the seventy-eighth session, the Working Group met with government 
representatives to discuss cases of disappearances and follow-up to the recommendations of the 
Working Group&#8217;s mission to the country in 2004 (see E/CN.4/2005/65/Add.1).   
</p>
<p>289. Also during the seventy-ninth session, the Working Group met with a family member of 
a disappeared person. 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>290. At the seventy-eighth session, the Working Group decided to request a visit to Nepal in 
order to follow up on the recommendations of its 2004 mission.  The request was sent to the 
Government on 12 May and a reminder on 10 August 2006.  The Working Group has not yet 
received a reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>291. On 3 February 2006, a prompt intervention letter (see paragraph 13) was sent by the 
Working Group to the Government of Nepal regarding participants in a demonstration on behalf 
of disappeared persons who were reportedly indiscriminately beaten and detained by police.  The 
Working Group has not received a response.   
</p>
<p><b>Clarifications 
</b></p>
<p>292. Based on information received from the Government, the Working Group decided to 
clarify 75 cases following the expiration of the six-month rule (see paragraph 11).  These cases 
include alleged disappearances dating from 1999.  In most cases, the subjects were reported 
released and their current addresses provided.  The Government provided the location of the 
places of detention of the others.   
</p>
<p>293. Based on information received from sources, the Working Group decided to 
clarify 18 cases.  In the majority of cases, sources reported that the subject had been released.   
<b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>294. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning alleged obstacles 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration by the Government of Nepal (see 
paragraph 14).  This information was transmitted to the Government.  Reports expressed concern 
that disappearances have continued in the country.  NGOs have reportedly urged government 
ministers and the Attorney-General to ensure that those in the security forces who carry out, 
order or acquiesce to gross violations are prosecuted in public trials before civilian courts and 
given punishments commensurate with their crimes. 
</p>
<p>295. NGOs reported that the Government continued to not respect court orders to release 
detainees.  Lawyers in Kathmandu and elsewhere who handle human rights cases reportedly 
have faced threats, intimidation and harassment.  Finally, the habeas corpus procedure was 
reportedly the only available legal remedy in cases of enforced disappearances.   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>296. Reportedly, registering a first information report (FIR) was a difficult task, as it takes 
hours to convince the authorities that the case is under their jurisdiction.  Police were reluctant to 
register the cases, mainly because high-level Royal Nepalese Army personnel are named in the 
FIRs.  Criminal law in Nepal gives investigating authority to the sub-inspector, thus the ability of 
junior officers is questionable in cases where high-level security officers are involved. 
</p><p>297. No reply was received from the Government regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>298. The majority of the cases reported to the Working Group allegedly occurred 
between 1998 and 2005 in the context of counter-insurgency operations by security forces 
against members and supporters of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), which had declared 
a &#8220;people&#8217;s war&#8221; in February 1996.   
</p>
<p>299. During the first phase of this conflict, disappearances occurred during police 
operations (1998).  As security operations intensified, the number of cases reported increased 
during 1999 and 2001, particularly after November 2001, following the declaration of a state of 
emergency and the deployment of the Army.  Following the breakdown of a seven-month 
ceasefire on 27 August 2003, there was a rapid escalation in the number of disappearances.  
Most cases concerned persons who were arrested by unidentified security forces personnel in 
plain clothes from their homes.  In many cases, the subjects were rearrested by security forces 
immediately after their release on court orders issued following habeas corpus petitions.  
Although disappearances reportedly were taking place across the country, the majority of cases 
reported to the Working Group occurred in and around Kathmandu and other districts in central 
Nepal.  The reported victims included girls, women, students, businessmen, farmers, workers, a 
writer, a government employee, a journalist and human rights defenders.  The disappearances 
were attributed to security forces personnel, the Armed Forces and the police.   
</p>
<p>300. Regarding cases of three members of the Akhil Bharatiya Nepali Ekta Samaj (All India 
Nepalese Unit Society) who were reportedly arrested by the Indian Special Branch Police and 
handed over to Nepali security officials at the border, in Nepalgunj, in accordance with the 
Working Group&#8217;s methods of work, copies of these cases were sent to the Government of India.  
The same was done in the case of a Kashmiri residing in Kathmandu.  It was reported that the 
Indian Embassy in Kathmandu was involved in the arrest; therefore, a copy of this case was also 
sent to the Indian authorities (see also section on India, paragraph 216). 
</p>
<p>301. At the invitation of the Government of Nepal, the Working Group visited the country 
from 6 to 14 December 2004.  The delegation held meetings with His Majesty the King and 
other high-level officials, as well as with representatives of NGOs, relatives of the disappeared 
and members of the international community in Nepal.  The Working Group found that the 
phenomenon of disappearance in Nepal was widespread; its use by the Nepalese security 
forces was arbitrary.  Maoist insurgents also were reported to have committed widespread 
human rights violations.  The mission report and recommendations can be found in 
document E/CN.4/2005/65/Add.1. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>302. On 8 February 2005, the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group issued a joint 
statement with eight other United Nations independent experts, expressing serious concern about 
the actions taken by the King to dissolve the constitutional Government and to assume direct 
power, including the proclamation of a nationwide state of emergency and the suspension of 
constitutional guarantees and civil and political liberties. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>303. In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 510 cases to the Government; of those, 77 cases have been clarified on the 
basis of information provided by the source, 129 cases have been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the Government and 304 cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>304. The Working Group welcomes the cooperation it has received from the Government of 
Nepal in providing information for the clarification of cases.  The Working Group urges the 
Government of Nepal to report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Working 
Group following its country visit in 2004.

<p>307. Following a decision of the Working Group at the seventy-eighth session, a request for a 
visit as part of a four-country initiative in Central America was sent to the Government of 
Nicaragua on 23 May 2006.  The Government has not yet replied.   
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>308. The majority of the cases reported to the Working Group occurred between 1979 
and 1983, in the context of the internal armed conflict which took place during the 1980s.  Many 
of the reports of these disappearances pointed to the involvement of members of the Army, the 
former Sandinista Government, the former General Directorate for the Security of the State and 
the Frontier Guard.  Two cases reportedly occurred in 1994:  one concerned a farmer who was 
allegedly detained by a group of members of the Army and the police, and the other concerned a 
person allegedly accused of being a member of the Contras armed group. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding

<p>318. The majority of the 85 cases of reported disappearance concerned members or 
sympathizers of the political party the Muhajir Qaomi Movement, who were allegedly arrested in 
1995 and 2001.  Most of the other reported cases allegedly occurred in 1986 and between 1989 
and 1991, and involved Afghan refugees in Pakistan, many with links to the Harakate Inghilabe 
Islamic party of Afghanistan.  The disappearances were reportedly perpetrated in Peshawar by 
persons allegedly acting with the acquiescence of the Pakistani authorities.  Four other cases 
concerned members of the same family who were reportedly abducted by agents of military 
intelligence in Islamabad in 1996.

<p>322. Over the years, the Working Group has made numerous attempts to contact the source, 
but to no avail.  The Working Group decided, in accordance with paragraph 21 of its methods of 
work, exceptionally to discontinue consideration of three cases.  The Working Group believes 
that it no longer has a useful role to play in trying to elucidate the whereabouts of the persons 
involved, as no follow-up can be given to the cases.  The cases can be reopened at any time if 
they are presented again to the Working Group.   
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>323. The 23 cases of disappearance reported to the Working Group occurred between 1975 
and 1977 under the Government of President Alfredo Stroessner.  Several of the disappeared 
persons were members of the Communist Party, including its Secretary-General.  Although 
disappearances took place in the capital, Asunci&#243;n, the majority of the cases affected the rural 
population and were carried out in the districts of San Jos&#233;, Santa Helena, Piribebuy and 
Santa Rosa. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding

<p>324. In the past and during the period under review, the Working Group transmitted 23 cases

investigation for human rights abuses, including disappearances, committed during the country&#8217;s 
armed conflict, which lasted from 1980 to 2000.   
</p>
<p>329. NGOs reported to have called on the Government of Peru to ensure that the Armed 
Forces fully cooperate with civilian prosecutors and courts investigating human rights violations 
committed in Peru&#8217;s armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>330. No reply was received from the Government regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>331. The majority of the 3,006 reported cases of disappearance occurred between 1983 
and 1992 in the context of the Government&#8217;s fight against the Communist Party of Peru, 
Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.  The 
majority of reported disappearances took place in areas of the country that had been under a state 
of emergency and were under military control.  Detentions were frequently carried out by 
uniformed members of the Army and the Navy infantry, sometimes together with civil defence 
groups. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>332. In the past and during the period under review, the Working Group has transmitted a 
total of 3,006 cases to the Government; of those, 385 cases have been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the source, 253 cases have been clarified on the basis of information 
provided by the Government and 2,368 cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>333. The Working Group wishes to remind the Government of Peru once again of its 
responsibility to conduct thorough and impartial investigations &#8220;for as long as the fate of 
the victim of enforced disappearance remains unclarified&#8221;, in accordance with article 13, 
paragraph 6, of the Declaration. </p>

<p>334. The Working Group transmitted four cases under its urgent action procedure to the 
Government of the Philippines.  All four cases concerned persons who reportedly disappeared 
from the Central Luzon region.  <b>Philip Limjoco</b> allegedly disappeared near a bus terminal.  
<b>Philip Dela Cruz </b>was reportedly taken from the side of the road by an armed group.  The two 
other urgent action cases concerned <b>Tessie Abellera</b> and her son <b>Rodel Abellera, </b>who were 
allegedly taken by soldiers from their home.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>335. The Working Group transmitted to the Government under its standard procedure the 
cases of three persons who reportedly disappeared together in June 2006 in the Bulacan District 
of the Philippines.  The cases concerned <b>Manuel Merino</b>, <b>Karen Empeno</b> and 
<b>Sherlyn Cadapan.  </b> 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>336. The Government of the Philippines sent two communications to the Working Group.  
On 22 August 2006, the Government reported on an investigation of the cases of four persons 
who disappeared in 2005.  It reported that an investigation of the case had been conducted by 
the Commanding General of the Philippine Army, 4th Infantry Division.  Initial reports revealed 
that the allegations against the 58th Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army were 
unsubstantiated.   
</p>
<p>337. On 11 October 2006, the Government stated that the licence plate number attributed to 
the vehicle that had been used by soldiers to take a mother and son from their home (see 
paragraph 334) had been issued to a different vehicle and therefore had been purposely used to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>mislead the investigation.  A communication dated 8 November 2006 regarding efforts 
undertaken by the Government to implement the recommendations made following the visit to 
the Philippines by the Working Group in 1991 was received too late for review, and will be 
considered at the next session of the Working Group for inclusion in the 2007 report. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>338. No information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>339. Following a decision of the Working Group at its seventy-eighth session, a request for a 
visit was sent to the Government of the Philippines on 24 May 2006.  The Working Group has 
not yet received a reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>340. The majority of the reported cases of disappearance occurred throughout the country in 
the late 1970s and early 1980s in the context of the Government&#8217;s anti-insurgency campaign.  
Alleged victims included farmers, students, social and health workers, members of Church 
groups, lawyers, journalists and economists.  Since 1980, many reported cases of disappearance 
concerned young men living in rural and urban areas who participated in legally constituted 
organizations which, according to the military authorities, were fronts for the outlawed 
Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing, the New People&#8217;s Army (NPA).   
</p>
<p>341. Disappearances have continued to occur since the 1990s, mainly in the context of 
military operations against the NPA, the Moro National Liberation Front, the Mindanao Islamic 
Liberation Front, the Citizen Armed Forces Geographical Units and the Civilian Volunteer 
Organizations. 
</p>
<p>342. The Working Group visited the Philippines in 1991.  The main recommendation to the 
Government was that the National Police should be severed from the Army and that the 
Government should introduce legislation to narrow the powers of arrest.  It was also 
recommended that the Philippines Commission on Human Rights be empowered to make 
unannounced spot checks at places of detention, as well as improve protection of witnesses and 
overhaul the law and practice of habeas corpus (see E/CN.4/1991/20/Add.1, para. 168). 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>343. In the past and during the period under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 758 cases to the Government; of those, 33 cases have been clarified on the basis 
of information provided by the source, 124 cases have been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the Government and 601 cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>344. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligation under article 13 of the 
Declaration to make every effort to clarify the 601 outstanding cases. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>345. The Working Group invites the Government to provide it with current information on the 
status of the consolidated anti-disappearance bills and reminds the Government of its obligation 
under article 4 of the Declaration to make all acts of enforced disappearance &#8220;offences under 
criminal law punishable by appropriate penalties which shall take into account their extreme 
seriousness&#8221;.

</b></p>
<p>  Five cases were determined to be duplications and were subsequently deleted. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>346. Five cases were sent to the Government of the Russian Federation under the urgent action 
procedure.  Two cases concerned <b>Bulat Chilaev</b> and <b>Aslam Israilov</b>, who were allegedly taken 
from their car by military personnel in Chechnya.  <b>Khamzat Shamsuldinovich Tushaev</b>,<b> 
</b>reportedly disappeared after entering the State office compound in Chechnya where he had been 
summoned.  <b>Aslan Israilovich Mishiev</b> was last seen by the bank of a river surrounded by 
Russian military.  <b>Galgi Shamkhanovich Bashaev</b> reportedly was pulled out of his car, put into 
a vehicle and held in unofficial detention facilities. 
</p>
<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>347. The Working Group transmitted three further reported cases of disappearance to the 
Government.  <b>Armen Aloyan</b> was reportedly taken by police in Moscow in May 1995.  <b>Ibragim 
Tausovich Uruskhanov</b> was allegedly abducted from his home by members of the Russian 
federal armed forces.  <b>Bashir Adamovich Mustolgov</b> was taken from in front of his house by 
men in military uniforms. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>348. The Working Group received six communications from the Government of the 
Russian Federation.  Three of the communications, dated 26 July, 16 August 
and 18 September 2006, could not be translated by the United Nations translation services 
in time for consideration by the Working Group for inclusion in the present report.  In the 
other three communications, the Russian Federation provided additional information 
on 12 outstanding cases of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>349. In a communication dated 15 September 2005, the Government stated that for five of the 
outstanding cases, pretrial investigations had been suspended, for one case, the decision to 
suspend pretrial investigations had been overturned and for another case, pretrial investigations 
had been resumed.  In one case the Government also reported that measures to establish the 
subject&#8217;s whereabouts were being carried out and a query had been sent to the Republic of 
Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>350. In a communication dated 24 February 2006, concerning three construction workers who 
disappeared together in 2005, the Government reported that the procurator&#8217;s office had opened a 
criminal case in accordance with article 126 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation 
(abduction).  In a communication dated 20 March 2006, the Government stated that a decision 
not to continue criminal proceedings in the cases of two persons had been overturned.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>351. Information was received from sources concerning four cases.  Additional information on 
two cases from Chechnya and one from Moscow was transmitted to the Government.  The fourth 
response provided information on where the person was imprisoned in Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarifications 
</b></p>
<p>352. Based on the information provided by the source on the location of the subject in prison 
in Uzbekistan (see paragraph 11), the Working Group decided that the case should be considered 
clarified. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>353. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning alleged 
obstacles encountered in the implementation of the Declaration by the Government of the 
Russian Federation (see paragraph 14).  This information was transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>354. According to such reports, many enforced disappearances are perpetrated by federal 
troops in Chechnya.  Allegedly, between 3,000 and 5,000 people have disappeared since 1999.  
Those detained are reportedly ill-treated and eventually killed.  This practice of disappearance 
occurs in an overall climate of impunity.  Although in most instances local prosecutors do launch 
criminal investigations, the prosecutors routinely suspend them shortly thereafter, stating that it 
is impossible to establish the identity of the perpetrator.  In most cases, however, investigators 
reportedly fail to take basic investigative steps. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>355. No reply was received from the Government regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>356. The Working Group has proposed September 2007 for a country visit to the 
Russian Federation, following prior agreement in principle by the Government to the visit. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>357. A large number of the cases transmitted in the past concerned persons of ethnic Ingush 
origin who allegedly disappeared in 1992, in the context of fighting in the Northern Caucasus.  
The majority of the remaining cases were reported to have occurred in the Republic of 
Chechnya, primarily since 1994, in the context of the conflict there.  The disappearances were 
alleged to have been carried out by Russian armed and security forces.  Twenty-seven of the 
cases occurred between September 2004 and April 2005 in various locations such as Argun, 
Grozny and Koren-Benoj.  Among the persons who disappeared were the relatives of the former 
President of the Republic of Chechnya, a 15-year-old child and the leader of the NGO called 
Let&#8217;s Save the Generation. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>358. In the past and during the period under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 465 cases to the Government; of those, 10 cases have been clarified on the 
basis of information provided by the source, 1 case has been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the Government and 5 were found to be duplications by the Working 
Group, leaving 454 cases outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>359. The Working Group is deeply concerned about the new cases that continue to occur 
in the Russian Federation.  The Working Group encourages the Government to respond to its 
general allegation letter (see paragraph 353) and to take steps to clarify outstanding cases, 
including the large number of unresolved cases arising from the conflicts in the 
Northern Caucasus.  The Working Group reiterates to the Government its obligation under 
the Declaration to prevent and to terminate all acts of enforced disappearance and to prosecute 
alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>360. The Working Group welcomes the invitation by the Government of the 
Russian Federation to the Working Group to conduct a country visit, and looks forward to 
finalizing dates as soon as possible.  
</p>
<p>361. The Working Group continues to be concerned about suspension of investigations in 
disappearance cases and wishes to remind the Government of its obligations to conduct thorough 
and impartial investigations &#8220;for as long as the fate of the victim of enforced disappearance 
remains unclarified&#8221;, in accordance with article 13, paragraph 6, of the Declaration. </p>

<p>362. The Government of Rwanda replied to the Working Group on 22 cases.  The Government 
indicated that in most cases, the subject was &#8220;not known&#8221; and requested more information.  The 
Working Group did not consider the responses provided by the Government regarding any of 
these cases sufficient to constitute clarifications. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>363. New information was provided about the case of a man who disappeared in 2003 in 
Kigali.  He had been a member of the National Assembly until it was dissolved in May 2003.  
In 2003 and 2004, the Governing Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union adopted a resolution 
on this case, which it continues to follow. 
</p>
<p><b>Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>364. At its eightieth session, the Working Group met with an NGO representative to discuss 
cases from Rwanda. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>365. Most of the 22 outstanding cases transmitted in the past occurred between 1990 
and 1996.  These included five cases which occurred in 1990 and 1991 in the north of the 
country in the context of the ethnic conflict between Tutsis and Hutus, and one case of a citizen 
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo who was allegedly arrested at the border between 
Rwanda and Uganda.  The disappearances were attributed to the Armed Forces, the gendarmerie 
nationale and the Rwandese Patriotic Army. 
</p>
<p>366. In accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group sent to the Government of 
Rwanda copies of cases listed under the Democratic Republic of the Congo of 18 Rwandan 
refugees and a professor who reportedly disappeared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo at 
the hands of Rwandan soldiers. </p>

<p><b>Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>382. The Working Group transmitted to the Government 41 cases under its urgent action 
procedure.  The reported disappearances occurred primarily in the north and east of Sri Lanka, 
mostly in the Jaffna District.  Eight cases concerned Tamil men who were all reportedly taken by 
Army personnel while at a Hindu temple.  Two cases concerned co-workers from the Danish 
Demining Group in Jaffna.  One case concerned a man with a mental disability.  Four cases 
concerned persons who allegedly disappeared by the seashore, and one case concerned a 
fisherman who could not produce his national identity card when requested by the authorities to 
do so.  Four cases concerned persons who were arrested during cordon and search operations.  In 
seven cases persons were reportedly taken by Sri Lankan Navy or Army personnel from their 
homes.  Four persons, including a priest, were last seen at Sri Lankan Navy checkpoints.  Nine 
cases, including one case of a minor, concerned persons who were last seen either walking or 
driving along the road. <b> </b>In one case, the person was arrested and last seen at a tea shop. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>383. The Government transmitted two communications to the Working Group.  In a 
communication dated 1 September 2006, the Government replied concerning three cases that had 
been submitted under the Working Group&#8217;s urgent action procedure, those of three brothers who 
disappeared together from their home.  The Government requested more information on their 
place of residence, the police station where the complaint had been filed and the relevant 
complaint number. 
</p>
<p>384. In another communication dated 6 October 2006, the Government replied concerning five 
cases that had been transmitted under the Working Group&#8217;s urgent action procedure, stating that 
investigations were being carried out in all cases.  The Government stated that it had been 
reported in the recent past that members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were 
involved in similar abductions in the north and east of Sri Lanka, disguising themselves as 
security forces personnel.  In one case, the Government replied that the subject was an 
underworld gang leader wanted by other groups.  The Government also provided additional 
details surrounding the disappearance of a priest at a Sri Lankan Navy checkpoint.  
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>385. Following a request made by the Government, the source provided additional information 
on the disappearance of three brothers. 
</p>
<p><b>Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>386. At its seventy-ninth session, the Working Group met with a Sri Lankan NGO to discuss 
the current situation in the country.  
</p>
<p>387. While attending the Human Rights Council, the former Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group met with the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations to 
discuss further collaboration with the Working Group.  
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>388. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning alleged obstacles 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration by the Government of Sri Lanka (see 
paragraph 14).  This information was transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>389. According to the reports, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka officially decided 
to stop further inquiries into 2,000 cases of disappearance unless an order was received from the 
Government to continue with the inquiries, as the findings might result in &#8220;payments of 
compensation, etc.&#8221;.  The mandate of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka is, among 
other things, to inquire into infringement of fundamental rights and to make appropriate redress, 
including the granting of compensation to the victims.  The board of the Commission has 
reportedly completely abdicated from this responsibility. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>390. In a response dated 11 August 2006, the Government of Sri Lanka stated:  &#8220;With regard 
to the representations made on the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, it should be noted 
that this is an independent body.  The Government can only transmit to the Human Rights 
Commission of Sri Lanka any representations forwarded, with the request for appropriate 
action.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>391. Following a decision of the Working Group, a request for a visit to take place in 
early 2007 was sent to the Government of Sri Lanka on 16 October 2006.  In a reply 
dated 24 October 2006, the Government stated that it would not be possible to schedule a visit 
for the Working Group during the requested period owing to the planned visits of other special 
procedure mandate holders, but that the interest of the Working Group would be noted and given 
due consideration. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>392. The cases reported to the Working Group are alleged to have occurred in the context of 
two major conflicts in Sri Lanka:  the confrontation between Tamil militants and government 
forces in the north and north-east of the country and that between the People&#8217;s Liberation Front 
(JVP) and government forces in the south.  Between 1987 and 1990, the disappearances occurred 
mainly in the southern and central provinces and coincided with extreme violence on the part of 
both security forces and the JVP.  The cases reported to have occurred since 11 June 1990, the 
date of the resumption of hostilities with the LTTE, have been confined primarily to the eastern 
and north-eastern provinces of the country.   
</p>
<p>393. The Working Group has undertaken three field missions to Sri Lanka, in 1991 
(see E/CN.4/1992/18/Add.1), 1992 (see E/CN.4/1993/25/Add.1) and 1999 (see 
E/CN.4/2000/64/Add.1).  The central recommendation to the Government was the establishment 
of an independent body with the task of investigating all cases of disappearance that had 
occurred since 1995 and to accelerate its efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice.  The Working 
Group also recommended the setting up of a central register of detainees as provided for in 
article 10, paragraph 3, of the Declaration.  It stated that all families of disappeared persons 
should receive the same amount of compensation and that the procedure for issuing death 
certificates in cases of disappearances should be applied in an equitable and non-discriminatory 
manner.  The Working Group further noted that the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the 
Emergency Regulations had not been abolished or harmonized with internationally accepted 
standards of human rights, and recommended that the prohibition of enforced disappearance be 
included as a fundamental right in the Constitution of Sri Lanka. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>394. In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 12,319 cases to the Government; of those, 40 cases have been clarified on the basis 
of information provided by the source, 6,530 cases have been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the Government and 5,749 cases remain outstanding. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>395. The Working Group wishes to express its appreciation to the Government of Sri Lanka 
for its ongoing cooperation and its efforts to investigate and clarify the fate of the many 
thousands of persons who disappeared in the past.  The Working Group thanks the Government 
for the reply to its request for a country visit, and looks forward to receiving a positive reply and 
setting dates as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>396. The Working Group is gravely concerned at the increase in reported cases of recent 
enforced disappearances occurring primarily in the north-east of the country in the context of 
renewed fighting in the region.  
</p>
<p>397. The Working Group encourages the Government to report on the further implementation 
of the recommendations emanating from the Working Group&#8217;s visits in 1991, 1992 and 1999. 
</p>
<p>398. The Working Group would appreciate further information on the situation of the National 
Human Rights Commission, owing to its crucial role in addressing disappearances and other 
human rights issues in Sri Lanka.

</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>403. The majority of the 323 cases of disappearance reported in the past 
concerned 249 villagers who were allegedly abducted from the village of Toror in the 
Nuba Mountains in 1995 by the Armed Forces and taken to a Government-controlled &#8220;peace 
camp&#8221;.  Another 54 disappeared persons were mainly members of the Sudan Liberation Army 
who were allegedly arrested after clashes with government forces in Dissa and Abu Gamra in 
June and August 2003.  Three cases concerned civilians who were arrested by government forces 
at Serif Amra in July 2003. 
</p>
<p>404. Another group of cases were transmitted by the Working Group in 2005, including the 
cases of 19 members of the Fur and Dajo communities who reportedly were arrested by armed

Working Group remains concerned about disappearances in the Sudan. 
</p>
<p>407. The Working Group also reiterates its request for an invitation from the Government of 
the Sudan to conduct a country visit so as to assist the Government in preventing disappearances 
and in clarifying outstanding cases. </p>

<p>408. The Working Group transmitted one urgent action to the Syrian authorities 
on 12 April 2006.  The case concerned <b>Mohammad Al-Abdullah</b>, who was reportedly abducted 
from his home in the city of Qatana on 23 March 2006.  The Syrian Army was alleged to be 
responsible.  
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>409. The Government sent responses concerning the cases of two men.  The first concerned a 
Lebanese national who disappeared on 1 April 1998.  The authorities reported on 13 April 2006 
that the subject had been released on 13 November 2005 under a political amnesty declared by 
the President of the Republic.  
</p>
<p>410. Regarding the case of a Lebanese male who reportedly disappeared on 1 January 1994 
and was last seen at the interrogation section in a prison in Damascus, the Government reported 
that the subject was abducted by the Union of People&#8217;s Forces organization and that he has &#8220;not 
been heard from since&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>411. The Working Group decided that the information provided was not sufficient to clarify 
the cases.  Two communications from the Government, both dated 10 July 2006, could not be

occurred between 1980 and 1994.  The security forces or military intelligence were allegedly 
responsible.  Among the victims were students, medical doctors, military personnel and an artist.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Of these, eight cases concerned Lebanese citizens, three concerned Jordanian nationals and one 
concerned a Palestinian.  In the past, in accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group

military personnel at a temporary army checkpoint in Narathiwat Province. 
</p>
<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>417. The Working Group also transmitted three reported cases of disappearance from 
Yala Province which allegedly occurred in 2004.  Two of the cases concern two friends, 
<b>Wae-arong Rohim</b> and <b>Yah Jeloh</b>, who were allegedly abducted by the police, and the other 
case concerns <b>Ibrohim Gayo</b>, whose disappearance was attributed to the Army.   
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>418. No communication was received from the Government regarding outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>419. New information was received from a source concerning the disappearance of a 
prominent Thai human rights lawyer, Mr. Somchai Neelaphajit.  The source stated that 
on 12 January 2006, Thai courts convicted a police major of forcibly pushing the lawyer into a 
car and acquitted four other defendants because of a lack of clear evidence.  The judgement 
highlighted that the defendants had not been interested in the lawyer&#8217;s property, despite having 
been charged with theft.  The court also ruled that a State official had forcibly abducted him.  
Although the Department of Special Investigation had promised to regularly update the family 
on its investigation into the case, the source claims that nothing has been forthcoming.  The 
source called on the Government of Thailand to pursue independent investigations to establish 
the fate and whereabouts of the victim and to hold those responsible for his disappearance 
accountable.  
</p>
<p><b>Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>420. On 26 March 2006 and on 7 November 2006, two prompt intervention letters (see 
paragraph 13) were sent to the Government of Thailand concerning alleged threats to and 
harassment of the family of Somchai Neelaphajit.  Serious concern has been expressed that the 
reported harassment and intimidation of his wife may have been in retaliation for the activities 
related to calls for justice and the search for her husband.  
<b>Press release 
</b></p>
<p>421. On 11 March 2006, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group issued a 
statement in connection with the decision of the Asian Human Rights Commission to honour 
Somchai Neelaphajit with its second Asian Human Rights Defender Award. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>422. Of the 39 reported cases, 33 occurred in 1992; 31 of those cases concerned persons who 
allegedly disappeared during a crackdown by security forces on demonstrations in Bangkok in 
the aftermath of the appointment of a new Prime Minister.   
</p>
<p>423. One case occurred in 1991 and concerned the President of the Labour Congress of 
Thailand, who reportedly disappeared from his union&#8217;s office in Bangkok three days after 
organizing a protest rally.  Another case occurred in 2005 and concerned a prominent human 
rights lawyer who was allegedly taken from his car near Bangkok by five policemen and never 
seen again.  
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>424. In the past and during the period under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 39 cases to the Government; of those, 1 case was clarified on the basis of

which remain outstanding before the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>425.  The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations under article 13, 
paragraph 3, of the Declaration to take steps to ensure that all persons involved in the 
investigation of an enforced disappearance, including the complainant, counsel, witnesses and 
those conducting the investigation, are protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal.  
The Working Group invites the Government of Thailand to reply to the three prompt 
intervention letters it sent to the Government in 2005 and 2006.

</p>
<p>430. The majority of the cases of disappearance reported to the Working Group occurred

<p>435. The Working Group reviewed four communications received during the period under 
review from the Government of Turkey. 
</p>
<p>436. Based on previous information received, the Working Group decided to apply the 
six-month rule (see paragraph 12) in 16 cases. 
</p>
<p>437. The Government also replied in 38 other cases, concerning people having disappeared 
between 1991 and 2001.  Most of the replies indicated that investigations by local authorities 
were ongoing.  The Working Group decided that the responses were considered insufficient to 
clarify the cases.  
</p>

<p>438. No information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Clarifications 
</b></p>
<p>439. Based on information from the Government, the Working Group decided to clarify five 
cases following the expiration of the six-month rule (see paragraph 11).  In four cases, death 
certificates were provided.  In one case, the subject, together with his attorney, made a 
declaration to the General Directorate of Security stating that he was not a disappeared person.  
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>440. The majority of the 181 reported cases were alleged to have occurred in south-eastern 
Turkey, in areas where a state of emergency was in force, and concerned members of the 
Kurdish minority.  Three cases reportedly occurred in 2001 and concerned members of the 
People&#8217;s Democratic Party.  A 2002 case concerned a welder who was allegedly detained by 
members of the gendarmerie, despite a judicial order that he be remanded to prison. 
<b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding

<p>441. In the past and during the period under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 181 cases to the Government; of those, 49 cases have been clarified on the basis

</p>
<p>444. The Working Group received information regarding cases previously accepted by the 
Working Group which it learned had in fact been abductions by a non-State actor.  The Working 
Group considered the matter and decided that those cases were not within the proper ambit of its 
mandate since the actions were not directly or indirectly attributable to the Government of 
Uganda.  As a result, the Working Group deleted 39 outstanding cases.  The Working Group also 
learned that the United Nations in Uganda is actively working on these and similar cases of 
children abducted by rebel forces. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>445. Of the 61 reported cases of disappearance, 20 occurred between 1981 and 1985.  These 
reported disappearances occurred throughout the country and in one case the person was 
allegedly abducted while in exile in Kenya and taken to Kampala.  One case concerned the 
18-year-old daughter of an opposition member of the Ugandan Parliament.  The disappearances 
are said to have been committed by policemen, soldiers or officials of the National Security 
Agency. 
</p>
<p>446. In 1998, three cases occurred, one of which concerned a former magistrate who was a 
refugee.  He was reportedly arrested in Kampala by Ugandan police officers.  Another case 
concerned a lawyer providing defence counsel to persons accused of genocide.  He is said to 
have been previously arrested and tortured because of his activities.

<p>448. On 16 December 2005, the Government of Ukraine transmitted one communication to 
the Working Group concerning the three persons who reportedly disappeared together in 1995.  
The Government stated that on 6 April 2005, the criminal investigation that was instituted 
pursuant to the disappearance of the three persons had been suspended.  At present government 
authorities are reportedly taking steps to determine the whereabouts of the subjects and to 
establish the identity of the perpetrators.  In addition, disciplinary proceedings have been 
instituted against militia officers for improper performance of their duties.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>453. Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning alleged obstacles 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration by the Government of the United States of 
America (see paragraph 14).  This information was transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>454. According to the reports, since 11 September 2001, the Government of the United States 
has relied increasingly in its counter-terrorism operations on a practice that is known as 
&#8220;rendition&#8221;, or &#8220;extraordinary rendition&#8221;.  The practice generally involves the detention of 
persons either outside or inside the United States and their extrajudicial transfer either to 
United States-run detention facilities overseas or to the custody of foreign intelligence agencies.  
Allegedly, even when suspects are transferred to the custody of foreign agents under the 
rendition programme, the United States Government often maintains a degree of control over 
their custody as well as the interrogation process itself.  Because the persons subjected to this 
practice are generally held incommunicado in secret facilities, it is believed that the practice 
amounts to enforced disappearance.  It is alleged that by authorizing United States agents to 
detain suspects and transfer them to incommunicado detention in overseas prisons, the 
United States violates express provisions of international law regarding the right to freedom from 
arbitrary arrest and detention, and the right to judicial review for the basis of the detention. 
</p><p>455. To date, victims of the rendition programme have not prevailed in their attempts to seek 
redress in United States courts.  While United States courts have reportedly recognized the 
prohibitions against arbitrary detention, torture, other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and 
enforced disappearance as discrete violations of international law cognizable under the Alien 
Tort Statute and the Torture Victim Protection Act, so far lower courts have found that only 
foreign officials can be held civilly liable for violation of these norms.   
</p>
<p>456. In a communication dated 25 October 2006, the Government of the United States 
responded to the Working Group&#8217;s general allegation described above, which also contained a 
request made by NGOs for the United States Government to provide information relating to the 
policy and practice of rendition.  The Government stated: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Inasmuch as this request concerns matters governed by the law of armed 
conflict, the United States respectfully notes that it does not believe that it falls within the 
mandate of the Working Group.  As recently confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 
<i>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</i>, the law of armed conflict governs the armed conflict with al Qaeda.  
Specifically, the Supreme Court held that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions 
applies to the armed conflict with al Qaeda.  Nevertheless, as a matter of courtesy, the 
Government of the United States is pleased to provide the following materials relevant to 
its request, which can be found at the respective sites:   
</p>
<p>&#8722; Speech of President George W. Bush dated September 6, 2006 
(www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/09/20060906-3html); </p>

Torture in May 2006 (www.usmission.ch); and  
</p>

</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>457. In the past and during the period under review, the Working Group transmitted one case 
to the Government and that case was clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government.  No cases remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>458. The Working Group would like to thank the United States Government for its reply to its 
general allegation letter.  Regarding the Government&#8217;s reference to common article 3 of the 
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, the Working Group would like to recall that this article 
is in reference to &#8220;armed conflict not of an international character&#8221;.  The Working Group 
respectfully draws the Government&#8217;s attention to the fact that as defined in the Working Group&#8217;s 
methods of work, while the Working Group does not work on cases arising from international 
armed conflicts, cases from armed conflict not of an international character do fall within the 
mandate of the Working Group, contrary to the Government&#8217;s reply.  The Working Group 
remains concerned about the policy and practice of rendition by the United States, particular in 
respect of articles 1.2 (right to life, liberty, recognition before the law and the right not to be 
subject to torture), 2 (right not to be disappeared), 7 (no circumstances, whether a threat of war, a 
state of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked to 
justify enforced disappearances), 8 (right to non-refoulement), 9 (right to a prompt and effective 
judicial remedy) and 10 (right to be held in an officially recognized place of detention and to be 
brought before a judicial authority promptly after detention) of the Declaration.

<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>464. The Government of Uzbekistan sent a communication dated 2 September 2005 
regarding 13 outstanding cases.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>465. In six cases, the Government reported that the subjects were being held in different penal 
institutions in Uzbekistan.  The Working Group considered that these replies could constitute 
clarifications, provided that the sources do not raise objections within six months (see 
paragraph 12).  
</p>
<p>466. In seven cases, the Working Group decided that the information provided by the 
Government was insufficient to constitute clarifications.  In all of those cases the Government 
stated that the whereabouts of the persons were unknown but that searches were continuing.  In 
five of the cases criminal proceedings had been instituted but later suspended under article 364, 
paragraph 1.1, of the Code of Criminal Procedure (failure to identify a person against whom 
charges can be brought).  In three of the cases the subject himself was charged in absentia, but 
the case was suspended because the whereabouts of the accused were unknown.  
</p>

</b></p>
<p>467. No new information was received from sources concerning outstanding cases.  
</p>
<p><b>Clarifications

previously applied (see paragraph 11). 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>469. Of the 19 cases transmitted in the past, 2 concerned an Islamic religious leader and his 
assistant who were reportedly detained in 1995 by the National Security Service in Tashkent as 
they were waiting to board an international flight, and another concerned the leader of the 
Islamic Renaissance Party, reportedly an unregistered political party, who was allegedly arrested 
in 1992.  Four cases concerned persons who had reportedly fled to Kyrgyzstan after violent 
events in May 2005 in Andijan, Uzbekistan, and were later returned to Uzbekistan.

Venezuelan man believed to have been arrested by army parachutists.  His case was decided by 
the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 2005, which attributed responsibility to the 
Venezuelan State for the enforced disappearance and the arbitrary detention of the subject and 
ordered the payment of reparation.  The other case concerned a man who allegedly disappeared 
in 1999.  The Government reported that a hearing of the two accused perpetrators (both officers) 
began on 14 October 2005.  The Working Group decided that the information was not sufficient

<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>477. In communications dated 3 March and 13 October 2006, the Government sent 
information concerning all 90 outstanding cases.  In three cases, the Working Group found that 
the responses did not contain sufficient information to clarify the fate or whereabouts of the 
disappeared persons.  For 73 cases, the Working Group decided to apply the six-month rule.  
Over half of these cases involved subjects who reportedly disappeared in 1986.  The vast 
majority of the responses stated that the subject was deceased.   
<b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>478. No information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Meetings</b> 
</p>
<p>479. During the seventy-ninth session, the Working Group met with government 
representatives to discuss outstanding cases and efforts carried out by the Government to clarify 
them.  
</p>
<p><b>Clarifications 
</b></p>
<p>480. Based on information previously received from the Government, the Working Group 
decided to clarify three cases concerning military officers who allegedly disappeared in 1994, 
following the expiration of the six-month rule (see paragraph 11). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Discontinued cases 
</b></p>
<p>481. The Working Group decided, in accordance with paragraph 21 of its methods of work, 
exceptionally to discontinue consideration of 14 cases.  The original source for these cases was 
no longer able to follow up and steps taken by the Working Group to establish communication 
with other sources were unsuccessful.  The Working Group believes that it no longer has a useful 
role to play in trying to elucidate the whereabouts of the persons involved, as no follow-up can 
be given to the cases.  The cases can be reopened at any time if they are presented again to the 
Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>482. The majority of the reported cases occurred in 1986 in the context of the fighting that 
took place in the former People&#8217;s Democratic Republic of Yemen.  Other cases occurred during 
the 1994 civil war. 
</p>
<p>483. Following its field mission to Yemen in 1998, the Working Group recommended that the 
Government consider establishing a special task force of the Supreme National Committee on 
Human Rights.  The Working Group also recommended that the task force further develop 
procedures in order to take the necessary legal steps for the clarification of all cases (see 
E/CN.4/1999/62/Add.1 and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>484. In the past and during the period under review, the Working Group has 
transmitted 150 cases to the Government; of those, 1 case has been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by the source, 62 cases have been clarified on the basis of information 
provided by the Government, 14 cases have been discontinued, and 73 cases remain outstanding 
and under the sixth-month rule. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>485. The Working Group thanks the Government of Yemen for its efforts to clarify the 
outstanding cases, which could be an example for other countries.

<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>486. The Working Group examined a communication sent by the Government 
on 12 October 2006 concerning the three outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p>487. Regarding one case, the Government reported that on 19 June 2000, the subject was 
taken by people driving a pick-up truck.  Four people were charged with his murder, but they 
were acquitted by the Bulawayo High Court on 5 June 2002.  
</p>
<p>488. In the case of a 20-year-old woman alleged to have disappeared with her infant son 
on 1 April 1986, the Government reported that the authorities were still searching for records 
pertaining to the investigation of the case and that there had not been any change in 
circumstances since the last report of 18 August 2003.  
</p>
<p>489. The Working Group decided that the Government information was insufficient to clarify 
these cases.  
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>490. No information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review 
</b></p>
<p>491. Of the reported cases of disappearance, one allegedly occurred in 2000 and concerned a 
polling officer for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change who allegedly disappeared 
in Bulawayo.   
</p>
<p>492. Two other reported cases occurred in 1986 and concerned a mother and 
her 2-month-old son who allegedly disappeared at the hands of persons believed to belong to the 
Zimbabwe African National Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) and were last seen a week later at the 
home of the Chairman of ZANU-PF.  Relatives and witnesses have allegedly been subjected to 
threats, intimidation and reprisals.  One other case occurred in 1985 and concerned a member of 
the ZAPU political party who was allegedly arrested by four men, two of whom were wearing 
police uniforms, and taken away in a police vehicle. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>493. In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted a total 
of four cases to the Government.  Of those, one case was clarified by the Government and three 
cases remain outstanding. </p>

</p>
<p><b>IV. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>495.<b> In 2006, the Working Group transmitted 248 newly reported cases of disappearance 
to 16 Governments, 79 of which allegedly occurred during 2006.  The Working Group used 
the urgent action procedure for 87 of these cases, which allegedly occurred within the three 
months preceding the receipt of the report by the Working Group.  During the reporting 
period, the Working Group was able to clarify 152 cases of disappearance.  The Working 
Group discontinued 18 cases.  The Working Group is grateful for the cooperation received 
from a number of Governments.  Nevertheless, it remains concerned that, of the 79 States 
with outstanding cases, some Governments (Burundi, Guinea, Israel, Mozambique, 
Namibia and Seychelles, as well as the Palestinian Authority), have never replied to the 
Working Group&#8217;s requests for information or its reminders.  Some Governments provide 
responses that do not contain relevant information.  The Working Group urges those 
Governments to fulfil their obligations under the Declaration, the resolutions of the 
General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights.  The cooperation of 
Governments is indispensable to discovering the fate or whereabouts of disappeared 
persons around the globe.</b> 
</p>
<p>496. <b>The Working Group is concerned about underreporting of disappearances in 
certain regions and countries.  This is due, among other reasons, to government restrictions 
on civil society work on this sensitive issue.  The Working Group is concerned that in a 
number of States, legal restrictions are placed upon NGOs working on cases of 
disappearance.  NGO workers and witnesses to disappearances are also subject to threats 
and harassment.  The Working Group strongly urges States to allow NGOs to undertake 
their work freely and without impediment, to allow families of victims of disappearances to 
organize freely without bureaucratic restriction or legislative obstacles and to protect 
witnesses.</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>497. <b>The Working Group calls upon Governments to comply with their obligations 
under articles 7, 8 and 9 of the Declaration:  no circumstances whatsoever may be invoked 
to justify enforced disappearances; no State shall expel, return (refouler) or extradite a 
person to another State where there are substantial grounds to believe that he would be in 
danger of enforced disappearance; and the right of all persons deprived of their liberty to a 
prompt and effective judicial remedy.</b> 
498. <b>The Working Group calls upon Governments to comply with their obligations 
under article 10 of the Declaration.  Any person deprived of liberty shall be held in an 
officially recognized place of detention, accurate information on the detention and transfer 
of such persons should be made promptly available to their families and counsel, and an 
official up-to-date register of detainees must be available in every place of detention.</b> 
</p>
<p>499. <b>The Working Group also calls upon Governments to comply with their obligations 
under article 16, paragraph 2, of the Declaration, which states that perpetrators shall be 
tried only by the competent civilian courts in each State and not by any special tribunals, in 
particular military courts.</b> 
</p>
<p>500. <b>The Working Group reminds Governments that in combating disappearances 
effective preventive measures are crucial.  Among them, the Working Group highlights  
the following:  harmonization of domestic law with the obligations of States under the 
Declaration and other international human rights law; accessible and updated registries of 
detainees; guaranteed access to appropriate information and to places of detention for 
relatives and lawyers of persons deprived of their liberty; ensuring that persons are 
brought before a judicial authority promptly following detention; bringing to justice all 
persons accused of having committed acts of enforced disappearance, ensuring that 
perpetrators do not benefit from any special amnesty law or other similar measures likely 
to provide exemption from criminal proceedings or sanctions; and providing redress and 
adequate compensation to victims and their families.</b> 
</p>
<p>501. <b>In many cases where disappearances arise from conditions of armed conflict not of 
an international character, the way to an enduring and sustainable solution is for the 
international community to take concerted action aimed at tackling the root causes that 
give rise to such internal situations.  It is crucial that early warning indicators pointing to 
the occurrence of or potential for disappearances be monitored with a view to preventing 
this phenomenon.  The Working Group is convinced that well-thought-out policies and 
actions directed at breaking the vicious cycle of increasing poverty that gives rise to conflict 
are among the essential preventive measures to consider in this regard.</b> 
</p>
<p>502. <b>The preventive measures noted above are particularly aimed at democratizing the 
structures of governance and making human rights the cornerstone of public policy.  When 
Governments take steps to create and support specific bodies and institutions charged with 
addressing disappearances, experience has demonstrated that they have highly positive 
results.  For instance, the establishment of investigating bodies, truth commissions and war 
crimes tribunals are concrete actions that may lead to the clarification of cases and to the 
implementation of compensation policies for victims.  These are strongly encouraged and 
supported by the Working Group, subject to the following paragraph.</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>503. <b>A further goal of public policy must be the eradication of the culture of impunity for 
the perpetrators of disappearances that is found to exist in many States.  The Working 
Group therefore wishes to stress again the importance of ending impunity for the 
perpetrators of enforced disappearances.  This must be understood as a crucial step, not 
only in the pursuit of justice but also in effective prevention.  The Working Group 
encourages the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to promote the 
Declaration and to include in its programme of technical cooperation the strengthening of 
national capacities for the prevention and eradication of disappearance.</b> 
</p>
<p>504. <b>The Working Group recommends that the international community and 
international NGOs support the development and strengthening of regional and national 
civil society institutions that could deter serious human rights violations, such as in 
sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the world.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>V.  ADOPTION OF THE REPORT
