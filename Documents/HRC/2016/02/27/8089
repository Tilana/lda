<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government of Portugal, the Working Group of Experts on 
People of African Descent undertook an official visit to Portugal from 16 to 20 May 2011. 
The Working Group members appreciated the comprehensive and frank discussions they 
had with Government and civil society representatives during the visit and also the 
opportunity to meet with members of the Afro-Portuguese community. In the present 
report, the Working Group summarizes information received during its visit regarding the 
general situation of people of African descent in Portugal and the situations that expose 
them to discrimination and outlines the action taken at various levels for their well-being. It 
concludes with recommendations that the Working Group believes will, if implemented, 
make tangible improvements in the situation of people of African descent in Portugal. 
</p>
<p> During their visit, the Working Group found that the challenges faced by people of 
African descent in Portugal related mainly to their lack of recognition as a specific group in 
the national policy and legal framework; the lack of recognition of their positive 
contribution throughout history to the construction and development of the country; the 
lack of qualitative and quantitative disaggregated data by racial or ethnic origin; the 
existence of a circle of poverty, unequal access to education, public services, employment, 
as well as discrimination in the administration and functioning of the justice system; 
existence of racial profiling and police violence; underrepresentation in political and 
institutional decision-making processes, as well as the lack of special measures or 
affirmative action policies in Portugal for people of African descent or other minorities.

<p> The concrete measures recommended by the Working Group include the 
implementation of specific national policies and programmes addressing racial 
discrimination faced by people of African descent, including immigrants of African descent 
living in Portugal and people of African descent with Portuguese citizenship; the revision 
and harmonization of relevant national legislation with international human rights norms; 
the revision of the Government policy that impedes the collection of information 
disaggregated by ethnic or racial origin; the adoption of special measures to alleviate and 
remedy structural discrimination; and the revision of school curriculums. It also 
recommends the effective protection of the rights of children of African descent as 
contained within the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the right to 
citizenship and full recognition by the State.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Bearing in mind its status as a special procedure of the then Commission on Human 
Rights, the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent decided at its 
fourth session to undertake country visits as a means of effectively discharging its mandate. 
The Working Group recognized that such visits could contribute to in-depth understanding 
of the situation of people of African descent in various regions of the world 
(E/CN.4/2005/21, para. 98). 
</p>
<p>2. At the invitation of the Government of Portugal, the Working Group undertook a 
visit to this country from 16 to 20 May 2011. The delegation, headed by Mirjana 
Najcevska, the Chairperson of the Working Group, also included the experts Verene 
Shepherd and Monorama Biswas. During their visit, the experts held meetings with 
Government representatives, the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries 
(Comunidade dos Pa&#237;ses de L&#237;ngua Portuguesa, CPLP) and civil society organizations and 
visited two communities of African descent in Lisbon.  
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group members met with various non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) and held meetings with the Minister of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers; 
the High Commissioner for Immigration and Intercultural Dialogue; the Secretary of State 
for European Affairs and President of the National Commission for Human Rights; the 
Deputy Attorney General; the Acting Portuguese Ombudsman, the Deputy Mayor of 
Lisbon and representatives of the Office of International Relations and Human Rights; the 
Department of Associations and Intercultural Dialogue Support; the Support Programme 
for Immigrants&#8217; Entrepreneurship; the Technical Assistance Office for Immigrant 
</p>
<p>Associations; the Central Office of the Civil Registry; the Ministry of Education; the 
Ministry of Social Security and Labour; the Commission for Equality in Labour and 
Employment; the Commission for Citizenship and Gender Equality and the Ministry of 
Health. The experts also met with the Executive Secretary and staff of the Community of 
Portuguese Speaking Countries, United Nations agencies and members of the Afro-
descendant community in the neighbourhoods of Almada and Alto da Cova da Moura. 
</p>
<p>4. The experts wish to thank the Government for its invitation and for its valuable 
assistance before, during and after their visit to the country. They would also like to thank 
the NGOs and people of African descent with whom they met during their visit. In the 
present report the experts describe the information received by the members of the Working 
Group during their visit to Portugal, identify good practices and make recommendations for 
actions that may assist in remedying challenges that were identified. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context of people of African descent in Portugal 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General situation 
</b></p>
<p>5. Between 1975 and 1980, there was a wave of immigration from Africa to Portugal, 
with people coming or returning from the ex-colonies after decolonization. Amid this wave 
came Africans, especially from Cape Verde, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, and Sao 
Tom&#233; and Principe. Since the 1990s there has been a constant increase in the number of 
immigrants in the country, including from Brazil and Portuguese-speaking African 
countries. There are today approximately 450,000 immigrants in Portugal, i.e. about 4.2 per </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>cent of the total population of 10.7 million.1  Immigrants living in Portugal are not 
acknowledged as ethnic minorities but rather as foreigners.  
</p>
<p>6. Despite the holistic approach taken by Portugal to deal with racial discrimination, 
the generality of the approach to dealing with racial discrimination may not allow sufficient 
attention to the concerns of groups of citizens as well as immigrants and foreigners who 
may be susceptible to direct and indirect discrimination. Notwithstanding innovative 
measures by Portugal to promote integration, prevent and address racial discrimination of 
immigrants and ethnic minorities, racial stereotypes and prejudices against immigrants, 
foreigners and some citizens prevails.2 Studies on immigrants and ethnic minorities reveal 
cases where members of these groups have complained of racial discrimination in a number 
of situations. Discrimination of this kind has occurred in matters relating to access to 
employment, housing and health care.3  Some of these cases have been reported to the High 
Commission for Immigration and Ethnic Minorities (ACIME).  
</p>
<p>7. In the area of education, children from certain immigrant groups, in particular 
Africans, still have lower levels of education than Portuguese pupils and are less likely to 
continue their education.  Difficulties with the language of instruction and a lack of 
accompaniment in the educational process are part of the problem, leading to structural 
discrimination. While there are several programmes specifically directed at supporting the 
social inclusion of children and youngsters within vulnerable social and economic contexts, 
particularly children of immigrants and ethnic minorities, the integration process of 
immigrants is aimed more specifically at recently arrived immigrants, overlooking slightly 
those who arrived longer ago and for whom no special integration measures were available 
at the time.  
</p>
<p>8. However, as with the issues of access to education, employment and housing, it is 
difficult to say with any degree of accuracy the role played by racist prejudices and racial 
discrimination in the treatment of immigrants and people from immigrant backgrounds 
since no relevant data disaggregated by racial or ethnic origin have yet been compiled 
</p>
<p><b> B. Framework for the protection of the human rights of people of African 
</b></p>
<p><b>descent 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The international legal framework for the protection of the human rights of people of 
</b></p>
<p><b>African descent 
</b></p>
<p>9. Portugal has demonstrated its commitment to combating racism and discrimination 
by signing and ratifying a series of international conventions that deal with racism and 
discrimination: the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination (CERD), the two International Covenants, on Civil and Political (ICCPR) 
and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the International Conventions for 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and for the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). In each case, and 
having ratified the relevant Optional Protocols, Portugal recognizes the full range of the 
Committees&#8217; competences to monitor the implementation of these core international human 
</p>
<p>rights treaties, including the powers to examine individual and inter-State communications, 
and to undertake inquiry procedures. Portugal is also a State party to both Optional 
</p>

 2 CERD/C/PRT/CO/12-14, para. 14

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 
</b></p>
<p>Protocols to the CRC. Portugal has also ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol without any reservations.  
</p>
<p>10. Portugal ratified the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and 
its 1967 Protocol. Portugal is also a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court and recognizes as compulsory the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, 
having made the declaration under article 36.2 of the Statute of the Court. 
</p>
<p>11. Regionally, Portugal is a member of the Council of Europe and a party to the 
European Convention on Human Rights. It is also a party to the Revised European Social 
Charter. Portugal accepts the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights and 
recognizes the competence of both the European Committees on Social Rights and for the 
Prevention of Torture. It also recognizes International Labour Organization (ILO) and 
United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) procedures. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The national policy and legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>12. In 1996, Portugal created the High Commission for Immigration and Ethnic 
Minorities to manage the integration and welfare of immigrants and ethnic minorities. In 
2007, this institution was fused with several related programmes and was renamed the High 
Commission for Immigration and Intercultural Dialogue (ACIDI), which operates under the 
authority of the Government Ministry for the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. The 
function of ACIDI is to &#8220;collaborate in the design, implementation and evaluation of 
</p>
<p>transversal and sectorial public policies which are relevant for the integration of immigrant 
and ethnic minorities, as well as to promote the dialogue between different cultures, ethnic 
groups and religions&#8221;. To facilitate its dissemination of information, ACIDI has a television 
</p>
<p>programme, a radio programme and a magazine. In 2004, the then ACIME created two 
National Immigration Support Centres (CNAIs), in Lisbon and Porto, which operate as 
&#8220;one-stop shops&#8221; for the attention of immigrants. These centres offer support to immigrants 
in areas such as legalization and visa issues, professional and educational skills recognition, 
family reunification, employment, access to education, health care, social security, legal aid 
and support for immigrant associations, among others. The members were informed that the 
creation of CNAI was in response to the European Union&#8217;s common agenda on 
immigration which recommended the &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; approach to attending to the needs of 
migrants. According to Government representatives with which the Working Group met, 
the Portuguese model has often been cited as a best practice and goes even further than that 
envisaged by the common agenda in that it provides services to all migrants regardless of 
their legal status and also to long-term migrants. The CNAIs are presented as an example of 
good practice in the &#8220;Handbook on Integration for policy-makers and practitioners&#8221; of the 
Directorate-General of Justice, Freedom and Security at the European Commission.  
</p>
<p>13. A range of services are offered by the sociocultural mediators who staff the CNAIs 
in a variety of languages (Portuguese, Cape Verdean and Guinean Creole, Romanian, 
Russian and English). The Lisbon CNAI involves six Government agencies from five 
Ministries (Immigration and Border Service, the Labour Inspectorate, Social Security, 
Regional Health Administration, Regional Directorate of Education and the Central 
Registry Office), together with other support offices for issues such as family reunification, 
legal advice and employment. The Working Group was also told that most of the users of 
the CNAIs were of African descent.  
</p>
<p>14. Faced with a lack of data disaggregated by racial or ethnic origin, ACIDI maintains 
contacts with a network of research teams in universities (Immigration Observatory), which 
provide recommendations regarding the policies that ACIDI implements, including for 
people of African descent. Currently, the main overarching policy that ACIDI implements 
is the Second Plan of Action for the Integration of Immigrants, the broad objective of which 
is to favour the situation of immigrants by promoting their integration into Portuguese </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>society. The Plan has a duration of four years (2010 to 2013) and involves intervention in 
17 areas by 14 ministries. This plan, which is monitored by the Consultative Council for 
Immigration Affairs (COCAI), is based on an evaluation of the First Plan of Action that 
included public consultation, a needs assessment of immigrant support professionals and 
recommendations made by the Immigration Observatory. The Working Group was 
informed that neither ACIDI nor the Second Plan of Action have special measures directed 
at people of African descent or any other particular ethnic group.  
</p>
<p>15. At the local level, Centres for the Integration of Immigrants (CLAII) replicate on a 
smaller scale what the ACIDI does through projects to promote interculturalism at the 
municipal level. There are 87 CLAIIs throughout Portugal, which are funded by national 
and local authorities. Some of them are run by non-governmental organizations.  
</p>
<p>16. The Commission for Equality and Against Racial Discrimination (CICDR) is an 
independent commission financed by ACIDI which has 18 members. The President of the 
Commission is always the High Commissioner for Immigration and the other members are 
made up of parliamentarians, the Minister of Education, the Minister of Labour, immigrant 
associations, anti-racism associations, labour unions, employers associations and others. 
The Commission collects information on acts of racism and the sanctions imposed. It 
makes recommendations concerning legislation and promotes studies and other research. It 
publishes an annual report on the state of racism in Portugal. On the CICDR website there 
is a form with which complaints of racism can be made.  
</p>
<p>17. The National Commission for Human Rights is presided over by the Secretary of 
State for European Affairs and includes different relevant Ministries and the Office of the 
Ombudsman. The Commission alerts responsible Ministries when Portugal is not up to best 
practice on a given human rights issue, including racism and racial discrimination, so that 
they may adopt corrective measures. Non-governmental organizations alert the 
Commission to human rights problems, as do research institutions in universities. 
</p>
<p>18. In the Office of the Portuguese Ombudsman, complaints related to immigrants and 
foreigners are handled by one of six groups, headed by a Coordinator. The Office of the 
Ombudsman has dealt with few cases of racism or racial discrimination. The Ombudsman 
is the Portuguese National Human Rights Institution in accordance with the Paris 
Principles. 
</p>
<p>19. In Portugal&#8217;s legal regime, racism and its prohibition are referred to in article 13 of 
the Constitution, article 240 of the Criminal Code, Law 134/99 and Law 18/2004. Article 
13.2 of the Constitution states that &#8220;no one may be privileged, favoured, prejudiced, 
</p>
<p>deprived of any right or exempted from any duty for reasons of ancestry, sex, race, 
language, territory of origin, religion, political or ideological beliefs, education, economic 
situation, social circumstances or sexual orientation&#8221;. Article 240 of the Criminal Code 
prohibits racist organizations, incitement to discrimination or racist violence, racial 
vilification and making racist threats. Law 134/99 on the Prohibition of Discrimination in 
the Exercise of Rights due to Motives based on Race, Colour, Nationality or Ethnic Origin 
covers direct and indirect discrimination. According to this law, racial discrimination 
includes any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, 
nationality or ethnic origin which results in annulling or restricting the recognition or 
exercise of a person&#8217;s economic, social and cultural rights. Law 134/99 establishes the 
</p>
<p>CICDR to assist with the law&#8217;s implementation. Law 18/2004 makes racial discrimination 
</p>
<p>an administrative offence as well which is actionable by the relevant Inspector General. </p>

<p><b> III. People of African descent in Portugal: general comments 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Participation of people of African descent in all political, economic, 
</b></p>
<p><b>social and cultural aspects of society and in the advancement and 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic development of the country 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Working Group acknowledges the efforts of the Government of Portugal to 
address the challenges that face people of African descent in this country. Although there 
were no programmes directly targeted at people of African descent, in their meetings with 
Government departments, the members gathered information on the many programmes that 
benefited people of African descent as migrants and promoted their integration into 
Portuguese society. A comprehensive understanding of the situation of people of African 
descent and an accurate evaluation of the success of these programmes was hampered, 
however, by the lack of data disaggregated by racial or ethnic origin. The members were 
repeatedly informed by Government officials and others with whom they met that it was 
Government policy not to collect information disaggregated by race and that, in any event, 
the collection of data disaggregated by racial or ethnic origin was prohibited by the 
Constitution.  Therefore, the evaluation that the Working Group can make of the situation 
of people of African descent in Portugal can be characterized as more of an impression than 
an assertion of fact, the latter requiring the sort of empirical evidence that is simply not 
available in this country.  
</p>
<p>21. As regards the Constitutional prohibition of the collection of data disaggregated by 
racial or ethnic origin, the members found no such constitutional prohibition to exist. The 
article referred to in the Constitution to support the notion of a constitutional impediment to 
the collection of such data, article 35.3, in fact contemplates the collection of data 
disaggregated by race provided that certain safeguards and other conditions are met. In a 
meeting with the Secretary of State for European Affairs and President of the National 
Commission for Human Rights, the Working Group were informed that the prohibition of  
collecting data disaggregated by racial or ethnic origin had been discussed by the 
Commission, which arrived at the conclusion that the prohibition is appropriate and in line 
with the policy of taking measures to combat any form of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>22. The Working Group, while taking note that the Portuguese Law on Data Protection 
(article 7/1 of Law No. 67/98 of 26 October 1998) expressly prohibits the treatment of 
personal data dealing with racial or ethnic origin, regrets the lack of disaggregated 
statistical data on the racial or ethnic composition of the population, both citizens and non-
citizens. 
</p>
<p>23. Through its many meetings with State officials and civil society representatives, the 
Working Group found the following issues to be the most pressing ones in Portugal as 
regards the participation of people of African descent in all political, economic, social and 
cultural aspects of society and in the advancement and economic development of their 
country. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Employment 
</b></p>
<p>24. During a presentation on the Government&#8217;s Immigrant Job Centre Network, the 
Working Group was informed that the centres provide support to immigrants searching for 
employment through training and job matching. The centres cross-reference immigrants 
looking for work with vacancies. The members were informed that about one third of the 
centres&#8217; clients were of African descent. In a meeting with the Institute of Employment and 
</p>
<p>Professional Training (IEFP), the members were informed that their mandate was to 
promote the creation and quality of jobs and fight unemployment. In order to register at one </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>of the 86 job centres throughout the country a person must present identification, 
Portuguese or foreign, and a valid wok permit in the case of foreigners. The members were 
told that the IEFP does not have programmes that target foreigners or immigrants, except 
&#8220;Portugal Welcomes You&#8221;, which provides Portuguese-language classes and classes in 
citizenship. Thirty-two (32) per cent of the foreigners registered in the job centre&#8217;s 
programmes were Africans. Under the &#8220;Portugal Welcomes You&#8221; programme, the Training 
for Citizenship course contains useful information for migrants, such as rights and duties, 
paying taxes, respecting the laws, access to education, gaining approval for qualifications, 
accessing accommodation etc. The members were informed that the IEFP did not have any 
specific policies or programmes for people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>25. In a meeting with the Organisation of Portuguese Speaking Countries, the members 
were informed that migrants of African descent, particularly irregular migrants, have 
difficulty finding employment. Irregular migrants from Eastern Europe are steadily 
replacing the work done by irregular migrants of African descent, as they are less visible 
and less likely to be spotted by the relevant authorities. Due to the difficult employment 
situation that irregular and regular migrants of African descent face, exacerbated by the 
economic crisis that Portugal is going though, many would like to return to Africa but do 
not have the financial resources to do so.  
</p>
<p>26. The Working Group was informed that people of African descent were often found 
performing manual labour and not in decision-making positions. There is a general 
tendency for men of African descent to be employed in construction and women in 
domestic work. Whereas child labour used to be a considerable problem in Portugal, 
legislation has been enacted and an appropriate programme put in place which has 
improved the situation significantly. The members were told that the economic crisis that 
Portugal was suffering had particularly affected the most vulnerable members of society, 
such as migrants of African descent.  
</p>
<p>27. The results of a sociological survey of Afro-descendant youths provided by the 
Government gives some indication as to general trends in the areas of employment. The 
survey was conducted between 2003 and 2005 and was of 1,000 individuals aged 15 to 29 
years old, living in Lisbon and its surrounding area, and also included 22 interviews. The 
results indicated that in 2004 18.1 per cent of the samples of youth of African descent were 
unemployed, compared to 10.5 per cent of youth in general living in Portugal. The survey 
also showed that about 40 per cent of young employed men of African descent, and about 
50 per cent of Afro-descendant fathers, worked in construction, while 66 per cent of young 
women of African descent and 75 per cent of Afro-descendant mothers were employed as 
service workers or sellers. According to the survey, 60.3 per cent of the samples of young 
people of African descent were employed as blue-collar workers, compared to 35.1 per cent 
of Portuguese youth in general living in Portugal while 0.6 per cent of the samples were 
employed as entrepreneurs, managers and professionals compared to 7.6 per cent of youths 
in general. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Access to education 
</b></p>
<p>28. In a meeting with the Ministry of Education, the Working Group was told about the 
&#8220;Between Cultures&#8221; programme, which promotes intercultural dialogue through sensitising 
sessions, teacher training and the training of intercultural mediators. This training is offered 
throughout the country and online as well. The intercultural mediators are placed in public 
institutions to help support the interaction of immigrants with the institution by, for 
instance, facilitating communication. The mediators are appointed by immigrant 
associations and have been, in practice, of the national origin of the majority of the 
immigrants in the region serviced by the particular institution. The Between Cultures </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10 
</b></p>
<p>programme recognizes the importance of working with the host community as well as the 
immigrants in order to promote smooth integration.  
</p>
<p>29. In a meeting with the Minister of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, the 
members were informed that in 2012 a kit would be delivered to all schools to promote the 
celebration of diversity. In a meeting with the National Agency for Qualifications (ANQ), 
the members were informed that ANQ had an office in the CNAI that advised immigrants 
on educational options and the homologation of qualifications. ANQ does not have 
programmes directed at a specific ethnic group, such as people of African descent, but 60 
per cent of the people involved in their programmes aimed at immigrants are of African 
descent. Another ANQ programme is the &#8220;New Opportunity Centre&#8221;, which provides adults 
the opportunity to improve their qualifications. There are about 450 of these centres 
throughout the country. ANQ has a cooperation protocol with the High Commissioner for 
Immigration to ensure that the immigrant population has the same access to the New 
Opportunities programme as the rest of the population. They also have an agreement with a 
university that has a special programme, or stream, in first year that is for people issued 
with a certificate from New Opportunities. This initiative has assisted migrants of African 
descent gain entry into university. 
</p>
<p>30. The Working Group was told by non-governmental organizations that access to 
education was often a problem for people of African descent due to difficulties with the 
language of instruction, a lack of accompaniment in the educational process and problems 
in the home environment. This leads to structural discrimination whereby the lack of 
successful education outcomes for students of African descent in turn leads to a lack of 
employment opportunities, a lower income and a compromised environment for their 
children. While there were no programmes in schools to promote non-discrimination, the 
Working Group learnt, however, that in those schools with a large proportion of students of 
African descent, the curriculum is sometimes modified to make it more culturally 
appropriate.  
</p>
<p>31. In a meeting with non-governmental organizations, the Working Group was told that 
school textbooks did not include the contributions of people of African descent in the 
development of Portugal. The contributions to Portugal of former colonies are not reflected 
in school texts and children of African descent are not taught to be proud of their heritage 
and background. Another deficiency is the lack of bilingual teaching programmes. One 
reason for such shortcomings, it was explained, is that the Afro-descendant community is 
not involved in the design of the school curriculum. It was also noted that there are very 
few teachers of African descent.  
</p>
<p>32. A representative of a non-governmental organization informed the Working Group 
that, as many adults of African descent were illiterate manual labourers, their children 
quickly become more educated than them and there is a transfer of authority from the adult 
to the child. This has adverse social and psychological effects upon the family.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Access to housing 
</b></p>
<p>33. In a meeting with the Deputy Mayor of Lisbon, the Working Group was told that 
there are areas within certain neighbourhoods which are inhabited predominantly by people 
of African descent, but they are to be found living in all parts of the city except for the 
historical centre. Lisbon, the Working Group was informed, does not have ethnic &#8220;ghettos&#8221; 
as such. There may be certain areas in the city where a certain ethnic community are more 
often found, but these neighbourhoods are not particularly impoverished. 
</p>
<p>34. During their visits to the predominantly Afro-descendant neighbourhoods of Almada 
and Cova da Moura, the Working Group found the housing there to be modest but 
providing a dignified standard of accommodation, with access to all the utilities that one </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>would expect to find in a developed country. In a meeting with non-governmental 
organizations, the Working Group was informed, however, that on occasion buildings 
housing families of African descent had been demolished with no alternative housing 
assured. 
</p>
<p>35. Access to dignified housing did not appear to the Working Group to be as urgent a 
challenge for the Afro-Portuguese community as they have found it to be for Afro-
descendant communities in other countries.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Access to health care 
</b></p>
<p>36. It was explained to the Working Group that youth pregnancy was a big problem for 
many migrant communities, including people of African descent and that more needed to 
be done to educate migrant teenagers on avoiding unwanted pregnancy. The members were 
also informed that there are insufficient information campaigns on human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other health issues directed at migrants. Such 
campaigns would assist immigrants of African descent in understanding these issues and 
how to gain access to treatment when necessary.  
</p>
<p>37. In a meeting with CPLC, the Working Group was informed that some Africans and 
people of African descent come to Portugal to receive medical treatment, but because the 
public health system takes so long they end up becoming unintentional immigrants. 
</p>
<p>38. In a meeting with non-governmental organisations, the Working Group was told that 
one of the difficulties faced by people of African descent was receiving medical care if they 
were irregular migrants. As with the issue of access to housing, it was difficult for the 
Working Group to arrive at a conclusive opinion regarding the quality of access to health 
care enjoyed by people of African descent in Portugal. This was again due to the lack of 
relevant data disaggregated by racial or ethnic origin. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Participation in public life 
</b></p>
<p>39. In a meeting with the Minister of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, the 
Working Group was informed that the relatively low parliamentary participation by people 
of African descent was not due to discrimination but more to do with the low level of 
political participation by communities of African descent.  
</p>
<p>40. In a meeting with non-governmental organizations, the Working Group was 
informed that there is no effective political representation of people of African descent in 
Portugal and that there was only one parliamentarian of African descent in the Portuguese 
parliament. The Working Group was told that there is poor leadership among people of 
African descent, that there are many neighbourhood organizations of Afro-descendant 
communities and that some receive financial assistance from the Government but that these 
organizations were often manipulated by politicians for their own interests.  
</p>
<p>41. One problem that the Working Group was informed of in several meetings was the 
difficulty that many people of African descent have in acquiring Portuguese citizenship. In 
a meeting with non-governmental organizations, the Working Group was informed that a 
child born in Portugal is given Portuguese nationality provided that their parents&#8217; situation 
was regularized at the time of birth. Civil society representatives suggested that the law 
should be changed so as to confer citizenship upon all those born in Portugal, regardless of 
the situation of their parents.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>42. In a meeting with the Acting Ombudsman, the Working Group was informed that, 
although there were no statistics to verify it, there is a perception that there are a high </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12 
</b></p>
<p>number of men of African descent in Portuguese prisons, particularly young men. Although 
there are no statistics disaggregated by racial or ethnic origin, there are statistics 
disaggregated by nationality. These statistics indicated that just over 1 per cent of the 
population in Portugal are citizens of African countries, while 11.66 per cent of the inmates 
in Portuguese prisons are citizens of an African country. People of African descent with 
Portuguese citizenship and those from countries outside of Africa (such as Brazil) are not 
included in this figure. The Ombudsman&#8217;s office does not have complaints that identify the 
complainant as being of African descent but they do characterize complainants as being 
foreigners when appropriate. One problem allegedly faced by foreign inmates, including 
those of African descent, is that they do not have access to the special leave from jail 
programme. The Ombudsman informed the members that his office has received very few 
complaints based on racial discrimination during the last 10 years. 
</p>
<p>43. In a meeting with the Deputy Attorney General, the Working Group was informed 
that there had been two criminal convictions for racial discrimination. One was a case of 
defamation but the person was also convicted of discrimination, while the other case 
concerned the distribution of racist leaflets. The two cases involved a message directed at a 
racial group, not an individual, and the courts are tending to convict on the ground of 
racism only in those cases where the racism is directed at groups. There are other cases 
where, for the purposes of sentencing, racism has been found to be an aggravating factor in 
the commission of other crimes. The Constitutional Court has abolished a neo-Nazi 
organisation for inciting racial hatred and in January 2011 a far-right leader was convicted 
of racism and sentenced to 17 years prison. This conviction is currently under appeal. The 
Deputy Attorney General told the Working Group that there was no data concerning access 
to justice by people of African descent due to the legislative constraints upon the collection 
of such data. 
</p>
<p>44. In a meeting with non-governmental organizations, the Working Group was 
informed that racism in Portugal is mostly subtle and not immediately apparent. Very few 
cases of racism have been tried, perhaps three in the past 10 years. There is, however, a 
problem with racial profiling and police violence directed at people of African descent. The 
Working Group was informed by a non-governmental organization that the rate at which 
people of African descent are killed by the police in Portugal was higher than any other 
country of the European Union.  
</p>
<p>45. According to non-governmental organizations with which the members met, police 
target Afro-descendant immigrants and carry out large-scale operations in neighbourhoods 
where they live. They are racially profiled by the police and stigmatized. Several members 
of a predominantly Afro-descendant community informed the Working Group of incidents 
of police brutality and cases where the police had broken into homes in the neighbourhood 
of Cova da Moura without a search warrant on the pretext of looking for somebody. 
According to those interviewed, young people of African descent from the community were 
often the victims of racial profiling by the police, who stop them in the street for 
questioning simply because of the colour of their skin.   
</p>
<p><b> 7. Poverty 
</b></p>
<p>46. In its meeting with the National Commission for Human Rights, the Working Group 
was informed that Portugal&#8217;s policies to combat poverty and discrimination against the 
</p>
<p>impoverished had been very successful and that this had greatly benefited people of African 
descent as they were frequently impoverished. These, and the generous nationality laws, 
had been in place of affirmative action measures, which were not possible in Portugal. 
</p>
<p>47. According to a non-governmental organization with which the Working Group met, 
there are many people of African descent in Portugal who live below the poverty line. The 
Working Group visited a community of predominantly Afro-descendants on the outskirts of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>Lisbon in the neighbourhood Alto da Cova da Moura. A non-governmental organization 
that has programmes in this neighbourhood explained to the members that the community 
was established in the 1980s, mostly by people from Cape Verde, but also from Guinea-
Bissau and other countries. The non-governmental organization began in the early 1980s,  
initially as a local association to obtain water for the neighbourhood, but it went on to build 
a library which now has 700 readers. The organization received funding from the European 
Union for several of its programmes, which include training programmes for domestic 
employees and teaching aids. Although poverty alleviation is a necessity in this 
neighbourhood, the organization does not provide charity as it believes that this would 
create dependence. Instead, it focuses on education and training as well as running a cr&#232;che 
and cultural activities. The organization also works in the prevention of domestic violence.  
</p>
<p><b> 8. Citizenship 
</b></p>
<p>48. In several of the meetings that the Working Group had with non-governmental 
organizations, concerns were raised about the difficulties that migrants of African descent 
could face in obtaining Portuguese citizenship. Non-governmental organizations were 
concerned at the negative impact upon access to fundamental services by children who did  
not have Portuguese citizenship and recommended that a <i>jus solis </i>approach be adopted 
whereby all children born in Portugal have the right to Portuguese citizenship. 
</p>
<p>49. In a meeting with the Citizenship Department of the Civil Registry, the Working 
Group was informed that children of irregular migrants parents were always given identity 
documents at birth and that abandoned children were always given Portuguese citizenship. 
Babies born to foreigners are given a birth certificate in the hospital. While home births are 
very rare these days, in these cases a medical certificate is produced at the registry&#8217;s office 
</p>
<p>and a birth certificate is issued. Minors can obtain citizenship when one of their parents has 
been in Portugal regularly for five years. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Policies for the integration of people of African descent 
</b></p>
<p>50. At a meeting with the Minister of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, the 
Working Group was informed that Portugal&#8217;s immigration policy was recently ranked 
</p>
<p>second in the list of European countries and was the most improved in the top 10. 
According to the Minister, migration was not a topic that causes conflict in Portugal and 
racist attitudes towards people of African descent were not very prominent. Diversity is 
value in the Portuguese model of society and there is funding for community projects that 
celebrate diversity.  
</p>
<p>51. One of the programmes implemented by ACIDI is specifically directed at supporting 
the social inclusion of children and youngsters within vulnerable<b> </b>social and economic 
contexts, particularly children of immigrants and ethnic minorities and is called &#8220;Choices&#8221;. 
It was created, inter alia, to address the physical isolation, language problems and other 
challenges that the children of immigrants faced. The Choices programme currently 
supports 132 other programmes in 71 municipalities throughout the country. Under the 
Choices programme, projects compete for funding according to set criteria. Civil society 
organizations that wish to benefit from Choices funding may select from an &#224; la carte menu 
of projects that can be implemented by them or present their own project. The most 
common implementers of Choices programmes are schools and there were 170 schools 
benefiting from such funding when the members visited the country. The Choices 
programme includes projects on vocational training, civic and community participation, 
computer literacy, entrepreneurship and empowerment and most beneficiaries are between 
14 and 18 years old. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 
</b></p>
<p>52. One of the barriers facing many immigrants, including those of African descent, is 
that of language. The members were informed by the Portuguese authorities about the 
programme &#8220;Portuguese for All&#8221;, whereby all those in possession of a valid title of 
</p>
<p>residence, regardless of citizenship status, are entitled to a Portuguese language and culture 
course that has a duration of 150 hours. The course contributes significantly to the 
integration of immigrants into Portuguese society.  
</p>
<p>53. In a presentation made by the Office for Technical Assistance to Immigrant 
Associations (GATAI), the Working Group was told that the Office supports the planning, 
implementation and evaluation of initiatives by immigrant associations. Certain criteria 
must be satisfied by an immigrant association before it is recognized as such by GATAI. 
The association must have at least 100 members, an elected governing body, published 
statutes, at least two years&#8217; existence and be registered on the National Register of 
Corporations. The Consultative Council for Immigration Affairs (COCAI) takes the 
decisions concerning recognition of associations. At the time of the members&#8217; visit, there 
</p>
<p>were 125 immigrant associations recognized by GATAI<b> </b>and 70 per cent of them 
represented people of African origin.  
</p>
<p>54. The members were informed that there were no special measures or affirmative 
action policies in Portugal for people of African descent or other minorities. Such measures 
would, according to Government policy, be deemed to be favouritism towards one 
population group and be in conflict with the country&#8217;s non-discrimination policy. Non-
governmental organizations pointed out that there was a need for special programmes to 
assist people of African descent in integrating into mainstream Portuguese society. Such 
programmes could be based on sport and other recreational activities, for example, and 
serve to address the current social exclusion that many Afro-descendants feel. Non-
governmental organizations recognised that the Government had had success in social 
integration with its &#8220;New Opportunities&#8221; programme which provides vocational training to 
immigrants, including those of African descent. The Working Group was informed that,  
within the Consultative Council for Immigration Affairs, there are five seats reserved for 
people of African descent and one seat for each of five largest African national 
communities in Portugal. 
</p>
<p>55. In its meetings with non-governmental organizations, the Working Group was told 
that there was a general feeling among people of African descent that they belong to a 
separate society from the mainstream Portuguese population. Academic institutions 
informed the members that the official policy for the inclusion of people of African descent 
into Portuguese society is one more approximating assimilation than multiculturalism. The 
official disinclination to collect data disaggregated by racial or ethnic origin is offered as 
evidence of assimilation being the official inclusion policy. Contrary to this, several of the 
Government bodies with which the Working Group met described the official policy as one 
of &#8220;interculturalism&#8221;. In a meeting with ACIDI<b> </b>the Working Group was informed that the 
Choices programme for the social inclusion of migrant youths and children was based upon 
interculturalism rather than multiculturalism, as the latter ends in stereotyping and 
tokenism. Interculturalism offers young people the choice of the best aspects of both 
mainstream Portuguese culture and their culture of origin, placing an emphasis on what 
they share rather than what differences may exist.  
</p>
<p>56. The Working Group was taken to visit a project funded by the Choices programme 
in the neighbourhood of Almada. The project, a youth drop-in centre, had a computer room 
and lounge area and was run by a charitable organization. The centre is open to all the 
youths from 12 to 18 years old of the local area, which has a large Afro-descendant 
population. The programmes that the centre offers are in the areas of social inclusion, 
computer skills, dancing, football and entrepreneurship. The members were told that 1,500 
people use the centre every month. Some of the major problems among the youths of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>neighbourhood are those of unemployment, teenage pregnancies, lack of documentation, 
petty crime and school dropout rates. The centre intercedes with schools on behalf of 
troubled students when there are problems and implements a special class in schools for 
children at risk of dropping out. As well as the projects already mentioned, the centre tries 
to address these issues using positive role models from among 18 to 24 year olds.  
</p>
<p>57. In a meeting with the Deputy Mayor of Lisbon, the Working Group was told about 
the planned project &#8220;Africa.cont&#8221;, which aims to be a cultural centre and focal point 
</p>
<p>between Africa and Portugal. It is to be supported by both the local and national 
Governments. The cultural centre will be developed in a renovated warehouse by the river 
and will contain exhibitions of African art, literature and other items that showcase African 
creativity.  
</p>
<p>58. The Working Group was informed that there was no national day to commemorate 
the slave trade or emancipation and that because slaves were generally taken by Portuguese 
slave traders to the colonies there was not such an interest in the history of slavery in 
Portugal itself.  
</p>
<p>59. The Working Group was informed that the discrimination against people of African 
descent that exists in Portugal is covert and not perhaps immediately apparent. It is often 
structural in nature and reflected in stereotypes that are perpetuated in the media. If, for 
instance, a crime is reported in the media, the racial origin of the person will often be 
reported if that person is black; or the neighbourhood where the crime is committed will be 
reported if that neighbourhood is known as one where Afro-descendants live. The effect is 
to link people of African descent with criminality. Although not all journalists do this, there 
are those that do. The general attitude of the Portuguese media towards Africa and people 
of African descent was described as patronizing by academic institutions with which the 
Working Group met.  
</p>
<p>60. In a meeting with non-governmental organizations, it was explained to the members 
that the African community in Portugal had a very low profile and that African culture was 
still considered to be on the margins of Portuguese society. It is not, for example, 
represented on mainstream television. They were informed that the official characterization 
of racism and colonisation was that (a) racism is individual behaviour, which eliminates 
collective responsibility, and that (b) Portuguese colonization was a &#8220;benign&#8221; or &#8220;soft&#8221; form 
of colonization. This has resulted in an inaccurate version of Portugal&#8217;s colonial past being 
taught in classrooms along with the idea that racism was not a particularly relevant issue in 
Portugal today. In contrast to this, the Working Group was also told that there are a 
growing number of racist movements in Portugal. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Gender perspective 
</b></p>
<p>61. In a meeting with the Commission for Citizenship and Gender Equality, the 
Working Group was informed that Portugal was currently implementing the IV National 
Plan Against Domestic Violence. Police statistics on domestic violence, which are 
disaggregated by migrant communities, show that the Brazilian and Cape Verde 
communities had made the most complaints among migrants. The information was not, 
however, disaggregated by racial or ethnic origin. Portugal is also implementing the IV 
National Plan for Equality, Gender Equality, Citizenship and Non-discrimination, which 
has a priority the mainstreaming of gender in public policy. The gender aspect needed to be 
considered in all forms of discrimination, including racial discrimination.  
</p>
<p>62. A problem that women of African descent face in Portugal that also occurred in 
other countries is that they are forced to work several jobs at the same time in order to 
support their families as single mothers. This results in their spending little time with their </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 
</b></p>
<p>children and often leads to youth behavioural problems such as involvement in gangs and 
petty crime.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The Working Group greatly appreciates the comprehensive and informative 
meetings that were held with Government agencies during the country visit. It notes 
</b></p>
<p><b>with satisfaction the existence of several institutions, including the High Commission 
</b></p>
<p><b>for Immigration and Intercultural Dialogue (ACIDI), the National Commission for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights, the Office of the Portuguese Ombudsman and their positive work for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the promotion and protection of the rights migrants, including people of African 
</b></p>
<p><b>descent.  
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Working Group welcomes the existence of several programmes and other 
governmental initiatives aimed at the integration of migrants into Portuguese society, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including a large number of measures in fields such as education, employment, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>culture. These programmes positively affect people of African descent, particularly 
</b></p>
<p><b>the implementation of the Second Plan of Action for the Integration of Immigrants. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Working Group also welcomes the fact that diversity is valued in the Portuguese 
</b></p>
<p><b>model of society and notes with appreciation the allocation of financial resources for 
</b></p>
<p><b>community projects that celebrate diversity. 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Working Group notes with satisfaction that Portugal&#8217;s immigration policy 
<b>was recently ranked second in the list of European countries and was the most 
</b></p>
<p><b>improved in the top 10.    
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The Working Group notes that there are no racial or ethnic minorities 
recognized as such in Portugal. People of African descent living in the country are not 
</b></p>
<p><b>acknowledged as racial or ethnic minorities but rather as immigrants. When speaking 
</b></p>
<p><b>about treatment of people of African descent, the Government refers to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>integration of people coming from abroad; there is no special recognition of people of 
</b></p>
<p><b>African descent who are nationals. As a result of the above, relevant legislation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutional structures are related to the integration of immigrants. As people of 
</b></p>
<p><b>African descent are not recognized as a racial or ethnic minority in the national legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework or as a specific group out of the groups of immigrants, there are no 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific national policies or programme addressing their human rights situation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>people of African descent.  
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Working Group recognizes the very unique relationship between Portugal 
and people of African descent, including the colonial past, long historic, economic and 
</b></p>
<p><b>political relations with several African countries and Brazil, and long-standing and 
</b></p>
<p><b>newer waves of immigration by people of African descent to the country. As such, it 
</b></p>
<p><b>notes with concern the non-existence of specific national policies directly targeting 
</b></p>
<p><b>nationals or migrants of African descent.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Working Group expresses concern at the lack of acknowledgment of the 
</b>legacy and influence of Portugal&#8217;s colon<b>ial past and the specific role played by people 
</b></p>
<p><b>of African descent during this period. It is also concerned about the insufficient 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognition of people of African descent as part of contemporary Portuguese society 
</b></p>
<p><b>and of their positive contribution throughout history to the construction and 
</b></p>
<p><b>development of the country  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Working Group learnt that the school texts and curriculums do not reflect 
the contribution to Portugal of its former colonies nor promote pride for children of 
</b></p>
<p><b>African descent in their heritage and background. Afro-descendant communities are 
</b></p>
<p><b>not involved in the design of the school curriculum and there are very few teachers of 
</b></p>
<p>African descent. This has resulted in an inaccurate version of Portugal&#8217;s colonial past 
</p>
<p><b>being taught in classrooms along with the idea that racism is not a particularly 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant issue in Portugal today. In contrast to this, the Working Group was also told 
</b></p>
<p><b>that there are a growing number of racist manifestations in the country.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Working Group observes that national legislation expressly prohibits the 
treatment of personal data dealing with racial or ethnic origin and regrets the lack of 
</b></p>
<p><b>statistical disaggregated data on the ethnic or racial composition of the population, 
</b></p>
<p><b>both citizens and non-citizens. The lack of reliable statistic data prevents the much 
</b></p>
<p><b>needed analysis of the socio-economic living conditions of people of African descent 
</b></p>
<p><b>living in Portugal.   
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Despite the lack of disaggregated data, the Working Group observes that 
people of African descent suffer from social exclusion and marginalization. They also 
</b></p>
<p><b>face high poverty rates; unequal access to quality education, health and other public 
</b></p>
<p><b>services and employment; and discrimination in the administration and functioning of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the justice system, including disproportionate rates of incarceration. These problems 
</b></p>
<p><b>affect people of African descent on multiple levels and are not being sufficiently 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressed, at the federal, state and local levels.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Working Group expresses concern about the existence of racial profiling 
and police violence, directed at people of African descent. The Working Group learnt 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the rate at which people of African descent were killed by the police in Portugal 
</b></p>
<p><b>was higher than any other country of the European Union.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Working Group also notes the relatively low levels of participation and the 
underrepresentation in political and institutional decision-making processes of people 
</b></p>
<p><b>of African descent in Portugal, particularly at the parliamentary level. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Although the Working Group recognizes that racism is addressed in several 
laws and programmes, the experts learnt that racism in Portugal is mostly subtle and 
</b></p>
<p><b>not immediately apparent. This necessitates institutions and programs tailored to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific situation of people of African descent in order to change current official policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>for inclusion into Portuguese society from an approach approximating assimilation to 
</b></p>
<p><b>one of multiculturalism. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Related to this, the Working Group notes that that there are no affirmative-
action policies or special measures in Portugal addressed for people of African descent 
</b></p>
<p><b>or other minorities. Such measures would, according to Government policy, be 
</b></p>
<p><b>deemed to be favouritism towards one population group and be in conflict with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>non-discrimination policy. Non-governmental organizations pointed out that there 
</b></p>
<p><b>was a need for special programmes to assist people of African descent in integrating 
</b></p>
<p><b>into mainstream Portuguese society.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Many of those consulted believe the Government had not adequately 
implemented the existing legislative framework and national policies with respect to 
</b></p>
<p><b>people of African descent and had failed in several aspects to respond adequately to 
</b></p>
<p><b>their problems or to devise meaningful and enforceable solutions, leaving them and 
</b></p>
<p><b>their communities in a neglected situation.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1

</b></p>
<p><b> B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> In view of the above, the following recommendations are proposed by the 
Working Group to the Government of Portugal. It is recommended that it: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Adopt legal and institutional measures to promote equality and address 
</b></p>
<p><b>racial discrimination experienced by people of African descent who are Portuguese 
</b></p>
<p><b>citizens and ensure that the issues related to people of African descent are not treated 
</b></p>
<p>exclusively as migrants&#8217; issues<b>; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Tackle racism and racial discrimination faced by people of African 
</b></p>
<p><b>descent by using a holistic approach, touching all levels of society. The particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>history and context of all people of African descent leaving in Portugal, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>nationals and migrants, should be taken into account and reflected in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive action agenda of legislation, practical measures, and monitoring 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance mechanisms;   
</b></p>

<p><b>Appendix 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Submission by Portugal of information regarding the report 
on the visit to Portugal of the Working Group of Experts on 
People of African Descent (16 to 20 May 2011) 
</b></p>
<p>The information that Portugal is submitting has been provided by the Ministries of Justice, 
Home Affairs, Education and Science, Solidarity and Social Security, Economy and 
Labour, as well as by the High Commissioner for Immigration and Intercultural Dialogue, 
the Commission for Citizenship and Gender Equality and the Attorney&#8217;s General Cabinet of 
</p>
<p>Documentation and Compared Law. 
</p>
<p>As a general preliminary comment, it is important to bear in mind that a large number of 
the persons of African Descent in Portugal are Portuguese citizens. Many of them were 
already born in Portugal. Furthermore, in Portugal persons of African descent are not 
exclusively black-skinned. Therefore, to limit the concept of African Descent exclusively to 
black-skinned persons risks excluding other persons. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Information regarding the acquisition of the Portuguese nationality 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Para. 41, 48 and 49) 
</b></p>
<p>According to the Nationality Law, as amended by Organic Law 2/2006, a child born in 
Portugal to foreign parents is entitled to Portuguese nationality if <b>at least one of parents</b> 
has been legally living in Portugal for <b>five years</b>. This requirement applies to all foreigners 
living in the country, <b>irrespective of their origin</b> (article 1&#186;/1/e) of the Nationality Law). 
</p>
<p>The loosening of the requirements to acquire the Portuguese Nationality expressed above is 
part of the wider 2006 reform in the Nationality Law aimed at reinforcing the <i>jus solli</i> 
approach, in order to address the profound demographic changes that have occurred in the 
country, mostly due to the increasing flux of immigration which started in the 1990&#8217;s. 
</p>
<p>Three new subjective rights to the acquisition of the Portuguese Nationality, reinforcing the 
<i>jus solli</i> criterion, have been established: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; a child born in Portugal to foreign parents is entitled to Portuguese Nationality if at 
least one of the parents was also born in Portugal and resides in Portugal 
(irrespective of his/her legal or illegal status) at the time of the birth of the child 
(article 1&#186;/1/d of the  Nationality Law); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; a minor, born in Portugal to foreign parents, can be naturalised Portuguese if, at the 
time of the request for naturalization, one of the parents has been legally residing in 
Portugal or, alternatively, if the said minor has concluded the Portuguese basic 
schooling system; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; in addition the anti-statelessness clause (article 1.&#186;/1/f) of the Nationality Law) states 
that all those born in Portugal, who otherwise would be stateless, are entitled to the 
Portuguese Nationality. This rule also applies to foundlings. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Access of foreign inmates to the special leave from jail programme 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Para 42) 
</b></p>
<p>The access to special leave from jail is regulated under Law 115/2009. The criteria 
established under article 78 do not include any reference, impediment or discriminatory 
treatment based on nationality, origin or descent of the inmate. One of the criterion taken 
into account when deciding on special leave from jail is the existence of a social or family 
environment where the inmate can be housed during the leave period Prison services 
contact organizations which could host those inmates (nationals or foreigners) who meet all 
the criteria for the jail leave, but who would otherwise not be granted it due to the lack of a 
social or family environment. 
</p>
<p>The statement contained in paragraph 42 that &#8220;foreign inmates do not have access to the 
</p>
<p>special leave from jail&#8221; is therefore not correct. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. </b>Alleged &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; and <b>police violence (Para. 44, 45, 72) 
</b></p>
<p>Regarding the allegations of &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; by the police, &#8220;stigmatization&#8221;, &#8220;police 
</p>
<p>brutality&#8221;, or &#8220;the rate of people of African descent killed by the police in Portugal&#8221;,  it is 
</p>
<p>important to note that police agents can only act in accordance with the required legal 
procedures. All cases of illegal use of force have disciplinary and criminal sanctions.  
</p>
<p>To prevent such illegal instances, inspection actions are undertaken by independent 
institutions (namely the Inspectorate General for Home Affairs). 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, all police bodies in Portugal receive initial and continuous training regarding 
the respect of human rights. Training includes issues related to racial discrimination, the use 
of violence and the constitutional and legal principles of necessity, adequacy and 
proportionality in performing their tasks of keeping public order and security. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. </b>Alleged &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; in the media (Para. 59)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>Notwithstanding the constitutionally granted freedom of press and expression, the conduct 
of the media is also subject to the general law which criminalises racism and racial 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission for Equality and Against Racial Discrimination (High 
Commission for Immigration and Intercultural Dialogue) has issued a communication 
addressed to all media urging them not to reveal nor to focus reports on the nationality, 
ethnicity, religion or the legal status of a certain person or group of persons. If these 
guidelines are not respected, the Commission directly contacts the responsible media actor 
asking it to consider revising its report. The Judiciary Police also follows these guidelines 
in all its official statements. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Alleged growing number of racist movements and manifestations (Para 
</b></p>
<p><b>60 and 69)</b> 
</p>
<p>The sole extreme right party in Portugal has never had significant electoral results. It has 
never had a member elected to the Parliament. During the last general elections, in 2011, it 
had 0.32% of the votes. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>In 2010/2011, the Judiciary Police did not receive a single complaint relating to racist 
propaganda. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b> 6. Para 19 
</b></p>
<p>In addition to the referred legislation it could be added that the Foreigners Law (32/2007) 
and the Asylum Law (27/2008) contain explicit references to the respect for Human Rights 
and for the international human rights treaties that Portugal is a party to. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Allegation that the Portuguese model of inclusion favours assimilation 
</b></p>
<p><b>rather than multiculturalism (Para. 55 and 74) 
</b></p>
<p>If considered appropriate, a reference could be made to article 3 e) of Decree-Law 167/97, 
which defines the mandate of the High Commission for Immigration and Intercultural 
Dialogue as &#8220;Promoting interculturalism, through intercultural and interreligious 
<i>dialogue, valorising cultural diversity in a framework of mutual res</i>pect&#8221;.  </p>
<p><b> 8. Access to medical care by irregular migrants (Para. 38) 
</b></p>
<p>The information contained in this paragraph is out dated. Since 2009 (DGS 12/DQS/DMD), 
all migrants, irrespective of their legal status, benefit from the health care provided by the 
National Health Service. 
</p>
<p><b> 9. Access to health by foreigners from Portuguese Speaking African 
</b></p>
<p><b>Countries (Para 37) 
</b></p>
<p>A reference could be made in this paragraph to the &#8220;Health Support Programme to 
</p>
<p>Foreigners from Portuguese Speaking African Countries (PADE)&#8221;, developed by ACIDI 
and the Institute for Social Security aiming at providing temporary accommodation and 
financial support to foreigners from these countries, who come to Portugal seeking health 
care. 
</p>
<p><b> 10. Access to education: difficulties with the language of the instruction 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Para. 7 and 30) 
</b></p>
<p>The new curricular guidelines (Decree-Law 1397/2012 of 5th. July) and the new Law on the 
Autonomy of Schools enable, as the Working Group already recognises in the same 
paragraph, schools to modify the curriculum to make it more culturally appropriate, namely 
through the adoption of measures which favour the equality of opportunities and academic 
success.  
</p>
<p>One of these measures is the introduction in the curriculum of the subject of &#8220;Portuguese as 
</p>
<p>a Foreign Language&#8221;. This subject&#8217;s aim is to avoid that the insufficient knowledge of the 
</p>
<p>Portuguese language hampers access to education by all children in Portugal, irrespective of 
their origin or background.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 11. Ensuring the right to education of children of African descent 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Para. 84) 
</b></p>
<p>All children resident in Portugal, irrespective of their nationality and legal status are 
granted access to the free public school system and can benefit, on an equal basis with 
Portuguese children, from school social support such as free meals and school books.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/60/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22 
</b></p>
<p>It is also worth noting that most of the children of African descent in Portugal, likewise 
adults, are actually Portuguese citizens, most of them born in Portugal. 
</p>
<p><b> 12. School texts and curricula do not reflect the contribution to Portugal of 
</b></p>
<p><b>its ex-colonies (Para. 31 and 69) 
</b></p>
<p>The curricula of History are designed according to rigorous and scientific criteria resulting 
from the exhaustive research of all available sources of information. It also stimulates 
further individual research by the student from all sources of information, namely the 
internet. 
</p>
<p>The maritime expansion and the following the colonialism period, including the slave trade, 
are compulsory parts of the History curricula in various academic years. 
</p>
<p>The school curricula reflect the rich and important cultural diversity and of our common 
heritage. As an example, the curricula of Portuguese Language in the basic and secondary 
education, foresee the compulsory reading of texts from Portuguese-speaking authors from 
Africa and Brazil (Jos&#233; Eduardo Agualusa, Louren&#231;o do Ros&#225;rio, Mia Couto, Ondjaki, Jos&#233; 
Craveirinha, Machado de Assis, Carlos Drummond de Andrade or Fernando Sylvan).
