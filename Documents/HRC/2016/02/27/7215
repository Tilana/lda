<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to its resolution 28/17 entitled &#8220;Effects of terrorism on the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>human rights&#8221;, the Human Rights Council convened a panel discussion on the effects of 
</p>
<p>terrorism on the enjoyment by all persons of human rights and fundamental freedoms, on 
</p>
<p>30 June 2015.1 
</p>
<p>2. The panel discussion was chaired and moderated by the Vice-President of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, Mothusi Bruce Rabasha Palai. The United Nations Deputy High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights, Flavia Pansieri, delivered the opening address. The 
</p>
<p>panellists were Ben Emmerson, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism; Steven Siqueira, 
</p>
<p>Deputy Director, Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force Office and the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre; and Mauro Miedico, Chief of the Implementation 
</p>
<p>Support Section III, Terrorism Prevention Branch, United Nations Office on Drugs and 
</p>
<p>Crime (UNODC).  
</p>
<p>3. Also in resolution 28/17, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a report on the panel discussion in the 
</p>
<p>form of a summary and to submit it to the Council at its thirtieth session. The present report 
</p>
<p>is submitted pursuant to that request. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Opening statement  
</b></p>
<p>4. In her opening statement, the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner stated that 
</p>
<p>terrorism destabilized Governments, undermined societies, jeopardized peace and security 
</p>
<p>and threatened economic and social development, all of which had serious implications for 
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of human rights by all. Terrorist attacks had devastating consequences for 
</p>
<p>victims, often directly impacting their rights to life, liberty and security. However, direct 
</p>
<p>victims were not the only ones affected; relatives and entire communities lived in fear and 
</p>
<p>suffered long-standing trauma following attacks. The recent spate of attacks illustrated the 
</p>
<p>direct impact of terrorism on human rights. 
</p>
<p>5. The human rights of victims of terrorism needed to be acknowledged and their loss 
</p>
<p>and dignity recognized. Victims needed immediate assistance and long-term medical, 
</p>
<p>psychosocial and financial support to compensate for the destruction of their property or 
</p>
<p>loss of their livelihood and jobs. Victims also had the right to equal access to justice and an 
</p>
<p>effective remedy, with a view to benefiting from adequate and prompt reparation for the 
</p>
<p>harm suffered. 
</p>
<p>6. For counter-terrorism efforts to be successful, dealing with the aftermath of 
</p>
<p>terrorism was not sufficient, rather prevention was necessary and critical. Prevention of 
</p>
<p>terrorism required understanding the conditions conducive to such abhorrent acts, including 
</p>
<p>a deeper appreciation of the linkages between such conditions and the lack of respect for 
</p>
<p>human rights, corruption, impunity, absence of rule of law and lack of development and 
</p>
<p>prospects for a peaceful future. Terrorism tended to thrive in situations of prolonged armed 
</p>
<p>conflict, chronic instability and systemic human rights violations, including discrimination, 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>MeetingDate=Tuesday, 30 June 2015.  
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>exclusion and lack of participation in political life and the conduct of public affairs and 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic marginalization. Those problems were often compounded by a lack of 
</p>
<p>accountability &#8211; with impunity of perpetrators prevailing in many situations &#8211;, a lack of 
</p>
<p>access to justice and a remedy for victims of human rights violations and abuses. The 
</p>
<p>Deputy High Commissioner emphasized that, in that context, States had the primary 
</p>
<p>responsibility for investigating and, where evidence warranted, prosecuting the perpetrators 
</p>
<p>of violations in full compliance with international norms, in particular those regarding due 
</p>
<p>process and fair trial.  
</p>
<p>7. Through the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted by the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly in September 2006 (see General Assembly resolution 60/288), Member 
</p>
<p>States had agreed a holistic, integrated and effective approach  to counter terrorism, with 
</p>
<p>human rights and rule of law as its basis. The Deputy High Commissioner noted, however, 
</p>
<p>that the Strategy had not yet translated into uniform practice on the ground. She also noted 
</p>
<p>that measures taken by a number of States in the wake of recent security threats continued 
</p>
<p>to raise serious human rights concerns. In line with the Strategy and international law, 
</p>
<p>regular review of counter-terrorism laws and practices was critical to ensure that they are 
</p>
<p>human rights-compliant and, in particular, specific, necessary, effective and proportionate. 
</p>
<p>The Deputy High Commissioner recalled that such review was particularly important given 
</p>
<p>that some States had enacted broadly formulated counter-terrorism legislation that did not 
</p>
<p>comply with the principle of legality because it lacked sufficiently precise definitions of 
</p>
<p>what constituted terrorist acts. The breadth and scope of that type of legislation allowed for 
</p>
<p>arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement by authorities. The application of the death penalty 
</p>
<p>to broadly construed terrorism-related offences also remained a serious concern, especially 
</p>
<p>where such offences did not rise to the level of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;, the threshold 
</p>
<p>required by article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The 
</p>
<p>Deputy High Commissioner also noted that some States sought to bypass the criminal 
</p>
<p>justice system by using administrative detention, other forms of detention and control 
</p>
<p>orders on persons suspected of terrorism, without respecting the safeguards enshrined in 
</p>
<p>international law. Such laws had been used to curb otherwise legitimate activities and to 
</p>
<p>target journalists, human rights defenders, minority groups and other individuals, some of 
</p>
<p>whom had been arbitrarily detained and tortured or subjected to cruel, inhuman and 
</p>
<p>dehumanizing treatment or punishment while in custody.  
</p>
<p>8. Noting that the rights to freedom of opinion and expression constitute the foundation 
</p>
<p>for every free and democratic society, the Deputy High Commissioner discussed the 
</p>
<p>relationship between counter-terrorism laws and those rights. In accordance with 
</p>
<p>international human rights law, any restriction on freedom of expression must be clearly 
</p>
<p>and narrowly defined and must meet the three-part test of legality, proportionality and 
</p>
<p>necessity. Offences such as &#8220;encouragement of terrorism&#8221;, &#8220;extremist activity&#8221;, &#8220;praising&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#8220;glorifying&#8221; or &#8220;justifying&#8221; terrorism must be clearly defined so as not to interfere 
</p>
<p>unnecessarily and disproportionately with freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>9. Lastly, the Deputy High Commissioner recalled that experience at the national level 
</p>
<p>showed that protecting human rights and ensuring respect for the rule of law contributed to 
</p>
<p>countering terrorism, in particular by creating a climate of trust between the State and those 
</p>
<p>under its jurisdiction and by supporting the resilience of communities to threats of violent 
</p>
<p>radicalism. Conversely, undue restrictions on human rights had proven corrosive to the rule 
</p>
<p>of law and conducive to a climate of impunity and might therefore undermine the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of counter-terrorism measures. It was time to stop basing policy on the false 
</p>
<p>dichotomy between security and human rights, which, she emphasized, were 
</p>
<p>complementary and mutually reinforcing. States should focus on policies and initiatives 
</p>
<p>that increase the enjoyment of all rights &#8212; not just civil and political rights, but also 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights. Swiftly addressing actual or perceived marginalization 
</p>
<p>or exclusion of particular communities was crucial. </p>


<p><b> III. Statements by panellists 
</b></p>
<p>10. The panellists emphasized the complementarity and mutually reinforcing nature of 
</p>
<p>security and human rights and stressed that respect for international law, including 
</p>
<p>international human rights law, was of key importance when taking measures to combat 
</p>
<p>terrorism. The devastating impact of terrorism on the enjoyment of human rights and the 
</p>
<p>importance of recognizing the rights of victims of terrorism were also noted.  
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism endorsed the Deputy High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner&#8217;s opening remarks and stated that the core of his mandate was to ensure the 
</p>
<p>protection and promotion of human rights while countering terrorism. He emphasized the 
</p>
<p>importance of the core guiding principles of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism 
</p>
<p>Strategy, which put the rule of law and promotion of human rights at the front and centre of 
</p>
<p>all counter-terrorism action.  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur stated that victims of terrorism deserved more attention. He 
</p>
<p>considered it striking that, despite the proliferation of counter-terrorism agreements, none 
</p>
<p>of those negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations focused on the rights of 
</p>
<p>victims. In his first report to the Human Rights Council in 2012 (A/HRC/20/14), the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur proposed framework principles for securing the human rights of victims 
</p>
<p>of terrorism, focusing on effective prevention, investigation, due process rights and the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of States to provide reparations to victims. He urged all States to recognize 
</p>
<p>that human rights violations in the context of terrorism could be committed by State and 
</p>
<p>non-State actors alike. He welcomed the high-level conference planned by the Counter-
</p>
<p>Terrorism Implementation Task Force Office in the coming months to discuss and move 
</p>
<p>forward on the framework principles. However, he noted that highly influential non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations (NGOs) and States rejected the notion that terrorist acts could 
</p>
<p>amount to human rights violations. From a victim-centred perspective, he believed that the 
</p>
<p>stance that only States could commit human rights violations was dangerous and that 
</p>
<p>human rights law must keep pace with the changing world in order to retain its validity. To 
</p>
<p>deny that victims of terrorism have suffered grave and often gross and systematic human 
</p>
<p>rights violations would be to render them prisoners of doctrine. 
</p>
<p>13. In his report on the human rights challenges posed by the fight against the Islamic 
</p>
<p>State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) (A/HRC/29/51), the Special Rapporteur noted the failure 
</p>
<p>of the Security Council to take effective action to enforce international law and protect 
</p>
<p>civilians in areas under ISIL control and stressed the need for the international coalition of 
</p>
<p>States currently engaged in military action against ISIL in Iraq and the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic to ensure that effective steps were taken to minimize the risk of civilian casualties 
</p>
<p>and to be transparent about such losses when they occur. While there were some human 
</p>
<p>rights concerns in respect of the conduct of international coalition forces in Iraq, he found 
</p>
<p>that, based on the available evidence, the coalition-inflicted casualties paled in comparison 
</p>
<p>to the horrific crimes systematically committed by ISIL. The report provides an assessment 
</p>
<p>of the scale of the violations of international law committed by ISIL in the territory it 
</p>
<p>occupies, which include crimes reportedly amounting to genocide, crimes against humanity, 
</p>
<p>serious violations of international humanitarian law and gross violations of international 
</p>
<p>human rights law. The findings of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on 
</p>
<p>the Syrian Arab Republic, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq and the Office of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) showed clear 
</p>
<p>evidence of persecution of religious and ethnic minority communities, including the 
</p>
<p>Yezidis; arbitrary executions of community leaders, journalists, intellectuals and others; 
</p>
<p>mass disappearances; forced religious conversion; and systematic torture. The enforcement 
</p>
<p>of summary justice in areas under ISIL control included public beheadings, stoning, </p>


<p>amputations, lashes, displays of mutilated corpses as a purported deterrent, systematic 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence, rape, sexual slavery and the targeting of sexual minorities. Children 
</p>
<p>had been subjected to summary executions, arbitrary detention and torture. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur underlined that those were all crimes and violations of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law which amounted to grave human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>14. The Deputy Director of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force Office 
</p>
<p>and the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre noted the continuing need to address the 
</p>
<p>ever-changing phenomenon of terrorism in the lead-up to the tenth anniversary of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in 2016. He reaffirmed the importance 
</p>
<p>of ensuring that responses and effective solutions to terrorism remained grounded within 
</p>
<p>the four pillars of the Strategy, and highlighted that the Strategy considered security and 
</p>
<p>human rights as complementary and mutually reinforcing.  
</p>
<p>15. The Deputy Director stated that the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force 
</p>
<p>comprised 36 United Nations and affiliated entities. The main functions of the Counter-
</p>
<p>Terrorism Implementation Task Force Office was to coordinate and facilitate United 
</p>
<p>Nations counter-terrorism initiatives and activities and provide support to Member States in 
</p>
<p>preventing and combating terrorism. He noted the key role played by OHCHR within the 
</p>
<p>Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force Office to ensure that its programmatic work 
</p>
<p>was based on the international human rights legal framework. The establishment of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre within the Counter-Terrorism Implementation 
</p>
<p>Task Force Office in 2011, with the support of the Government of Saudi Arabia and other 
</p>
<p>donors, has allowed it to better support capacity-building efforts for Member States under 
</p>
<p>the rubric of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Both the Counter-
</p>
<p>Terrorism Implementation Task Force Office and the United Nations Counter-Terrorism 
</p>
<p>Centre give high priority to the protection of human rights while combating terrorism and 
</p>
<p>to supporting victims of terrorism, in addition to other strategic priorities.  
</p>
<p>16. Terrorist groups are tearing apart the social fabric of countries and the four pillars of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations. Human rights abuses and violations are carried out on an 
</p>
<p>unprecedented scale, creating flows of refugees and internally displaced persons not seen 
</p>
<p>since the end of the Second World War. ISIL in particular has committed egregious human 
</p>
<p>rights violations and must be held to account.  
</p>
<p>17. National, regional and international efforts to respond to terrorism through military 
</p>
<p>or other means had sometimes been disproportionate, resulting in violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights and a lack of protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, which had effectively 
</p>
<p>provided terrorist groups with fuel for more hatred. Respect for human rights must remain 
</p>
<p>the foundation of counter-terrorism efforts. In that context, the entities of the Counter-
</p>
<p>Terrorism Implementation Task Force would continue to support efforts to strengthen the 
</p>
<p>responses of Member States to terrorist acts to ensure that they are grounded in respect for 
</p>
<p>international human rights law, international humanitarian law and international refugee 
</p>
<p>law, including through capacity-building and training.  
</p>
<p>18. The Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force Office coordinates 11 Working 
</p>
<p>Groups that deal with various issues, including border security, countering the financing of 
</p>
<p>terrorism, security for critical infrastructure, support for human rights while countering 
</p>
<p>terrorism and victims of terrorism. Those Working Groups have increased the capacity of 
</p>
<p>Member States to counter terrorism through a number of important initiatives. For example, 
</p>
<p>the Working Group on promoting and protecting human rights and the rule of law seeks to 
</p>
<p>build the capacity of law enforcement institutions in Member States through a training 
</p>
<p>curriculum based on human rights-compliant approaches within a counter-terrorism context 
</p>
<p>on issues such as detention, special investigative techniques, use of force and investigative 
</p>
<p>interviewing. The Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force Office has already piloted 
</p>
<p>training in Nigeria, and will soon roll out training sessions in other interested Member </p>


<p>States. With regard to prevention, the Secretary-General is expected to launch a plan of 
</p>
<p>action on preventing violent extremism later in 2015. It is aimed at reinvigorating the 
</p>
<p>universal core values of the international community, based on the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to present concrete proposals 
</p>
<p>on how the United Nations system and Member States could best approach the challenge of 
</p>
<p>violent extremism leading to terrorism.  
</p>
<p>19. The recent terrorist attacks in Tunisia, Kuwait, France and Egypt further emphasized 
</p>
<p>the need for States to uphold their obligation to ensure security for those under their 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction. However, this must not be at the expense of their human rights obligations 
</p>
<p>under international law. Human rights violations can lead to further radicalization towards 
</p>
<p>violence, especially of youth. In particular, the rights to the freedoms of speech, association 
</p>
<p>and assembly should not be arbitrarily restricted, as they are fundamental to helping 
</p>
<p>societies to combat violent extremism. On 16 June 2015, the United Nations Counter-
</p>
<p>Terrorism Centre organized an online panel discussion entitled &#8220;An exit for extremists: 
</p>
<p>digital solutions for online counter-radicalization&#8221;, in which Google Ideas, Facebook and 
</p>
<p>civil society participated. The panel discussed how to handle online content that called for 
</p>
<p>violence and how to monitor material communicated through the networks, while at the 
</p>
<p>same time ensuring privacy, freedom of expression and access to information. The 
</p>
<p>discussion highlighted the importance of being more inclusive and engaging more with the 
</p>
<p>private sector.   
</p>
<p>20. With regard to victims of terrorism, the international community was urged to 
</p>
<p>acknowledge that it was often ordinary individuals who bore the brunt of acts of terrorism.  
</p>
<p>The Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force Office established a portal
2
 to provide 
</p>
<p>victims of terrorism with the necessary resources and information, including those provided 
</p>
<p>by Member States and civil society. The Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force 
</p>
<p>Office and the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre were deeply committed to 
</p>
<p>ensuring that victims were at the centre of their activities. To that end, both the Counter-
</p>
<p>Terrorism Implementation Task Force Office  and the United Nations Counter-Terrorism 
</p>
<p>Centre had promoted solidarity for victims of terrorism, provided assistance and 
</p>
<p>rehabilitative services and ensured that victims of terrorism had a voice in counter-
</p>
<p>narratives to violent extremism. The Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force Office 
</p>
<p>also planned to provide training in order to empower victims of terrorism to be part of 
</p>
<p>effective counter-narrative strategies.  
</p>
<p>21. The Chief of Implementation Support Section III referred to the ways in which 
</p>
<p>terrorism threatened the core values of the United Nations and represented an assault on the 
</p>
<p>rule of law, human rights and international peace and security. He emphasized the crucial 
</p>
<p>role of technical assistance and capacity-building in preventing and countering terrorism, 
</p>
<p>the need to do more to protect and to take preventive action and the importance of 
</p>
<p>increasing the capacity of States to ensure human rights and rule of law-based responses to 
</p>
<p>terrorism.    
</p>
<p>22. Terrorism violated the most basic human rights, including the right to life, among 
</p>
<p>other civil and political rights, as well as economic, social and cultural rights. The 
</p>
<p>importance of the right to security of person was a fundamental right enshrined in article 3 
</p>
<p>of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Unfortunately, security was often wrongly 
</p>
<p>perceived as limiting human rights. He quoted a Tunisian activist, Amira Yahyaoui, who 
</p>
<p>had recently stated:<b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 See www.un.org/victimsofterrorism/en.  </p>


<p>For human rights activists, security is a taboo. Security means you are anti-human 
</p>
<p>rights. But that gives space to those who are not very keen on human rights to take 
</p>
<p>care of this topic. I think that people from a human rights background should be 
</p>
<p>more involved in security issues, and stop thinking that security is a taboo. If we 
</p>
<p>want to defend people&#8217;s rights, the first thing we need to defend is their right to live 
</p>
<p>and not to die. That&#8217;s the first step.3 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>23. The international community now recognized the important nexus between security 
</p>
<p>and development and their interdependence. The new comprehensive, integrated and 
</p>
<p>universal sustainable development goals should provide an important framework for a 
</p>
<p>United Nations common effort in this area.

 On the one hand, the new agenda recognizes 
</p>
<p>the need to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies; on the other hand, it is expected that 
</p>
<p>at the summit to be held in September 2015, when the post-2015 development agenda is 
</p>
<p>expected to be adopted, Member States will recognize the need to &#8220;strengthen national 
</p>
<p>institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, 
</p>
<p>in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime&#8221;.5  
</p>
<p>24. UNODC supported Member States in implementing the United Nations Global 
</p>
<p>Counter-Terrorism Strategy, in particular its criminal justice aspects. The Terrorism 
</p>
<p>Prevention Branch supported Member States&#8217; efforts to ensure effective and efficient 
</p>
<p>criminal justice responses to prevent and counter terrorism, including by developing multi-
</p>
<p>year cooperation plans with a number of countries. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>25. The right to be protected was emphasized as a key aspect of the right to security of 
</p>
<p>person. In recent years, traditional security-oriented approaches had been increasingly 
</p>
<p>recognized as insufficient to effectively address the threat of terrorism, particularly in the 
</p>
<p>medium and long term. UNODC believed that a long-term approach to countering terrorism 
</p>
<p>must encompass prevention, with more focus on the plans and activities of terrorist groups. 
</p>
<p>Such a preventative approach required that lawful investigative and evidentiary 
</p>
<p>mechanisms be established by Member States to facilitate prosecutorial intervention before 
</p>
<p>tragedies occur, while respecting procedural safeguards.  
</p>
<p>26. Criminalization was an important tool for preventing violent extremism, however, it 
</p>
<p>carried significant risks of arbitrary limitations on the right to the freedoms of expression, 
</p>
<p>religion and association. Therefore, UNODC was enhancing its efforts to assist Member 
</p>
<p>States in developing legislation and criminal justice capacities to punish conduct that spread 
</p>
<p>ideas supportive of violent extremism, while complying with fundamental freedoms. For 
</p>
<p>example, terrorists utilized the Internet to recruit terrorists and incite the commission of acts 
</p>
<p>of terror. The Internet also allowed terrorists to spread their message to a worldwide 
</p>
<p>audience at a low cost. UNODC has developed specialized training programmes that 
</p>
<p>address the facilitation of violent extremism over the Internet. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>27. The international community needs to do more in the area of preventing 
</p>
<p>radicalization to violence in prison settings. UNODC assisted Member States in building 
</p>
<p>and reforming their prison systems and in implementing non-custodial sanctions and 
</p>
<p>measures aimed at the prevention of violent extremism in compliance with human rights.

<p>28. Policymakers increasingly recognized the important role that victims of terrorism 
</p>
<p>and their stories could play in efforts to counter violent extremism. UNODC integrated 
</p>
<p>programmes on victims of terrorism in its technical assistance to Member States. 
</p>
<p>Strengthening criminal justice responses to support victims enhanced the resilience of 
</p>
<p>States to counter terrorism and violent extremism.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>29. Developing the capacity of States to ensure rule of law-based responses to terrorism 
</p>
<p>was underscored as being the most important factor in preventing terrorism and violent 
</p>
<p>extremism. Several General Assembly and Security Council resolutions identified human 
</p>
<p>rights violations as major factors conducive to terrorism, including, to a significant extent, 
</p>
<p>human rights violations committed in the context of countering terrorism. There was often a 
</p>
<p>perception in United Nations forums that the right to security and the security of rights 
</p>
<p>were, by definition, limiting, if not in contradiction with one another. That is a totally faulty 
</p>
<p>perception because both concepts are complementary. There is no security if the right to 
</p>
<p>security of person is not properly recognized and protected. Likewise, there is no right to 
</p>
<p>security of person if the protection and security of all other rights are not ensured. The  
</p>
<p>Chief of Implementation Support Section III concluded by quoting the Secretary-General: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Missiles may kill terrorists. But I am convinced that good governance is what will kill 
</p>
<p>terrorism.&#8221;6 <b>

<p><b> IV. Summary of the discussion 
</b></p>
<p>30. During the ensuing discussion, contributions were made by representatives of 
</p>
<p>Albania (on behalf of a group of States), Algeria, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, China, Cuba, 
</p>
<p>Denmark (on behalf of the Nordic States), Ecuador (on behalf of the Community of Latin 
</p>
<p>American and Caribbean States), Egypt, Estonia, Hungary (on behalf of a group of States), 
</p>
<p>India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Ireland, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Namibia, the 
</p>
<p>Netherlands, the Niger, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Switzerland (on behalf of a 
</p>
<p>group of States), the Syrian Arab Republic, the United States of America and Viet Nam, as 
</p>
<p>well as the Council of Europe, the European Union, the Holy See and the International 
</p>
<p>Organization of la Francophonie. Statements by Australia, Brazil, Fiji, Iraq, Lebanon, 
</p>
<p>Libya, Mauritania, Norway, the Russian Federation, South Africa, the Sudan and Tunisia 
</p>
<p>were not delivered owing to lack of time. Copies of their statements were, however, posted 
</p>
<p>on the Human Rights Council extranet. 
</p>
<p>31. Representatives of the following national human rights institutions and NGOs also 
</p>
<p>took the floor: Human Rights Council of Morocco, Human Rights Watch (in a joint 
</p>
<p>statement with International Service for Human Rights and International Federation for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Leagues), Al Salam Foundation, CIVICUS World Alliance for Citizen 
</p>
<p>Participation, Friends World Committee for Consultation (in a joint statement with 
</p>
<p>Amnesty International), Organization for Defending Victims of Violence, Arab 
</p>
<p>Commission for Human Rights and Amuta for NGO Responsibility.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Effect of terrorism on the enjoyment of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>32. Many delegates began their statements by offering condolences to the people of 
</p>
<p>Tunisia, France, Kuwait and Egypt, which had recently suffered terrorist attacks, and the 
</p>
<p>people of the Syrian Arab Republic, Iraq and Nigeria, who were victims of terrorist attacks 
</p>
<p>on an almost daily basis. Most delegates found that terrorism constituted a serious 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6  See the Secretary-General&#8217;s remarks at the G7 working session on Terrorism, held at Schloss Elmau, 
</p>
<p>Germany, on 8 June 2015. </p>


<p>challenge for all States and a grave threat to international peace and security, and that they 
</p>
<p>had had a dire impact on the ability of all persons to enjoy their human rights. One delegate 
</p>
<p>considered that the international community was experiencing terrorism that was 
</p>
<p>transcending traditional borders in an unprecedented way.  
</p>
<p>33. Another delegate stated that the effect of terrorism on human rights should be 
</p>
<p>studied because no country was safe from terrorism, as witnessed in Kuwait, Tunisia and 
</p>
<p>France, the week before the discussion, and in Egypt, the day before the discussion, where 
</p>
<p>the Prosecutor General was murdered in a terrorist attack. Some aspects of the resolution, 
</p>
<p>further to which the panel discussion had been convened, were highlighted, for example, 
</p>
<p>focus on the effects of terrorism on the enjoyment of various rights, especially the rights to 
</p>
<p>safety and life, and other political, economic and cultural rights. It was underlined that 
</p>
<p>fighting terrorism and protecting human rights were mutually reinforcing and that 
</p>
<p>effectively combating terrorism required cooperation among all stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>34. Some delegates noted that terrorism could strike anywhere and at any time and that 
</p>
<p>terrorist acts had very negative effects on the enjoyment of human rights, including 
</p>
<p>depriving individuals of the right to life, liberty, health and security of person, as well as 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights, including access to food and water, education and  
</p>
<p>health services. One delegate described how terrorist acts had led not only to a heavy death 
</p>
<p>toll, but also to the movement of several thousands of refugees and internally displaced 
</p>
<p>persons in its territory. Another delegate said that attacks on religious establishments 
</p>
<p>undermined the right to freedom of religion and belief and the right to security of person, 
</p>
<p>and led to destruction of private property. The representative of an NGO stated that violent 
</p>
<p>acts by groups of non-State actors against the general population for political purposes 
</p>
<p>constituted abhorrent crimes that, when widespread or systematic, could amount to crimes 
</p>
<p>against humanity. 
</p>
<p>35. Many delegates pointed out that terrorism was not linked to any religion, ethnic 
</p>
<p>group, nationality or nation. Some specified that spreading fear &#8212; which is the aim of 
</p>
<p>terrorism &#8212; was contrary to religious teachings and practices, which called for peace. The 
</p>
<p>international community need to ensure that counter-terrorism efforts do not stigmatize 
</p>
<p>certain communities; it was regretted that Muslims were often believed to be a threat.  
</p>
<p>36. One delegate urged States to adopt and implement multidimensional national 
</p>
<p>strategies for combating terrorism, stating that spreading awareness about human rights and 
</p>
<p>the values of tolerance was critical. Engagement with imams with a view to promoting the 
</p>
<p>ideals of tolerant Islam was highlighted as a powerful tool for fostering a society free of 
</p>
<p>terrorism. The representative of an NGO highlighted that religious leaders could play a role 
</p>
<p>in combating extremism at the local, regional and international levels.  
</p>
<p>37. Some delegates called for a distinction to be made between State and non-State 
</p>
<p>actors and indicated that, as parties to international human rights treaties, States had 
</p>
<p>obligations to uphold human rights, whereas terrorists were criminals and should be treated 
</p>
<p>as such. One delegate noted that combating terrorism involved political and security issues 
</p>
<p>that would be dealt with more appropriately by the General Assembly and the Security 
</p>
<p>Council; the Human Rights Council should focus on ensuring that any measures taken to 
</p>
<p>combat counter-terrorism do not impact human rights. Another delegate highlighted the 
</p>
<p>importance of the Council being able to reaffirm a united and consensual position on this 
</p>
<p>issue. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Combating terrorism while respecting human rights 
</b></p>
<p>38. Participants highlighted the obligations of States to protect the human rights of 
</p>
<p>individuals under their jurisdiction and to take counter-terrorism measures that complied </p>


<p>with international law, in particular the right to freedom of expression. They also noted the 
</p>
<p>impact that counter-terrorism measures could have on human rights, including the 
</p>
<p>prohibition of torture and arbitrary detention and the right to a fair trial. The need to comply 
</p>
<p>with the principles of distinction and proportionality in armed conflict under international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law was also stressed. Those were all principles that needed to be adhered to 
</p>
<p>when preventing terrorism. 
</p>
<p>39. Many delegates highlighted the complementarity between security and human 
</p>
<p>rights, while acknowledging that current State practices often mistakenly pitted the two 
</p>
<p>principles against one another. One delegate, speaking on behalf of a group of States, said 
</p>
<p>that States must ensure that their actions complied with the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>international human rights law, international humanitarian law and international refugee 
</p>
<p>law, by protecting their populations while ensuring fair trials for persons accused of having 
</p>
<p>committed terrorist acts, as well as assisting victims. Another delegate considered that anti-
</p>
<p>terrorism strategies should safeguard rights and freedoms, while yet another stressed the 
</p>
<p>importance of the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment and of States becoming parties to 
</p>
<p>the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment and its Optional Protocol. 
</p>
<p>40. One delegate said that States should deny safe haven to those who incited, planned, 
</p>
<p>financed, supported or committed terrorist attacks. Another delegate noted that, despite 
</p>
<p>United Nations resolutions to combat terrorism over the previous two decades, certain 
</p>
<p>terrorist organizations continued to be financed, including by States, and that that practice 
</p>
<p>must be stopped. One delegate stated that robust and decisive measures needed to be taken 
</p>
<p>in that regard, not only by the countries affected, but also by the international community as 
</p>
<p>a whole. It suggested that the international community commission comprehensive studies 
</p>
<p>on the origins, motives and funding of terrorist groups.  
</p>
<p>41. Several participants called for all terrorist acts to be punished and for a holistic 
</p>
<p>approach to countering terrorism that required expanding the scope of legal instruments to 
</p>
<p>bring the perpetrators of terrorist acts to justice. In response to questions regarding the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of States to protect populations against widespread and systematic human 
</p>
<p>rights violations by non-State armed groups, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism stressed 
</p>
<p>that accountability must be ensured on both sides of the equation and that public officials 
</p>
<p>engaged in counter-terrorism activities must be brought to justice. With regard to 
</p>
<p>accountability for violations of the rights of victims of terrorism perpetrated by non-State 
</p>
<p>armed groups, the Special Rapporteur stated that, although the Security Council had 
</p>
<p>declared ISIL a threat to international peace and security and had stressed the need to bring 
</p>
<p>perpetrators to justice, it had been very reluctant to authorize military action pursuant to its 
</p>
<p>powers under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations or to refer the situation in 
</p>
<p>Iraq and Syrian Arab Republic to the International Criminal Court. He added that the 
</p>
<p>Security Council resolution putting ISIL on the list of terrorist organizations would not 
</p>
<p>prevent it from continuing to commit human rights abuses. The Special Rapporteur also 
</p>
<p>underlined that the time had come to recognize that the permanent members of the Security 
</p>
<p>Council had an obligation to act and that, in the event of reports of genocide, all members 
</p>
<p>of the Council, individually, may have a specific legal responsibility to take action and to 
</p>
<p>refrain from using their veto power to block action to prevent that most serious of 
</p>
<p>international crimes.  
</p>
<p>42. The Chief of the Implementation Support Section III of UNODC Terrorism 
</p>
<p>Prevention Branch stated that concrete efforts should be made to prevent terrorism, 
</p>
<p>including adhering to the rule of law, which contributed to avoiding radicalization. He 
</p>
<p>recalled that measures to criminalize incitement and recruitment must be fully compatible 
</p>
<p>with the principle of legality. Such measures often relied on intelligence and circumstantial </p>


<p>evidence, which could pose challenges in terms of human rights. Thus, appropriate rule of 
</p>
<p>law-based approaches aligned with the principles of necessity and proportionality must be 
</p>
<p>identified. He also mentioned that UNODC had integrated human rights good practices in 
</p>
<p>its curricula and believed that more engagement with parliamentarians was important.  
</p>
<p>43. A number of delegates cautioned that attempts to prevent terrorism were 
</p>
<p>unnecessarily and disproportionately infringing on human rights &#8212; particularly civil and 
</p>
<p>political rights. One delegate noted that the freedoms of peaceful assembly, expression and 
</p>
<p>association facilitated a range of other human rights and were key elements of open and 
</p>
<p>democratic societies because the ability to share and challenge ideas, and to organize was 
</p>
<p>vital to the health of any society. A society without those rights would stagnate. Under 
</p>
<p>human rights law, any limitations on the freedom of expression must be provided by law 
</p>
<p>and be necessary for respect for the rights or reputation of others or the protection of 
</p>
<p>national security, public order, public health or morals. Any limitations must be in 
</p>
<p>accordance with an appropriate, transparent and legal framework and national security 
</p>
<p>agencies must have appropriate authority and oversight to allow States to respond quickly 
</p>
<p>to threats to national security while respecting their human rights obligations. Another 
</p>
<p>delegate said that State efforts should not constrain civil society and that, when States 
</p>
<p>committed human rights violations in the name of counter-terrorism, they played into the 
</p>
<p>hands of terrorist groups. Other delegates noted that social media had often been used to 
</p>
<p>spread radical messages and for purposes such as incitement to terrorism. 
</p>
<p>44. Representatives of NGOs and national human rights institutions provided specific 
</p>
<p>examples of instances in which the freedoms of speech, expression and association had 
</p>
<p>been curtailed as States attempted to combat terrorism. Concern at laws on terrorism that 
</p>
<p>lacked the requisite specificity was voiced and reference was made to overly broad counter-
</p>
<p>terrorism measures which had a negative impact on and arbitrarily restricted human rights 
</p>
<p>and which were in breach of the principle of legality. States should not use counter-
</p>
<p>terrorism as a smokescreen to stifle dissenting voices and Governments had a responsibility 
</p>
<p>to protect those under their jurisdiction from extremist attacks, but should not use counter-
</p>
<p>terrorism as a reason to prosecute alleged terrorism offences in mass trials, conduct mass 
</p>
<p>surveillance or pass legislation with large discretionary powers.  
</p>
<p>45. One delegate, speaking on behalf of a regional group of States, referred to the 
</p>
<p>problematic use of the death penalty in counter-terrorism efforts. Concern was expressed 
</p>
<p>that States resorted to the death penalty for authors of acts of terrorism, even when the 
</p>
<p>offence of terrorism was broadly and vaguely defined. The fact that intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>organizations provided assistance to States that applied the death penalty was highlighted, 
</p>
<p>and the panellists were asked about the steps that United Nations agencies had taken to 
</p>
<p>ensure that the support and assistance they provided did not render them complicit in 
</p>
<p>executions. In response, the Deputy Director of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation 
</p>
<p>Task Force Office and the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre stated that the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General continued to condemn the death penalty in all circumstances and that the 
</p>
<p>work of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force Office was conducted within 
</p>
<p>the international human rights legal framework. The Chief of Implementation Support 
</p>
<p>Section III stated that UNODC technical assistance interventions integrated protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights in all areas. He noted that UNODC had suspended cooperation with countries 
</p>
<p>that had not respected human rights or democratic principles. 
</p>
<p>46. One delegate highlighted the need for women&#8217;s rights to be central to all efforts to 
</p>
<p>counter terrorism, noting that extremists had placed the subordination of women and the 
</p>
<p>denial of their rights at the heart of their strategy. It advocated for the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council to continue to advance the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s full and equal 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of all human rights.  </p>


<p>47. With reference to the impact of counter-terrorism measures on international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law, one delegate stated that the Government had paid a colossal price for the 
</p>
<p>ongoing war on terrorism, and deemed that all States were responsible for avoiding 
</p>
<p>casualties of non-combatants or &#8220;collateral damage&#8221;. The delegate stated that it was vital to 
</p>
<p>ensure respect for the rule of law and due process of law and to avoid illegal practices such 
</p>
<p>as torture, incommunicado detention and extrajudicial killings.  
</p>
<p>48. Participants noted that, although terrorist acts jeopardized peace and security and 
</p>
<p>threatened social and economic development, the option of launching wars in the name of 
</p>
<p>countering terrorism must be meticulously considered. The so-called &#8220;war on terrorism&#8221; 
</p>
<p>had fostered an ideology of fear and repression that ultimately created enemies and 
</p>
<p>promoted violence. Also, some Governments used terrorism as an excuse to subvert 
</p>
<p>political opponents.  
</p>
<p>49. The international community and States should do more to strengthen education, 
</p>
<p>training, awareness-raising and development because they were important bulwarks against 
</p>
<p>isolation, disenchantment and radicalization of youth. With regard to ensuring that counter-
</p>
<p>terrorism measures respected human rights, the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task 
</p>
<p>Force Office had developed basic human rights reference guides and specific modules to 
</p>
<p>build the capacity of law enforcement bodies. The Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task 
</p>
<p>Force Office worked with a wide range of national and regional partners, most recently the 
</p>
<p>African Union, to ensure their compliance with the United Nations Global Counter-
</p>
<p>Terrorism Strategy. It conducted training for police, worked with partners to combat the 
</p>
<p>financing of terrorism and collaborated with national actors to find ways to build trust 
</p>
<p>between civil society actors and the security establishment. However, such capacity-
</p>
<p>building interventions threatened to be undermined by the corrosion of State legitimacy that 
</p>
<p>occurs when a State undertakes counter-terrorism measures that disrespect due process.  
</p>
<p>50. Several delegates referred to the need to tackle the root causes of terrorism, 
</p>
<p>including by preventing the spread of violent extremism through different media. One 
</p>
<p>delegate&#8217;s Government had engaged in preventive actions against terrorism, published a list 
</p>
<p>of wanted persons, worked with international organizations to bring perpetrators of 
</p>
<p>terrorism to justice, created a rehabilitation centre to provide intellectual rehabilitation for 
</p>
<p>former terrorists and provided significant financial support to an international counter-
</p>
<p>terrorism centre in 2005. The delegate stated that international efforts should focus on three 
</p>
<p>vital dimensions: prevention, deterrence and security, and policymaking. 
</p>
<p>51. Member States highlighted the need for more global coordination. Regarding 
</p>
<p>coordination efforts, one delegate&#8217;s Government had coordinated with counter-terrorism 
</p>
<p>and judicial practitioners worldwide, including at the International Centre for Counter-
</p>
<p>Terrorism, in the Netherlands, and the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of 
</p>
<p>Law, in Malta; another delegate stressed that success in the fight against terrorism went 
</p>
<p>hand in hand with progress in strengthening cooperation and exchange of information at the 
</p>
<p>international, regional and subregional levels and it had worked as part of the global 
</p>
<p>initiatives against international terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>In their concluding remarks, the panellists highlighted the enduring value of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which remains of core 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevance almost 10 years after its adoption. While the fourth pillar of the Strategy 
</b></p>
<p><b>specifically focuses on human rights, it was emphasized that the entire Strategy rests 
</b></p>
<p><b>on human rights principles. Respect for those principles is a prerequisite to any 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective counter-terrorism response. Measures taken in breach of these principles </b></p>


<p><b>only serve to foster a sense of injustice; they can have a corrosive effect on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>legitimacy of a State in the eyes of the people and undermine all the pillars of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Strategy. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>In terms of the practical application of human rights principles, the panellists 
</b></p>
<p><b>referred to the existing guidance relating to the implementation of counter-terrorism 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures in a manner that complies with human rights, including the collection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>best practices compiled by the previous Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Martin Scheinin. The panellists also noted the need for strengthened cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b>between States, international organizations and civil society to assist in finding human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights-compliant solutions to challenging issues, such as responding to threats posed 
</b></p>
<p><b>by foreign fighters. 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>Finally, the panellists highlighted the importance of ensuring and fulfilling the 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights of victims of terrorism. Victims of terrorism need to be given access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>information and to have a real voice in society. While having a voice is their right, it 
</b></p>
<p><b>could also be an integral part of a preventive strategy, whereby victims provide a 
</b></p>
<p><b>compelling counter-narrative of the horrific and destructive impact of terrorism on 
</b></p>
<p>people&#8217;s lives<b>.  
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>Recent developments have brought to the fore the issue of conditions conducive 
</b></p>
<p><b>to terrorism, which is the focus of the first pillar of the Strategy and closely linked to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the issue of respect for human rights while countering terrorism. While there was 
</b></p>
<p><b>remarkable consensus on what constituted conditions conducive to terrorism at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>time that the Strategy was developed, insufficient action on that point has been taken. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Therefore, the emphasis on preventing and countering violent extremism, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>through the Secretary-</b>General&#8217;s <b>forthcoming plan of action on the issue, is much 
</b></p>
<p><b>needed.  
</b></p>
<p>
