6] Maximum penalty could be imposed these types of offences as follows; 

6.1] OFFICE BREAKING ENTERING AND LARCENY

300. Any person who-

(a) breaks and enters any dwelling-house, or any building within the curtilage thereof and occupied therewith, or any school-house, shop, warehouse, counting-house, office, store, garage, pavilion, factory, or workshop, or any building belonging to Her Majesty, or to any Government department, or to any municipal or other public authority, and commits any felony therein; or

is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

6.2] ROBBERY WITH VIOLENCE

(b) robs any person and, at the time of or immediately before or immediately after such robbery, uses or threatens to use any personal violence to any person,

is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for life, with or without corporal punishment.

7] Following tariffs have considered in decided cases for above offences; 

7.1] In Tomasi Turuturuvesi v State [2002] HAA 86/02S 23 December 2002 Her Ladyship Justice Shameem said that  The tariff for house breaking entering and larceny is between 18 months to 3 years... 

7.2] In Regina v Chandar Sen Kumar [1979] SC HAA 62/79L 7 November 1979 His Lordship Dyke J. Mentioned  As a rule offences of burglary, house breaking, shop breaking, etc... will attract custodial sentences of varying degrees of severity. 

7.3] In Manoa Baleinakeba v State [2010] HAA 8/10S 16 June 2010 His Lordship Madigan J held that; given the jurisdictional restraints from MCs, the proper tariff there now should be 7 to 10 years.

7.4] In Anare Buresalei v State [2010] HAA 23/10S 13 August 2010 His Lordship Temo J. Held that unprovoked attack on innocent V for refusal to give accused money, punching his nose, forcefully stealing Vs wallet, $220 cash and Alcatal mobile phone, is not harsh and excessive but below the tariff. 
 
Aggravating Factors of the offences

8] Following facts were revealed by the summary of facts placed before the court and will be considered as aggravating factors.

- Felonious intention to commit thefts and robbery

-used force and weapons on the victims

- joint enterprise with co-accused

- Caused serious injuries to the victim, (In Criminal Case No: 74/2010, the victim, Mr. Bal Ram was partially blinded and deafen.) 

-total values of property stolen/ robbed in these three cases are $15001

Mitigating Factors

9.1]. 1 Accused: 1 Accused in your mitigation, you said that you are 22 years old, single and still in remand. You were allowed mitigating through your uncle. He read over the mitigation and copy of this mitigation has handed over to this court. In your written mitigation, you said that you are an orphan and your father left you since birth and mother went overseas when you reached 7 years. Till 2006 you were with your uncle Waisake Tuimereke (Snr). When he moved to in laws you were with grandmother and due to peer pressure you fell into trouble and peril. Your uncle asked mercy and forgiveness considering the young age, your family background. He tendered apologies to the victims.

9.2] 2 Accused: in your mitigation you said that your 23 years old. You are a serving prisoner. Currently you are serving 8 years imprisonment. The copy of that sentencing judgement is given to this court by the prosecution. You have been convicted for 9 similar types of cases. You asked con current sentence for these offences. You tendered apologies to the victims. You told that you were raised up by grandparents since 7 months old. You asked courts forgiveness and leniency. 

10] I drew my attention to your mitigation. Court is mindful of your mitigations. Court is regretted by your unfortunate personal circumstances where you both were abandoned by parents in tender ages. But you committed grave crimes and it attracts deterrent sentence. As legal maxims say Ignorantia legis neminen exusat- Ignorance of law is excuse nobody or Ignorantia facti excusat; ingnorantia juris non excusat- Ignorance of fact is excuse, but ignorance of law is no excuse. You both have done series of offences without caring law of the country. You used weapons and force and innocent people suffered by your criminal acts. It is to be noted that your individual rights supersede innocent publics rights. Courts are duty bound to safeguard their rights as well. Court notes that you both are young offenders as this offences committed in same period of time (2007 to 2009). 

11] Now I turn to the Sentencing Principles which enunciate in new Decree. 

11.1] The section 4(1) of the sentencing and penalties Decree 2009 sets out the following guidelines for sentencing, may be imposed by a court;

a) To punish offenders to an extent and in manner which is just in all the circumstances

b) To protect the community from offenders

c) To deter offenders or other persons from committing offences of the same or similar nature

d) To establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated

e) To signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offences

f) Any combination of these purposes

11.2] Further Section 4(2) articulates the matters which the court must have concerned to when sentencing an offender. Accordingly the following factors have to be taken into consideration;

(a) the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence; 

(b) current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable guideline judgment;

(c) the nature and gravity of the particular offence;

(d) the offender's culpability and degree of responsibility for the offence;

(e) the impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; 

(f) whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so; 

(g) the conduct of the offender during the trial as an indication of remorse or the lack of remorse;

(h) any action taken by the offender to make restitution for the injury, loss or damage arising from the offence, including his or her willingness to comply with any order for restitution that a court may consider under this Decree;

(i) the offender's previous character;

(j) the presence of any aggravating or mitigating factor concerning the offender or any other circumstance relevant to the commission of the offence; and 

(k) any matter stated in this Decree as being grounds for applying a particular sentencing option. 

12] His Lordship Justice Goundar considered carefully the Section 4 (2) of the Decree said in State v Mataisai Bulivou Susu [2010] FJHC 226 that:

"The dominant factor in assessing seriousness for any types of robbery is the degree of force used or threatened. The degree of injury to the victim or the nature of and duration of threats are also relevant in assessing the seriousness of an offence of robbery with violence. If a weapon is involved in the use or threat of force that will always be an important aggravating feature. Group offending will aggravate an offence because the level of intimidation and fear caused to the victim will be greater. It may also indicate planning and gang activity"

7. Most of the above factors are patent in these offences. Considering all above factors you both attract custodial sentence with severity. But I start with lower tariff as you both young offenders and allow you to correct yourselves and have a peaceful, crimeless future. 

13.1] In Criminal Case No: 71/2010, I select 2 years imprisonment as starting point. I will add 1 year for the aggravating factors. I will reduce the sentence by 1 year for your early plea the time you spend in remand prison and other mitigation. Your sentence is 2 years imprisonment. 

13.2] In Criminal Case No: 72/2010, I select 7 years as starting point. I will add 1 year for the aggravating factors. I will reduce the sentence by 1 year for your early plea the time you spend in remand prison and other mitigation. Your sentence is 7 years imprisonment. 

13.3] In Criminal Case No: 74/2010, I select 8 years as starting point. I will add 1 year for the aggravating factors as victim was partially blinded and deafen. I will reduce the sentence by 1 year for your early plea, the time you spend in remand prison and other mitigation. Your sentence is 8 years imprisonment. 

14] All these sentences will run concurrently. The Second accused is currently serving and this sentence should run concurrently to the previous sentence as well. Both accused are eligible for parole after 6 years. 

15] You, Waisake Tuimereke and Kaminieli Qasevakatini Turagaloaloa, are sentenced to 

Criminal Case No: 71/2010: 2 years imprisonment
Criminal Case No: 72/2010: 7 years imprisonment
Criminal Case No: 74/2010: 8 years imprisonment

16]. 28 days to appeal.
