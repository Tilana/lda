<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism undertook a 
visit to South Africa from 16 to 26 April 2007. The main purposes of the visit were to gather 
first-hand information about initiatives in the area of counter-terrorism and how such measures 
affect human rights, and to begin a process of cooperation with the Government. The Special 
Rapporteur is very grateful to the Government of South Africa for extending its cooperation to 
him. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the remarkable achievements of South Africa over 
the last 15 years in establishing a society founded on democracy, pluralism and a strong 
Constitution, based on the full respect of human rights. This includes the establishment of a 
robust judicial system, of an inclusive South African Police Service, and strong efforts to 
improve the social and economic situation of large segments of the previously disenfranchised 
population. 
</p>
<p> In the field of counter-terrorism, South Africa has not in the period following the terrorist 
attacks of September 2001 been affected by terrorist acts. The Government is committed to the 
global measures to counter terrorism, and remains vigilant. 
</p>
<p> In this report, the Special Rapporteur seeks to highlight particularly central issues for the 
promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, and in his conclusions and 
recommendations, to point out particular areas of interest or concern. 
</p>
<p> The country adopted new counter-terrorism legislation (the Protection of Constitutional 
Democracy against Terrorist and Related Activities Act, 2004), on the basis of broad 
consultations. The Special Rapporteur commends South Africa for this process, and the efforts to 
ensure that the protection of human rights and the safeguards normally embedded in criminal 
procedures are also applicable to the investigation and prosecution of crimes related to terrorism. 
He notes that the definition of terrorist acts in the law, when read cumulatively, sets up several 
thresholds of severity in order for an act to constitute terrorism in the meaning of the law. There 
are, however, elements of the definition which may convey the idea that even less severe acts 
may amount to terrorism. He recommends that the Government closely monitor the 
implementation of the new law and be prepared to amend it, should its interpretation suggest a 
threat to human rights. 
</p>
<p> The issue of the sanctions regime under Security Council resolution 1267 (1999) is also 
addressed in the South African counter-terrorism law. The names of individuals and entities 
listed by the Security Council are to be published by Presidential declaration in the Government 
Gazette, and to be communicated to Parliament. While the Special Rapporteur sees it as positive 
that the procedures are outlined in the law, he found a need to clarify the practical implications 
of this procedure, including the possibility of judicial review. 
 The Special Rapporteur found that criminal investigations, prosecutions and trials 
generally fall within the normal provisions for criminal procedure in South Africa. He 
commends South Africa for maintaining this stance, and cautions against the use of special 
procedures in terrorist or security-related trials, such as in-camera trials. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.2 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p> The immigrant community of South Africa has grown remarkably during the period of 
democracy in the country, and is seen partly as an important source of labour, but partly also as a 
problem and possibly even as a security threat. There are sentiments of xenophobia in the 
country, and despite the generally strong protections which the Constitution offers to all those 
residing in South Africa, the Special Rapporteur got varied and sceptical responses from 
authorities concerning the rights of immigrants in the country. In particular, two areas in relation 
to the human rights of immigrants in the context of counter-terrorism are of concern to the 
Special Rapporteur: the detention of immigrants, and the application of the principle of 
non-refoulement. 
</p>
<p> While the South African counter-terrorism law does not allow for administrative detention, 
the Immigration Act allows for detention for up to 30 days without mandatory judicial review. In 
detention cases related to security concerns or suspicions of links to terrorism, detention often 
takes place in ordinary police stations, where monitoring and access to legal counsel are lacking. 
The Special Rapporteur recommends the setting up of a comprehensive system of monitoring of 
immigration detention, and for legislation calling for mandatory judicial review within 48 hours, 
and the right to legal counsel from the time of apprehension. 
</p>
<p> The principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits the extradition, deportation or any other 
kind of removal of an individual to a country where he or she may risk torture or cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment, has been articulated in important South African 
jurisprudence: <i>S. v. Makwanyane and Another</i> by the South African Supreme Court and 
<i>Mohamed </i>by the Constitutional Court. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur found, 
however, that the content and binding nature also of this principle of customary law was not 
clear to all government officials. As removals often take place in the context of 
counter-terrorism, this issue is particularly pressing for the mandate. The Special Rapporteur 
recommends that South Africa include in its legislation clearly the principle of non-refoulement. 
</p>
<p> South Africa recognizes the international nature of measures to counter terrorism, and 
therefore, also actively supports regional and subregional efforts in this respect. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages South Africa to support such cooperation and particularly to ensure that 
the promotion and protection of human rights is mainstreamed into all efforts to counter 
terrorism, be it on the African continent as a whole or in the context of Southern Africa. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to his mandate, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism visited South Africa 
from 16 to 26 April 2007 at the invitation of the Government.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>2. After the repression of apartheid, South Africa, in the early 1990s, made its transition 
from apartheid into a full-fledged parliamentary democracy, marked particularly by the adoption 
of the Constitution in 1995. The transition process was in many ways exceptional through its 
non-violent and inclusive approach. The strong constitutional foundation on which South Africa 
rests today is evident and enjoys broad support within society. South Africa has also taken upon 
itself the responsibility of a leadership role on both the African continent and internationally, 
which includes holding a seat on the Security Council until the end of 2008. 
</p>
<p>3. In the context of global measures to counter terrorism, South Africa has expressed its 
commitment. Measures to counter terrorism, in the context of South Africa&#8217;s particular history, 
exist against a background of extremely harsh anti-terrorism legislation of the apartheid era, 
which was used as a vehicle of gross and widespread violations of human rights. In the period 
following the September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, South Africa has not been a 
significant target of terrorist attacks. In the late 1990s, the Western Cape was plagued by attacks 
by PAGAD (People Against Gangsterism and Drugs), a Muslim-based organization with no 
apparent ties to international terrorism. In the early 2000s, the extreme right-wing group 
Boeremag carried out some violent attacks. The Government of South Africa does not today see 
terrorism as a major threat, but remains vigilant. The country adopted counter-terrorism 
legislation, the Protection of Constitutional Democracy against Terrorist and Related Activities 
Act, 2004 (POCDATARA), after lengthy consultations. 
</p>
<p>4. The mission to South Africa was the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s second country visit after he 
accepted his appointment as mandate-holder on 8 August 2005. Its main purpose was to gather 
first-hand information about past, current and future initiatives in the area of counter-terrorism in 
South Africa and how such measures affect the protection and promotion of human rights. The 
Special Rapporteur is very grateful to the Government of South Africa for its invitation and its 
assistance in facilitating the mission. He hopes that the recommendations will be useful for all 
those within the Government, the Parliament, the judiciary and civil society who strive to 
promote and protect human rights while countering terrorism. 
</p>
<p>5. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur visited Pretoria, Johannesburg, Midrand and 
Cape Town. In Pretoria, he had high-level meetings with Ministers or officials in the following 
government bodies: the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of National Intelligence, the 
Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice, including the National Prosecuting Agency and the 
South African Law Reform Commission, the Ministry of Safety and Security as well as the

<p><b>1
</b>  The Special Rapporteur conducted his mission assisted by the Office of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights and Ms. Kristina Stenman of the Institute for Human 
Rights at &#197;bo Akademi University. A draft mission report was sent to the Government 
on 28 June 2007. </p>

</p>
<p>South African Police Service (SAPS) and the SAPS College, and the Ministry of Home Affairs. 
In relation to an ongoing major trial, he also visited the C-Max Prison, privately interviewed 
detainees and briefly attended the trial in the Pretoria High Court. He also met with the 
South African Human Rights Commission. In Johannesburg, he met with a current justice and a 
retired Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court and several non-governmental organizations, 
including the Freedom of Expression Institute, the Wits Law Clinic, the National Coalition on 
Refugee Affairs, and the Southern Africa Migration Project (SAMP). In Midrand, he had a joint 
meeting with parliamentarians in the Security Cluster of Parliament&#8217;s portfolio committees. In 
Cape Town, he met with civil society representatives. During the visit, he also had discussions 
with numerous legal practitioners and academics, and gave two public lectures organized, 
respectively, by the Centre for Human Rights at the University of Pretoria and the Institute for 
Security Studies. He also had consultations with the local office of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The Special Rapporteur was not 
able to complete the full agenda envisaged due to Parliament and many of the courts being in 
recess. He also regrets that requests made during the mission to visit, in particular, police 
detention facilities were not met. In light of the Terms of Reference for Fact-Finding Missions 
by Special Rapporteurs, such visit requests ought to be accommodated by the host Government,<b>2</b> 
and they would have contributed in an important way to a greater insight into South Africa&#8217;s 
counter-terrorism measures. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  MAIN FINDINGS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  General political and legal background 
</b></p>
<p>6. South Africa evolved from an apartheid system into a democracy in 1994, in a transition 
which in many ways remains unparalleled in its level of ambition and commitment by all actors 
in society and the international community. The new South African Constitution was adopted 
in 1996, hailed for its inclusiveness and reflection of international human rights standards. 
South Africa is party to most international human rights instruments, but has not yet acceded to 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>7. Today, South Africa is a multi-ethnic, multilingual and multi-religious society. The total 
population in 2006 was approximately 45 million. According to the 2001 census, the population 
of South Africa was constituted as follows: Black African, 79 per cent; White, 9.6 per cent; 
Coloured, 8.9 per cent; and Indian/Asian, 2.5 per cent. 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>2
</b>  Terms of Reference for Fact-Finding Missions by Special Rapporteurs/Representatives of the 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/1998/45, appendix V). 
<b>3
</b>  South Africa has ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
</p>
<p>Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (ICCPR), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against 
Women (CEDAW) and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination (CERD). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.2 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>8. The distribution of religions, according to the 2001 census, is: Zion Christian 11.1 per cent, 
Pentecostal/Charismatic 8.2 per cent, Catholic 7.1 per cent, Methodist 6.8 per cent, Dutch 
Reformed 6.7 per cent, Anglican 3.8 per cent, other Christian 36 per cent, Muslim 1.5 per cent, 
other 2.3 per cent, unspecified 1.4 per cent and none 15.1 per cent. 
</p>
<p>9. The South African Parliament is bicameral, with the National Assembly and the National 
Council of Provinces. The National Assembly is to have 350 to 500 Members, elected every 
five years, and currently has 400 Members. The National Council of Provinces has 10 members 
from each of the 9 provinces.<b>4</b> Elections are held every five years. The last parliamentary 
elections were held in 2004, and gave yet another overwhelming victory to the African National 
Congress (ANC), which took 69.7 per cent of the votes, and holds 279 seats in the National 
Assembly, followed by the Democratic Alliance (50 seats), the Inkatha Freedom Party 
(IFP, 28 seats), the United Democratic Movement (UDM, 9 seats), the New National Party 
(NNP, 7 seats), and the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP, 6 seats); 21 seats are held by 
smaller groups. Thabo Mbeki has been President since 1999. The President is elected by the 
National Assembly, and appoints the Cabinet. 
</p>
<p>10. Since its democratization in 1994, South Africa&#8217;s political focus has centred on the 
eradication of the extreme poverty and disenfranchisement of the vast majority of the population, 
which was the legacy of apartheid. Although progress has been made, the white minority 
population still retains considerable concentrations of power in business and many areas of 
public life. 
</p>
<p>11. A key area of focus in the field of justice and law enforcement has largely been crime, 
organized crime and corruption. South Africa has, and continues to struggle with an extremely 
high crime rate, and therefore, much effort has been put both into strengthening law 
enforcement, but also into social reform to combat poverty. However, there is ongoing criticism 
against the measures taken. Also, trust in the system of law enforcement is undermined by 
allegations of corruption and police brutality.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>12. The high prevalence of HIV/AIDS also has socio-economic repercussions, and life 
expectancy in South Africa today is low, at 42.73 years, despite the relative affluence of the 
country.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>13. Democratic South Africa has also become a major host country for immigrants. 
South Africa maintains, and has in recent years tried to strengthen, an immigration policy which 
furthers immigration of skilled labour. At the same time, some of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
interlocutors estimated there were up to 2 million undocumented migrants in the country.

</p>
<p>South Africa was one of the first countries on the African continent to set up an individual 
asylum procedure, with the number of applications rising to 53,361 in 2006.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>14. Despite the high rate of crime, terrorism has not been seen as a major problem in 
South Africa. Two main organizations have emerged in the last 10 years which have carried 
out politically motivated acts of violence against members of the general population: the 
Islamic-based PAGAD, and the right-extremist group Boeremag. 
</p>
<p>15. PAGAD was set up in 1996. A rise in crime, the police&#8217;s inability to tackle this trend and 
frustration within the Muslim communities, particularly in the Western Cape, has been seen as 
the motivation for its establishment. PAGAD&#8217;s G-Force (Gun Force) was considered responsible 
for committing terrorist acts. Organizations such as MAGO (Muslims Against Global 
Oppression) and MAIL (Muslims Against Illegitimate Leaders) were apparently also offshoots 
or fronts for PAGAD. During 1996-2000, PAGAD carried out a large number of violent attacks, 
first mainly against drug dealers, then academics and State structures; later, restaurants and 
public places were targeted. From 1998 onward, PAGAD is described as having become more 
violent and indiscriminate.<b>8</b> Altogether, 189 bomb attacks were carried out either by PAGAD or 
related factions of this group.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>16. During 2001 and 2002, the authorities started to uncover a series of planned bombings and 
violent attacks, traced to a new far-right, white-power group called Boeremag. It also managed to 
carry out eight bomb blasts in Soweto, killing two persons, and the bombing of a bridge on the 
border of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. The National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and the 
South African Police Service during that time managed to uncover several planned attacks. 
Some 20 suspected Boeremag members are currently on trial.<b>10</b> Two suspects escaped from 
police custody in May 2006. They were caught in January 2007. The court case against the 
Boeremag members resumed in February 2007 and the Special Rapporteur was able to monitor 
one session. Separate charges under the new anti-terror act will likely be brought against a 
couple who aided the two fugitives.<b>11</b>

</p>
<p>17. In recent years, there has been discussion about the possibility of recruitment to 
international terrorist organizations in South Africa. There is also the possibility that 
international terrorist organizations may be using South Africa, due to its well developed 
infrastructure and banking system, its porous borders and alleged corruption in the civil service, 
as a basis for recruitment operations. It is therefore natural that South Africa supports regional 
and subregional efforts on the African continent to counter terrorism and encourage coordination 
in the field of law enforcement and judicial cooperation, both within the context of the 
African Union (AU) and the Southern African Development Conference (SADC). 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Priority issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  The definition of terrorism and related issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Protection of Constitutional Democracy against Terrorist and Related Activities Act 
</b></p>
<p>18. The definition of terrorist acts is one of the central issues in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
mandate. The lack of a universal, comprehensive and precise definition partly explains why 
States have adopted varying legislation, often in a piecemeal manner, copying other countries&#8217; 
counter-terrorism laws. This situation may lead to vague definitions and flawed procedures that 
do not meet the requirements of legality and judicial guarantees set out, particularly, in the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Broad definitions of terrorism may also 
lead to violations of human rights such as the freedom of expression and freedom of association. 
It is in this international context that the Special Rapporteur also assesses the counter-terrorism 
legislation of South Africa. 
</p>
<p>19. The main piece of legislation, POCDATARA, was passed in Parliament in 2004, and 
entered into force following presidential signature in 2005.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>20. The law is the result of a lengthy process, which began in 1995 after the democratic 
transition in the country, with a call by the Minister of Safety and Security for a review of 
security legislation. The Internal Security Act of the time had an outdated definition of terrorism, 
focused only on acts committed in and against South Africa. Internal violence during the 1990s 
further heightened the perceived need for new legislation. A first draft proposal was submitted 
by the South African Law Reform Commission in 2000. The Government presented a bill to 
Parliament in November 2002. The bill was then subject to comments and criticism from 
numerous civil-society actors, including the Congress of South African Labour Unions 
(COSATU), who feared that the law might criminalize labour actions and social movements. The 
bill was then subject to broad consultations in Parliament and extensive redrafting in the 
Committee on Justice, headed by the Chair of the Committee, the present Deputy Minister of 
Justice, Johnny de Lange. 
</p>
<p>21. The 2005 counter-terrorism law now provides the overall legal framework for 
counter-terrorism in South Africa. The Ministry of Safety and Security has the main 
responsibility for its implementation. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  Act No. 33 of 2004. </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>22. To date, no jurisprudence is available regarding the implementation of the new terrorism 
law. However, there is a pending prosecution, related to an associated crime in the so-called 
Boeremag trial that is scheduled to commence in coming months pursuant to the new law. 
</p>
<p>23. Article 1 of POCDATARA contains the relevant definitions in relation to the law. 
Section 1, subsection 1 (xxv) (a) to (c), contains a three-pronged definition of terrorism. 
Subsection (a) defines terrorist activity through a fairly long list of crimes. Subsection (b) then 
defines terrorist intent, and subsection (c) the requirement of a political or analogous aim. 
Subsections (a) to (c) are to be read as a cumulative definition, so that an act constitutes 
terrorism only if all three conditions are met. Consequently, the application of the clause as a 
whole must meet several evidentiary thresholds, including those related to intent and aim. In the 
assessment of the Special Rapporteur the clause, if properly applied, is not likely to have an 
overly broad scope. 
</p>
<p>24. However, subsection (a) of the clause, read in isolation, enumerates a broad scope of acts 
which by their level of harm cannot justifiably be seen as terrorist acts. On the face of it, 
article 1, section 1, subsection 1 (xxv) (a) of the definition of terrorist activity appears overly 
broad, covering several offences that do not necessarily include deadly or otherwise serious 
violence against members of the general population or segments of it. While subsections (b) 
and (c) mitigate this concern, subsection (a) nonetheless conveys to domestic and international 
readers a view of a broad scope of acts potentially amounting to terrorism. Many of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors from the Government of South Africa underlined the cumulative 
nature of the definition. Yet, several civil society actors voiced concern about the broad scope of 
the definition, and the possibility that the law might be used for instance against social 
movements working for the improvement of social and economic rights of the population. 
</p>
<p>25. Article 12 of the law sets out a reporting duty for the public in respect of all crimes under 
the Act. This raises issues related to the freedom of expression generally and, in particular, 
journalists&#8217; ability to protect their sources. Concern about this feature of the law was expressed 
to the Special Rapporteur, while the article was also seen as protection and encouragement for 
the population to contact the law enforcement agencies when possessing knowledge of 
suspicious action.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Law enforcement and criminal proceedings in terrorism cases </b></p>
<p>26. In terms of procedures related to the investigation and prosecution of terrorist acts, the Act 
went through some important changes in the parliamentary debate and decision-making process. 
In particular, the Act contains only very few additional powers for law enforcement agencies and 
prosecution in the case of suspected terrorist crimes. The Act does not, for instance, provide for 
administrative detention, as did the first drafts of the law. 
</p>
<p>27. In the investigation of terrorist crimes, the authorities clearly stated to the Special 
Rapporteur that profiling or data-mining on the basis of racial/ethnic/religious characteristics are 
neither a part of the collection of intelligence nor used in investigations. Profiling on the basis of 
personal behaviour is seen as both more efficient and more compatible with South African 
legislation and the Constitution. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.2 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>28. In counter-terrorism investigations, the South African Police Service has a key role in 
addition to the security services in the country. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by 
assurances of SAPS&#8217; strict adherence to human rights standards, inter alia, the human rights 
manual in use by SAPS. He was also familiarized with the training of police in 
counter-terrorism. His overall impression was that there is a significant human rights component 
in the training of police officers, albeit some specific issues such as the human rights of 
undocumented aliens may not be adequately covered. Law enforcement agencies naturally play a 
crucial role in counter-terrorism, and a consistent record of professional conduct and adherence 
to human rights standards is a central pillar in their ability to collect intelligence and conduct 
investigations in relation to terrorist acts. 
</p>
<p>29. The history of South African law enforcement during the apartheid era is grim, and 
therefore, it has been an enormous task to create a South African Police Service that has the trust 
of the community. However, allegations of police brutality persist in South Africa. The 
establishment of an Independent Complaints Directorate (ICD) is an important step, but 
transparent information on reports and decisions by ICD are not easily available. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur visited the C-Max high security prison in Pretoria, where 13 of 
the 22 accused in the Boeremag trial are being held in detention during trial. He found the 
physical conditions of the prisoners to be of adequate standard and the limitations placed on 
them in terms of freedom of movement, visitation rights and communication with counsel to be 
in conformity with international standards concerning the treatment of accused in remand, 
including being proportionate in respect of the classification of the detainees as high-security 
detainees. The Special Rapporteur conducted confidential interviews with a number of the 
detainees and takes the view that their complaints mainly relate to the consequences of their 
classification as high-security detainees. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur also attended a brief hearing in the High Court in Pretoria in the 
Boeremag trial. He was unable to identify any particular concerns in respect of fair trial 
protections but notes that the trial has already taken several years and could at some point give 
rise to concerns of undue delay. If the issue of undue delay is raised at a future stage, an 
assessment of the complexity of the case and the conduct by the court, the prosecution and the 
defence in causing possible delays will need to be examined.  
</p>
<p>32. During the mission, it came to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention that in a criminal case 
related to national security, although not under the counter-terrorism law, the prosecution has 
applied for that the full court proceedings are to be held in camera. This is troublesome, since a 
public trial is one of the central pillars of a fair trial under article 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which stipulates that only in some situations it 
may be justifiable to hold parts of a trial in camera. 
<b>Listing of individuals and entities under the Security Council sanctions list 
</b></p>
<p>33. The counter-terrorism act  POCDATARA also contains provisions related to the listing of 
individuals on the basis of the Security Council list of individuals and entities being placed 
under sanctions pursuant to Security Council resolution 1267 (1999), due to their affiliation with 
Al-Qaeda or the Taleban. </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.2 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>34. According to section 25 of the Act, the listings when completed are to be published by 
presidential proclamation in the Government Gazette. According to section 26, the lists are then 
submitted to Parliament, which may take any action that it deems appropriate. 
</p>
<p>35. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission, the listing had gained acuteness as the 
United States had initiated proceedings in the Security Council for the placing of two 
South African nationals on the list. South Africa had blocked the listing in the Security Council. 
Many of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors voiced their concern over the shortcomings in the 
Security Council listing procedures, the lack of transparency and of procedures for de-listing. At 
the same time, however, the interpretations of parliamentary action foreseen in article 26 of 
POCDATARA varied widely. Some stated that the only course of action possible for Parliament 
to pursue was to insist that the Government initiate de-listing in the Security Council. Others saw 
a stronger potential role for Parliament or one of its Committees, including hearing from the 
persons subject to the Security Council listing or the quashing of an executive decision to 
implement such listing on the national level. 
</p>
<p>36. It was clear from discussions both with Government and civil society interlocutors that, 
owing to their role in the community, of these persons subject to the United Nations listing 
procedure, the Government has sought an active dialogue with the South African Muslim 
population concerning the sanctions regime. The same interlocutors also voiced their broader 
concerns about the possibilities for Muslims to fulfil their religious duty of charity by means of 
legal and acceptable channels of funding. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Immigration policies in the context of counter-terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>37. Since its democratization, South Africa has again opened up its international contacts and 
has also become a country of destination for immigrants, mostly from the African continent, but 
also from other countries. South Africa entered into an agreement with the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1993 on setting up a national 
system for the determination of refugee status. Legislation in this area has been renewed, and is 
currently based on the Immigration Act of 2002 and the Refugees Act of 1998.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>38. South Africa has a determined policy of non-discrimination and promotion of equality, 
enshrined in both its Constitution and legislation. Most rights in the Constitution apply to every 
person in South Africa, including the right to housing and the right to emergency health care. 
Despite the clarity of the Constitution, the Special Rapporteur was surprised by statements by 
persons, even in high-level government positions, to the effect that irregular aliens would not 
enjoy rights in South Africa. Through discussions with numerous government and 
non-government interlocutors, it became clear that in South Africa many see the risk of terrorism 
primarily as coming from foreigners and that among authorities there is a temptation to bypass 
procedural and substantive human rights standards when dealing with foreigners unlawfully in 
the country.  
</p>
<p>

<p><b>13
</b>  Immigration Act, Act No. 13, 2002; Immigration Amendment Act, Act No. 19, 2004;

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.2 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>39. In the international debate on terrorism, foreigners are often perceived as a threat of 
terrorism. South African authorities and NGOs generally do not perceive immigrants as a risk for 
potential terrorist acts. However, there is a persistent and troubling view, in terms of human 
rights, that irregular migration is rampant and that immigrants may be a source of crime and 
violence.  
</p>
<p>40. At the same time, allegations or rumours were frequently raised concerning huge backlogs 
and corruption in the practices of the Department of Home Affairs. These trends raise concerns 
both in terms of the rights of foreigners and the risk of South Africa becoming a safe haven for 
organized crime or terrorist activities. 
</p>
<p>41. In the context of counter-terrorism, the Special Rapporteur noted particularly two areas of 
concern: detention of immigrants and the application of the principle of non-refoulement. 
</p>
<p><b>Immigration detention 
</b></p>
<p>42. Detention of immigrants is possible under article 34 of  the Immigration Act of 2002, when 
it is found that an immigrant is illegally in the country and, hence, deportable. The initial 
decision is taken by immigration officers, and detention without mandatory judicial review is 
possible for up to 30 days. A detainee can in principle file a request for habeas corpus review.  
</p>
<p>43. Important safeguards for detainees are set out in article 35 (2) of the Constitution.<b>14</b> Hence, 
an informed reason for detention, the ability to obtain legal counsel and the opportunity to  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>14
</b>  &#8220;(2)  Everyone who is detained, including every sentenced prisoner, has the right: 
</p>
<p> (a) To be informed promptly of the reason for being detained; 
 (b) To choose, and to consult with, a legal practitioner, and to be informed of this right 
promptly; 
</p>
<p> (c) To have a legal practitioner assigned to the detained person by the State and at State 
expense, if substantial injustice would otherwise result, and to be informed of this right 
promptly; 
</p>
<p> (d) To challenge the lawfulness of the detention in person before a court and, if the 
detention is unlawful, to be released; 
</p>
<p> (e) To conditions of detention that are consistent with human dignity, including at least 
exercise and the provision, at State expense, of adequate accommodation, nutrition, reading 
material and medical treatment; and 
</p>
<p> (f) To communicate with, and be visited by, that person&#8217;s: 
(i) Spouse or partner; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Next of kin; 
(iii) Chosen religious counsellor; and 
(iv) Chosen medical practitioner.&#8221; </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>challenge the lawfulness of detention ought to be available to all detainees. However, it was the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s clear impression from discussions with numerous interlocutors and from 
his visit to the detention facilities of Johannesburg airport that, in practice, these safeguards are 
not known or respected. Unfortunately, the authorities were not willing to facilitate ad hoc visits 
by the Special Rapporteur to police detention facilities, through which he would have wished to 
interview both detained foreigners and policemen about their awareness of the legal safeguards 
in place for persons detained pending deportation. These visits were requested during the 
mission, in part because of changes to the programme which unexpectedly permitted additional 
time and in part because it transpired in the course of various meetings that the issue required the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention. 
</p>
<p>44. As stated elsewhere, South Africa does not have provisions for administrative detention in 
its counter-terrorism law. However, it did come to the attention of the Special Rapporteur that 
even large-scale arrests of foreigners have taken place on the basis of security-related issues and 
that the detention was a result of law enforcement officials disregarding immigration rules and 
regulations. Also, in discussions with legal practitioners and officials, the Special Rapporteur 
learned that in the case of security-related cases of immigration detention (including persons 
suspected of links to terrorism), detention would often take place in police stations in and 
around Johannesburg and Pretoria. This was also the case in the matter of Khalfan Khamis 
Mohamed, a suspect in the 1998 bombings of the United States of America embassies in Nairobi 
and Dar-es-Salaam, whose case was dealt with by the Constitutional Court of South Africa 
in 2000.<b>15</b> Taken together with the apparent shortcomings in the application of legal safeguards 
for persons in immigration detention, this situation gives rise to concern.  
</p>
<p><b>The principle of non-refoulement 
</b></p>
<p>45. One of the most important human rights protections of foreigners is the principle of 
non-refoulement.  In the international debate on counter-terrorism, this principle has been called 
into question by many Governments, and has been diluted for instance by the practices of 
diplomatic assurances and extraordinary renditions.  During his mission, thanks to extremely 
frank discussions with high-ranking government spokespersons, including the Deputy Minister 
of Justice, it became obvious to the Special Rapporteur that there is a lack of clarity as to the 
scope and nature of this international legal obligation upon South Africa.  
</p>
<p>46. The principle of non-refoulement arises out of the prohibition against torture and cruel or 
degrading treatment or punishment, and is generally founded in article 7 of ICCPR, and more 
explicitly in the specific provisions of article 3 of CAT, and article 33 of the Convention relating 
to the Status of Refugees of 1951.  The Special Rapporteur underscores the customary law nature 
of this prohibition, which is therefore unconditionally binding also upon South Africa. 
</p>
<p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.2

</p>
<p>47. Before and during the visit, the case of Khalid Rashid, a Pakistani national who left 
South Africa on 6 November 2005, allegedly on a chartered airplane and escorted by Pakistani 
authorities, was brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention. Until April 2007, the whereabouts 
of Mr. Rashid were unknown. Numerous court submissions have been filed on his behalf, and 
the case is ongoing. Without assessing the merits of the case, the Special Rapporteur notes that 
the discussion around it gives rise to concerns related to the distinction between extradition and 
deportation and the respective provisions to be followed, and the application of the principle of 
non-refoulement in South African law and practice.  
</p>
<p>48. In the Extradition Act of 1962, as amended by the Amendment Act of 1996, there is in 
article 11 a list of reasons for refusing extradition. These include, according to paragraph (b) (iv), 
situations in which &#8220;the Minister is satisfied that the person concerned will be prosecuted or 
punished or prejudiced at his or her trial in the foreign State by reason of his or her gender, race, 
religion, nationality or political opinion&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>49. However, the principle of non-refoulement is not explicitly included in the Constitution. In 
the Refugees Act of 1998, the principle is expressed in section 2.<b>16</b> The wording of the provision 
is based upon article 2 (3) of the African Union Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of 
Refugee Problems in Africa,<b>17</b> which reads: &#8220;No person shall be subjected by a Member State to 
measures such as rejection at the frontier, return or expulsion, which would compel him to return 
to or remain in a territory where his life, physical integrity or liberty would be threatened for the 
reasons set out in article I, paragraphs 1 and 2.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>50. The placing and wording of this provision appear problematic. First, the wording of the 
provision appears to limit the scope of the protection of the principle of non-refoulement to 
persons covered by the refugee definition in the Refugees Act. This is not in congruence with the 
principle set out by article 7 of ICCPR and article 3 of CAT , which is universal in its 
application, inclusive of all individuals. Secondly, the provision does not mention the types of 
ill-treatment which hinder removal, although it may be deduced from the wording related to 
&#8220;persecution&#8221; that capital punishment, torture and all forms of ill-treatment would be included. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>16
</b>  &#8220;2.  General prohibition of refusal of entry, expulsion, extradition or return to other country in 
</p>
<p>certain circumstances. Notwithstanding any provision of this Act or any other law to the 
contrary, no person may be refused entry into the Republic, expelled, extradited or returned to 
any other country or be subject to any similar measures, if as a result of such refusal, expulsion, 
extradition, return or other measure, such person is compelled to return to or remain in a country 
where: 
</p>
<p> (a) He or she may be subjected to persecution on account of his or her race, religion, 
nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group; 
</p>
<p> (b) His or her life, physical safety or freedom would be threatened on account of external 
aggression, occupation, foreign domination or other events seriously disturbing or disrupting 
public order in either part or the whole of that country.&#8221; 
<b>17
</b></p>
<p>  Adopted on 10 September 1969. </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>Finally, while the provision is a general one, referring to all types of removal, its being placed in 
the Refugees Act may contribute to the apparent confusion as to the binding nature of the 
prohibition in relation to all individuals, be they asylum-seekers or not. 
</p>
<p>51. Torture or ill-treatment as grounds for refusing extradition are not mentioned in the above 
provision of the Extradition Act, nor in the Refugees Act. The same is true for the Immigration 
Act. However, on the basis of the <i>Mohamed</i> judgement, it is now established that neither 
extradition nor deportation can take place where there is a risk of execution of the death penalty. 
More importantly, the Constitutional Court ruling, read in the light of the earlier case of 
<i>S. v.</i> <i>Makwanyane and Another</i>, indicates that removal under the risk of capital punishment was 
understood as an application of a broader obligation of non-refoulement in respect of torture or 
any form of inhuman treatment or punishment.  
</p>
<p>52. A recent judgement of the High Court of South Africa in an asylum case concerning a 
Libyan national also makes explicit and unambiguous reference to the principle of 
non-refoulement in international law as binding upon South Africa, and with reference to 
section 2 of the Refugees Act.<b>18</b>   
</p>
<p><b>3. Mercenaries in the context of countering insurgencies or terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>53. It is commonly known that persons and companies acting as private military or security 
contractors or mercenaries have been involved in armed operations carried out in the context of 
countering insurgencies or terrorism. This is true also in the invasion of Iraq, where 
South African nationals have also allegedly been involved. The Special Rapporteur was 
encouraged by the clear stance against such involvement expressed by South African officials.  
</p>
<p>54. The South African Parliament recently passed an Act on the Basis of the Prohibition of 
Mercenary Activities and Prohibition and Regulation of Certain Activities in Areas of Armed 
Conflict Bill.<b>19</b>  The new Act is to replace the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act,<b>20</b>  
and to render clarity to South Africa&#8217;s position concerning the participation of its nationals as 
private security or military contractors in armed conflicts. Under the new provisions, it is 
required that companies or individuals wanting to render military assistance or security services 
to any party to an armed conflict obtain permission from the National Conventional Arms 
Control Committee (NCACC). South Africans are banned from enlisting in foreign armed 
forces, unless authorized by NCACC. Humanitarian assistance organizations will also need to 
register with NCACC. Critics of the law have argued that the legislation hinders, for example, 
South African organizations from rendering humanitarian assistance in armed conflicts.

</p>
<p><b>4. Community relations 
</b></p>
<p>55. South Africa has throughout its history been a multi-ethnic, multi-religious society, and has 
become more so in the period of democracy and the ensuing immigration. In the prevention of 
terrorism, tolerance and the promotion of good ethnic relations amongst all the population is key 
in any society. Non-discrimination and inclusiveness are important strands in the South African 
Constitution, as the Special Rapporteur has noted above. The rise of immigration has, however, 
also brought in an element of xenophobia against the immigrant community of South Africa. 
This led to a campaign, Roll Back Xenophobia, as a coordinated operation between the 
South African Human Rights Commission, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees and the South African NGO community. The campaign was launched in 1998, and 
has been seen as making some gains.<b>21</b>  
</p>
<p>56. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur raised with the authorities the issue of 
violence, particularly against Somali immigrants, which occurred in the Western Cape 
particularly in 2006 and lead to the death of dozens of individuals. The response given was that 
the violence was not founded on xenophobia, but rather on disputes between owners of 
small-scale businesses, and based partly upon the Somali community&#8217;s isolation. However, the 
authorities drew attention to the Unit for Counter-Xenophobia established within the National 
Immigration Branch of the Department of Home Affairs. 
</p>
<p><b>5. Regional role 
</b></p>
<p>57. South Africa has made important contributions to the strengthening of political and 
economic cooperation and integration on the African continent. The African Union and the 
New Partnership for Africa&#8217;s Development (NEPAD) form the basis for cooperation on the 
whole continent, while the SADC (Southern African Development Conference) is the 
subregional framework for South African cooperation.  
</p>
<p>58. SADC established an Organ on Politics, Defense and Security Cooperation through a 
protocol in 2001. The Strategic Indicative Plan for the Organ on Politics, Defense and Security 
Cooperation (SIPO) clearly sets out modalities of practical cooperation in the field of 
counter-terrorism, and also strategies for the protection and promotion of human rights.<b>22</b>   
</p>
<p>59. While not formally a part of SADC, the Southern African countries established in 1994 the 
Southern African Regional Police Chiefs Cooperation Organization (SARPCCO). While the 
Special Rapporteur was not able to meet with officials working within the SARPCCO 
cooperation, it is clear from documentation that the Government of South Africa sees the 
cooperation within SARPCCO as an important element of its counter-terrorism strategies.<b>23</b>

</p>
<p><b>II. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>60. South Africa has undergone a remarkable transition from the apartheid regime to a 
pluralistic democracy, founded firmly on the 1995 Constitution. South Africa is party to most 
major international human rights treaties, and has sought to build its society firmly on the 
foundation of human rights, enshrined in the Bill of Rights in the Constitution. Also in its 
counter-terrorism policies and legislation, it has sought an overall framework for addressing 
security concerns related to terrorism without undermining the protections of the Constitution. 
The Special Rapporteur rests assured that this foundation will help to ensure that 
counter-terrorism measures will be used properly, and not as previously applied during the 
apartheid regime, as a vehicle of repression and for the suppression of dissent. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur commends South Africa for the thorough consultative process, 
including in Parliament, preceding the adoption of the Act on Protecting Constitutional 
Democracy against Terrorist and Related Activities Act (POCDATARA). In this process, 
legitimate concerns were taken into account inter alia concerning the right to labour action, and 
to the risks of human rights violations involved in administrative detention. 
</p>
<p>62. The definition of terrorism in the counter-terrorism law, when read cumulatively, is 
relatively narrow in scope. However, many of the acts listed as potentially constituting terrorist 
acts do not, as to their level of severity or the harm caused, reach the threshold of what 
legitimately can be considered terrorist acts. Hence, this part of the definition may give the 
wrong impression of the definition being broader than it is when properly applied.  
</p>
<p>63. The criminal proceedings pursuant to the counter-terrorism act basically fall under general 
South African criminal law and all its safeguards. However, in the context of countering 
terrorism, national legislation is often borrowed and copied by other countries in a piecemeal 
way, and if sections of this Act are inserted into a national framework with less developed legal 
safeguards, a situation may arise where human rights are threatened. Given the important role 
South Africa has on the African continent, this is a matter of concern. 
</p>
<p>64. The authorities clearly state that racial/ethnic/religious profiling are neither a part of the 
collection of intelligence or used in investigations, but rather any profiling is based on individual 
behaviour.  
</p>
<p>65. There are no provisions of administrative detention in the South African counter-terrorism 
law. Nevertheless, immigration detention, in particular of illegal immigrants facing deportation 
and seen as a security threat, may in fact face detention without trial in South Africa despite the 
broadly shared sentiment against such practices.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur notes the enormous task in the post-apartheid era of creating law 
enforcement agencies which have legitimacy through the adherence to laws and to human rights 
standards. Important improvements have taken place, but reports of police brutality still surface, 
which may also hamper effective investigations in terrorism-related cases. The Independent 
Complaints Directorate has an important role in investigating and issuing decisions concerning 
police misconduct. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.2 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>67. South Africa is an important destination of immigrants and asylum-seekers. The 
Constitution of South Africa to a great extent gives human rights protections to all persons in 
South Africa, which in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view is the correct approach in the light of 
international human rights law, and is commendable. However, in practice, immigrants and 
asylum-seekers face serious difficulties, inter alia, in the fields of housing and health care. A 
special concern is the lack of legal safeguards for detained immigrants, and the protections 
against refoulement in immigration and extradition legislation. 
</p>
<p>68. The recently passed Prohibition of Mercenary Activities and Prohibition and Regulation of 
Certain Activities in Areas of Armed Conflict Act provides an important framework for 
addressing the involvement of South African nationals and companies and residents of 
South Africa as private security or military contractors. This is an important step for improving 
South Africa&#8217;s accountability for human rights violations in the context of countering insurgence 
or terrorism by means of armed intervention. 
</p>
<p>69. The issue of xenophobia against the immigrant community of South Africa was discussed 
in a number of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s meetings. The Special Rapporteur finds that, as part of a 
preventive approach to counter-terrorism, firmer action is needed to address violence and other 
expressions of xenophobia towards immigrants, both from private individuals and any 
government actors.  
</p>
<p>70. South Africa plays an important role in regional and subregional efforts to counter 
terrorism on the African continent. In particular, the strategic and operative cooperation within 
the framework of the Southern African Regional Police Chiefs Cooperation Organisation appears 
to be of practical importance for all the countries involved. The mainstreaming of the promotion 
and protection of human rights in these cooperation measures ought to be a priority of the 
Government of South Africa. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government carefully monitor the 
implementation in jurisprudence of the definition of terrorist acts under POCDATARA, 
and remain prepared to amend the law, should the interpretation of it suggest a threat to 
human rights.</b>  
</p>
<p>72. <b>The practical content of the national procedures for listing individuals subjected to 
sanctions pursuant to Security Council resolution 1267 (1999), including the availability 
and modalities of judicial review, ought to be elaborated more clearly by the Government.</b> 
73. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that for the most part, the normal 
criminal procedure is in place also in terrorism cases. He recommends that South Africa 
maintain this stance, and also that any special proceedings, for example, in-camera trials in 
terrorism or other security-related cases, be used very restrictively.</b> 
</p>
<p>74. <b>For clarity and transparency on the issue of unjustified or disproportionate 
use of force by the police, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to the 
concluding observations of the Committee against Torture, which include the </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.2 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p><b>recommendation to prohibit in law all forms of torture and ill-treatment, and to 
incorporate in the law a specific criminalization of torture.</b> 
</p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur also encourages South Africa to put into place a system of 
reliable statistics related to police brutality with clear parameters and benchmarks for 
improvement. Such statistics can be one helpful and transparent component in assessing 
advances and setbacks in the protection of human rights in law enforcement.</b> 
</p>
<p>76. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends the establishment of a general system of 
independent oversight for the detention of immigrants. This need is particularly urgent in 
respect of the use of police detention facilities for immigration detention of persons subject 
to deportation proceedings.</b> 
</p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends re-examining the provisions on immigration 
detention so that judicial review would be mandatory within, say, 48 hours and that 
effective access to counsel is guaranteed from the moment of apprehension.</b> 
</p>
<p>78. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends amending section 2 of the Refugees Act so as to 
prohibit the removal of any person, either by extradition, deportation or any other form of 
removal, to face a real risk of persecution, capital punishment, torture or any form of 
inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment or punishment, and the inclusion of a provision 
concerning the prohibition of refoulement in the Extradition and Immigration Acts. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Government and Parliament closely 
monitor the implementation of the recently adopted Act prohibiting mercenary activities, 
so that the law prevents the participation of South African individuals or entities as private 
military and security contractors in counter-insurgency or counter-terrorism operations 
where human rights may be undermined. He cautions, however, against the law being 
applied to hinder humanitarian assistance, as such assistance is necessary in the context of 
armed conflicts in order to protect the right to life.</b> 
</p>
<p>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of South Africa, as part also of 
preventative action to counter terrorism, to firmly and promptly implement the 
recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
of 19 October 2006.24</b>  
</p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the Government of South Africa for its efforts to 
strengthen cooperation and integration on the African continent and in the subregion of 
Southern Africa. He urges South Africa to ensure the promotion and protection of human 
rights in all regional and subregional efforts to counter terrorism, be they legislative, 
strategic or operational in nature.</b>
