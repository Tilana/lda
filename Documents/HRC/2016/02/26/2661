</b></p>
<p><b>  Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council</b>&#61482;<b>

<p><b>  22/2. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Composition of staff of the Office of the United Nations High 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> paragraph 5 (<i>g</i>) of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
in which the Assembly decided that the Human Rights Council should assume the role and 
responsibilities of the Commission on Human Rights relating to the work of the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as decided by the Assembly in 
its resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of all relevant resolutions on this issue adopted by the General 
Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note also</i> of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the 
staff of the Office of the High Commissioner,1  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the reports of the Joint Inspection Unit on the follow-up to the 
management review of the Office of the High Commissioner2 and on the funding and 
staffing of the Office,3 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> that an imbalance in the composition of the staff could diminish the 
effectiveness of the work of the Office of the High Commissioner if it is perceived to be 
culturally biased and unrepresentative of the United Nations as a whole, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating</i> <i>its concern</i> that, in spite of stated efforts by the Office of the High 
Commissioner, the situation whereby one region accounts for 47.3 per cent remains, 
</p>
<p>  
 &#61482; The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its twenty-second session (A/HRC/22/2), chap. I. 
 1 A/HRC/22/69. 
 2 A/59/65-E/2004/48 and Add.1. 
 3 JIU/REP/2007/8. 
</p>

<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of continuing ongoing efforts to address the imbalance 
regarding the regional representation of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, 
most notably in senior management positions, 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> that the paramount consideration for employing staff at every level is 
the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and taking into 
account Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, expressing its 
conviction that this objective is compatible with the principle of equitable geographical 
distribution, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the 
General Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses</i> <i>serious concern</i> at the fact that, despite the measures reported by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the imbalance in 
the geographical representation of its composition continues to be prominent, and that a 
single region occupies  almost half of the posts in the Office of the High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Notes with concern </i>the fact that, in 2012, only two out of four regions 
increased their representation in the percentage of staff, and that no change was recorded in 
the overrepresentation status of one region; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Welcomes</i> the statement made by the High Commissioner in her report1 that 
enhancing the geographical diversity of the staff of her Office remains one of her priorities, 
and requests her to redouble her efforts with a view to redressing the current imbalance in 
geographical distribution of the staff of the Office, despite the budgetary contingency; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner, in this regard, to establish specific and 
public targets and deadlines to be achieved; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also requests</i> the High Commissioner to work on the broadest geographical 
diversity of her staff by strengthening the measures aimed at achieving a better 
representation of countries and regions that are unrepresented or underrepresented, 
particularly from the developing world, while considering applying a cap on the 
representation of countries and regions already overrepresented in the Office of the High 
Commissioner; 
</p>
<p>6.<i>  Takes note<b> </b></i>of the commitment of the High Commissioner to remain attentive 
to the need to maintain the emphasis on the broadest possible geographic diversity of her 
Office, as stated in the conclusion of her report; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Welcomes</i> the efforts made towards the achievement of a gender balance in 
the composition of the staff and the decision to continue to pay special attention to this 
issue; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> future High Commissioners to continue to enhance the ongoing 
efforts made in the fulfilment of the goal of a geographical balance in the composition of 
the staff of the Office; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Underlines </i>the importance of continuing to promote geographical diversity in 
recruitment and promotion at the Professional level and, in particular, in senior 
management positions, as a principle of the staffing policies of the Office of the High 
Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Reaffirms</i> the vital importance of geographical balance in the composition of 
the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, taking into account the significance of 
national and regional specificities and various historic, cultural and religious backgrounds, 
as well as of different political, economic and legal systems, to the promotion and 
protection of the universality of human rights; </p>


<p> 11. <i>Recalls</i> the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General 
Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001, on human resources management, in which 
the Assembly reiterated its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to 
improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical 
distribution of staff in each and every department, and also recalls the request that he 
submit to the Assembly proposals for a comprehensive review of the system of desirable 
ranges with a view to establishing a more effective tool to ensure equitable geographical 
distribution in relation to the total number of staff of the Secretariat; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Encourages</i> the General Assembly to consider further measures to promote 
desirable ranges of geographical balance in the staff of the Office of the High 
Commissioner, as requested in the present resolution <b> 
</b></p>
<p> 13.<b> </b><i>Recognizes</i> the importance of the follow-up to and implementation of 
General Assembly resolution 61/159 of 19 December 2006, and underlines the priority 
importance that the Assembly continue to provide support and guidance to the High 
Commissioner in the ongoing process of improvement of the geographical balance in the 
composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Requests</i> the Joint Inspection Unit to undertake a comprehensive follow-up 
review of the management and administration of the Office of the High Commissioner, in 
particular with regard to its impact on the recruitment policies and the composition of the 
staff, and to submit a report thereon and containing concrete proposals for the 
implementation of the present resolution to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh 
session;  
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to submit a comprehensive and updated 
report to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh session following the structure 
and scope of her report and with a special focus on further measures taken to correct the 
imbalance in the geographical composition of the staff of the Office of the High 
Commissioner.
