<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 This report examines the role of commodity buyers, food processors and retailers in 
the realization of the right to food. These actors play a key role, as they connect producers 
to consumers, and as they transform raw commodities into edible food. But the vast 
majority of those who are hungry in the world today are part of the food system; small 
independent food producers or waged agricultural workers working on farms in the formal 
or informal sector represent over half of the billion who go hungry today. The report 
therefore asks how the sourcing, pricing, and wages policies of commodity buyers, food 
processors and retailers impact the right to food. The report seeks to contribute to a better 
understanding, by agribusiness corporations and States alike, of their respective 
responsibilities and obligations under international law. It ends with 10 recommendations 
to States and the agribusiness sector to ensure that the current transformation of the food 
chain will contribute to the realization of the right to food. The recommendations relate to a 
range of areas, including codes of conduct and international framework agreements, 
cooperatives, marketing boards, public procurement, and competition law.

<p>GE.09-17776 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This is the second annual report to the Human Rights Council of Olivier De Schutter 
as Special Rapporteur on the right to food, as requested in Council resolution 10/12. 
</p>
<p>2. In a report presented to the Human Rights Council at its eighth session, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises proposed a framework outlining the human 
rights responsibilities and obligations of the business community and of States, 
respectively, in relation to corporate-related human rights issues.1 Based on an overview of 
human rights violations linked to the activities of corporations,2 he proposed a framework 
relying on three principles. First, States have an obligation to protect human rights, 
comprising at a minimum &#8220;a duty to protect against human rights abuses by non-State 
actors, including by business, affecting persons within their territory or jurisdiction&#8221;.3 
Second, companies have a responsibility to respect all human rights: &#8220;Because companies 
can affect virtually all internationally recognized rights, they should consider the 
responsibility to respect in relation to all such rights.&#8221;4 In order to meet their responsibility 
to respect, companies must undertake an ongoing process of human rights due diligence 
whereby they become aware of, prevent, and mitigate adverse human rights impacts: 
companies should &#8220;not only ensure compliance with national laws but also manage the risk 
of human rights harm with a view to avoiding it&#8221;.5 Third and finally, &#8220;effective grievance 
mechanisms play an important role in the State duty to protect, in both its legal and policy 
dimensions, as well as in the corporate responsibility to respect&#8221;.6 
</p>
<p>3. In this report, the Special Rapporteur examines the role of commodity buyers, food 
processors, and retailers in the realization of the right to food. These actors are referred to 
collectively as the &#8220;agribusiness sector&#8221;. They link producers to consumers. Without them, 
producers would have only very limited access to markets and the choices available to 
consumers would be vastly more limited. It is through market mechanisms that, for the 
most part, the right to food is satisfied, yet the sourcing, pricing, and wage policies of 
commodity buyers, food processors and retailers have a huge and sometimes negative 
impact on the right to food. The main objective of this report is to contribute to a better 
understanding, by agribusiness corporations and States alike, of their different but 
complementary responsibilities under international law, in the light of these impacts.  
</p>
<p>4. This report focuses on political economy issues that arise in the food chain, and on 
the relationships between the agribusiness corporations on the one hand, and their suppliers 
on the other, looking specifically at two vulnerable groups: agricultural workers and 
smallholder farmers. A number of issues have been left out of this report, due to space 
limitations. These include the environmental and nutritional dimensions of the practices of 
agribusiness corporations (i.e., how they could encourage sustainable agriculture and 
promote diverse, nutritious and balanced diets), and the impact of pricing policies on 
consumers. However, the Special Rapporteur intends to return to these other issues in his 
future work. Nor does this report address a number of situations in which the activities of 
private corporations can have an impact on the right to food, for instance when large-scale 
development projects deprive communities of their access to productive resources, or when

<p>seed companies abuse a dominant position in the market to raise the prices of the inputs 
they sell to farmers.7 An addendum to this report (A/HRC/13/33/Add.1) presents the work 
of the Special Rapporteur on the issue of large-scale land acquisitions or leases. 
</p>
<p>5. This report builds on the work of the previous Special Rapporteur on this issue.8 For 
its preparation, the Special Rapporteur has benefited from his participation in the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) Tripartite Technical Workshop on the Global 
Food Price Crisis and Its Impact on Decent Work held in Geneva on 6 March 2009, and 
from other contacts with the ILO, as well as with the International Union of Food, 
Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers&#8217; Associations 
(IUF). He also commissioned contributions9 and convened a multi-stakeholder consultation 
in Berlin on 19&#8211;20 June 2009, hosted by the non-governmental organization European 
Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) and supported by the German 
Government. He had exchanges with a number of agribusiness corporations, both 
bilaterally and through the Consumer Goods Forum, a global network of retailers and 
manufacturers covering over 150 countries. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The changing context 
</b></p>
<p>6. Food systems are currently undergoing deep transformations. The renewed interest 
in agriculture, from both the public and the private sector,10 led to foreign direct investment 
in agriculture rising from an average of US$ 600 million annually in the 1990s, to an 
average of US$ 3 billion in 2005&#8211;2007.11 The increase in direct investment is part of a 
larger transformation of the global supply chain in the agrifood sector.12 Commodity buyers 
(wholesalers) are larger and more concentrated than previously, and they seek to respond to 
the requirements of their food industry clients by increased vertical coordination, tightening 
their control over suppliers. The processing industry is rapidly consolidating, after an initial 
period during the 1980s and early 1990s during which the parastatal large-scale processors 
were dismantled. This sector is increasingly globalized and dominated by large 
transnational corporations. Global retailers and fast-food chains are expanding to reach 
China, India, Russia, Viet Nam, and increasingly southern and eastern Africa, and 
diversifying from processed foods to semi-processed foods and, increasingly, fresh 
produce. 
</p>
<p>7. In this process of expansion and consolidation, the procurement system too has been 
modernized: in addition to public standards, private standards have gained increased

<p>importance, often imposed through codes of conduct adopted by retailers.13 Vertical 
integration has increased, with wholesalers and retailers seeking to secure stability of 
supply by the use of explicit contracts (long-term arrangements with producers) or 
techniques such as preferred supplier lists. Procurement is increasingly centralized, as the 
procurement shed (the area from which companies source) expands from the national to the 
regional and thence to global networks.  
</p>
<p>8. As a result of these developments, concentration in the food production and 
distribution chains has been significantly increasing over the past years.14 The resulting 
market structure gives buyers considerable bargaining strength over their suppliers, with 
potentially severe implications for the welfare both of producers and consumers. Current 
measures adopted to encourage companies to act responsibly are unable to tackle this 
structural dimension.15 Concentration in buying markets is particularly worrying, and even 
more so than concentration in selling markets, because dominance in buying markets can be 
achieved with a relatively small market share; for instance, the United Kingdom Groceries 
Market Investigation concluded in 2000 that retail grocers with as little as 8 per cent of the 
total retail market have substantial buyer power over sellers.16 
</p>
<p>9. Due to the deeply unequal bargaining positions of food producers and consumers on 
the one hand, and buyers and retailers on the other hand, the latter can continue to pay 
relatively low prices for crops even when the prices increase on regional or international 
markets, and they can continue to charge high prices to consumers even though prices fall 
on these markets. Thus, one main reason why prices in developing countries have remained 
high despite the bursting of the bubble in the commodities markets in July 2008 &#8212; in a 
number of countries, prices were higher in July 2009 than they were a year earlier17 &#8212; is 
because of the dominant position of certain traders in these countries. These imbalances of 
power in the food systems must be corrected. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that the 
relationships between the actors concerned cannot any longer be based solely on their 
relative bargaining strength. Instead, they must be collaborative, and based on other modes 
of communication than price signals.

 For example, in the Brazilian soybean market there are roughly 200,000 farmers attempting to sell to

<p>five main commodity traders; three large transnational commodity buyers (ADM, Cargill, and Barry 
Callebaut) dominate the Ivorian cocoa industry. Food processors sometimes also achieve the same 
degree of concentration: in 1996, two transnational food and beverage companies, Nestl&#233; and 
Parmalat, shared 53 per cent of the Brazilian dairy processing market, driving off a large number of 
cooperatives who were led to sell their facilities to these companies. For these and other examples,

<p><b> III. Protecting workers in the agricultural sector 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The challenges 
</b></p>
<p>10. There are more than 450 million waged agricultural workers globally, composing 40 
per cent of the agricultural workforce.18 Fundamental rights at work are frequently violated 
in the agricultural sector. Less than 20 per cent of agricultural workers have access to basic 
social protection and about 70 per cent of child labour in the world is in agriculture, 
representing approximately 132 million girls and boys aged 5 to 14. Bonded labour 
practices are perpetuated from one generation to the next. Since much of waged 
employment is in the informal sector, national labour legislation is unable to ensure the 
right to a minimum wage or to protect women from discrimination. 
</p>
<p>11. Collective bargaining is crucially important for agricultural workers, both because 
knowledge and enforcement of the law tend to be weak in rural areas and because labour 
legislation frequently treats the agricultural sector differently from other sectors with regard 
to issues such as working time, overtime pay, or leave.19 Yet, despite the relatively high 
level of ratification of ILO Convention No. 11 (1921) on the Rights of Association and 
Combination of Agricultural Workers, collective bargaining and social dialogue are often 
entirely absent. In part, this is attributable to the difficulties waged agricultural workers face 
in organizing themselves. But it stems also from subcontracting and outsourcing practices, 
the result of which is that the actual employer has no formal relationship with the worker. 
</p>
<p>12. As agricultural labour is increasingly casualized, as contract farming develops, and 
as small farmers increasingly work on farms or plantations to supplement their basic 
incomes, the distinction between waged workers and farmers is breaking down. Tenants 
and share-croppers also form intermediate categories: tenants pay a fixed rent in cash, in 
kind, in labour, or by a combination of these; sharecroppers pay rent in kind consisting of 
an agreed share of the produce; and certain agricultural workers are remunerated by a share 
of the produce.20 The blurring of the distinctions between these different categories often 
leads to situations in which the legal framework applicable to the relationship between the 
food producer and the food buyer is difficult to determine, and in which the rights and 
obligations of the parties are unclear. This challenge must be met by the regulator. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The role of States in protecting the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>13. States must protect the right to food of agricultural workers by discharging their 
obligations under international labour legislation. Specific instruments that concern 
agricultural workers include ILO Conventions, No. 99 (1951) on Minimum Wage-Fixing 
Machinery in Agriculture21 and No. 110 (1958) on Conditions of Employment of Plantation 
Workers, supplemented by its Protocol of 1982, and recommendation No. 110 (1958) on

<p>Conditions of Employment of Plantation Workers. States face two major and interrelated 
challenges in the implementation of these instruments. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Guaranteeing the right to a living wage 
</b></p>
<p>14. As companies in the agribusiness sector increasingly buy from different suppliers 
across different regions, competition increases between suppliers, and there is a risk of 
regulatory competition between the countries that host them. As a result, various forms of 
abuse in the payment of wages could remain unpunished. Such abuses include the non-
payment or deferred payment of wages; the exclusion of agricultural workers from national 
legislation on the minimum wage; non-respect of periodic readjustment of minimum wage 
rates; the lack of adequate sanctions to deter abuse of the minimum wage system, where it 
exists; and the lack of statistics and data on workers covered by minimum wages in this 
sector. 
</p>
<p>15. It is the duty of the State to ensure that a minimum wage is set in legislation, and 
that compliance with this requirement is adequately monitored. That minimum wage should 
be, at least, a &#8220;living wage&#8221;, that &#8220;provides an income allowing workers to support 
themselves and their families&#8221;, as required under articles 6 and 7 of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.22 Work could be launched on the 
design of a universally agreed-upon methodology to define a living wage, expressed in 
terms of the hourly wage rate a full-time worker should earn.23 No such definition currently 
exists. 
</p>
<p>16. A methodology to define the living wage at national level should be based on a 
number of common principles. It should: (a) ensure that all members of the family have 
permanent access to quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and sufficient food, that is in 
conformity with the cultural traditions of the family concerned, without having to sacrifice 
other basic human rights, such as the right to education or to housing;24 (b) be transparent 
and adaptable to the evolution of the cost of living, including the evolution of the price of 
the basic food basket; (c) allow for a calculation based on easily accessible data; (d) take 
into account specific needs, for example the costs of transportation for those living away 
from the place of work, or the costs of taking care of members of the family unable to 
provide for themselves; (e) build on, and be consistent with, ILO Conventions No. 99 and 
No. 131 (1970) on Minimum Wage Fixing, with Special Reference to Developing 
Countries, particularly as regards the requirement that the minimum wage should be fixed 
taking into consideration, inter alia, &#8220;the needs of workers and their families, taking into 
account the general level of wages in the country, the cost of living, social security benefits, 
and the relative living standards of other social groups&#8221;;25 and (f) include an element of 
progressivity, with a view to reducing inequalities in incomes. 
</p>
<p>17. A methodology based on such principles would take into account the characteristics 
of each country and the significant differences of the cost of living across different

</p>
<p>22
 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 18 (2005) on the right to 
</p>
<p>work (art. 6), para. 7. The Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code refers to a &#8220;living wage&#8221; as one that is 
&#8220;enough to meet basic needs and to provide some discretionary income&#8221; (art. 5.1). The Global Social 
Compliance Programme reference code states that &#8220;Compensation shall meet basic needs and provide 
some discretionary income for workers and their families&#8221; (6.3).

 This is in line with general comment No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (art. 11) of the

interdependency and indivisibility of all human rights.

</p>
<p>countries. It should naturally be seen as a minimum, above which countries and social 
partners should be encouraged to move as speedily as possible, through laws and collective 
agreements. In the agricultural sector, it is sometimes understood that the minimum wage 
can be paid, in part, in the form of allowances in kind, when the employer provides 
housing, food rations, or health care to the workers. States should ensure that such 
allowances are appropriate for the personal use and benefit of the worker and his family and 
that &#8220;the value attributed to such allowances is fair and reasonable&#8221;.26 At the same time, the 
imposition of a living wage should not increase the incentive to develop informal forms of 
employment in the agricultural sector, in which this is already one of the major obstacles to 
the effective monitoring and implementation of existing safeguards. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Monitoring compliance with labour legislation 
</b></p>
<p>18. Agricultural workers should benefit from the same level of protection as workers in 
other sectors. This implies that agricultural workers should be protected by the social 
security schemes applicable to the industrial and commercial sectors. A first step towards 
achieving this is to establish a scheme making the registration of agricultural workers 
compulsory, as has been done in Argentina under pressure from the Argentine Union of 
Rural Workers and Stevedores (UATRE). Similarly, labour providers should be registered 
and should only be authorized to work under a licence, and any violation of the applicable 
legislation should lead to the licence being revoked.27 
</p>
<p>19. Agriculture is often excluded from coverage under national occupational health and 
safety regulations, and such standards are usually not enforced even when they do exist. As 
a result, agriculture is one of the three most dangerous occupations to work in, along with 
construction and mining.28 This is a direct cause of poverty in rural areas: families are left 
without protection when the main breadwinner is killed or injured at work. ILO Convention 
No. 184 (2001) on Safety and Health in Agriculture and its accompanying recommendation 
No. 192 (2001) formally recognize that agricultural workers are guaranteed the same rights 
and protection with regard to their health and safety as other categories of workers. 
Innovative solutions, such as that experimented with in Sweden, where unions have won 
the right to send safety representatives onto farms located in their region, may have to be 
scaled up further. 
</p>
<p>20. The single most important obstacle to the enforcement of labour legislation and the 
reason for the continuing existence of high levels of informal employment is the weak 
capacity of labour inspectorates to monitor employment conditions in the agricultural 
sector. ILO Convention No. 129 (1969) on Labour Inspection in Agriculture requires 
governments to establish a system of labour inspection in agriculture and describes the 
main functions of labour inspection, including that of playing a proactive role by bringing 
gaps in protection to the attention of the competent authorities and making proposals as to 
how to bridge those gaps. However, although some progress has been made on this front in 
recent years,29 more political will is needed in this respect: Convention No. 129 has been 
ratified by significantly fewer States than Convention No. 81 (1947) on Labour Inspection

 See, for instance, the role of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority in the UK. In May 2009, in order

<p>to make enforcement more effective, the GLA and firms including Tesco and Sainsbury&#8217;s have drawn 
up a draft protocol on joint checks of suppliers and sharing information on any abuses.

<p>in Industry and Commerce; and even where labour inspectorates exist and are competent to 
monitor employment in rural areas, they may not have the resources to function effectively.  
</p>
<p><b> C. The role of employers in respecting the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>21. Employers have a responsibility to respect the right to food, even where laws are 
insufficiently protective of agricultural workers or where the existing labour legislation is 
inadequately monitored. At present, the globalization of the food economy increases the 
competitive pressure exercised on suppliers, pushing them to lower wages and downgrade 
other working conditions, and weakening the ability of unions to resist this downward 
trend. This can and must be reversed. Its responsibility to respect the right to food implies 
that a company must not contribute, directly or indirectly, to human rights abuses through 
its relationship with suppliers. Agribusiness corporations operating at a global level should 
use their influence on suppliers to ensure that wages and working conditions improve, 
rather than degrade, as a result of their suppliers joining global value chains. Agribusiness 
companies could make unilateral undertakings to monitor compliance with certain social 
standards in the supply chain. They may conclude international framework agreements with 
global unions. These tools are not a substitute for the enforcement of protective regulatory 
standards by the State, but they can improve situations that, otherwise, would be even 
worse. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Codes of conduct 
</b></p>
<p>22. Agribusiness companies increasingly adopt codes of conduct to ensure that their 
suppliers comply with certain requirements related, for instance, to freedom of association, 
to health and safety at work, and to the prohibition of child labour. Indeed, the proliferation 
of such codes has been such that one of the challenges is now to coordinate, further 
encourage, or harmonize, the multiple private initiatives. There are attempts to encourage 
the comparison of good practices between multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSI). 
Transnational corporations increasingly share experiences in supply chain management. 
One example is the Global Social Compliance Programme (GSCP), which seeks to improve 
coordination between a number of supply chain management schemes, by developing a 
reference code that may serve as a benchmark for the partners involved, and by making 
progress towards mutual recognition of social auditing practices. Such coordination should 
mitigate the difficulties resulting from the coexistence of a myriad of codes of conduct 
imposed by the various clients of local suppliers. 
</p>
<p>23. While welcome in principle, these unilateral initiatives also present companies with 
other challenges. First, the quality of these codes varies greatly. The value of codes consists 
in the fact that they may go beyond the minimum requirements that are laid out in domestic 
legislation or in international labour standards that companies have a responsibility to 
respect; a code that does not move beyond those minimum requirements is a source of 
confusion, not progress. Second, these codes should avoid shifting all the burden of 
compliance onto the supplier, and recognize that it is the responsibility of the buyer to 
support compliance by meeting part or whole of the investment cost required, by providing 
technical capacity, and by funding the monitoring procedures. Third, codes would be too 
easy to circumvent if the supplier could simply subcontract or outsource certain segments 
of the chain; codes should apply to the whole supply chain, including sub-suppliers and 
subcontractors. Fourth, lack of compliance should lead to the adoption of a corrective 
action plan, supported by the buyer, with well-defined and reasonable time frames, rather 
than to the cutting off the business relationship &#8211; a solution which, for the workers 
concerned, may be worse than the evil to be combated. Fifth, these codes should be binding 
on the companies adopting them, and failure to implement them adequately should come at 
a cost. The Special Rapporteur believes that a company adopting a code but failing to </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.09-17776 
</p>
<p>implement it appropriately should be considered as guilty of misleading advertising, and 
public authorities therefore have a duty to monitor such compliance.30 
</p>
<p>24. The main concern raised by codes of conduct is that they would de facto appear as 
substitutes for negotiation and bargaining, and divert companies from signing international 
framework agreements (IFAs), or from joining multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. International framework agreements 
</b></p>
<p>25. Some 72 international framework agreements (IFAs) have been concluded to date 
between transnational corporations and global unions. Among them are agreements 
concerning the food sector, such as the agreement concluded between Danone and IUF in 
1988, between Accor and IUF in 1995, Carrefour and UNI in 2001, Chiquita and 
IUF/COLSIBA in 2001, and Fonterra and IUF in 2002. These IFAs go beyond most codes 
of conduct because of the active implication of the unions in monitoring the undertakings of 
the company which signed the agreement. Their main purpose is to protect the ability of 
local unions to bargain effectively over working conditions, including wages. They may 
thus strengthen the ability of unions throughout the group to protect workers, and they limit 
the competition between workers of the same group. 
</p>
<p>26. A number of conditions should be fulfilled in order for IFAs to be truly effective.31 
First, they should protect the basic rights of workers throughout the whole supply chain, 
covering not only the direct employees of the transnational corporation, but also those of its 
suppliers, contract growers or joint venture partners, wherever they operate. Second, 
appropriate information should be given to workers about the content of the IFA, so that 
they may complain in case of violation. Third, they should go beyond guaranteeing the 
ability of unions to bargain collectively at local level and include, at a minimum, a 
provision on a living wage, if necessary higher than that set under the applicable minimum 
wage legislation. This would be consistent with the obligation of companies to respect the 
right to food in their operations. Fourth, where one supplier does not comply with the 
requirement of the IFA, the buyer should not be obliged either to do nothing or to cut off 
relationships with that supplier; here also, a range of graduated options should be available, 
and the buyer should commit to supporting the supplier in its efforts to comply with the 
content of the IFA. These different conditions could be taken into account by employers&#8217; 
organizations in the food sector and the IUF in the preparation of a model IFA. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Remedies 
</b></p>
<p>27. Just as legal guarantees of a living wage and compliance with other labour rights 
require the strengthening of enforcement mechanisms, particularly through labour 
inspectorates, codes of conduct or IFAs are only as valuable as the monitoring mechanisms 
they include. States should therefore be encouraged to allow consumers to challenge the 
compliance of companies with the codes of conduct they advertise, and global unions 
negotiating IFAs should ensure that monitoring will be effective.

<p><b> IV. Addressing the specific needs of smallholders 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The challenges 
</b></p>
<p>28. Smallholders in developing countries, cultivating small plots of land often with little 
or no public support, are the single most important group of those who are food insecure in 
the world today. To the extent that they do not market their produce themselves, and lack 
storage and processing facilities, smallholders often face a very limited number of buyers. 
For smallholders, the key factor is the price they receive for their crops. In the next 
paragraphs the Special Rapporteur explores the initiatives States could take in order to 
protect the right to food of smallholders, and the measures which could be taken by the 
agribusiness companies to respect the right to food in their relationships with smallholders. 
The overall objective is to ensure that smallholders capture a fair proportion of the value of 
their products, despite the very unequal bargaining position in which they find themselves 
at the moment vis-&#224;-vis commodity buyers. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The role of States in protecting the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>29. By encouraging the diversification of channels of trading and distribution and by 
ensuring the viability of wholesale and local markets, States create a wider range of options 
for smallholders, thus improving their bargaining position in the food chain. In particular, it 
is vital that farmers are not forced to join the agro-export networks, and that they are 
sufficiently supported if they opt, instead, for the production of food crops for local 
consumption. This has not always been the case in the past; since farmers supplying the 
international markets reaped a disproportionate share of public support (in access to credit, 
to technologies, or to infrastructure), the choice for smallholders was often between 
switching to cash crops for exports, something only a minority achieved, or living off 
subsistence agriculture. A number of countries are now seeking to put an end to this 
imbalance, and this is to be welcomed. But more precise measures could also be taken. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Creating a wider range of options for smallholders: cooperatives, marketing boards, 
and public procurement 
</b></p>
<p>30. States have at their disposal a number of tools in order to strengthen the position of 
smallholders and allow them to reap a larger proportion of the value in their transactions 
with buyers. The provision of information about prices and the improvement of 
communication infrastructures are essential, allowing producers to improve their bargaining 
position vis-&#224;-vis buyers and to transport their crops more easily to the markets, where they 
can obtain better prices from other buyers. In this section three other instruments are 
examined &#8212; farmers&#8217; cooperatives, marketing arrangements, and public procurement &#8212; 
that States could explore in order to address the specific needs of smallholders. 
</p>
<p>31. States could support the establishment of farmers&#8217; cooperatives and other producer 
organizations. When they were controlled by governments in the past, cooperatives 
sometimes captured value instead of ensuring fair revenues for farmers, and they were seen 
as inefficient. In many countries, parastatal cooperatives were dismantled during the 1980s. 
This led to the emergence of a large number of producer organizations, established on 
their own initiative.32 For small producers, grouping together presents a number of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>32
 For instance, between 1982 and 2002 the percentage of villages with producer organizations rose 
</p>
<p>from 8 per cent to 65 per cent in Senegal and from 21 per cent to 91 per cent in Burkina Faso. It is 
estimated that 250 million farmers in developing countries belong to one association. See World 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.09-17776 
</p>
<p>advantages,33 since organizations or cooperatives can significantly reduce the transaction 
costs which commodity buyers associate with small-scale farming. Such organizations also 
enhance the capacity of farmers to obtain lower prices when they buy inputs, and higher 
prices when they seek to sell their produce. They can spread the risks across their 
membership; provide services and organize training sessions for their members; provide 
infrastructure services to members, such as storage or transformation facilities; and 
disseminate price and other marketing information. The strengthening of such associations 
is recommended by various international bodies and experts, including ILO and the 
International Assessment on Agricultural Sciences and Technologies for Development 
(IAASTD).34 Cooperatives that function according to democratic principles, that work for 
their members and in which costs and benefits are distributed equitably can be extremely 
beneficial to their members. States should go beyond recognizing the right of farmers to 
organize. They could establish an appropriate legal framework, that encourages the 
formation of cooperatives by smallholders, for instance by favouring access to loans for 
infrastructure investment. They could also build economic incentives, for instance 
preferential treatment of cooperatives in public procurement schemes, or tax incentives for 
the cooperatives themselves or for those buying from cooperatives. Cooperatives wishing to 
enter the global supply chain could benefit from capacity-building in order to improve their 
managerial capacity and ability to meet the increasingly complex norms and requirements 
of buyers and public authorities active on regional and global food markets. 
</p>
<p>32. States could also establish or support marketing boards, equipped to buy certain 
volumes of staple crops at remunerative prices, in order to put pressure on private traders to 
improve on their own offers. These boards should be set up with the participation of 
farmers&#8217; organizations. Such boards could help farmers market their products, or comply 
with standards imposed by the large commodity buyers or retailers. They could, for 
instance, provide for a transparent and reliable certification system. In the past, such 
marketing boards have sometimes used their monopsony power to artificially reduce prices 
received by farmers in order to ensure cheap food for urban consumers, or to earn foreign 
currency from food exports in order to fund industrialization policies; sometimes cheap 
food served the interests of the domestic food processing industries.35 In effect, farmers 
were taxed, and the urban population subsidized &#8211; a situation made even worse by the high 
prices of inputs, the result of tariffs on imported inputs and of an artificially depressed 
currency exchange rate.36 In that context, marketing boards in fact prevented farmers from 
retaining control over the prices they received for their produce, leading to the emergence 
of parallel farmers&#8217; markets and, sometimes, to bribery of marketing board officials. Great

<p>care should be taken to ensure that these past mistakes are not repeated. Participation, 
accountability and transparency are therefore essential in the management of these bodies. 
</p>
<p>33. Finally, States could use their public procurement systems to support smallholder 
farmers. The public sector is an extremely important consumer of goods and services, 
typically representing 10 to 15 per cent of national GDP, and up to 16 per cent in the 
European Union.37 Public authorities could exercise an important leverage on the practices 
of suppliers by including requirements linked to the payment of a fair price to the end 
producers, or to sourcing from smallholders in their purchasing practices. This tool could 
also serve to promote awareness amongst the broader public about the impact of consumer 
choices. It could encourage agribusinesses to develop their supply chains in a way that 
allows them to tender for public contracts, with an impact that would go beyond the 
specific supplies of the contracts for which they are selected. Of course, the introduction of 
criteria in public procurement schemes that seek to contribute to the right to food should be 
non-discriminatory and transparent and reliance upon non-objective criteria that third 
parties cannot apprehend should therefore be avoided. Nevertheless, there should be no 
obstacle to including technical specifications in food procurement schemes referring, for 
instance, to the need for a defined percentage of food being sourced from small farmers, or 
being bought in accordance with fair trade principles. The Brazilian Programme for the 
Purchase of Food from Family Agriculture (PAA) provides a good illustration of the 
potential of such tools.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Improving the bargaining power of smallholders: competition law and abusive 
practices 
</b></p>
<p>34. Where companies have a choice between sourcing from large producers or from 
small farmers, they generally prefer the larger producers, both because of the lower 
transaction costs involved, and because these producers have easier access to capital and 
thus to non-land farm assets, such as storage, greenhouses, or irrigation systems. Unless 
they organize themselves into cooperatives or unless they are otherwise supported in the 
acquisition of such assets, small farmers can only compensate for this disadvantage by their 
lower labour costs. The disturbing consequence is that small farmers pay a high fee for 
entry into the global supply chain; because of the structural obstacles they face, they can 
only compete by agreeing to low wages for those (often family members) working on the 
farm, and by being locked into a situation of high dependency on the buyer. These 
structural problems should be the target of State intervention in the area of competition 
policy. Unfair practices should be identified and prohibited. 
</p>
<p>35. States could seek to combat excessive concentration in the food chain, or abuses of 
dominant positions acquired by certain actors. However, competition law as it currently 
stands is not appropriately tailored to the circumstances that weaken the bargaining position 
of smallholders.38 First, although progress has been made over the past years, in many 
developing countries, competition law is weak or non-existent.39 Second, competition law

 For instance, a survey of African countries on the website of the Global Competition Forum reveals 
</p>
<p>that out of 38 States, 20 are either only in the process of creating a competition law regime, or lacking 
such a regime completely. See: http://www.globalcompetitionforum.org/africa.htm, and Section T.

</p>
<p>generally seeks to protect the end consumers, and not suppliers squeezed by buyers. 
Competition law should, however, also constitute a check against excessive buyer power, 
and not only against seller power.40 The South African Competition Act 1988 illustrates the 
potential of competition law thus reconceived, since this legislation has been relied upon, 
for instance, to launch prosecutions against dairy processors for colluding to fix prices in a 
way that is detrimental to suppliers.41 Third, the use of competition law to address abuses of 
dominant position or cartels in global supply chains may require the application of 
competition law to foreign companies. But while the extraterritorial application of 
competition rules is common when anti-competitive behaviour affects consumer welfare in 
the State concerned, it is not customary when it affects producers in that State seeking to 
have access to export markets and unable to do so on reasonably advantageous terms 
because of excessive concentration of buyer power. For concentration in global food chains 
to be effectively combated, States where suppliers are based should extend the reach of 
their competition law to foreign buyers whose abuses affect national sellers, developing 
regional responses if they are concerned about being vulnerable as a small economy; and 
States where consumers are affected should accept responsibility for addressing such 
abuses, which may restrict consumer choice by allowing buyers to become the gatekeepers 
to their markets. If necessary, States should cooperate through arrangements allowing 
suppliers in one country to complain about abuse of dominant positions by traders or 
supermarkets from another country. 
</p>
<p>36. States could also seek to identify and prohibit a series of practices which are 
particularly detrimental to suppliers. A number of abusive practices have been documented 
in this regard.42 For instance, a dominant buyer may demand a discount on the market price 
from suppliers that reflects the savings made by the seller due to increased production, or it 
may retrospectively adjust the terms of supply. In its Groceries Market Investigation of 
2008, the United Kingdom Competition Commission stated that of the 52 practices it 
identified in the previous Investigation of 2000, 26 were concerned with &#8220;practices that 
have the potential to create uncertainty for suppliers regarding their revenues or costs as a 
result of the transfer of excessive risks or unexpected costs to suppliers&#8221;.43 Certain practices 
could be prohibited as they constitute an undue exercise of buyer power. The UK 
Supermarket Code of Practice (SCOP) could serve as a source of inspiration in this regard.

</p>
<p><b> C. The role of buyers in respecting the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>37. Buyers also could improve the ability of smallholders to have access to markets, 
whether local, regional or global. There is evidence that the shift from supply-driven to 
buyer-driven chains, linked to the expansion of large retail networks 
(&#8220;supermarketization&#8221;), can lead to an increased exclusion of smallholders.44 Such 
exclusion is due, in part, to the imposition of standards in the supply chain that 
smallholders find it difficult to comply with. They must be supported in achieving 
compliance, but they must also be integrated in ways that ensure an adequate standard of 
living, including adequate food, as required by article 11 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, three issues 
are central. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Private standards 
</b></p>
<p>38. The agribusiness sector has devoted significant efforts to developing private 
standards, traceability systems and third-party certification in order to accompany and 
facilitate the booming global trade in fresh fruit, vegetables and fish. The most significant 
initiative in this regard was the establishment of the European Retailers&#8217; Protocol for Good 
Agricultural Practice (EurepGAP), which evolved into GLOBALGAP, a certification 
system covering the process from farm inputs to the farm gate. The development of 
standards is frequently seen as a tool to guarantee that the globalization of food chains 
meets high social and environmental criteria. However, the focus has been more on hygiene 
and food safety issues than on social and environmental concerns. 
</p>
<p>39. The development of private standards has worked against smallholders.45 Indeed, 
compliance has often required higher levels of capitalization than many smallholders could 
afford, and the high costs of monitoring compliance over a large number of units have been 
an incentive for export companies to switch from smallholders to larger commercial 
farms.46 This consequence can only be avoided by the payment of a premium by the

</p>
<p>45
 In their study of the vegetable export chain in Senegal, Johan F.M. Swinnen and Miet Maertens 
</p>
<p>conclude that tightening standards led to a shift from smallholder contract farming to integrated estate 
production. But, they note, the poorest households benefited through being employed on such estates 
rather than themselves producing for the global markets (M. Maertens and J.F.M. Swinnen, &#8220;Trade, 
Standards and Poverty: Evidence from Senegal&#8221;, <i>World Development</i>, vol. 37, No. 1 (January 2009), 
p. 161. Plantation farming is generally much less labour-intensive than small-scale farming, however, 
and it is therefore doubtful whether, in most cases, the employment effects compensate for the 
increased concentration of production.

<p>wholesalers to reward compliance, at least during the first years of implementation, and by 
the provision of technical assistance to facilitate compliance with standards. Currently, a 
number of certified smallholders are only able to remain within the system thanks to donor 
support. This is not sustainable. Research in the horticultural sectors of Kenya and Zambia 
has shown that &#8220;the average recurrent costs of GLOBALGAP compliance typically exceed 
half of the margin for [smallholders]&#8221;.47 For this reason, the Ethical Trade Initiative (ETI) 
Smallholder Guidelines, developed in 2006, take the view that: &#8220;retailers cannot expect 
smallholders to bear all the burden of meeting new technical standards. [Retailers] can help 
smallholders by sharing the risk of transition to production processes that meet these 
standards. For instance, [they] can invest in technical assistance, funds or materials for 
smallholder production&#8221;.48 
</p>
<p>40. The agribusiness sector could take proactive steps to assist smallholders wishing to 
enter global supply chains. As a first step, the sector could carefully assess the impact of 
private standards on the right to food. This is true for the standards it has adopted in the past 
and for those it is planning to adopt in the future. Such assessments should be carried out 
with the participation of smallholders themselves, who are better placed to identify the 
obstacles they may be facing in seeking to comply.49 Second, the sector should recognize 
the limitations of and move beyond the inspection/audit approach. Indeed, this approach 
does not assist smallholders in overcoming compliance problems, nor does it help buyers 
understand the obstacles that their suppliers face. In the opinion of the Special Rapporteur, 
the participation of smallholders in the elaboration of, and compliance with, standards is 
crucial. The smallholder ambassador/Africa observer project launched by GLOBALGAP in 
May 2007 is welcome in this respect, because it allows for feedback to be provided to the 
development of standards by GLOBALGAP. 
</p>
<p>41. The agribusiness sector could do more to reform in depth its relationships with 
smallholders, and in particular reinforce the capacity of its suppliers to comply with social 
and environmental standards. The ETI Smallholder Guidelines set out a series of steps to be 
implemented sequentially within specified time frames. The nature and position of 
smallholders within the supply chain should be identified, followed by an assessment of 
their needs and priorities regarding not just labour issues, but also operational matters. A 
&#8220;development and improvement plan&#8221; should then be drawn up, the nature of which should 
vary according to the particular market. Lastly, there should be periodic evaluations of 
these plans undertaken with smallholders, in which farmers and other supply chain actors 
should participate. 
</p>
<p>42. The imposition of standards by agribusiness companies may also have to be 
challenged in a different way. Standards qualifying products relative to specific 
cultural/geographical regions could act as a counterweight, to encourage a re-linking of 
farmers to their local markets, and increase the attractiveness of these markets for 
producers. Regional examples, such as <i>Cojote Rojo</i> in Mexico or Local Food Plus in 
Canada, demonstrate that such labels present distinct advantages in re-embedding 
agriculture and combating the current dualization whereby producers either manage to join 
agro-export chains or are neither recognized nor sufficiently rewarded.50 The emergence of

<p>local and regional organizations experimenting with alternative food supply chains &#8212; such 
as the Slow Food movement &#8212; which also involve some sort of certification, albeit in a 
decentralized and bottom-up manner, is encouraging in this regard. States have ceded a part 
of their responsibility to regulate food chains to the private sector in the past two decades. 
They would now gain from strengthening these local experiences in order to create a 
diversity of options for farmers and consumers. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Contract farming 
</b></p>
<p>43. One arrangement that is often referred to as a means to improve the ability of 
smallholders to participate in higher-value chains is contract farming. This consists in 
smallholders being provided with credit, inputs, and technical assistance by a buyer who 
typically commits to buy predefined volumes at certain prices, thus ensuring that the 
producer will have a market and that the investments will pay back.51 
</p>
<p>44. Ideally, contract farming should benefit both sides, improving the ability of farmers 
to modernize and increase their production, and guaranteeing a stable supply to the buyer. 
However, since the farmer in many cases has very few alternatives to choose from, it is 
particularly important to ensure that such contracts do not lead to inequitable outcomes.52 
This risk is present when farmers have no access to credit or to technical advice, as a result 
of the failure of public policies to provide them with the kind of support they require. 
Abuses have been documented, for instance, whereby the buyer provided loans to the 
supplier that the latter was unable to repay, or sold inputs above market prices because of 
his dominant position. 
</p>
<p>45. At a minimum, contract farming arrangements should not result in a 
disproportionate proportion of the value going to the buyer, and all the risks linked to 
production (as a result of weather-related events or pests, or due to changes in consumer 
preferences) being shifted to the producer. Model contracts should serve as a basis for the 
negotiation of specific arrangements. They should include: (a) the setting of prices at 
predefined levels that shield the producer from variations in market prices; (b) where the 
inputs are paid for by the producer, an adaptation of the prices paid to the producer to take 
into account any increases in the cost of inputs; (c) the guarantee of at least a minimum 
income calculated on the basis of the expected output; and (d) appropriate redress 
mechanisms, including automatic penalties, if the buyer fails to comply with its obligations. 
This would shift the risk onto the buyer, but reinsurance mechanisms should be made 
available to the buyer in order to make such forms of contract farming sustainable in the 
long term.

<p><b> 3. Fair trade 
</b></p>
<p>46. A still small but growing segment of the market functions according to the 
principles of &#8220;fair trade&#8221;. This segment accounted for around US$ 5.88 billion in worldwide 
sales by the end of 2008, and its increase over the years has been spectacular. Although it 
still represents less than 1 per cent of total trade53 and remains centred on coffee, bananas,

<p>cocoa, tea, sugar, and other fruits and juices, it covers an increasingly large number of 
commodities and mechanisms.54 Where it has been introduced, fair trade has brought 
significant improvements to the farmers benefiting from the scheme.55 In contrast to other 
certification schemes, such as SA8000, the Rainforest Alliance or UTZ, fair trade (as 
defined in the Charter of Fair Trade Principles)56 not only ensures that environmental and 
social conditions are complied with in the supply chain: in addition, it guarantees a floor 
price to the producer that may be significantly above the conventional world market price. 
The minimum price is calculated to be sufficient to cover the costs of sustainable 
production and living. Fair trade contracts are long-term, allowing planning and sustainable 
production practices.57 
</p>
<p>47. The fair trade movement now faces three main challenges. First, the proliferation of 
labels related to environmental and/or social &#8220;sustainable&#8221; practices has created confusion 
among consumers, who may not always be well-informed about the specificity of fair 
trade.58 The Special Rapporteur identifies signs of a &#8220;Gresham&#8217;s law&#8221; at work in this area: 
among the vast array of schemes boasting sustainability in supply chains, the less effective 
labels &#8212; those which offer the fewest benefits to producers while reassuring the consumer 
at the supplier&#8217;s expense &#8212; may be crowding out the best ones. Second, the supply of fair 
trade goods outstrips consumer demand.59 Accordingly, while fair trade bodies may 
guarantee a minimum price for the produce that is sold, they cannot guarantee that the 
produce will in fact be sold. This leads to concerns that buyers may choose among their 
suppliers, generally preferring those with whom they have an established relationship, with 
potential new entrants facing insuperable obstacles. Third, fair trade schemes may lock 
producers into a dependent relationship where they provide raw materials, instead of being 
provided with the tools to progressively diversify, process, package and directly market 
their products, thereby capturing more of the total value created along the chain. 
</p>
<p>48. Both retailers and governments should do more to promote fair trade and find, in 
negotiation with smallholders, ways to overcome the challenges identified above. States 
should clarify the legal meaning of fair trade and prohibit any abuse of the label. The 
existing confusion among consumers surrounding the various certification schemes should 
be dispelled by information campaigns which highlight the respective merits of the 
different schemes. States could also develop incentives to encourage demand, such as the 
lowering of import tariffs on products that are fair trade certified, and they could support

 Although the mandate of fair trade was initially focused on disadvantaged small producers, it has now 
</p>
<p>moved also to protect labourers on large-scale plantations, leading to the inclusion of new 
certification criteria such as democratic worker representation and good labour conditions. 
Nevertheless, consistent with the historical origins of fair trade, it is examined in this report in the 
section dedicated to smallholders.

<p>the creation of national fair trade networks or organizations in order to ensure they can 
seize national and international opportunities. Finally, public bodies at all levels in both 
developed and developing countries could consider favouring fair trade products in their 
public procurement schemes. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Remedies 
</b></p>
<p>49. Both agribusiness corporations and States must be aware that, in the absence of 
appropriate grievance mechanisms or remedies, the above measures may remain 
ineffective. For instance, States should ensure that, if they prohibit certain unfair buyer 
practices, the suppliers that are victims of such practices will be able to complain without 
fear of reprisals. Since fears of delisting have sometimes led suppliers to abstain from 
complaining, the establishment of an ombudsman to monitor the policies and practices of 
buyers may need to be considered by States. If marketing boards are set up offering to buy 
at certain prices from small farmers, the fixing of the prices and the selection among 
potential beneficiaries should be defined transparently by objective criteria, and those who 
cannot sell their crops should have the possibility of complaining. If public bodies include 
technical specifications in public procurement schemes that prioritize smallholders or fair 
trade, a failure to implement such specifications could lead to the award of a public contract 
being annulled. 
</p>
<p>50. Buyers too, whether they are wholesalers or retailers, should ensure that mechanisms 
are in place ensuring that their relationships with suppliers will be transparent and thus 
promote trust. In contract farming, the obligations of the buyer should be clearly stipulated, 
and predefined sanctions applied in cases of violation, to reduce uncertainty. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>The Special Rapporteur makes the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>States should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Improve the protection of agricultural workers by (a) ratifying all ILO 
conventions relevant for the agrifood sector, including Convention No. 99 (1851) on 
Minimum Wage Fixing Machinery in Agriculture; Convention No. 129 (1969) on 
Labour Inspection in Agriculture; Convention 184 (2001) on Safety and Health in 
Agriculture; Convention No. 110 (1958) on Conditions of Employment of Plantation 
Workers; and Convention 141 (1975) on Organisations of Rural Workers and Their 
Role in Economic and Social Development; and (b) ensuring that their legislation sets 
a minimum wage corresponding at least to a &#8220;living wage&#8221; as required by 
international human rights standards and defined according to the criteria identified 
in this report; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Monitor compliance with labour legislation by (a) devoting appropriate 
resources for an effective functioning of labour inspectorates in agriculture, in order 
to genuinely meet the requirements of the ILO Labour Inspection Convention; and (b) 
taking the requisite measures, legislative or otherwise, to reduce to the fullest extent 
possible the number of workers outside the formal economy to ensure that 
agricultural workers are progressively protected by the same social security schemes 
applicable to other industries. Among others, this should include the establishment of 
a scheme making the registration of agricultural workers compulsory and, to combat 
the circumvention of legal requirements by outsourcing, at a minimum by the 
compulsory registration of labour providers; </b></p>


<p><b>20</b> GE.09-17776 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Proactively engage in public policies aimed at expanding the choices of 
smallholders to sell their products on local or global markets at a decent price by (a) 
strengthening local and national markets and supporting continued diversification of 
channels of trading and distribution; (b) supporting the establishment of farmers&#8217; 
cooperatives and other producer organizations; (c) establishing or defending flexible 
and efficient producer marketing boards under government authority but with the 
strong participation of producers in their governance; (d) using their public 
procurement systems to support small farmers; and (e) promoting and scaling up fair 
trade systems; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Reinforce the bargaining power of smallholders and equalize their 
relationships with the agribusiness sector by (a) prohibiting practices that constitute 
an undue exercise of buyer power; and (b) combating excessive concentration in the 
food chain, or abuses of dominant positions acquired by certain actors. This requires 
having in place competition regimes sensitive to excessive buyer power in the agrifood 
sector, and devising competition authorities with mechanisms that allow for affected 
suppliers to bring complaints without fear of reprisal by dominant buyers; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Re-engage in public regulation of global food chains by (a) guaranteeing 
that the standards developed by the private sector do not have unintended negative 
side effects on the realization of the right to food; (b) considering the potential of, and 
strengthening, alternative decentralized certifying schemes, such as those qualifying 
products relative to specific cultural/geographical regions; and (c) engaging more 
broadly in the development of standards through international cooperation. 
</b></p>
<p>53.<b> Private actors of the agribusiness sector should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Refrain from practices that constitute an undue exercise of buyer power, 
as identified by the States in which they operate; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) In their relationships with workers, use their influence on suppliers to 
ensure that wages and working conditions improve, rather than degrade, as a result of 
their suppliers joining global value chains, by (a) seeking to conclude international 
framework agreements with global unions, guided by the principles stated in this 
report; (b) considering unilateral undertakings to monitor compliance with ILO 
standards in the supply chain, while supporting their suppliers in achieving 
compliance; and (c) engaging in chain-wide learning to assure that participation in the 
chain is profitable for all involved, including small-scale producers; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) In their relationships with smallholders: 
 (i) Involve smallholders in the elaboration of and compliance with food 
</b></p>
<p><b>safety, labour or environmental standards and facilitate their access to global 
supply chains; at a minimum, ensure that the imposition of private standards 
does not exclude smallholders from certified food chains (by assessing the 
impact of private standards on the right to food); 
</b></p>
<p><b> (ii) Negotiate contract farming arrangements that respect the right to food 
of smallholders and the criteria outlined in this report; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (iii) Promote fair trade through increased shelf space and by running 
information campaigns highlighting the unique importance and contribution of 
fair trade.
