<p><b>  Note by the Secretariat

<p>1. In its resolution 10/2 entitled &#8220;Human rights in the administration of justice, in 
particular juvenile justice&#8221;, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General to 
submit a report to the Council at its thirteenth session on the latest developments, 
challenges and good practices in human rights in the administration of justice, including 
juvenile justice and conditions for women and children in detention, as well as in the 
activities undertaken by the United Nations system as a whole. In the same resolution the 
Council also requested the High Commissioner to report to it at its thirteenth session on the 
implementation of this resolution.  
</p>
<p>2. The last report on this subject was submitted by the Secretary-General to the 
Commission on Human Rights at its sixtieth session in 2004 (E/CN.4/2004/51) pursuant to 
Commission resolution 2002/47. Therefore, the consideration of the reports requested in 
Council resolution 10/2 presents the first opportunity for the Council to address the issue of 
human rights in the administration of justice, including juvenile justice, in a comprehensive 
manner. The Secretary-General will submit his report to the Council at its fourteenth 
session in order to allow for the conclusion of a comprehensive survey of the developments 
and good practices that have emerged over the past six years. Similarly, the High 
Commissioner will submit her report also to the fourteenth session of the Council in order 
to allow the Council to consider her report together with the above-mentioned report of the 
Secretary-General.
