<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report presents the findings and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment on his mission to 
Denmark which took place from 2 to 9 May 2008. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur paid tribute to Denmark&#8217;s long-standing leadership in anti-torture 
efforts worldwide, including within the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly, as 
well as within the European Union. Moreover, he noted the country&#8217;s long history of generous 
support to civil society both at home and abroad, particularly in the area of rehabilitation for 
victims of torture. A significant focus of the mission was visiting places where persons are 
deprived of their liberty, such as police stations, prisons, psychiatric institutions, and detention 
centres for asylum-seekers. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur reports that no allegations of torture and very few complaints of 
ill-treatment from detainees were received. Nevertheless he strongly cautioned against 
complacency, encouraged the Government to ensure that all allegations and suspicions of torture 
and ill-treatment are meticulously investigated, and that perpetrators are appropriately punished. 
Noting recent legislative initiatives to add torture as an aggravating circumstance of various 
criminal offences, which is not subject to the statute of limitations, the Special Rapporteur 
regretted that a specific crime of torture is still missing in Danish criminal law. 
</p>
<p> The hallmark of the prison system in Denmark, the Special Rapporteur observed, is the 
&#8220;principle of normalization&#8221;, meaning that life behind bars reflects life outside to as great an 
extent as possible. Taken together with an attentive approach to the concerns of detainees by 
prison staff, the result is generally a high standard of conditions of detention inside Danish 
prisons, both in terms of infrastructure and day-to-day living standards. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur noted that in Denmark and Greenland a significant proportion of prisons are 
open institutions. He noted initiatives to accommodate the special needs of children of 
imprisoned parents through establishing, for example, child-friendly visiting rooms in prisons, as 
well as initiatives to consider the impact on children of a parent being taken into custody. The 
Special Rapporteur also noted the mixing of male and female prisoners. While the positive 
effects of such arrangements have long been accepted in Danish society, in light of international 
standards which advocate segregation of the sexes, concern must be expressed for the need to 
rigorously ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur commended the efforts of the Government in carrying out 
successful awareness-raising campaigns on domestic violence and trafficking of women, which 
have contributed to the reduction of gender-specific violence, including through successive plans 
of action. Concerning trafficking, the Special Rapporteur considered that the efforts of the 
Government are aimed less at the rehabilitation of victims of trafficking in Denmark than on 
their prepared return to their countries of origin. In Greenland, it is a serious concern that action 
against domestic violence has so far not received adequate attention, despite the severity of the 
problem. 
</p>
<p> Notwithstanding the Government&#8217;s efforts to restrict the use of solitary confinement, the 
extensive recourse to this remains a major concern, particularly with respect to pretrial detainees. 
Solitary confinement has a clearly documented negative impact on mental health, and therefore </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/44/Add.2 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p>should be used only in exceptional circumstances or when absolutely necessary for criminal 
investigation purposes. In all cases, solitary confinement should be used for the shortest period 
of time. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the establishment of an inter-ministerial working 
group to investigate alleged Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) rendition flights operating 
through Denmark and Greenland, and strongly encouraged the inclusion of independent experts 
and civil society in a fully transparent process. The Special Rapporteur expressed concerned 
about recent plans to employ diplomatic assurances to return suspected terrorists to countries 
known for their practice of torture. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur was invited by the Government of Denmark to undertake a visit to 
the country. He conducted his mission to Denmark, including the self-governing province of 
Greenland, from 2 to 9 May 2008.<b>1</b> Due to time constraints he did not pay a visit to the other 
self-governing province of the Faroe Islands. The purpose of the visit was to assess the situation 
of torture and ill-treatment, including conditions of detention; and intensify cooperation with the 
Government in the fight against torture. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur expresses deep appreciation to the Government, not only for 
its full cooperation, but also for the spirit in which it was extended. He is grateful for the 
detailed information provided in writing and the complete freedom of inquiry he enjoyed 
(i.e. unannounced and unimpeded access to any place of detention that he chose to visit, 
private interviews with detainees and staff, and access to documentation). 
</p>
<p>3. In Denmark, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with government officials, including 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Justice, and senior representatives of the 
Ministries of Justice (including the Director-General of the Prison and Probation Service, the 
Deputy-Director of Public Prosecutions, the Deputy Assistant National Commissioner of Police), 
Integration, Health, Defence, Welfare and Gender Equality, as well as representatives from the 
Faroe Islands. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur met with the Parliamentary Ombudsman, and 
members of parliament, the Danish Institute for Human Rights, the International Rehabilitation 
Council for Torture Victims (IRCT), a broad range of civil society organizations, and 
representatives of international organizations. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur visited Police Headquarters Prison, Copenhagen, Herstedvester 
Prison, Vridsl&#248;selille State Prison, Ellebaek Closed Detention Centre for Foreigners and Vestre 
Prison. 
</p>
<p>5. In Greenland, the Special Rapporteur met with the Permanent Secretary of the Home Rule 
Government, the Chief Constable, the Head of the Prison and Probation Directorate, and 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and visited Nuuk police station, Nuuk Prison, and the 
psychiatric ward in Queen Ingrid&#8217;s Hospital. 
</p>
<p>6. At the outset, the Special Rapporteur must draw attention to Denmark&#8217;s long-standing 
leadership in anti-torture efforts worldwide. At the international level, Denmark plays a central 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Since 1979 Greenland has been a self-governing province of Denmark. According to the 
</p>
<p>Greenland Home Rule Act, home rule authorities consist of a Landsting (Assembly) and an 
administration headed by a Landsstyre (Executive). The Greenlandic authorities are bound by 
obligations under international treaties of which Denmark is a State party. In practice, the 
Greenland Landsting administers almost all legislative matters. Greenland is a separate police 
district subordinate to the Danish National Commissioner of Police. The enforcement authority is 
the Prison and Probation Service in Greenland which reports to the Minister of Justice and to the 
Danish Department of Prisons and Probation. The Chief Constable being the Chief Prosecutor, 
prosecutions are under the Danish Director of Public Prosecutions (Rigsadvokaten). </p>

</p>
<p>role in mobilizing the international community by proposing resolutions on combating torture at 
the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly every year. Within the European Union, 
Denmark leads the efforts to implement the European Union (EU) foreign policy guidelines on 
torture in third countries. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur shared his preliminary findings with the Government at the close 
of his mission, to which the Government responded with constructive comments and additional 
written information. On 1 October 2008, a preliminary version of this report was sent to the 
Government. On 8 December 2008, the Government provided detailed comments which have 
been included in this report. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur wishes to acknowledge with appreciation the support provided by 
the Director of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Nordic Office and his staff 
in the United Nations Country Team; the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR); Dr. Jonathan Beynon, consultant medical expert; and 
Ms. Isabelle Tschan of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Human Rights in Vienna. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International level 
</b></p>
<p>9. Denmark is party to all major United Nations human rights treaties including the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
(the Convention against Torture) and its Optional Protocol. Furthermore, Denmark has 
recognized the competence of the Committee against Torture to receive and consider 
communications from or on behalf of individuals subject to its jurisdiction under article 22 of the 
Convention against Torture, and the competence of the Committee to receive inter-State 
complaints regarding Denmark under article 21 of the Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Regional level 
</b></p>
<p>10. As a member of the Council of Europe, Denmark is party to all relevant regional 
conventions including the European Convention on Human Rights and all additional Protocols, 
the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, and the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human 
Beings. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  National level 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Constitutional and legislative provisions criminalizing torture 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Constitution provides for a large set of human rights and fundamental freedoms. There 
is no specific provision concerning the prohibition of torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment and punishment. 
</p>
<p>12. The Criminal Code does not contain any express provision prohibiting torture, but acts 
amounting to torture are punishable under the Code&#8217;s provisions on assault (sects. 244-246), on 
placing another person in a helpless position (sect. 250), on causing danger intentionally 
(sect. 252), on unlawful coercion/duress (sect. 260), on unlawful deprivation of liberty </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/44/Add.2 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>(sect. 261), on threats to commit an unlawful act (sect. 266) and on crimes committed on public 
duty (chap. 16) carrying maximum penalties of 10 years. Section 8 (5) of the Code provides for 
universal jurisdiction over crimes covered by an international convention to which Denmark is a 
State party.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>13. Despite the absence of a specific provision, there have been moves by the Ministry of 
Justice and the legislature towards tightening the legal framework in relation to torture.<b>3</b> 
However, instead of making torture a specific offence, as envisaged by article 4 of the 
Convention against Torture, the newly introduced section 157 A only refers to torture as 
aggravating circumstance in relation to existing crimes and increases the maximum penalties for 
such acts: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(1) In the determination of a penalty for violation of this Act it shall be considered an 
aggravating circumstance that the violation has been committed by torture. 
</p>
<p> (2) A violation of this Act shall be considered to have been committed by torture if it 
was committed in the performance of Danish, foreign or international public service or 
duty by inflicting harm on the body or health of another or causing severe physical or 
mental pain or suffering to another 
</p>
<p> (1) For the purpose of obtaining information or a confession from another, 
</p>
<p> (2) For the purpose of punishing or frightening another or forcing another to do, 
suffer or omit an act or 
</p>
<p> (3) Due to the subject&#8217;s political belief, gender, race, skin colour, national or ethnic 
origin, religious belief or sexual inclination.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> In the situations enumerated above the statute of limitations has been abrogated.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>14. The Government is of the opinion that section 157 (a) of the Criminal Code serves the 
purpose of a provision criminalizing torture since it reflects the seriousness of torture and allows 
for keeping a record of crimes of torture. According to the former Minister of Justice, even 
without an express provision prohibiting torture, acts of torture are effectively criminalized and 
appropriate penalties are prescribed commensurate with their gravity.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  See also the Military Penal Code, where military personnel suspected of having committed 
</p>
<p>acts of torture and CIDT could be charged under section 27 for neglect of duties in military 
service, or under sect. 36 (2) for acts contrary to applicable international law.<i>

</b>  Act No. 316 of 30 April 2008, sect. 93 B. When a criminal offence is covered by sect. 157 A 
</p>
<p>of this Act, it shall not be subjected to the rules of limitation.<i>

</p>
<p>15. However, the Special Rapporteur considers that the absence of a specific crime of torture 
and mere characterization of acts amounting to torture as aggravating circumstances of other 
offences do not afford torture - among the most fundamental violations of human rights which 
Denmark has globally championed to combat - the weight and gravity that it deserves. Moreover, 
since torture is not included as a specific crime in the Danish Criminal Code, but only as an 
aggravated circumstance of a serious or repeated breach of duty or carelessness in public service, 
the application of the universal jurisdiction clause for acts of torture might be hampered. 
</p><p>16. In Greenland, the Criminal Code contains neither a definition nor an explicit prohibition of 
torture. A person can be sentenced to an indeterminate period of detention in case of aggravated 
offences such as homicide, robbery, aggravated violence, rape or other aggravated sexual 
offences. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Safeguards against torture and ill-treatment during arrest and detention 
</b></p>
<p>17. In general, the Special Rapporteur is highly satisfied with the legal framework providing 
for procedural safeguards against torture and ill-treatment during arrest and detention,<b>6</b> above all 
the short maximum period of police custody of 24 hours after which a detainee must be brought 
before a judge.<b>7</b> 
18. He notes that upon arrest a medical examination depends upon the request of the arrested 
person or the police deeming an examination to be necessary.<b>8</b> However, it seems that little or no 
information on exercising this right is provided to the arrested persons, although, according to 
the Government, upon arrest detainees receive a form which explains their right to contact and to 
be examined by an independent doctor.<b>9</b> The form also requests detainees to inform the police of 
any disease requiring treatment. A general medical screening is not required upon the prisoner&#8217;s 
arrival at the prison. However, according to the Government, the executive order on health care 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  For example, provisions concerning arrest (Administration of Justice Act, sects. 730, 755 (4), 
</p>
<p>758, and 821); use of force by police (Police Act No. 444 of 09/06/2004); safeguards for remand 
prisoners (Administration of Justice Act, sects. 764 (1), 767 (1), and 768); safeguards for 
convicted prisoners (Execution of Sentences Consolidation Act No. 1337 of 03/12/2007, sects. 4, 
24, 31 (1), 43, 51 (1)-(2), and 53 (1)); and coercive measures against prisoners, such as searches 
(Execution of Sentences Consolidation Act, sects. 60 and 61), and use of force (sect. 62 (1)). 
Prisoners who are fixated shall be under permanent supervision, and a doctor shall see to the 
fixated prisoner, unless the doctor deems this clearly unnecessary (sects. 65 and 66).<i>

</p>
<p>for inmates in the institutions of the Prison and Probation Service prescribes that all new 
prisoners be offered (orally) a consultation with the nurse or doctor of the institution and 
consequently, in practice, prisoners might have a brief interview with medical staff. 
</p>
<p>19. The Administration of Justice Act of Greenland provides only a limited number of 
safeguards. Safeguards are also contained in Chief Constable of Greenland order No. 1 of 
2 May 2008 on confinement in prison and detention cells, which lays down rules relating to 
order and security, to the tasks of staff and to the rights and duties of detainees. Further, the order 
regulates searches and the locking of cells, provides for measures to be taken in case of illness 
and prescribes that complaints regarding treatment in detention can be made in writing to the 
Chief Constable, or to the competent district judge. The regulation on institutional stay in 
Greenland (see section 48) also outlines rules regarding conditions for detainees in police 
detention.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Complaints and investigations of acts of torture 
</b></p>
<p>20. The body of rules concerning complaints against the police is to be found in the 
Administration of Justice Act, sections 93b-93d.<b>11</b> Complaints against police conduct 
(e.g. violence and heavy-handed treatment in connection with arrest, etc.) or criminal offences 
(e.g. violations of provisions cited in paragraph 14 above) are filed with the regional public 
prosecutors, who examine the complaints, investigate them and decide on whether to proceed 
with prosecutions. Where a person has died or has been seriously injured as a consequence of 
police action, the prosecutor initiates the investigation ex officio. The regional public prosecutor 
notifies the complaint to the regional police complaints board (PCB), which is a panel comprised 
of a lawyer and two lay persons, appointed to monitor the regional public prosecutor&#8217;s 
processing of the complaint. The PCB has no investigatory power, but may indicate to the 
regional public prosecutor its opinion on how to proceed with the complaint. Appeals against the 
decisions of the regional public prosecutors can be made to the Director of Public Prosecutions 
(Rigsadvokaten). Annual reports to parliament and the Ministry of Justice, which are publicly 
available, aim to increase the transparency of the activities, initiatives, challenges of the 
complaint system, as well as to highlight selected cases. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur notes that, according to information provided by the Government, 
in the period 2004 to 2007 criminal charges against police personnel in relation to assault 
(sects. 244-246), or causing danger intentionally (sect. 252) were brought by the regional public 
prosecutor in about one or two cases per year. In this period all such cases resulted either in the 
acquittal of the police personnel or in convictions without penalties. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  A new Administration of Justice Act and Criminal Law for Greenland containing more 
</p>
<p>detailed safeguards has been adopted and will enter into force in January 2010. 
<b>11
</b></p>

Denmark</i>, 2002. See also overview in CAT/C/34/Add.3, paras. 84-86. </p>

</p>
<p>22. In Denmark it is the Ministry of Justice which has authority over the police, the 
Prosecution Service and the Prison and Probation Service.<b>12</b> This has been one of the key 
grounds for criticism levelled at the current complaints system, in combination with the potential 
for conflict of interest. For example, concern has been expressed that the independence of 
investigations of acts by police personnel might be compromised in light of the customary close 
collaboration between prosecutors and the police in fighting crime. Criticism has also been 
voiced as to the efficiency in handling cases in a timely manner. The Special Rapporteur notes 
that the Ministry of Justice established a committee to review the system of complaints in 
October 2006. 
</p>
<p>23. The Police Complaints Board for Greenland<b>13</b> can receive complaints regarding police 
conduct and criminal proceedings brought against police officers and request and advise the 
Chief Constable to investigate the cases. In addition, the Chief Constable can initiate 
investigations <i>proprio motu</i> on the basis of a reasonable presumption that a police officer has 
committed a criminal act while on duty. He is obliged to carry out an investigation when a 
person has been seriously injured or has died as a result of police intervention. The PCB can take 
disputes which arise with the Chief Constable, including disputes over his decisions on 
complaints, to the Director of Public Prosecutions. According to the Government, out of 
12 criminal indictments brought against police personnel in the period 2004-2007, 3 resulted in 
convictions in relation to ill-treatment and/or sexual abuse and 1 in relation to a lack of 
observation of a detainee who committed suicide. The corresponding penalties ranged from fines 
up to six months&#8217; imprisonment. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Parliamentary Ombudsman/national preventive mechanism 
</b></p>
<p>24. The parliamentary Ombudsman is inter alia mandated to inspect institutions where persons 
are deprived of their liberty and to handle prisoner complaints.<b>14</b> However, in general, since there 
is an established complaints mechanism to deal with police conduct and criminal offences, the 
Ombudsman typically refers related complaints to this mechanism. 
</p>
<p>25. In October 2007, as required by the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, 
the parliamentary Ombudsman was designated as the national body responsible for monitoring 
all places of deprivation of liberty in Denmark, the national preventive mechanism (NPM). 
Given that inspecting places where persons are deprived of their liberty is one of the core 
activities of the Ombudsman, this designation was not surprising. However, some observers 
pointed out that, although the institution of the Ombudsman carries out inspections regularly, it 
is presently unable to carry out visits systematically as envisaged by the Optional Protocol. 
Apart from the fact that a significant increase in resources, including staffing (e.g. health

<p>professionals), would be needed, it has been argued that the designation as NPM would 
transform the character and functioning of the current institution of parliamentary Ombudsman 
into a more inspection-focused body, which may require legislative amendments. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Rehabilitation of torture victims 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur notes that Denmark is playing a leading role in the area of 
rehabilitation for victims of torture. In Copenhagen, it hosts the International Rehabilitation 
Council for Torture Victims (IRCT), which is a pioneering institution in this field. The 
nationally-focused Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims (RCT) was 
established in 1982. Up to 2005 the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs financed the 
rehabilitation of torture victims. Since 2006, the costs for the rehabilitation of torture victims by 
RCT in Denmark have been covered by the Danish health-care system. Denmark has a &#8220;free 
choice hospital act&#8221;, which allows patients to choose the hospital or institution at which they 
wish to receive their treatment. The act refers to RCT and several other Danish rehabilitation 
centres for torture victims. Thus, the rehabilitation of torture victims is integrated into the public 
health system, and torture victims receive treatment at specialized rehabilitation centres free of 
charge. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE SITUATION OF TORTURE AND ILL-TREATMENT 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize with satisfaction that he did not receive any 
allegations of torture prior to or during his visit to Denmark. Also, he received only very few 
complaints of ill-treatment of detainees during the visit (see paras. 7, 26 and 33 of the appendix). 
</p>
<p>28. In these cases, the Special Rapporteur appealed to the authorities to ensure that the 
allegations were effectively addressed and wishes to express his gratitude for the thorough 
responses he received (reflected in paras. 8, 27 and 34 of the appendix). The Special Rapporteur 
encourages the Government to continue to ensure that all allegations of torture and ill-treatment 
are meticulously investigated and perpetrators are appropriately punished, in a manner that 
ensures public confidence in the system. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONDITIONS OF DETENTION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Principle of normalization 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur was impressed with the conditions of detention in the eight 
facilities he visited in Denmark and Greenland. The hallmark of the prison system in Denmark is 
the &#8220;principle of normalization&#8221;,<b>15</b> meaning that life behind bars shall reflect to as great an extent 
as possible life on the other side. Taken together with an attentive approach to the concerns of 
detainees by prison staff, the outcome is a prison system that stands apart from others. The result 
is generally a high standard of conditions of detention inside Danish prisons, both in terms of 
infrastructure and day-to-day living standards. Prisoners are accommodated in single cells which

</p>
<p>they can arrange as they like, thus granting each prisoner privacy and autonomy to the extent 
possible. The facilities are kept clean and decorated and prisons are equipped with libraries, 
computers and sports gear. 
</p>
<p>30. Furthermore, in accordance with the principle of exercising responsibility, a variety of 
activities in workshops are offered to prisoners, and most detainees are on self-cooking regime. 
Additionally, in line with the principle of openness, inmates have numerous opportunities to 
make and maintain contacts outside prisons, including through very liberal visiting policies. 
</p>
<p>31. One particularly impressive area which the Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight are the 
Government&#8217;s efforts, together with civil society, to aid and encourage contact between prisoners 
and their children by establishing a child-friendly environment within detention facilities.<b>16</b> He 
notes that children of convicted prisoners up to 3 may live with their mother or father in prison, 
provided that he or she is capable of taking care of the child (e.g. Horser&#248;d State Prison).<b>17</b> 
Engelsborg Prison has a family house with five flats where inmates may stay together with their 
partner and children of up to 15 years of age. 
</p>
<p>32. With regard to child visitors, in 2004 the Department of Prisons and Probation set out 
minimum standards for visiting facilities: they must appear light and friendly, be nicely 
decorated, and have a suitable selection of toys to stimulate contact between prisoners and their 
children. Some prisons are equipped with play areas and family rooms where visiting families 
may stay overnight. East Jutland State Prison offers two visiting flats where inmates may receive 
family visits for up to 48 hours. In many prisons visiting children are allowed to move about in 
the entire prison area, so that prisoners may take them to sports facilities and play and cooking 
areas. In the opinion of the Special Rapporteur, the refurbishment of the children&#8217;s visiting area 
of Vridsl&#248;selille State Prison stands out as an excellent example of how a child&#8217;s meeting with 
their incarcerated parent can be positively transformed in an inexpensive manner through the 
joint efforts of prison staff, prisoners and civil society. 
</p><p>33. Furthermore, with reference to the principle of normalization, a significant proportion of 
prisons are open or semi-open institutions. In Greenland, there is no closed prison, which reflects 
the culture of Greenlandic society. Prisons are also characterized by the fact that male and female 
prisoners are not separated (see chapter IV below), and male and female staff can work together 
in male and female sections. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur commends the excellent conditions of detention and psychological 
treatment provided to detainees with special needs, including sexual offenders in Herstedvester 
Institution. He was also informed of the libido-suppressing treatment for sexual offenders 
(&#8220;medical castration&#8221;). He notes that such therapies allow sexual offenders to be released and 
lead a life outside prison. Whereas extensive consultation and preparation seems to be 
undertaken prior to such treatment and the principle of informed consent appears to be respected, 
the Special Rapporteur learned that often the detainee&#8217;s consent is motivated by the fact that he 
</p>

</p>
<p>otherwise cannot obtain permission for leave or release on parole/conditional discharge. The 
Special Rapporteur considers that such treatment should only be used as a last resort where other 
therapies have failed to help the detainee.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>35. Since no closed prisons presently exist in Greenland, Greenlanders convicted of serious 
offences or committed to psychiatric institutions must serve their sentence in Denmark, mostly in 
Herstedvester Institution. On the positive side, the Prison and Probation Service has taken steps 
to improve the conditions for Greenlanders in Herstedvester Institution by ensuring that staff 
from Greenland who speak the same language and understand the culture are rotated through the 
unit. In this context, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the decision by the Government and 
Greenlandic authorities to build a new closed prison in Greenland in order to avoid Greenlanders 
having to serve their sentence a long way from home and relatives. The Special Rapporteur 
encourages the Greenlandic authorities to ensure that Greenlandic detainees with special needs 
get equally professional treatment in the new prison in Greenland as they receive in 
Herstedvester Institution. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur notes that, as a matter of policy, gang members are strictly 
separated from other detainees, mostly in special prison wings. While he fully understands the 
Government&#8217;s argument that placing gang members in special units is necessary to maintain 
reasonable conditions, including safety for other inmates, the Special Rapporteur is of the 
opinion that a total separation of convicted gang members as a rule might run against the 
principle of normalization. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Solitary confinement 
</b></p>
<p>37. The practice of solitary confinement has a long tradition in Denmark. Solitary confinement 
of remand prisoners on the basis of a court decision is used to isolate suspects during criminal 
investigations in pretrial detention, whereas administrative solitary confinement (reduced<b>19</b> or 
total exclusion from association with other detainees) may be imposed on remand and convicted 
prisoners on the basis of an administrative decision by the prison authorities as a punishment for 
disciplinary infractions. 
</p>
<p>38. At the request of the police, under the Administration of Justice Act, the court can decide 
that a detainee be remanded in solitary confinement for investigative purposes for a maximum 
period of up to eight weeks. In exceptional circumstances, this period may be extended at the 
request of the prosecutor to six months or even longer.<b>20</b> In this regard, the Government 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>18
</b>  According to the Government, the treatment is only offered as a last resort to persons who 
</p>
<p>have committed very serious sexual offences and are at risk of relapsing into the same type of 
offences and only with the agreement of the Medico-Legal Council. Only two to four prisoners 
per year commence such treatment. 
<b>19
</b></p>
<p>  Reduced exclusion from association with other detainees means that the detainee is allowed 
association with one or a few other fellow detainees. 
<b>20
</b></p>
<p>  See Act on the Administration of Justice, sects. 770 (b), (c), (d). Unless exceptional 
circumstances prevail, pretrial solitary confinement cannot: exceed &#61472;two weeks, where the person 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>emphasized that solitary confinement of remand prisoners based on a court decision is strictly 
restricted to situations where there are specific reasons to presume that the accused will impede 
the prosecution of the case, particularly by removing evidence or warning or influencing others. 
It further stated that the number of remand prisoners in solitary confinement on the basis of court 
decisions had dropped from 475 in 2006 to 273 in 2007. Also, the number of persons held for 
more than eight weeks in solitary confinement had dropped from 55 in 2006 to 19 in 2007.<b>21</b> 
Since the Greenlandic Administration of Justice Act contains no provisions according to which 
solitary confinement can be imposed following a court decision, the decision to exclude a 
prisoner from association with others is to be made after having presented the case to the legal 
staff of the Chief Constable&#8217;s office.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>39. Prisoners may be held in administrative solitary confinement on the basis of an 
administrative decision inter alia to prevent escape, criminal activities or violent behaviour. It 
shall be carried out as leniently as possible and shall cease as soon as the conditions for applying 
this measure no longer exist and must be reconsidered at least once a week by the prison 
authorities.<b>23</b> In case of exclusion from association for more than four weeks, the prison must 
report the case to the Department of Prisons and Probation, and submit a report every four 
weeks. Administrative solitary confinement in a disciplinary cell may be imposed for a 
maximum of four weeks on a convicted prisoner<b>24</b> and for a maximum of two weeks on a remand 
     
</p>
<p>is charged with a criminal offence punishable by less than four years&#8217; imprisonment; four weeks, 
where the person is charged with an offence punishable by more than four and less than six 
years&#8217; imprisonment; and eight weeks, where the person is charged with an offence punishable 
by six or more years&#8217; imprisonment. In exceptional circumstances, in cases where the person 
detained may, if convicted, be sentenced to more than two years of imprisonment, the period of 
solitary confinement may be extended at the request of the prosecutor, during the pretrial phases 
of the proceedings. In such cases, solitary confinement may not exceed six months, unless the 
person is charged with drug trafficking, homicide, a crime against the State or a terrorism 
offence under chapters 12 and 13 of the Criminal Code (sect. 770 (c) (4), Act on the 
Administration of Justice). Solitary confinement beyond eight weeks is subject to approval by 
the Director of Public Prosecution (sect. 770 (d) (3), Act on the Administration of Justice). 
Minors may only be held in solitary confinement if most exceptional circumstances make this 
necessary (sect. 770 (b) (2), Act on the Administration of Justice). The maximum length of 
solitary confinement without interruption is four weeks, unless the person is charged with an 
intentional violation of a provision of chapter 12 or 13 of the Criminal Code (crime against the 
State/terrorism). Solitary confinement of minors beyond four weeks is subject to approval by the 
Director of Public Prosecution (sect. 770 (d) (3), Act on the Administration of Justice).

<p>prisoner<b>25</b> as a disciplinary punishment. Similarly, a prisoner suspected of having breached rules 
which prima facie result in disciplinary cell punishment may be placed in an interrogation cell 
for at most five days.<b>26</b>  
</p>
<p>40. During the visit the Special Rapporteur came across a number of prisoners that were held 
in solitary confinement, i.e. obliged to spend 22-23 hours per day in their cell (see appendix, 
paras. 6, 9, 10 and 15). No communication with other prisoners is permitted. Prisoners are 
allowed 30 minutes of outdoor exercise on their own, twice a day. Three meals a day are served 
inside the cell. 
</p>
<p>41. Whereas the Government stressed that solitary confinement of pretrial detainees may not 
be used as a means of coercion to extort a confession or information, the Special Rapporteur 
noted instances where pretrial detainees reported that the police used the threat of extending 
solitary confinement to coerce detainees to cooperate in an investigation (see e.g. appendix, 
paras. 8 and 9).<b>27</b> If prolonged solitary confinement is used for the purpose of extracting a 
confession, it may amount to torture. 
</p>
<p>42. In the face of significant evidence which points to the serious and adverse psychological 
effects of solitary confinement, especially on pretrial detainees, who are at increased risk of 
self-harm within the first two weeks of detention,<b>28</b> Denmark has come under sustained criticism 
for its extensive use of solitary confinement.

and 28 days; and 39 for more than 28 days. In the first six months of 2008, 300 prisoners were 
held in solitary confinement based on the orders of the prison authorities, of whom 152 up 
to 7 days; 74 between 8 and 14 days; 54 between 15 and 28 days; and 20 for more than 28 days.

28 January to 4 February 2002, CPT/Inf (2002) 18, para. 39: &#8220;many prisoners perceived solitary 
confinement and restrictions on contacts with the outside world as a means of pressure to make 
them confess; some prisoners alleged that the police had plainly stated that those measures 
would be eased or lifted if they cooperated. It would appear that it was not uncommon for 
confessions to be immediately followed by the discontinuation of such measures&#8221;.

</p>
<p>&#8220;[The] last thirty years has seen a certain response from the Danish authorities, and, 
compared to the original situation in the 1970s, a significant decline in the use of pretrial 
solitary confinement. But the Danish State has always been very reluctant to acknowledge 
any problems officially, and solitary confinement is still not used just in exceptional 
circumstances as recommended by the CPT (European Committee for the Prevention of 
Torture). Altogether one must conclude that Denmark&#8217;s willingness to uphold a practice 
which doctors and psychologists recommend abolishing and its reluctance to meet 
international recommendations reveal qualities which run counter to the Danish (and 
Scandinavian) self-image of humanitarian leniency and decency in all areas of State and 
society.&#8221;<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>43. According to rule 43.2 of the European Prison Rules, &#8220;the medical practitioner or a 
qualified nurse reporting to such a medical practitioner shall pay particular attention to the health 
of prisoners held under conditions of solitary confinement, shall visit such prisoners daily, and 
shall provide them with prompt medical assistance and treatment at the request of such prisoners 
or the prison staff&#8221;.<b>30</b> It is noteworthy to recall that when the European Prison Rules were 
adopted, &#8220;the Representative of Denmark reserved the right of his Government to comply or not 
with rule 43, paragraph 2 ... because it is of the opinion that the requirement that prisoners held 
under solitary confinement be visited by medical staff on a daily basis raises serious ethical 
concerns regarding the possible role of such staff in effectively pronouncing prisoners fit for 
further solitary confinement&#8221;.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur, in a recent report (A/63/175, paras. 77-85), pointed out that he 
shares the concern of the Human Rights Committee, the Committee against Torture and the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child, which have recommended that the use of solitary 
confinement be minimized. Regarding Denmark, the Committee against Torture called on the 
Government to reduce the use of solitary confinement under strict supervision and with a 
possibility of judicial review, and recommended that Denmark should aim to abolish the 
practice, particularly during pretrial detention.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur, echoing the findings of the Council of Europe&#8217;s Committee on the 
Prevention of Torture,<b>33</b> considers that the use of solitary confinement should be kept to a

<p>minimum; used in very exceptional cases, for as short a time as possible and only as a measure 
of last resort. Whereas solitary confinement for a maximum limit of just a few days may be 
necessary as a last resort for grievous breaches of prison discipline, its use in pretrial cases may 
amount to a form of coercion, and as such could constitute ill-treatment or torture. Furthermore, 
prisoners with known mental disorders are at increased risk of harm from solitary confinement 
and should never be held in these conditions. 
</p>
<p>46. Regardless of the specific circumstances of the use of solitary confinement, effort is 
required to raise the level of social contacts for prisoners: prisoner contact with prison staff, 
allowing access to social activities with other prisoners, allowing more visits, and providing 
access to mental health services. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Detention of foreigners and asylum-seekers 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur visited the Ellebaek closed detention centre for foreigners, a 
high-security facility for rejected or incoming asylum-seekers. He was encouraged by the low 
number of asylum-seekers held in detention,<b>34</b> and found the conditions to be satisfactory, but 
well below the high standards found in the Danish prison system in general.<b>35</b> The primary 
concern of the Special Rapporteur related to the detainees&#8217; perception of uncertainty as to how 
long they would remain in detention, since Danish legislation does not provide for a maximum 
period of deprivation of liberty. He was informed of cases where persons had been detained for 
18 months. In the opinion of the Special Rapporteur, deprivation of liberty for administrative 
reasons for a prolonged period without knowing the length of the detention may amount to 
inhuman and degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur notes that an alien must be brought before a court for it to rule on 
the lawfulness of deprivation of liberty (section 37 (1) of the Aliens Act). The court must fix a 
time limit for the detention, which it may extend repeatedly by four weeks each time. The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that such a mandatory habeas corpus procedure exists and 
that free legal aid is provided to all aliens in detention. However, according to information 
received, in the past five years, on only two occasions did the court not confirm the prolongation 
of detention when requested by the police. Furthermore the Special Rapporteur was informed 
that about 50 per cent of the inmates of Ellebaek accept an automatic prolongation of their 
detention by signing a document to that effect in advance.<b>36</b> To the Special Rapporteur, these are 
signs that de facto the procedure of legal challenge of deprivation of liberty under article 37 of 
the Aliens Act is not as effective as one might expect. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>34
</b>  Fifty-eight persons on the day of the visit of the Special Rapporteur. According to the 
</p>
<p>Government, on 1 November 2008, 41 asylum-seekers were held there, which indicates a further 
decrease. 
<b>35
</b></p>
<p>  See footnote 33 above, para. 85. 
<b>36
</b></p>
<p>  According to the Government, in cases where a person has accepted and signed the 
prolongation of the detention, this prolongation must always be approved by the court. </p>

<p><b>IV.  WOMEN 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Domestic violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>49. In light of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report to the Human Rights Council on using the 
anti-torture framework to strengthen the global campaign to end violence against women,<b>37</b> he is 
pleased to note that the attention to domestic violence by the Government of Denmark has begun 
to show positive effects as the number of cases reported seems to have decreased.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>50. A number of provisions in the Criminal Code are relevant in this regard: rape is 
criminalized under sections 216 and 217 of chapter 24 on sexual offences; section 237, on 
homicide; section 244, on less severe violence; section 245, on more severe violence; and 
section 246, on severe violence, generally with permanent injury of the victim. Under 
section 265 the police can issue a warning, prohibiting a person to intrude on, pursue in writing 
or otherwise molest a specific person, and often used in cases concerning harassment of a former 
partner or spouse. Disregarding such a warning, the person shall be liable to a fine of up to 
two years of imprisonment. Act No. 449 of 9 June 2004 (Act on Expulsion) establishes that the 
police under specific circumstances can expel a person from the home. The police can also 
prohibit the person in question to intrude on, pursue in writing or otherwise molest a member of 
the household, and likewise the person subject to the expulsion can be prohibited from staying 
within a determined distance from the home, workplace or educational institution of a member of 
the household. Further the police can lend assault alarms to women at risk of assault. 
</p>
<p>51. Denmark has made female genital mutilation a separate crime under section 245a of the 
Criminal Code, which is subject to a maximum penalty of a six-year prison term.<b>39</b> In the first 
case under the provision, the Special Rapporteur notes that in June 2008, a Danish couple of 
Sudanese origin were arrested on suspicion of having taken their two daughters to Sudan in 2003 
for circumcision.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur notes that a nationwide network consisting of free local and 
independent counselling services for victims has been established pursuant to Act No. 349 of 
23 May 1997 concerning the strengthening of the legal status of crime victims. The legal status 
of victims of crimes has also been strengthened as a result of Act No. 558 of 24 June 2005 and

<p>Act No. 517 of 6 June 2007. In 2000, the Director of Public Prosecutions issued a special 
directive concerning investigation in relationship matters to the effect that the police should carry 
out an ex officio criminal investigation, when it is obvious that one of the parties has been the 
victim of an assault. In 2008, the directive was replaced by a new one containing further 
instructions for investigations, as well as for the support given to victims. On 30 June 2006, the 
Director of Public Prosecutions issued a circular note entitled &#8220;Honour killing and other 
punishable offences related to culturally or religiously conditioned norms or conceptions of 
honour&#8221; and, on 22 January 2007, a &#8220;Strategy for the police effort in honour-related crimes&#8221;. 
Another strategy on, among other things, cooperation in the area of domestic violence cases, and 
establishment of special units within the police districts was developed by the National Police, 
together with the Prosecution Service, in 2007. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government&#8217;s efforts in carrying out successful 
awareness-raising campaigns on domestic violence, which have contributed to the reduction of 
gender-specific violence, including through successive plans of action. For example, the &#8220;Action 
plan to stop men&#8217;s domestic violence against women and children 2005-2008&#8221; aims to provide 
support to victims, treatment facilities for perpetrators, strengthen cooperation between 
government agencies and increase knowledge about the phenomenon of domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>54. In Greenland, the Special Rapporteur expressed serious concern in relation to the high 
incidence of assault and sexual offences against women. A study by the National Institute for 
Public Health showed that 60 per cent of women in Greenland aged 18 to 24 were victims of 
assaults or threats; a third of whom were victims of aggravated assaults.<b>41</b> Thirty-four per cent of 
these women were victims of sexual assaults; 12.5 per cent already when they were children. 
Among female victims, 58 per cent claimed that the offender was their husband or live-in 
partner. The Special Rapporteur regrets that action against domestic violence has so far not 
received adequate attention in Greenland despite the severity of the problem. In this regard, he 
welcomes information that the Home Rule Government has committed to elaborating a 
&#8220;National strategy for prevention of rape, sexual harassment and assaults&#8221;. Cooperation with 
authorities, such as the Department for Gender Equality and relevant organizations in Denmark, 
is encouraged. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s holistic approach towards addressing 
the problem of human trafficking, which includes coordination and cross-sectoral collaboration 
of various ministries and other partners.<b>42</b> The establishment of the Centre for Human 
Trafficking to coordinate action is one concrete example of the Government&#8217;s commitment in 
this regard. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur notes that the &#8220;Action Plan to Combat Trafficking 
in Human Beings 2007-2010&#8221;<b>43</b> builds upon the experience of earlier plans of action. He notes

</p>
<p>that the latter focuses on strengthening investigation efforts in order to identify and have the men 
responsible for trafficking brought to justice; supporting the victims by strengthening the social 
services in Denmark; prevention by limiting demand and enhancing the population&#8217;s awareness 
of trafficking; and improving international cooperation. 
</p>
<p>56. In addition to section 262a of the Criminal Code, which criminalizes trafficking in human 
beings, pursuant to the 2007-2010 plan of action, on 1 August 2007, an amendment to the 
Danish Aliens Act came into force to put into effect the ratification of the Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, supplementing the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Council of Europe 
Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. It provided for the so-called 
&#8220;assisted voluntary return programme&#8221;, which entails three key improvements over the existing 
regime on trafficking: an extended &#8220;reflexion period&#8221; lasting up to 100 days, up from 30 days, 
where victims can stay in Denmark provided they agree to be repatriated and cooperate in 
investigations; victims are offered a prepared repatriation, which includes legal and 
psychological assistance, health treatment and social-pedagogical support, and reception by a 
social organization or NGO in the country of origin; and victims will no longer be punished by 
expulsion. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the efforts of the Government in relation to the 
phenomenon of trafficking in persons are a significant improvement on what existed previously. 
However, despite greater attention to victims, in the opinion of the Special Rapporteur the efforts 
are not sufficiently victim-centred; the efforts appear to be aimed less at the rehabilitation of 
victims of trafficking in Denmark than at repatriating them to their countries of origin. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Non-separation of men and women in prisons 
</b></p>
<p>58. During his visits to detention facilities, the Special Rapporteur observed the practice of 
accommodating male and female detainees in the same premises, based on the principle of 
normalization. While in most places such arrangements were voluntary, this was not the case in 
Nuuk Prison in Greenland. As regards non-separation of men and women in places of detention, 
the Special Rapporteur recalls that international standards call for the segregation of men and 
women. In the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, rule 8 (a) provides: 
&#8220;The different categories of prisoners shall be kept in separate institutions or parts of institutions 
taking account of their sex, age, criminal record, the legal reason for their detention and the 
necessities of their treatment. Thus, men and women shall so far as possible be detained in 
separate institutions.&#8221;<b>44</b> Similarly, the European Prison Rules provide in rule 18.8 (b): &#8220;In 
deciding to accommodate prisoners in particular prisons or in particular sections of a prison due 
account shall be taken of the need to detain male prisoners separately from females.&#8221;<b>45</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>44
</b>  See also rule 53, paras. 1-3. 
</p>
<p><b>45
</b>  See footnote 30 above. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/44/Add.2 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>59. In accordance with these rules, on previous country visits he has called on States to 
rigorously observe them where he has found evidence of non-separation.<b>46</b> The Special 
Rapporteur notes that the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) has previously commented on the practice of 
non-separation in Denmark.<b>47</b> In more general terms, the CPT stated: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The duty of care which is owed by a State to persons deprived of their liberty 
includes the duty to protect them from others who may wish to cause them harm. The CPT 
has occasionally encountered allegations of woman upon woman abuse. However, 
allegations of ill-treatment of women in custody by men (and, more particularly, of sexual 
harassment, including verbal abuse with sexual connotations) arise more frequently, in 
particular when a State fails to provide separate accommodation for women deprived of 
their liberty with a preponderance of female staff supervising such accommodation. As a 
matter of principle, women deprived of their liberty should be held in accommodation 
which is physically separate from that occupied by any men being held at the same 
establishment.&#8221;<b>48</b> 
</p>
<p>60. During his visit to Denmark, the Special Rapporteur discussed the practice of 
non-separation with a broad array of actors, including government officials, women&#8217;s 
associations, the parliamentary Ombudsman, and female detainees themselves. The Special 
Rapporteur notes that the positive effects of such arrangements have long been accepted in 
Danish and Greenlandic society (e.g. free association eliminates the climate of 
institutionalization by allowing, to the extent possible, exercise of the kind of social contacts 
which exist outside institutions; it reduces aggression and other negative effects of deprivation of 
liberty; and the co-mingling of sexes tends to reduce the power dynamics at play amongst 
otherwise single-sex prisoner populations, either female or male), as reflected in the principle of 
normalization.<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p>61. On the other hand, while most female detainees appeared to be in favour of communal 
living, it became apparent that they commonly formed relationships with male inmates for 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

</b>  See for example A/HRC/7/3/Add.4, para. 75 (s) and para. 52 of the appendix.

<b>49
</b></p>
<p>  According to the Government, since in Greenland most institutions are small and not divided 
into smaller units, it is impossible to offer women the opportunity to serve their sentences in 
units without men. Therefore, women, like men, serve their sentence close to their homes with 
the possibility of staying in their local area. With regard to pretrial detainees in Denmark, the 
Government confirmed that situations may occur in which there is only one female prisoner in a 
local prison who cannot be separated from male detainees. If the woman wishes to be segregated 
from men, it is possible to arrange a transfer to another prison which has a female unit for 
pretrial detainees. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>purposes of protection, from either female detainees or from other males. Thus, while 
non-separation of sexes may diffuse female-female or male-male prisoner population conflicts, 
in some cases it acts to reinforce male-female hierarchical relationships and carries the risk of 
violence against women and sexual abuse. These arrangements were confirmed by female 
detainees that the Special Rapporteur spoke with in the institutions in Nuuk, Herstedvester and 
Vestre (see appendix paragraphs 17 and 18). In fact, it is believed that the rate of marriage within 
prisons, which is on average higher than outside, is explained primarily by this. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur fully appreciates the reasons provided by the Government and 
prison officials for allowing male and female detainees to be accommodated in the same 
premises and recognizes that it is a widely accepted practice based on the openness of Danish 
society, the principle of normalization and the progressive situation prevailing in the prison 
system in Denmark and Greenland. However, given the risks of reinforcing hierarchical 
relationships and violence against women inherent in this practice, the international prison 
standards rightly call for a strict segregation of sexes. In light of the latter, he urges the 
Government to ensure that communal living arrangements are always voluntary: placing a 
woman together with male prisoners must be based on her completely free and informed 
decision. The decision of a woman not to be together with men must have no negative 
consequences and should not unduly restrict her access to education, work and recreational 
programmes.<b>50</b> Furthermore, he urges the Government to ensure that appropriate safeguards 
protecting women from violence and abuse are put in place and continuously monitored. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress that the Danish policy is unique and can only be 
justified in light of the special circumstances prevailing in Danish prisons in accordance with the 
principle of normalization. It cannot serve as a model for other countries where these particular 
conditions do not exist. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  COUNTER-TERRORISM 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur expressed his concerns about recent developments or practices in 
Denmark which may undermine the absolute prohibition of torture through the use of certain 
counter-terrorism strategies. Beyond any doubt, cooperation between various intelligence 
services is a necessary feature of the global fight against terrorism. However, where such 
cooperation involves the use of diplomatic assurances and cooperation in extraordinary 
renditions, it carries the risk of leading to complicity in human rights violations.

</p>
<p><b>A.  Extraordinary renditions 
</b></p>
<p>65. A Danish documentary broadcast on 30 January 2008 alleged that Danish and Greenlandic 
airports (e.g. Narsarsuaq) were used by the United States of America Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA) to transport prisoners as part of its renditions programme.<b>51</b> The Special 
Rapporteur is encouraged by the establishment of an inter-ministerial working group to 
investigate these allegations. The Special Rapporteur strongly encourages the inclusion of 
independent experts and civil society to ensure a fully transparent process. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Diplomatic assurances 
</b></p>
<p>66. In accordance with section 45 (b) (1), Aliens (Consolidation) Act No. 945 
of 1 September 2006, non-nationals considered a threat to national security can be expelled upon 
the decision of the Minister of Integration (after recommendation by the Minister of Justice and 
the Civil Security Service, PET). However, section 31 (1) of the Aliens Act, in accordance with 
article 3 of the Convention against Torture and articles 6 and 7 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, provides that an alien may not be returned to a country where he or 
she will be at risk of facing the death penalty or of being subjected to torture or inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, or where the alien will not be protected from being sent on 
to such country. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur is alarmed about consideration being given by the Government to 
employ diplomatic assurances to return suspected terrorists to countries known for their practice 
of torture.<b>52</b> The Special Rapporteur also refers to the Memorandum of Understanding between 
the Ministry of Defence of Afghanistan and the Ministry of Defence of Denmark of 8 June 2005 
concerning the transfer of persons between the Danish contingent of the International Security 
Assistance Force and the Afghan authorities. According to the Committee against Torture, the

consider the procedural rules related to administrative expulsion of foreign nationals, who are 
deemed to be a danger to national security, without risking the death penalty, torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The mandate includes, inter alia, the 
consideration of diplomatic assurances. </p>

</p>
<p>principle of non-refoulement in article 3 of the Convention against Torture applies to transfers of 
detainees within a State party&#8217;s custody to the custody whether de facto or de jure of any other 
State.<b>53</b> 
</p>
<p>68. As he has pointed out on numerous occasions, diplomatic assurances with regard to torture 
are nothing but attempts to circumvent the absolute prohibition of torture and non-refoulement.<b>54</b> 
Further, diplomatic assurances are unreliable and ineffective in protection against torture and 
ill-treatment. The Special Rapporteur is therefore of the opinion that States cannot resort to 
diplomatic assurances as a safeguard against torture and ill-treatment where there are substantial 
grounds for believing that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture or 
ill-treatment upon return. 
</p>
<p>69. As the country is leading diplomacy for anti-torture efforts worldwide, the Special 
Rapporteur calls upon Denmark to also lead by example and refrain from using diplomatic 
assurances. Rather than pursuing efforts at the EU level aimed at introducing the practice of 
diplomatic assurances, he encourages the Government to consider taking the lead in efforts to 
develop a common European policy or approach aimed at the improvement of conditions of 
detention and the situation of torture and ill-treatment in the potential countries of return. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates his appreciation to the Government of Denmark 
for extending him an invitation to visit the country, and looks forward to continued 
cooperation in combating torture and ill-treatment. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Denmark has a long-standing commitment to and leadership in combating torture 
worldwide. At the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly, it is the central 
player in mobilizing the international community by proposing resolutions on combating 
torture every year. In Europe, Denmark leads efforts on the implementation of the 
European Union&#8217;s foreign policy guidelines on torture in third countries. Moreover, it has 
a long history of generous support to civil society both at home and abroad, particularly in 
the area of rehabilitation for victims of torture. But apart from its role in international 
diplomacy, the Special Rapporteur witnessed over the course of his visit Denmark&#8217;s 
genuine commitment to eradicating torture and ill-treatment first and foremost within the 
country. In fact, he did not receive any allegation of torture and only very few allegations 
of ill-treatment. Without question, the international community has much to learn from 
Denmark&#8217;s example.

</p>
<p>72. <b>Based on his visits to prisons in Denmark and Greenland and his interviews with 
prison inmates, as well as discussion with staff from the Prison and Probation Service, the 
Special Rapporteur concludes that in most institutions the conditions of detention are of a 
very high standard. The principle of normalization which serves as a backbone of 
Denmark&#8217;s prison system not only implies that many prisons in Denmark, including 
Greenland, are open prisons, but also brings about very good day-to-day living standards 
for detainees who benefit from an excellent infrastructure and a variety of activities. 
Particularly noteworthy are the very liberal visiting policies, which allow detainees to 
maintain good contacts with the outside world, and Denmark&#8217;s efforts to establish a 
child-friendly environment within detention facilities. Furthermore, the Special 
Rapporteur was impressed by the excellent conditions of detention and psychological 
treatment provided to detainees with special needs in Herstedvester Institution. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that Denmark&#8217;s particular practice of 
allowing male and female detainees to associate freely, based on the principle of 
normalization, is widely accepted in Danish society, including by female detainees. 
However, in light of international standards which advocate a segregation of the sexes and 
the risks of the practice of non-separation of men and women, he points to the need to 
rigorously ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place and that female detainees can 
freely decide whether or not they want to mix with men. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Notwithstanding the Government&#8217;s efforts to reduce the use of solitary confinement, 
the Special Rapporteur, in line with the opinions expressed by the Committee against 
Torture and the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, is concerned by the 
extensive recourse to this practice during criminal investigations in pretrial detention, in 
order to manage certain categories of convicted prisoners or as a form of punishment for 
disciplinary infractions. Whereas solitary confinement may be used in very exceptional 
cases and for as short a time as possible, its prolonged use may lead to severe mental 
suffering, which in particular circumstances may be qualified as inhuman treatment. If 
prolonged pretrial detention is used as a means of coercion to extort information or a 
confession, it may amount to torture. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>With regard to detention of foreigners and asylum-seekers the Special Rapporteur, 
while being encouraged by the low number of asylum-seekers in detention as compared 
with some other European countries, is concerned by the fact that there is no maximum 
period for such administrative detention. Prolonged deprivation of liberty for 
administrative reasons without knowing the length of the detention may amount to 
inhuman and degrading treatment. Furthermore, although mandatory habeas corpus 
proceedings exist, the Special Rapporteur received information indicating that legal 
challenges to administrative deprivation of liberty of foreigners are not effective in 
practice. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends Denmark&#8217;s efforts in addressing domestic 
violence against women and the trafficking of women, inter alia by amending its domestic 
legislation and carrying out successful awareness-raising campaigns, including through 
successive plans of action. However, in his opinion the efforts of the Government are aimed 
less at the rehabilitation of victims of trafficking in Denmark than preparing their return 
to their countries of origin. While regretting that in Greenland domestic violence has so far </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.2 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p><b>not been adequately addressed, despite the particular severity of the problem in this 
self-governing province, the Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the plans of the Home 
Rule Government to elaborate a national strategy for action with regard to this issue. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the establishment of an inter-ministerial 
working group to investigate the alleged CIA rendition flights operating through Denmark 
and Greenland. Nevertheless, he is alarmed about the consideration recently being given by 
the Government to employ diplomatic assurances to return suspected terrorists to 
countries known for practising torture. Such practice would constitute an attempt to 
circumvent the absolute prohibition of torture. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Incorporate a specific crime of torture in the criminal law; 
 (b) Further reduce the use of solitary confinement, based on the unequivocal 
evidence of its negative mental health effects upon detainees; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Set an absolute limit to the length of detention of foreigners pending 
deportation, and review the practice of habeas corpus proceedings under section 37 of the 
Aliens Act; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Give greater attention to the rehabilitation of victims of human trafficking in 
Denmark; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Ensure that, where arrangements exist for male and female detainees to be 
accommodated in the same premises, the decision of a woman to be placed together with 
men is based on her completely free and informed decision, and scrupulously monitor 
appropriate safeguards to prevent abuse; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Refrain from the use of diplomatic assurances as a means of returning 
suspected terrorists to countries known for practising torture; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Ensure that investigations into alleged CIA rendition flights using Danish and 
Greenlandic airports are carried out in an inclusive and transparent manner; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Continue to promote and support international and national efforts relating to 
rehabilitation for victims of torture. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Finally, the Special Rapporteur recommends, as a priority for the Greenland Home 
Rule Government, that it develop and implement an adequately resourced plan of action 
against domestic violence in Greenland in cooperation with actors with relevant 
experience, such as the Ministry of Welfare and Gender Equality.</b> </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. <b>General information</b>: The following are selected accounts of interviews of detainees who 
consented to be interviewed by the Special Rapporteur and to be included in the report. The 
Special Rapporteur conducted visits to detention facilities unannounced and was able to hold 
private interviews with detainees in all facilities he visited. If detainees did not wish that their 
interviews are recorded, the information provided is only reflected in the general findings of the 
report. Some detainees only agreed to an anonymous publication of their interviews. 
</p>
<p><b>Nuuk Police Station 
(Visited on 2 and 3 May 2008) 
</b></p>
<p>2. <b>General information</b>: The police station had four cells, each equipped with a mattress, a 
blanket and a chair. The cells were used for police custody, but also for persons in pretrial 
detention because of lack of space in Nuuk Prison.<b>a</b> There was a small room equipped with a 
fridge, a table, chairs, a sofa and a TV which could be used by detainees who are not held in 
solitary confinement. All cells and rooms were under continuous video surveillance and 
illuminated 24 hours per day. On the evenings of the Special Rapporteur&#180;s visit one person was 
detained in the facilities. The officer in charge receiving the Special Rapporteur was 
Johan Westen. 
</p>
<p>3. <b>Mads Strom Hansen</b>, aged 50, was arrested on 18 April 2008 at his apartment in Nuuk 
and taken to the police station. After 24 hours he was brought before a court, which remanded 
him to pretrial solitary confinement. He was allowed to receive a visitor once for 10 minutes in 
the presence of three police officers. Mr. Hansen sought and received medical treatment for back 
pain, for which a doctor prescribed pain killers. Mr. Hansen reported that he had difficulties 
sleeping since the light in his cell was switched on 24 hours per day because of the video 
surveillance system. He further complained that the under-floor heating in the cell was set too 
high, and that he sometimes had to wait up to 90 minutes until a police officer was available to 
escort him to the toilet outside his cell. 
</p>
<p>4. With regard to the light switched on for 24 hours in the cell of the detainee, the 
Government stressed that there have been many suicide attempts in police detention facilities in 
Greenland. Video surveillance has contributed to preventing and reducing the possibility of 
detainees to commit suicide or in other ways injure themselves. However, upon the 
Ombudsman&#8217;s request, revised Order No. 1 of 2 May 2008 now contains rules allowing for the 
light in police detentions to be switched off between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., on the basis of a 
concrete estimate and following elaborate guidelines.

</b>  The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that in case a police cell is used for pretrial

<p><b>Nuuk Prison 
(Visited on 3 May 2008) 
</b></p>
<p>5. <b>General information</b>: The prison has a total capacity of 64 inmates. On the day of the 
visit the total number of detainees was 62, of whom seven were women. Seventeen detainees 
were held in pretrial detention, and 45 were convicted. The institution is a &#8220;semi-open prison&#8221;. 
The majority of the convicted prisoners were allowed to go to work outside the prison during the 
day. Men and women were detained together. The 24 prison officers were Danish and 
Greenlanders and included eight women. The prison was divided into a section for remand 
prisoners with eight cells, as well as two additional sections (section A of 13 cells and section B 
of 14 cells). There were also two annexes for convicted prisoners with 10 and 14 beds, 
respectively. Prisoners working outside the prison had furnished their rooms with items, 
including wide-screen televisions, stereos, etc., purchased with their wages. The prison has two 
observation cells, and one security cell equipped with a bed with a five-point restraint system. 
The Special Rapporteur was received by the officer in charge, Poul Hard.

<p>6. <b>Female detainee</b>, aged 30, was arrested on 6 April 2008 and has since been held in pretrial 
solitary confinement. The cell was equipped with a TV, sink and cupboard. After her arrest by 
two male police officers she was taken to the police station in Nuuk, where she stayed for some 
hours before being transferred to Nuuk Prison. Although she had the right to spend 30 minutes 
twice per day outside in the fresh air, she almost never made use of this right. She reported that 
she was not allowed to receive visitors, although had seen her boyfriend three times since her 
arrest. She was in contact with her lawyer over the phone. On 2 May, the court reportedly 
decided to prolong her solitary confinement for another three months. During that period she was 
to undergo a psychological examination pursuant to her criminal case. It was obvious from the 
interview that she suffered severely from the one month she had spent in solitary confinement. 
</p>
<p>7. <b>Angunnguaq G. Fly</b>, aged 19, was arrested in January 2008. After one week of detention 
in pretrial solitary confinement at Nuuk Police Station he was transferred to Nuuk Prison. He 
was convicted in March 2008 and was detained in the semi-open wing for convicted prisoners. 
He had been held in solitary confinement for two months, during which he had been allowed to 
receive visits from his mother. He reported that in January, in response to his playing loud music 
in his cell, two prison officers entered his cell and punched him in the face. He was dragged out 
of his cell and was punched again in the corridor, which resulted in his mouth bleeding. He did 
not officially report the incident, though he informed his lawyer and was examined by a doctor. 
</p>
<p>8. <b>According</b> to the Government, the Department of Prisons and Probation requested the 
Nuuk institution manager to make a statement. The institution manager stated that no notes 
appeared to have been taken in connection with the incident mentioned. Nor had any information 
surfaced elsewhere, and no actual complaint had been lodged by the inmate. However, based on 
the information in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report, the institution management interviewed the 
relevant inmate who maintained having been hit. The matter had therefore been reported to the 
police, which initiated an investigation. In this regard, the person in question, his defence 
attorney, as well as the doctor who carried out the treatment would be contacted. Furthermore, 
the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that, by letter dated 13 October 2008, the 
institution in which the convicted person was placed maintained that he had not been kept in </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/44/Add.2 
  page 29 
 
</p>
<p>solitary confinement in the institution. He had, however, been repeatedly placed in a single cell 
for different periods ranging from 24 hours up to seven days in connection with a number of 
disciplinary offences. 
</p>
<p>9. <b>Detainee</b> aged 30, reported that he was being held in pretrial detention, pending a criminal 
investigation. He was confined to his cell for 23 hours per day with two half hour periods alone 
in the exercise yard. He was unable to speak with others except his lawyer. He was remanded for 
an additional 14 days at the request of the police. His co-accused was released on bail for 
cooperating with the police. 
</p>
<p>10. <b>According</b> to the Government, the person was held in solitary confinement from 11 April 
to 24 July 2008 for investigation purpose as part of a case, involving other persons. One person 
was released by the police as he had made an elaborate confession in relation to the charges 
raised against him before the District Court so that a continued detention could not be justified.

<p><b>Police Headquarters Prison, Copenhagen 
(Visited on 6 May 2008) 
</b></p>
<p>12. <b>General information</b>: Located in the headquarters of Copenhagen Police, the Police 
Headquarters Prison is part of &#8220;Copenhagen Prisons&#8221;, which include the Police Headquarters 
Prison, Vestre Prison and Nytorv Prison. Built in 1924, this high security prison is a remand 
prison for so-called &#8220;negatively strong prisoners&#8221;, i.e. prisoners seen to be exerting a highly 
negative influence on other prisoners. Prisoners detained in Police Headquarters Prison are 
divided into five categories: Copenhagen-area convicted prisoners who are gang members; 
Copenhagen-area gang members in pretrial detention; gang members from outside the 
Copenhagen area in pretrial detention; convicted gang members with a sentence of less than 
4 months; and persons in need of witness protection or voluntary protection. All inmates were 
held in single cells and were allowed to have so called &#8220;community time&#8221; of between two and 
four hours per day in their cells with another inmate, as decided by the prison management, as 
well as one hour of open air exercise on the roof per day. The inmates had the right to receive 
one visit of 90 minutes per week. The prison had a total capacity of 25 inmates and 24 cells were 
occupied on the day of the visit. Eight of the detainees were convicted and 16 were held in 
pretrial detention, two of whom were in solitary confinement pursuant to a court decision, and 
one was prevented from association with others as an administrative measure. The Special 
Rapporteur was received by Morten Gudman-H&#248;yer, Deputy Governor of Copenhagen Prisons. 
</p>
<p>13. <b>Velimir Mujovic</b>, aged 39, had been detained in solitary confinement 
since 17 March 2008. He had been transferred to Police Headquarters Prison on 5 May. He 
reported that he could not inform his family in Montenegro of his detention, although he did </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.2 
page 30 
 
</p>
<p>have contact with his lawyer. Mr. Mujovic had no complaint regarding his treatment in Police 
HQ Prison, but complained about the treatment in the prison in which he had been detained 
previously. 
</p>
<p>14. <b>J&#248;rn J&#248;nke Nielsen</b>, aged 48, leader of a motorcycle gang, had been in pretrial detention 
since 2 January 2008. He was arrested on 27 December 2007. Before his transfer to the Police 
Headquarters Prison he was treated in the hospital for injuries sustained at the time of his arrest. 
Mr. Nielsen appointed himself as spokesperson of detainees, and the other detainees could see 
him privately (once per week). He was writing a report about his 19 years of experience in 
Danish jails and claimed that he was instrumental in bringing about certain achievements in the 
treatment of prisoners through his complaints. He had no complaints about the prison staff.<b>b</b> 
</p>
<p>15. <b>Detainee</b>, aged 25, gang member, had been detained for over one week in solitary 
confinement at the Police Headquarters Prison with three months remaining of his sentence. His 
cell was approximately 4m x 2m with a bed, chair, television, and wash basin. Because of his 
aggressiveness, he chose to be brought to Police Headquarters in order to be segregated from 
other prisoners and reduce the potential for violent conflict. But after having spent just over 
one week there he expressed his wish to go back. He described how difficult he found the 
regime, confined alone in his cell for 23 hours per day with one hour of open air alone on the 
roof. In the first days of his detention he crushed a light bulb, and cut his arms with the broken 
glass, threatening to kill himself if he was not able to see his family, and was subsequently taken 
overnight to the observation cell. He spent much of his day watching television, trying to 
exercise in his cell, or packaging wall plugs as assigned work. For long periods he found himself 
staring at the walls, rocking his body and trying to suppress aggressive thoughts. He had 
requested to see a psychologist.

<p><b>Herstedvester Institution, Albertslund 
(Visited on 7 May 2008) 
</b></p>
<p>16. <b>General information</b>: Herstedvester was built in the early 1930s, and serves as the 
treatment institution of the Prison and Probation Service for inmates in need of psychiatric or 
psychological treatment, particularly sexual offenders, or for inmates who cannot be housed in 
other prisons because of their behaviour. The institution has a total capacity of 153 places out of 
which 15 are open places and 138 are in the closed section. The closed section for women can 
accommodate 10 female detainees. All female inmates stay in this separate section, but can mix 
with male inmates during the day if they choose to do so. On the day of the visit the prison 
population was 152 inmates, including eight women. All except one were convicted. The closed 
institution is for convicts only, however, on occasion the institution receives remand prisoners 
who are detained under section 777 of the Administration of Justice Act. The prison has a special 
section for Greenlandic inmates (21 on the day of the visit) who were supervised by two 
Greenlandic prison officers, two social workers, and Greenlandic interpreters. The prison has 
four observation cells and one security cell. It also has two single cells (equipped with a TV and 
fridge) which are mostly used for persons who voluntarily want to be separated from other

</p>
<p>inmates; are persons with deviant behaviours; or are suicidal. The institution includes a sexual 
offender&#8217;s assessment centre that can accommodate 18 persons. The prisoners usually spend 
5-7 weeks in the assessment centre, and are then transferred to another prison for treatment. The 
institution had 250 full-time staff members, including 167 prison officers, 20 workshop masters, 
a librarian, teachers, six psychiatrists, nine psychologists, a medical doctor, nine social workers 
and eight nurses. Eighty-seven per cent of the inmates were serving a sentence of more than 
eight years, eight were serving a life sentence and 32 were serving an &#8220;indeterminate&#8221; sentence, 
according to Danish legislation. The conditions of detention were excellent. The prison was 
equipped with workshops, a library and computers for the use of prisoners. The institution was 
surrounded by a large green garden. All inmates were detained in single cells which they could 
decorate according to their will, and they were allowed to keep pets (e.g. one prisoner kept an 
Australian parrot) in their cells. In one case, the Special Rapporteur received allegations of 
ill-treatment by the police. However, according to the forensic expert accompanying the Special 
Rapporteur, the pattern was suggestive of self-inflicted wounds. The Special Rapporteur was 
received by the Deputy Governor, Ms. Hanne H&#243;egh Rassmussen and the Clinical Director, 
Ms. Birgit Jessen-Petersen. 
</p>
<p>17. <b>Female detainee</b>, aged 23, was arrested in September 2003 and was detained in Esbjoerg 
Arrest House and Ringk&#248;bine until May 2005. In Ringk&#248;bine she formed a relationship with a 
male inmate and became pregnant. After her conviction she was transferred to Herstedvester 
Institution (and was separated from her boyfriend). She was later transferred to Ringe Prison, 
where she gave birth. Following a psychological assessment it was decided that she was unable 
to care for her baby. She was separated from her baby four days after the birth and given 
medicine to stop the production of breast milk. After eight months at Ringe Prison, she was 
transferred back to Herstedvester where she was held in isolation for some time as a protective 
measure from excessive attention she was receiving from the male prison population. In 
Herstedvester, she married an inmate but later separated. At the time of the interview, she was 
engaged with another inmate who protected her. She cut herself twice but received appropriate 
treatment for this. She was eligible for release in mid-May but preferred to stay at Herstedvester, 
because she was afraid of life outside the prison and wished to be with her boyfriend. Despite her 
traumatic experiences, she was in favour of the system of mixing men and women in prison. 
</p>
<p>18. <b>Female detainee</b>, aged 39. Before her transfer to Herstedvester Institution she had been 
held for almost two years in pretrial detention in Vestre Prison, the first 16 days of which she 
spent in solitary confinement. On the second day of solitary confinement she tried to commit 
suicide by hanging and was subsequently transferred to another cell where she was able to look 
out of a window. She asked to see a psychologist or psychiatrist but was treated only some week 
later. As a consequence of her experience in isolation she feels claustrophobic when entering 
small rooms. She reported that in Herstedvester Institution she received very good treatment to 
overcome these fears. Further, she reported that in Vestre Prison she witnessed an incident where 
violence against an inmate was used. She allegedly was told by the respective guard &#8220;you have 
not seen anything&#8221;. She prefers to be separated from men despite the fact that this leads to a loss 
of certain educational or recreational opportunities but reported that she is in favour of the 
system in which female detainees can choose whether to be or not with men. 
</p>
<p>19. <b>With</b> regard to this case, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that 
Copenhagen Prisons have a special scheme under which a nurse carries out a health check 
within 24 hours after imprisonment. This may be brought forward if the prison staff is worried </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.2 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p>about the inmate&#8217;s condition and requests such a check. If the nurse finds it necessary, medical 
attendance may be provided on the same day, as doctors are present on all workdays. Outside 
normal working hours and on Sundays/public holidays, a doctor can be called from home. If an 
inmate requests a consultation with a psychologist or psychiatrist, he/she will first have to see a 
prison doctor, who will assess the need for referral to a psychologist/psychiatrist. The 
consultation with the doctor will typically take place the day after the inmate has made the 
request, unless in case of an emergency.

<p>20. <b>Male detainee</b>, aged 63, Greenlander. Since 1975 he has - with some short interruptions - 
repeatedly been in prison in Greenland and Denmark for rape. From 1994 to 1997 he was 
detained in solitary confinement in Asiat and Nuuk in Greenland and then transferred to 
Herstedvester. He reported that for two years he refused medical castration, but eventually 
agreed to this treatment since the only alternative was a life in prison. He had been undergoing 
this treatment for three years and was allowed to go out of prison every two or three weeks for 
three days at a time. For these occasions, the prison authorities and social workers worked 
together with him to develop a visit plan. He learned Danish during his imprisonment in 
Denmark and he wished to stay in Denmark after his release. In his opinion imprisonment of 
Greenlanders in Denmark was difficult since it resulted in separation from family, friends and 
Greenlandic cultural life. 
</p>
<p>21. <b>Abdulay Anderson</b>, aged 34. At the time of his arrest, two years earlier, his arms were 
forced behind his back and the wrists tied with flexi-cuffs. A hood was placed on his head. He 
remained handcuffed for three hours, the cuffs cutting into his wrists and leaving his hands 
numb. The numbness persists two years later. Some hours later, when detained in Randers Police 
Station, he was stripped naked by an officer who performed a rectal examination using a finger. 
No medical examination was conducted. He alleged that, while in the cell he was not 
handcuffed, police officers entered and hit him on the body with truncheons, particularly on the 
upper arms and thighs. He sustained bruises. 
</p>
<p>22. <b>Detainee</b>, sentenced to indefinite imprisonment, had been detained since the 7 March 2006 
at Herstedvester Institution. He reported that, whereas the treatment at the Institution was 
satisfactory, he personally would prefer to go back to a psychiatric institution or receive a limited 
prison sentence. He reported that the prison guards overall were doing a good job, but he wished 
that some of them were more active. Further, he said that it was difficult to lodge a complaint, 
but he welcomed the existence of a spokesperson representing the detainees. During the time he 
had spent in detention, no violence was used against him. Once he was taken to the observation 
cell at Vridsl&#243;selille State Prison for 24 hours, but no force was used against him. The cells were 
locked at night, but prison staff reportedly opened the cells within a reasonable period of time if 
a detainee had to go to toilet at night.

prison&#8221;, where inmates were held in isolation during work and in their leisure time. The prison 
was star-shaped with four three-storied wings emanating from the centre point. The prison had a 
capacity of 250 inmates. On the day of the visit, the total prison population amounted to 240 
(all males), out of whom 215 were convicted and 25 in pretrial detention. The prison had a </p>

</p>
<p>high security unit for 15 persons (convicted and remand prisoners) which was occupied by 
eight inmates (four pretrial and four convicted). One of the remand prisoners was in solitary 
confinement pursuant to a court decision; two of the convicted prisoners were in isolation based 
on a disciplinary sanction and two other convicted prisoners were in voluntary isolation. The 
different sections were very well kept. The whole prison was very clean and decorated with 
plants. There were various sport activities for inmates. Apart from the inmates in the high 
security unit, all were on a self-cooking regime. All inmates were detained in single cells. The 
prison had newly renovated visiting rooms with colourful paintings and child-friendly furniture. 
The Special Rapporteur was received by the Governor Mrs. Marianne Secher. 
</p>
<p>24. <b>Gazmen Mustafaj</b>, aged 40, ethnic-Albanian from Montenegro, was arrested 
on 17 March 2008. Until his transfer from Vestre Prison on 6 May, he had been held in pretrial 
solitary confinement. He reported that during his solitary confinement he did not make use of his 
right to spend one hour per day in the yard outside since he felt like an animal in a cage. He was 
not allowed to talk to his family, although his wife was informed about his detention.<b>c</b> He 
reported that he was suffering from stress symptoms.

<p><b>Ellebaek - Closed Detention Centre for Foreigners 
(Visited on 8 May 2008) 
</b></p>
<p>25. <b>General information</b>: Ellebaek was a detention centre for incoming or rejected 
asylum-seekers. Adjacent to the detention centre was the &#8220;Sandholm Red Cross Centre&#8221; which is 
an open centre for asylum seekers. Detention orders were requested by the police and sanctioned 
by a court, and the centre was run by the Danish Prison and Probation Service. The centre had a 
capacity of 118, which could be increased through the addition of another 19 beds. On the day of 
the visit, 58 persons, including four women and one juvenile were detained at the centre. Female 
detainees were detained in a separate building, but were allowed to mix with male detainees 
during the day. The centre used the same disciplinary system as prisons, however it did not have 
a security cell. Medical screening of a detainee was performed by a nurse within 24-48 hours 
upon arrival at the centre. A doctor visited the centre twice per week. The medical staff used 
interpreters for examinations. The inmates were allowed to do very basic work for which they 
earned between 500 and 1000 DKK (approx. US$ 100 to 200) per week. The Special 
Rapporteur was received by the Head Constable, Niels Etlard, and the Prison Governor, 
Hendrik Boe Pedersen. 
</p>
<p>26. <b>Yuri Nikolaev</b>, aged 36, a Russian national. He was arrested and taken to Kastrup Airport 
Police Station on 2 May 2008 upon arrival in Denmark by train from Sweden. On 3 May, he was 
transferred to Ellebaek detention centre. He reported that a few days prior to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, in the observation cell, he was recently forcibly grabbed on the left arm by a 
guard and pushed onto the bed. The following day, an officer kicked him with the sole of his 
shoes on the right side of the chest, when the detainee went to note the guard&#8217;s name. The prison 
doctor&#8217;s medical report indicated allegations of assault by the guard and noted bruising on the

<p>right side of the chest. A forensic examination a few days later found that the bruising on his arm 
was consistent with a grab mark, and those on his chest consistent with a blow from a blunt 
object, such as a shoe, and were compatible with the allegations described. 
27. The <b>Government</b> informed the Special Rapporteur that, on 8 May 2008, the Prison and 
Probation Service reported the matter to the police on behalf of the detainee. However, the 
person left Denmark before the police could interview him. Subsequently, it was found that he 
had moved to Sweden. The public prosecutor therefore requested that he be interviewed by the 
Swedish police. The Danish police are currently awaiting a response from Sweden. 
</p>
<p><b>Vestre Prison 
(Visited on 8 May 2008) 
</b></p>
<p>28. <b>General information</b>: Vestre was built in 1895, in the form of a cross-shaped panoptic 
cell prison with a total capacity of 545. On the day of the visit there were 514 inmates: 
477 remand prisoners (out of which seven were in solitary confinement); 30 women (remand and 
convicted prisoners); Women were detained in a separate wing (30 cells on two floors) but were 
allowed to mix with male prisoners during the day. When the wing was not fully occupied by 
women, some men were placed in the female wing and it was found that this improved the 
atmosphere. The 15 &#8220;negatively-strong&#8221; convicted prisoners, i.e. prisoners seen to be exerting a 
highly negative influence on other prisoners (e.g. members of motorcycle gangs) were detained 
in a special wing with a capacity of 18, completely separated from the rest of the inmates. The 
prisoners in this section were allowed to cook their own food, while remand prisoners were 
served prison food. The staff at Vestre Prison comprise of 620 persons. The prison was very 
clean and many sport and work facilities were offered to inmates. All inmates were detained in 
single cells. The courtyard, which was used for outdoor visits of detainees in solitary 
confinement, was divided into several triangular shaped cages. This space was fairly small and 
there were no chairs and benches. The Special Rapporteur recommends rebuilding the courtyard, 
increasing the space available for detainees.<b>d</b> Each newly registered prisoner was examined by a 
nurse usually within the first 12 hours in the Arrival Section. According to one prisoner the 
&#8220;examination&#8221; was more of an interview about illnesses and prescribed medications. The prison 
had a hospital wing, which included 36 cells/beds divided between two floors. One floor was 
mainly used for psychiatric cases. A drug program was available in the prison. On the day of the 
visit, 65 prisoners were enrolled in individual drug counselling programmes. Methadone 
maintenance therapy (substitution therapy) was available to prisoners and often this treatment 
started after arrival at the prison. In 2007, three inmates committed suicide. In the first 
four months of 2008, there have been three suicides, all men between the age of 30 and 40 years 
who died by hanging. None of the suicides took place in the isolation regimes. The Special 
Rapporteur was received by Peter Vesterheden, Prison Governor of Copenhagen Prisons.

Vestebod City Police Station. In the evening of the same day he was transferred to Vestre Prison. 
On 5 April 2008, he was taken to court and was remanded to two weeks of pretrial detention in 
solitary confinement in order to prevent collaboration with others involved in his case. The 
solitary confinement was subsequently prolonged by the court. He was due to return to the court 
again on 14 May. He stated that he missed interacting with others, but from previous isolation 
experience in 2003, he was able to cope. He was permitted one hour of exercise in the yard. The 
toilet was outside his cell and he needed to signal an officer to escort him whenever he needed to 
use it. He had access to books, magazines and a television in the cell. He asked to do some work 
and was placed on a waiting list in this regard. He received three meals a day, breakfast, a hot 
meal for lunch and a cold meal in the evening and had no complaints about the quality or 
quantity. He was allowed one hour of family visits per week, but a police officer from his case 
was normally present in the room. He reported that most of the prison staff treated the inmates 
well.

boyfriend&#8217;s apartment in Copenhagen and taken to Belahoj Police Station. The same day she was 
transferred to Vestre Prison where she was held for 12 days in solitary confinement. She was not 
allowed to call her boyfriend or family but could correspond in writing. She reported that the 
prison staff treated the inmates in a correct and respectful manner and welcomed that there were 
also male prison officers working in the women&#8217;s section. Furthermore, she liked being able to 
mix with male detainees during the day. She did not feel harassed.

<p>31. <b>Ji An Shi Zy</b>, Chinese national, was arrested at his home on 17 April 2008. He was 
examined at the hospital and was shortly held at a police station before being remanded to 
Vestre Prison, in solitary confinement. He reported that the police and his lawyer tried to inform 
his wife about his detention. He had no complaints and was satisfied with the treatment by the 
guards.

<p>32. <b>Niels Poulsen</b>, aged 35, leader of a motorcycle gang, serving a life sentence. He was 
detained in the wing for &#8220;negatively-strong&#8221; prisoners, i.e. prisoners seen to be exerting a highly 
negative influence on other prisoners, together with other convicted gang members. He 
complained about this separation and preferred to be part of the normal prison population. He 
complained also about an earlier solitary confinement of about one year during which he was 
afraid he would go insane.

<p>33. <b>Christine Kristianson</b>, aged 33, a spokesperson of female detainees. She was arrested 
on 8 August 2006 taken to a police station where she was held for 12 hours, and later transferred 
to Vestre Prison. In Vestre Prison she was held in isolation for one day for investigative reasons. 
She was also held in administrative solitary confinement for three weeks. She reported to the 
Special Rapporteur that one day the prison warden suspected that she had swallowed drugs. 
When she refused to follow the special protocol in such circumstances (i.e. wear special 
underwear), six guards came in her cell, stripped her naked and escorted her naked to the 
security cell, where she was restrained to the bed naked until she passed the drugs. She further 
reported that in Ringe Prison (where she was previously detained) the conditions of detention 
were better because detainees were allowed to go to the garden and more activities were offered. 
However, she thought that more separation was needed between male and female detainees at 
Ringe Prison. In Vestre prison she was allowed to go to the courtyard for 30 minutes per day. </p>

</p>
<p>34. The <b>Government</b> informed the Special Rapporteur that the Department of Prisons and 
Probation requested the prison to make a statement, which indicates that the detainee&#8217;s statement 
according to which she was placed in a security cell and even stripped naked must be rebutted. 
According to Copenhagen Prisons, she was admitted to the prison on 17 July 2006. It appears 
from the observation cell report that there was a suspicion of possession of drugs in the 
abdomen. She was asked whether she wanted to undergo a recto-vaginal examination, or whether 
she wanted to put on a body packer suit. She chose the body packer suit and was placed in an 
observation cell. No force was applied in connection with the suspicion/confinement. Half an 
hour later, she allowed the doctor to perform a recto-vaginal examination. The examination was 
performed, and no drugs were found. Immediately thereafter she returned to her own cell. The 
Government assumes that this must be the incident referred to by the inmate as no other 
incidents during incarcerations since 2001 have been reported.
