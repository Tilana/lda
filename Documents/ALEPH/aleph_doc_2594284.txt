Notes:
(1)
Funds from operations is not a measurement based on generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in
Canada, but is a financial term commonly used in the oil and gas industry. We define funds from operations as
cash flow from operating activities adjusted for changes in non-cash operating working capital and other
operating items. Baytex's funds from operations may not be comparable to other issuers. Baytex considers funds
from operations a key measure of performance as it demonstrates its ability to generate the cash flow necessary
to fund capital investments and potential future dividends. For a reconciliation of funds from operations to cash
flow from operating activities, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of the operating and financial results
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
Principal amount of instruments.
Net debt is a non-GAAP measure which we define to be the sum of monetary working capital (which is current
assets less current liabilities (excluding current financial derivatives and assets held for sale)) and the principal
amount of both the long-term notes and the bank loan.
Barrel of oil equivalent ("boe") amounts have been calculated using a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet
of natural gas to one barrel of oil. The use of boe amounts may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A
boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil is based on an energy
equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value
equivalency at the wellhead.

Advisory Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
In the interest of providing Baytex's shareholders and potential investors with information regarding Baytex, including
management's assessment of Baytex's future plans and operations, certain statements in this press release are
"forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
and "forward-looking information" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation (collectively,
"forward-looking statements"). In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as
"anticipate", "believe", "continue", "could", "estimate", "expect", "forecast", "intend", "may", "objective", "ongoing",
"outlook", "potential", "project", "plan", "should", "target", "would", "will" or similar words suggesting future outcomes,
events or performance. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date
thereof and are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.
Specifically, this press release contains forward-looking statements relating to but not limited to: our business plan,
strategies and objectives, including to deploy capital efficiently, maintain strong levels of financial liquidity and
emphasize cost reductions; that we are well positioned to benefit from a continued oil price recovery and that our three
core plays provide strong capital efficiencies; our target for 2016 capital expenditures to approximate funds from
operations in order to minimize additional bank borrowings; our Eagle Ford shale play, including our assessment of
the performance of wells drilled in Q2/2016, our plan to monitor and evaluate the multi-zone potential of our acreage,
and the cost to drill, complete and equip a well; our ability to partially reduce the volatility in our funds from operations
by utilizing financial derivative contracts for commodity prices, heavy oil differentials and interest and foreign
exchange rates; the proportion of our anticipated oil and gas production that is hedged and the effectiveness of such
hedges in reducing the volatility in our funds from operations; our anticipated disposition of assets in Canada; that we
expect funds from operations to exceed capital expenditures in 2016; and our expectations for exploration and
development capital expenditures and annual average production rate for 2016 and the impact that the spending
reduction will have on our annual average production rate for 2016. In addition, information and statements relating to
reserves are deemed to be forward-looking statements, as they involve implied assessment, based on certain
estimates and assumptions, that the reserves described exist in quantities predicted or estimated, and that the
reserves can be profitably produced in the future.
These forward-looking statements are based on certain key assumptions regarding, among other things: petroleum
and natural gas prices and differentials between light, medium and heavy oil prices; well production rates and reserve
volumes; our ability to add production and reserves through our exploration and development activities; capital
expenditure levels; our ability to borrow under our credit agreements; the receipt, in a timely manner, of regulatory and
other required approvals for our operating activities; the availability and cost of labour and other industry services;
interest and foreign exchange rates; the continuance of existing and, in certain circumstances, proposed tax and
royalty regimes; our ability to develop our crude oil and natural gas properties in the manner currently contemplated;
and current industry conditions, laws and regulations continuing in effect (or, where changes are proposed, such
changes being adopted as anticipated). Readers are cautioned that such assumptions, although considered
reasonable by Baytex at the time of preparation, may prove to be incorrect.
Actual results achieved will vary from the information provided herein as a result of numerous known and unknown
risks and uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the volatility of oil and natural gas
prices; further declines or an extended period of the currently low oil and natural gas prices; failure to comply with the
covenants in our debt agreements; that our credit facilities may not provide sufficient liquidity or may not be renewed;
uncertainties in the capital markets that may restrict or increase our cost of capital or borrowing; risks associated with
a third-party operating our Eagle Ford properties; changes in government regulations that affect the oil and gas
industry; changes in environmental, health and safety regulations; restrictions or costs imposed by climate change
initiatives; variations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; risks associated with our hedging activities; the cost
of developing and operating our assets; risks related to the accessibility, availability, proximity and capacity of
gathering, processing and pipeline systems; depletion of our reserves; risks associated with the exploitation of our
properties and our ability to acquire reserves; changes in income tax or other laws or government incentive programs;
uncertainties associated with estimating petroleum and natural gas reserves; our inability to fully insure against all
risks; risks of counterparty default; risks associated with acquiring, developing and exploring for oil and natural gas
and other aspects of our operations; risks associated with large projects; risks related to our thermal heavy oil projects;
risks associated with the ownership of our securities, including changes in market-based factors and the discretionary
nature of dividend payments; risks for United States and other non-resident shareholders, including the ability to
enforce civil remedies, differing practices for reporting reserves and production, additional taxation applicable to non-
residents and foreign exchange risk; and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These and additional
risk factors are discussed in our Annual Information Form, Annual Report on Form 40-F and Management's
Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with Canadian securities regulatory
authorities and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The above summary of assumptions and risks related to forward-looking statements has been provided in order to
provide shareholders and potential investors with a more complete perspective on Baytex's current and future
operations and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.
There is no representation by Baytex that actual results achieved will be the same in whole or in part as those
referenced in the forward-looking statements and Baytex does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or to
revise any of the included forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise, except as may be required by applicable securities law.
All amounts in this press release are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise specified.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Funds from operations is not a measurement based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") in
Canada, but is a financial term commonly used in the oil and gas industry. Funds from operations represents cash
generated from operating activities adjusted for changes in non-cash operating working capital and other operating
items. Baytex's determination of funds from operations may not be comparable with the calculation of similar
measures for other entities. Baytex considers funds from operations a key measure of performance as it demonstrates
its ability to generate the cash flow necessary to fund capital investments and potential future dividends to
shareholders. The most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are cash flow from
operating activities and net income.
Net debt is not a measurement based on GAAP in Canada. We define net debt as the sum of monetary working
capital (which is current assets less current liabilities (excluding current financial derivatives)) and the principal
amount of both the long-term notes and the bank loan. We believe that this measure assists in providing a more
complete understanding of our cash liabilities.
Bank EBITDA is not a measurement based on GAAP in Canada. We define Bank EBITDA as our consolidated net
income attributable to shareholders before interest, taxes, depletion and depreciation, and certain other non-cash
items as set out in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facilities. This measure is used to measure
compliance with certain financial covenants.
Operating netback is not a measurement based on GAAP in Canada, but is a financial term commonly used in the oil
and gas industry. Operating netback is equal to product revenue less royalties, production and operating expenses
and transportation expenses divided by barrels of oil equivalent sales volume for the applicable period. Our
determination of operating netback may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities.
We believe that this measure assists in characterizing our ability to generate cash margin on a unit of production
basis.

MESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS
Second Quarter Results
As we entered 2016, we laid out certain strategic objectives to help guide us through the commodity price downturn, which included deploying
capital efficiently, maintaining strong levels of financial liquidity and continuing to emphasize cost reductions across all facets of our
organization. Our second quarter results were reflective of these strategic objectives and we remain well positioned to benefit from a continued
recovery in crude oil prices. We highlight below some of the results achieved to-date from the execution of these initiatives.
Capital Deployment
Our emphasis on deploying capital efficiently was evident during the second quarter as we continued to defer investments in our heavy oil
operations in Canada and reduced the pace of development in the Eagle Ford. As a result, we significantly curtailed our level of capital
spending, focusing all development activity in the Eagle Ford, our highest rate of return and highest netback asset. In Q2/2016, our exploration
and development expenditures totaled $35.5 million, down from $81.7 million in Q1/2016 and $140.8 million in Q4/2015.
During the second quarter, we participated in the drilling of 38 gross (11.3 net) wells in the Eagle Ford and commenced production from
20 gross (5.7 net) wells. This compares to Q1/2016 when we commenced production from 34 gross (10.2 net) wells. Of the 20 wells that
commenced production during the second quarter, all have been producing for more than 30 days and have established an average 30-day
initial production rate of approximately 1,300 boe/d. We currently have three drilling rigs operating on our lands, as compared to six drilling rigs
in Q1/2016. We continue to monitor and evaluate the multi-zone development potential of our acreage, which sees us targeting the Lower Eagle
Ford, Upper Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk formations.
In addition to a reduced pace of development, in Canada we shut-in approximately 7,500 boe/d of predominantly low or negative margin heavy
oil production during the first quarter of 2016. As crude oil prices recovered from the lows experienced earlier this year, we reinitiated production
from the majority of these wells in May and June. By the end of June, approximately 6,500 boe/d of the 7,500 boe/d previously shut-in had
been re-started. We expect to resume production from the remaining 1,000 boe/d in the second half of 2016.
Production averaged 70,031 boe/d (77% oil and NGL) in Q2/2016 as compared to 75,776 boe/d in Q1/2016, reflecting both the reduced pace of
development and the impact of the shut-in heavy oil volumes.
Financial Liquidity
On March 31, 2016, we amended our credit facilities to provide us with increased financial flexibility. The amendments included reducing our
credit facilities to US$575 million, granting our banking syndicate first priority security over our assets and restructuring our financial covenants.
The revolving facilities, which currently mature in June 2019, are not borrowing base facilities and do not require annual or semi-annual reviews.
Our Senior Secured Debt to Bank EBITDA ratio as at June 30, 2016 was 0.86:1.00 (maximum permitted ratio of 5.00:1.00) and our interest
coverage ratio was 4.05:1.00 (minimum permitted ratio of 1.25:1.00).
In addition to amending our credit facilities, we have targeted our capital expenditures to approximate our funds from operations in order to
minimize additional bank borrowings. In Q2/2016, our funds from operations totaled $81.3 million, as compared to capital expenditures of
$35.5 million, and in the first six months of 2016, our funds from operations totaled $126.9 million, as compared to capital expenditures of
$117.1 million.
Our net debt (bank loan, long-term notes and working capital deficiency) has decreased to $1.94 billion at June 30, 2016 from $2.05 billion at
December 31, 2015.
Baytex Energy Corp.    Second Quarter Report 2016    5
Cost Reductions
We continue to have success in reducing our cost structure while maintaining efficiency in our operations and the safety of our employees.
Costs in the Eagle Ford have continued to decrease with wells now being drilled, completed and equipped for approximately US$5.4 million, as
compared to US$8.2 million in late 2014. Despite achieving cost reductions of approximately 20% in Canada during 2015, the prevailing
commodity prices have not supported additional drilling on our Canadian assets.
Operating expenses have been reduced by 12% to $9.42/boe in the first half of 2016, as compared to $10.70/boe in the first half of 2015.
These cost reductions reflect a combination of a lower overall cost structure in Canada and our lower cost Eagle Ford assets representing a
larger percentage of our total production. Transportation expenses are also down, averaging $0.90/boe through the first six months of 2016, as
compared to $1.94/boe in 2015.
General and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 of $12.2 million and $26.4 million, respectively, have
decreased from $15.6 million and $32.6 million for the same periods in 2015. The decrease is attributable to reductions in staffing levels
commensurate with lower activity levels combined with a reduction in discretionary spending and supplier's costs. As a continued cost control
measure, all full-time employee salaries and all annual retainers paid to our directors were reduced by 10% effective March 1, 2016.
Operating Netback
During the second quarter, our operating netback improved by 147% as compared to Q1/2016 as crude oil prices strengthened from the lows of
the first quarter and heavy oil differentials tightened as a result of supply disruptions associated with the forest fires near Fort McMurray. In
Q2/2016, the price for West Texas Intermediate light oil ("WTI") averaged US$45.60/bbl, as compared to US$33.45/bbl in Q1/2016, while the
discount for Canadian heavy oil, as measured by the price differential between Western Canadian Select ("WCS") and WTI, averaged
US$13.31/bbl in Q2/2016, as compared to US$14.23/bbl in Q1/2016.
We generated an operating netback in Q2/2016 of $14.39/boe ($18.13/boe including financial derivatives gain), up from $5.82/boe ($12.29/boe
including financial derivatives gain) in Q1/2016. The Eagle Ford generated an operating netback of $17.66/boe ($11.41/boe in Q1/2016) while
our Canadian operations generated an operating netback of $10.44/boe (loss of $0.77/boe in Q1/2016).

Risk Management
As part of our normal operations, we are exposed to movements in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. In an effort to
manage these exposures, we utilize various financial derivative contracts which are intended to partially reduce the volatility in our FFO. We
realized a financial derivatives gain of $23.8 million in Q2/2016 due to crude oil and natural gas prices being at levels below those in our
financial derivative contracts.
For the second half of 2016, we have entered into hedges on approximately 46% of our net WTI exposure with 15% fixed at US$63.79/bbl and
31% hedged utilizing a 3-way option structure. We have also entered into hedges on approximately 35% of our net WCS differential exposure
and 67% of our net natural gas exposure.
For 2017, we have entered into hedges on approximately 31% of our net WTI exposure utilizing a 3-way option structure. We have also entered
into hedges on approximately 23% of our net WCS differential exposure and 44% of our net natural gas exposure.
A complete listing of our financial derivative contracts can be found in Note 15 to our Q2/2016 financial statements.
Disposition Activity
In Q2/2016, we entered into an agreement to dispose of our operated assets in the Eagle Ford for approximately $55 million. Production from
these assets is currently 1,000 boe/d and the disposition includes reserves of approximately 1.26 million boe on a proved plus probable basis
(as evaluated by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. at December 31, 2015). This production has a lower netback than our other Eagle Ford barrels
due to small economies of scale. The Eagle Ford transaction closed on July 27, 2016. In addition, we anticipate closing dispositions relating to
an additional 1,250 boe/d of certain non-core assets in Canada. These transactions are expected to close during the third quarter.
2016 Guidance
As a result of continued depressed crude oil prices, our development activity in the Eagle Ford has been reduced. We currently have three
drilling rigs operating on our lands, as compared to six drilling rigs in Q1/2016.
Given the reduced pace of development anticipated for the second half of 2016, we are now forecasting full-year 2016 exploration and
development capital expenditures of $200 to $225 million, down from previous expectations of $225 to $265 million.
Taking into account the above noted disposition activity and the reduced spending profile, we now anticipate full year 2016 production of 67,000
to 69,000 boe/d (previously 68,000 to 72,000 boe/d). Excluding the impact of disposition activity, the approximate 13% reduction in planned
spending impacts our 2016 production forecast by only 1%. Our 2016 program will remain flexible and allows for adjustments to spending based
on changes in the commodity price environment.
At this level of spending and based on the forward strip for crude oil and natural gas, we expect our funds from operations to exceed capital
expenditures in 2016.

Conclusion
Our operating results for the second quarter were consistent with our expectations and demonstrate the commitment we have made during this
downturn to deploy capital efficiently, maintain strong levels of financial liquidity and reduce costs in all facets of our business. Importantly, our
funds from operations exceeded capital expenditures during both the second quarter and first half resulting in a reduction in net debt. We
remain well positioned to benefit from a rising oil price environment with strong capital efficiencies across our three core resource plays.
We look forward to executing our plans for 2016 for the ongoing benefit of all stakeholders and we thank you for your continued support.
On behalf of the Board of Directors,
James L. Bowzer
President and Chief Executive Officer

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The following is management's discussion and analysis ("MD&A") of the operating and financial results of Baytex Energy Corp. for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016. This information is provided as of July 27, 2016. In this MD&A, references to "Baytex", the "Company",
"we", "us" and "our" and similar terms refer to Baytex Energy Corp. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, except where the context
requires otherwise. The results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 ("YTD 2016") have been compared with the results for the six months
ended June 30, 2015 ("YTD 2015") and the results for the three months ended June 30, 2016 ("Q2/2016") have been compared with the results
for the three months ended June 30, 2015 ("Q2/2015"). This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Company's condensed interim
unaudited consolidated financial statements ("consolidated financial statements") for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, its audited
comparative consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, together with the accompanying notes and its
Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2015. These documents and additional information about Baytex are accessible on
the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com and through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov. All amounts are in
Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated, and all tabular amounts are in thousands of Canadian dollars, except for percentages and per
common share amounts or as otherwise noted.
In this MD&A, barrel of oil equivalent ("boe") amounts have been calculated using a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to
one barrel of oil, which represents an energy equivalency conversion method applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value
equivalency at the wellhead. While it is useful for comparative measures, it may not accurately reflect individual product values and may be
misleading if used in isolation.
This MD&A contains forward-looking information and statements. We refer you to the end of the MD&A for our advisory on forward-looking
information and statements.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In this MD&A, we refer to certain financial measures (such as funds from operations, net debt, operating netback and Bank EBITDA) which do
not have any standardized meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in Canada ("GAAP"). While funds from operations,
net debt and operating netback are commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry, our determination of these measures may not be
comparable with calculations of similar measures by other issuers.
Funds from Operations
We consider funds from operations ("FFO") a key measure that provides a more complete understanding of our results of operations and
financial performance, including our ability to generate funds for capital investments, debt repayment and potential dividends. However, funds
from operations should not be construed as an alternative to performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP, such as cash flow
from operating activities and net income (loss).
The following table reconciles cash flow from operating activities (a GAAP measure) to funds from operations (a non-GAAP measure).

Principal amount of instruments.
Working capital is current assets less current liabilities (excluding current financial derivatives and assets held
for sale).
In the oil and gas industry, it is not unusual to have a working capital deficiency as accounts receivable arising
from sales of production are usually settled within one or two months but accounts payable related to capital and
operating expenditures are usually settled over a longer time span (often two to four months) due to vendor
billing cycles and internal approval processes.
Operating Netback
We define operating netback as oil and natural gas revenue, less royalties, operating expenses and transportation expenses. Operating netback
per boe is the operating netback divided by barrels of oil equivalent production volume for the applicable period. We believe that this measure
assists in assessing our ability to generate cash margin on a unit of production basis.
Bank EBITDA
Bank EBITDA is used to assess compliance with certain financial covenants.

SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
In Q2/2016, commodity prices improved from Q1/2016 and our funds from operations increased 78% with higher realized pricing and lower
operating costs. We continue to prudently manage our capital program with funds from operations exceeding capital expenditures for both
Q2/2016 and YTD 2016.
10    Baytex Energy Corp.    Second Quarter Report 2016
The price of West Texas Intermediate light oil ("WTI") ranged from a low of US$26.21/bbl in February 2016 to a high of US$51.23/bbl in
June 2016. WTI averaged US$45.60/bbl in Q2/2016 up from US$33.45/bbl in Q1/2016 but was still down from US$57.94/bbl in Q2/2015. With
improved commodity prices, FFO increased 78% from Q1/2016 to $81.3 million in Q2/2016. Our average sales price increased 39% to
$30.52/boe in Q2/2016 compared to $21.93/boe in Q1/2016. WTI has averaged US$39.53/bbl during 2016, a decrease of 26% as compared to
the first six months of 2015.
Production averaged 70,031 boe/d during Q2/2016, a decrease of 8% from Q1/2016. This decrease is a result of reduced capital spending
combined with low or negative margin production that was shut-in during the first half of the quarter. Canadian production averaged
31,722 boe/d for Q2/2016, a decrease of 9% from Q1/2016. With improved pricing, 6,500 boe/d of previously shut-in production was brought
back on during the second half of Q2/2016. The Company still has approximately 1,000 boe/d of production in Canada shut-in. U.S. production
averaged 38,309 boe/d for Q2/2016 which was down approximately 7% from 41,067 boe/d in Q1/2016. This decrease was largely anticipated
due to a reduction in the rigs and completion crews on our Eagle Ford lands during 2016 in response to the lower commodity prices. Production
averaged 72,902 boe/d during YTD 2016 down 17% as compared to YTD 2015. The decrease from 2015 is mainly attributed to the limited
amount of capital spending in Canada over the last 18 months combined with low or negative margin production that was shut in. The reduced
capital spending in the Eagle Ford is also contributing to the decrease from the prior year.
Funds from operations for Q2/2016 was $81.3 million ($0.39 per basic and diluted share) compared to $45.6 million ($0.22 per basic and diluted
share) in Q1/2016. The 78% increase in FFO is attributable to higher commodity prices and lower operating costs in the quarter which was
partially offset by lower hedging gains. FFO for YTD 2016 of $126.9 million is down 60% from YTD 2015 and is directly attributable to lower
commodity prices, lower production volumes in Canada and lower realized financial derivatives gain.
Capital activity in the current quarter slowed from Q1/2016 with capital expenditures totaling $35.5 million, a decrease of $46.2 million from
Q1/2016 and $71.7 million from Q2/2015. Despite lower activity levels in Q2/2016, 92% of total capital spending was focused on our Eagle Ford
assets. Capital spending in the Eagle Ford totaled $32.7 million in Q2/2016 where we drilled 11.3 net wells, completed 7.2 net wells and brought
5.7 net wells on-stream. There was very limited activity in Canada in Q2/2016 with total capital spending of $2.7 million as compared to
$7.7 million in Q2/2015.
With reduced capital spending and higher commodity prices, our net debt decreased to $1.94 billion at June 30, 2016 from $2.05 billion at
December 31, 2015. At June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants with approximately $410 million in undrawn
credit capacity.

Production for Q2/2016 averaged 70,031 boe/d, a 17% decrease from Q2/2015. U.S. production averaged 38,309 boe/d in Q2/2016 which was a
slight decrease from Q2/2015 with less capital spending in Q2/2016 and fewer wells coming on production. Production in Canada averaged
31,722 boe/d, a 30% decrease from Q2/2015. Production has decreased with natural declines as there has been minimal capital spending in
Canada over the last 18 months along with 7,500 boe/d of low or negative margin production that was shut-in. With increased commodity prices
approximately 6,500 boe/d of the shut-in production was brought back on by the end of June 2016. The shut-in volumes reduced average
production in Q2/2016 by approximately 4,250 boe/d.
12    Baytex Energy Corp.    Second Quarter Report 2016
Production for YTD 2016 averaged 72,902 boe/d, a 17% decrease from YTD 2015. U.S. production averaged 39,688 boe/d in YTD 2016 and
was relatively unchanged from YTD 2015 with continued capital investment in the Eagle Ford offsetting the production declines. Canadian
production of 33,214 boe/d decreased 30%, or 14,186 boe/d, from YTD 2015 due to minimal capital investment along with low or negative
margin production that was shut-in. The shut-in volumes reduced average production in YTD 2016 by approximately 4,600 boe/d.
Commodity Prices
The prices received for our crude oil and natural gas production directly impact our earnings, funds from operations and our financial position.
Crude Oil
For Q2/2016, the WTI oil prompt averaged US$45.60/bbl, a 21% decrease from the average WTI price of US$57.94/bbl in Q2/2015. For YTD
2016, the WTI oil prompt averaged US$39.53/bbl, a 26% decrease from the average WTI price of US$53.29/bbl for YTD 2015. The low prices
experienced during 2016, as compared to 2015, were due to the continued global oversupply of crude oil and on-going concerns due to the high
levels of inventory in storage.
The discount for Canadian heavy oil is measured by the Western Canadian Select ("WCS") price differential to WTI. For the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, the WCS heavy oil differential averaged US$13.31/bbl and US$13.77/bbl, respectively, compared to
US$11.59/bbl and US$13.15/bbl for the same periods in 2015. Over the past year, increased pipeline capacity from Canada to the U.S. Gulf
Coast has allowed WCS pricing to achieve pipeline equivalency with the large waterborne Gulf Coast refinery market.
Natural Gas
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the AECO natural gas prices averaged $1.25/mcf and $1.68/mcf, respectively, a decrease
compared to $2.67/mcf and $2.81/mcf for the same periods in 2015. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the NYMEX natural
gas price averaged US$1.95/mmbtu and US$2.02/mmbtu, respectively, a decrease compared to US$2.64/mmbtu and US$2.81/mmbtu for the
same periods in 2015. The decrease in natural gas prices on both indices during 2016 was driven by historically high production levels and
extremely weak weather related demand compared to 2015.

Baytex's risk management strategy employs both oil and natural gas financial and physical forward contracts
(fixed price forward sales and collars) and heavy oil differential physical delivery contracts (fixed price and
percentage of WTI). The pricing information in the table excludes the impact of financial derivatives.
Realized heavy oil prices are calculated based on sales volumes, net of blending costs.
Average Realized Sales Prices
U.S. light oil and condensate pricing for Q2/2016 was $52.79/bbl, down 19% from $65.34/bbl in Q2/2015, which is slightly less than the 22%
decrease in the LLS benchmark (expressed in Canadian dollars). U.S. light oil and condensate pricing for YTD 2016 was $45.03/bbl, down 23%
from $58.81/bbl in YTD 2015 also slightly less than the 24% decrease in the LLS benchmark (expressed in Canadian dollars). Reduced supply
along with increased pipeline capacity have tightened the pricing differential between our U.S. light oil and condensate to LLS during 2016.
During Q2/2016, our Canadian average sales price for light oil and condensate was $47.24/bbl, down 24% from $62.20/bbl in Q2/2015, as
compared to a 19% decrease in the benchmark Edmonton par price. Canadian light oil and condensate pricing was $41.37/bbl for YTD 2016
compared to $54.72/bbl for YTD 2015, a 24% decrease compared to a 20% decrease in the benchmark Edmonton par price. Our Canadian
realized price decreased slightly more than the benchmark when comparing 2016 to 2015 as a higher percentage of our Canadian light oil
production in 2016 is comprised of medium grade crude which has a higher discount to the benchmark price.
Our realized heavy oil price for Q2/2016 was $30.09/bbl, a $14.50/bbl decrease from Q2/2015. YTD 2016, our realized heavy oil price was
$20.87/bbl, a $15.34/bbl decrease from YTD 2015. The decrease in our realized heavy oil price during 2016 generally coincides with the
decrease in the WCS benchmark price (expressed in Canadian dollars) which decreased from 2015 by $15.37/bbl for Q2/2016 and by
$15.28/bbl for YTD 2016 as our heavy oil is generally sold at a fixed dollar differential to the benchmark. Our price decreased slightly less than
the benchmark during 2016 as the volumes shut-in have a higher discount to the benchmark price resulting in better price realizations in 2016.
Our Canadian average realized natural gas price for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $1.30/mcf and $1.62/mcf, respectively,
down 50% and 38% from the same periods in 2015. The decrease in our realized price was consistent with the decrease in the AECO
benchmarks for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 of 53% and 40% from the same periods in 2015.
Our U.S. average realized natural gas price for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $2.39/mcf and $2.57/mcf, respectively,
down 30% and 28% from the same periods of 2015. The decrease in the U.S. average
14    Baytex Energy Corp.    Second Quarter Report 2016
realized natural gas price was consistent with the decrease in the NYMEX benchmark for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 of
26% and 28% for the same periods of 2015.
Our realized NGL price was $13.28/bbl or 23% of WTI (expressed in Canadian dollars) in Q2/2016 compared to $15.78/bbl or 22% of WTI
(expressed in Canadian dollars) in Q2/2015. For YTD 2016, our realized NGL price was 30% of WTI (expressed in Canadian dollars) which is
slightly higher than 27% of WTI in YTD 2015. In Q2/2016, the operator of our Eagle Ford assets reversed the changes to certain post-
production NGL processing arrangements that were recorded in Q1/2016 which reduced NGL revenues and operating expenses in Q2/2016 but
have no impact on YTD 2016.

Total petroleum and natural gas revenues for Q2/2016 of $195.7 million decreased $147.1 million from Q2/2015 with lower commodity prices
contributing $82.1 million of the decrease and the remaining $65.0 million from lower production volumes. Petroleum and natural gas revenues
of $120.0 million in the U.S. decreased $47.9 million from Q2/2015 due to a decrease in realized prices on all products.
In Canada, petroleum and natural gas revenues for Q2/2016 totaled $75.7 million, a $99.2 million decrease compared to Q2/2015 due to lower
realized prices and lower production volumes.
Baytex Energy Corp.    Second Quarter Report 2016    15
Total petroleum and natural gas revenues for YTD 2016 of $349.3 million decreased $276.9 million from YTD 2015 with lower commodity prices
contributing $163.3 million of the decrease and the remaining $113.6 million from lower production volumes. Petroleum and natural gas
revenues of $228.5 million in the U.S. decreased $90.4 million from YTD 2015 mainly due to a decrease in realized prices on all products. In
Canada, petroleum and natural gas revenues for YTD 2016 totaled $120.8 million, a $186.4 million decrease compared to YTD 2015 due to
lower realized prices and lower production volumes.
Heavy oil blending revenue of $1.2 million and $3.6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, decreased
$7.3 million and $14.6 million compared to the same periods in 2015. Heavy oil blending revenue decreased in 2016 as the Company sold less
diluent with the decrease in heavy oil production in Canada. Heavy oil transported through pipelines requires blending to reduce its viscosity in
order to meet pipeline specifications. The cost of blending diluent is recovered in the sale price of the blended product. Our heavy oil
transported by rail does not require blending diluent. The purchases and sales of blending diluent are recorded as heavy oil blending expense
and revenue, respectively.
Royalties
Royalties are paid to various government entities and to land and mineral rights owners. Royalties are calculated based on gross revenues, or
on operating netbacks less capital investment for specific heavy oil projects, and are generally expressed as a percentage of gross revenue.
The actual royalty rates can vary for a number of reasons, including the commodity produced, royalty contract terms, commodity price level,
royalty incentives and the area or jurisdiction. The following table summarizes our royalties and royalty rates for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

Average royalty rate excludes sales of heavy oil blending diluents and the effects of financial derivatives.
Total royalties for Q2/2016 of $42.4 million decreased 46%, or $35.5 million, from Q2/2015, due to the decline in gross revenues. The overall
royalty rate in Q2/2016 of 21.8% was slightly lower than 23.3% in Q2/2015. The royalty rate decreased slightly as the royalty rate in Canada
was lower in Q2/2016 as a result of lower prices. Canadian royalties decreased to 10.6% of revenue for Q2/2016, compared to 17.0% of
revenue in Q2/2015. Canadian crown royalty rates are partially based on price and with the lower commodity prices experienced during
Q2/2016, the Company recorded lower crown royalty rates compared to Q2/2015. The royalty percentage on our U.S. assets does not vary with
price and as a result the U.S. royalty rate in Q2/2016 of 28.7% has remained fairly consistent with the Q2/2015 rate of 29.5% and overall
royalties have decreased with the decrease in gross revenues.
Total royalties for YTD 2016 of $77.0 million decreased 43%, or $57.6 million, from YTD 2015, due to the decline in gross revenues. The overall
royalty rate in YTD 2016 of 22.3% was consistent with 22.1% in YTD 2015. The Canadian royalty rate decreased, but a higher proportion of our
revenue came from the U.S. in YTD 2016 which has higher royalty rates offsetting the impact of the decrease in the Canadian rate on the
overall royalty rate. Canadian royalties decreased to 10.0% of revenue for YTD 2016, compared to 14.4% of revenue in YTD 2015 due to lower
commodity prices. The royalty percentage on our U.S. assets does not vary with price and as a result the YTD 2016 U.S. royalty rate of 28.5%
has remained consistent with the YTD 2015 rate of 29.1% and overall royalties have decreased with the decrease in gross revenues.

Operating expenses related to the Eagle Ford assets include transportation expenses.
Operating expenses of $55.3 million and $125.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, decreased by
$26.8 million and $44.9 million compared to the same periods in 2015. Overall operating costs are down as production has decreased in 2016
compared to 2015. Operating expenses are also down on a unit of production basis with operating costs decreasing to $8.67/boe and $9.42/boe
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $10.64/boe and $10.70/boe for the same periods in 2015. The
lower cost Eagle Ford assets comprise a larger proportion of our overall volumes which is helping to reduce our overall operating costs per boe.
In Canada, we are also seeing the impacts of our cost savings initiatives along with the benefit of shutting-in higher cost properties as our
operating expenses per unit of production were lower in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to same periods in 2015.
U.S. operating expenses of $24.0 million for Q2/2016 decreased $2.7 million compared to Q2/2015. In Q1/2016, the operator of the Eagle Ford
property changed certain post-production processing arrangements which increased operating expenses and revenues. In Q2/2016, this change
was reversed by the operator resulting in a decrease to operating expenses and revenues. The reversal of the post production processing
arrangement reduced operating costs by approximately $1.00/boe in Q2/2016 with no impact on the YTD 2016. On a unit of production basis,
YTD 2016 operating expenses were $8.17/boe compared to $7.39/boe in YTD 2015 representing an increase of $0.78/boe. This increase in per
unit costs in the U.S is primarily a result of the weaker Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. Operating expenses per boe in U.S. dollars for
YTD 2016 have averaged US$6.17/boe which is comparable to YTD 2015 costs of US$5.98/boe.
Canadian operating expenses of $31.3 million and $65.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, decreased
$24.1 million and $50.0 million compared to the same periods in 2015. The decrease is a result of lower production volumes and realized cost
savings across all of our operations. On a per boe basis, Canadian operating expenses were $10.84/boe and $10.91/boe for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $13.45/boe and $13.51/boe for the same periods in 2015 reflecting the cost savings
initiatives during 2016 and the impact of high cost production being shut-in for part of YTD 2016. As commodity prices improve and the higher
cost shut-in volumes are restored, we expect Canadian operating expenses, on a unit of production basis, to increase.

Transportation Expenses
Transportation expenses include the costs to move production from the field to the sales point. The largest component of transportation
expenses relates to the trucking of heavy oil to pipeline and rail terminals. The following table compares our transportation expenses for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

Transportation expenses related to the Eagle Ford assets have been included in operating expenses.
Transportation expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $5.1 million and $11.9 million, respectively, a decrease of
66% and 61% from the same periods in 2015. The decrease is due to lower heavy oil volumes being transported to the sales point, decreased
fuel costs and the increased use of lower cost internal trucking. On a per unit basis, costs have decreased as a large portion of the shut-in
volumes were subject to higher transportation charges.
Blending Expenses
Blending expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 of $1.2 million and $3.6 million, respectively, have decreased compared
to $8.5 million and $18.1 million for the same periods of 2015. Consistent with the decrease in heavy oil blending revenue, blending expenses
decreased due to a decrease in both the volume of blending diluent required and the price of blending diluent.
Financial Derivatives
As part of our normal operations, we are exposed to movements in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. In an effort to
manage these exposures, we utilize various financial derivative contracts which are intended to partially reduce the volatility in our funds from
operations. Financial derivatives are managed at the corporate level and are not allocated between divisions. Contracts settled in the period
result in realized gains or losses based on the market price compared to the contract price. Changes in the fair value of contracts are reported
as unrealized gains or losses in the period as the forward markets for commodities and currencies fluctuate and as
18    Baytex Energy Corp.    Second Quarter Report 2016
new contracts are executed. The following table summarizes the results of our financial derivative contracts for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015.

Unrealized interest and financing derivatives gain (loss) includes the change in fair value of the call options
embedded in our long-term notes.
The realized financial derivatives gain of $23.8 million and $68.4 million for three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, relate
mainly to crude oil prices being at levels below those set in our fixed price contracts.
The unrealized financial derivatives loss of $80.6 million for Q2/2016 is due to the increase in WTI price at June 30, 2016 as compared to
March 31, 2016 and the realization, or reversal, of previous unrealized gains recorded at March 31, 2016. The unrealized financial derivatives
loss of $110.7 million for YTD 2016 is due to the increase in WTI price at June 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015 and the
realization, or reversal, of previous unrealized gains recorded at December 31, 2015.
A summary of the financial derivative contracts in place as at June 30, 2016 and the accounting treatment thereof are disclosed in note 15

Exploration and evaluation expense includes the derecognition of exploration and evaluation assets and will vary from period to period
depending on the expiry of leases and assessment of our exploration programs and assets.
Exploration and evaluation expense decreased to $1.9 million for Q2/2016 from $2.2 million in Q2/2015. Exploration and evaluation expense
decreased to $3.4 million for YTD 2016 from $4.5 million for YTD 2015. The decrease is due to lower expiries of undeveloped land.

General and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 of $12.2 million and $26.4 million, respectively,
decreased from $15.6 million and $32.6 million for the same periods in 2015. The decreases are attributable to reductions in staffing levels
commensurate with lower activity levels combined with a reduction in discretionary spending.
Share-Based Compensation Expense
Compensation expense associated with the Share Award Incentive Plan is recognized in net income (loss) over the vesting period of the share
awards with a corresponding increase in contributed surplus. The issuance of common shares upon the conversion of share awards is recorded
as an increase in shareholders' capital with a corresponding reduction in contributed surplus.
Compensation expense related to the Share Award Incentive Plan was $3.9 million and $8.4 million for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $8.2 million and $16.2 million for the same periods in 2015. The decrease in share-based
compensation expense for both periods is a result of a lower fair value of share awards granted due to a reduction in the Company's share price
at grant date for new grants in 2016.
Baytex Energy Corp.    Second Quarter Report 2016    21
Financing and Interest Expenses
Financing and interest expenses include interest on bank loan and long-term notes, non-cash financing costs and accretion on asset retirement
obligations.
Financing and interest expenses increased $1.1 million to $27.9 million for Q2/2016, compared to $26.8 million in Q2/2015. The Canadian dollar
was weaker in Q2/2016 compared to Q2/2015 which increased our interest expense on our long-term notes as the majority of our long-term
notes are denominated in U.S. dollars.
Financing and interest expenses increased slightly to $56.9 million for YTD 2016, compared to $56.2 million in YTD 2015. Interest on long-term
notes increased to $45.3 million during YTD 2016 compared to $43.4 million in YTD 2015 as the Canadian dollar was weaker against the
U.S. dollar in YTD 2016 compared to YTD 2015 which increased our interest expense as a majority of our long-term notes are denominated in
U.S. dollars. This was offset by lower interest charges on our bank loan in 2016 as compared to 2015 as we had larger bank loans in 2015
before the proceeds from the equity financing on April 2, 2015, were used to reduce bank indebtedness.
Foreign Exchange
Unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized with the change in the value of the long-term notes and bank loan denominated in
U.S. dollars. The long-term notes and bank loan are translated to Canadian dollars on the balance sheet date and a strengthening Canadian
dollar against the U.S. dollar from current period to previous period will result in unrealized gains and a weakening Canadian dollar will result in
unrealized losses. Realized foreign exchange gains and losses are due to day-to-day U.S. dollar denominated transactions occurring in the
Canadian operations.

In 2016, available tax deductions exceeded taxable income which allowed the Company to recover a portion of the prior year current income tax
expense. For Q2/2016, this resulted in a current income tax recovery of $2.3 million, an increase of $1.7 million over the current income tax
recovery of $0.6 million in Q2/2015. For YTD 2016, this resulted in a current income tax recovery of $3.7 million, an increase of $20.1 million
over the current income tax expense of $16.4 million in YTD 2015.
The deferred income tax recovery of $46.8 million for Q2/2016 increased $34.5 million from $12.3 million for Q2/2015. The deferred income tax
recovery of $94.9 million for YTD 2016 increased $40.9 million from $54.0 million for YTD 2015. The increase for both periods is primarily the
result of a decrease in the amount of tax pool claims required to shelter the lower taxable income.
In June 2016, certain indirect subsidiary entities received reassessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (the "CRA") that deny non-capital
loss deductions relevant to the calculation of income taxes for the years 2011 through 2015. These reassessments follow the previously
disclosed letter which we received in November 2014 from the CRA, proposing to issue such reassessments.
We remain confident that the tax filings of the affected entities are correct and will vigorously defend our tax filing positions. The
reassessments do not require us to pay any amounts in order to participate in the appeals process.
We will file a notice of objection for each notice of reassessment received. These notices of objection will be reviewed by the Appeals Division
of the CRA; a process that we estimate could take up to two years. If the Appeals Division upholds the notices of reassessment, we have the
right to appeal to the Tax Court of Canada; a process that we estimate could take a further two years. Should we be unsuccessful at the Tax
Court of Canada, additional appeals are available; a process that we estimate could take another two years and potentially longer.
By way of background, we acquired several privately held commercial trusts in 2010 with accumulated non-capital losses of $591 million
(the "Losses"). The Losses were subsequently used to reduce the taxable income of those trusts. The reassessments disallow the deduction
of the Losses under the general anti-avoidance rule of the Income Tax Act (Canada). If, after exhausting available appeals, the deduction of
Losses continues to be disallowed, we will owe cash taxes for the years 2012 through 2015 and an additional amount for late payment interest.
The amount of cash taxes owing and the late payment interest are dependent upon the amount of unused tax shelter available to offset the
reassessed income, including tax shelter from future years available for "carry back" to the years 2012 through 2015.
Net Income (Loss) and Funds from Operations
Net loss for Q2/2016 totaled $86.9 million ($0.41 per basic and diluted share) compared to net loss of $27.0 million ($0.13 per basic and diluted
share) for Q2/2015. Net loss for YTD 2016 totaled $86.3 million ($0.41 per basic and diluted share) compared to net loss of $202.9 million
($1.08 per basic and diluted share) for YTD 2015. Funds from operations for Q2/2016 totaled $81.3 million ($0.39 per basic and diluted share)
as compared to $158.1 million ($0.60 per basic and diluted share) for Q2/2015. Funds from operations for YTD 2016 totaled $126.9 million
($0.60 per basic and diluted share) as compared to $318.3 million ($1.70 per basic and diluted share) for YTD 2015. The

Dividends
In 2015, we declared monthly dividends of $0.10 per common share for January to June totaling $0.60 per common share. The Company paid
$83.2 million in cash dividends in YTD 2015, and $25.5 million of dividends declared were settled by issuing 1,262,000 common shares under
the Company's dividend reinvestment plan. In response to the prolonged low price commodity environment and in an effort to preserve liquidity,
Baytex suspended the monthly dividend effective September 2015.
Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of the foreign currency translation adjustment on U.S. net assets not recognized in profit or
loss. The $6.1 million foreign currency translation gain for Q2/2016 is due to a slight weakening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar at
June 30, 2016 as compared to March 31, 2016. The $152.6 million foreign currency translation loss for YTD 2016 is due to the strengthening of
the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar at June 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015.

YTD 2016 capital expenditures totaled $117.1 million as compared to $256.2 million in YTD 2015. Capital spending has been focused on our
Eagle Ford assets with YTD 2016 capital spending of $109.6 million down from $224.4 million for YTD 2015. The decrease in spending is from
lower activity levels with lower commodity prices and from significant cost savings achieved on our Eagle Ford program. Total costs in the
Eagle Ford have continued to decrease with wells now being drilled, completed and equipped for approximately US$5.4 million as compared to
US$8.2 million in 2014. We also recognized additional savings on drilling, completion and equipping expenditures in Q2/2016 as actual costs
incurred were less than previously estimated. In Canada, we have drilled one well in YTD 2016 and have spent $7.6 million compared to YTD
2015 where we drilled 11.1 net wells and spent $29.0 million. Despite achieving cost reductions of approximately 20% in Canada during 2015,
the prevailing commodity prices have not supported additional drilling on our Canadian assets.
In Q2/2016, our capital expenditures totaled $35.5 million compared to $107.2 million in Q2/2015 and were focused on our Eagle Ford assets
with 92% of the total capital being spent in the U.S. The significant reduction year over year is due to reduced activity levels in Canada and the
Eagle Ford and from cost savings on the Eagle Ford program that were recognized in Q2/2016 as actual costs incurred were less than
previously estimated. We did not drill any wells in Canada and spent $2.7 million in Q2/2016 as compared to 2.0 net wells and $7.7 million
in Q2/2015.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed the sale of our operated assets in the Eagle Ford on July 27, 2016 for approximately
$55 million.
Baytex Energy Corp.    Second Quarter Report 2016    25
LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND RISK MANAGEMENT
We regularly review our capital structure and liquidity sources to ensure that our capital resources will be sufficient to meet our on-going short,
medium and long-term commitments. Specifically, we believe that our internally generated funds from operations and our existing undrawn
credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity to sustain our operations and planned capital expenditures.
We regularly review our exposure to counterparties to ensure they have the financial capacity to honor outstanding obligations to us in the
normal course of business. We periodically review the financial capacity of our counterparties and, in certain circumstances, we will seek
enhanced credit protection.
The current commodity price environment has reduced our internally generated funds from operations. As a result, we have taken several steps
to protect our liquidity, which included reducing our 2016 capital program by approximately 33% from our initial plans and working with our
lending syndicate to secure our bank credit facilities. We also shut-in low or negative margin production for part of 2016.
If the current commodity price environment continues, or if prices decline further, we may need to make additional changes to our capital
program. A sustained low price environment could lead to a default of certain financial covenants, which could impact our ability to borrow
under existing credit facilities or obtain new financing. It could also restrict our ability to pay future dividends or sell assets and may result in
our debt becoming immediately due and payable. Should our internally generated funds from operations be insufficient to fund the capital
expenditures required to maintain operations, we may draw additional funds from our current credit facilities or we may consider seeking
additional capital in the form of debt or equity. There is also no certainty that any of the additional sources of capital would be available
when required.
At June 30, 2016, net debt was $1,942.5 million, as compared to $2,049.9 million at December 31, 2015, representing a decrease of
$107.4 million. This decrease is mainly due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar which reduced the carrying value
of our U.S. dollar denominated long-term notes and bank loans at June 30, 2016. Funds from operations exceeded capital spending by
$9.7 million for YTD 2016 further reducing net debt.
Bank Loan
On March 31, 2016, we amended our credit facilities to provide us with increased financial flexibility. The amendments included reducing our
credit facilities to US$575 million, granting our banking syndicate first priority security over our assets and restructuring our financial covenants.
The amended revolving extendible secured credit facilities are comprised of a US$25 million operating loan and a US$350 million syndicated
loan and a US$200 million syndicated loan for our wholly-owned subsidiary, Baytex Energy USA, Inc. (collectively, the "Revolving Facilities").
The Revolving Facilities are not borrowing base facilities and do not require annual or semi-annual reviews. The facilities contain standard
commercial covenants as detailed below and do not require any mandatory principal payments prior to maturity on June 4, 2019. Baytex may
request an extension under the Revolving Facilities which could extend the revolving period for up to four years (subject to a maximum four-
year term at any time). The agreement relating to the Revolving Facilities is accessible on the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com (filed under
the category "Material contracts – Credit agreements" on April 13, 2016).
The weighted average interest rates on the credit facilities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were 3.5%, as compared to 4.0%
and 3.1%, respectively, for the same periods in 2015.

On March 31, 2016, we reached an agreement with the lending syndicate to restructure the financial covenants applicable to the Revolving

"Senior Secured Debt" is defined as the principal amount of the bank loan and other secured obligations
identified in the credit agreement. As at June 30, 2016, our Senior Secured Debt totaled $359 million.
Bank EBITDA is calculated based on terms and definitions set out in the credit agreement which adjusts net
income (loss) for financing and interest expenses, income tax, certain specific unrealized and non-cash
transactions (including depletion, depreciation, exploration expenses, unrealized gains and losses on financial
derivatives and foreign exchange and stock based compensation) and is calculated based on a trailing twelve
month basis. Bank EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2016 was $417 million.
Interest coverage is computed as the ratio of Bank EBITDA to financing and interest expenses, excluding non-
cash interest and accretion on asset retirement obligations, and is calculated on a trailing twelve month basis.
Financing and interest expenses for the twelve months ended June 30, 2016 were $103 million.
If we exceed or breach any of the covenants under the Revolving Facilities or our long-term notes, we may be required to repay, refinance or
renegotiate the loan terms and may be restricted from paying dividends to our shareholders or taking on further debt.
Long-Term Notes
Baytex has five series of long-term notes outstanding that total $1.54 billion as at June 30, 2016. The long-term notes do not contain any
significant financial maintenance covenants. The long-term notes contain a debt incurrence covenant that restricts our ability to raise additional
debt beyond our existing credit facilities and long-term notes unless we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (computed as the ratio
of EBITDA to financing and interest expenses on a trailing twelve month basis) of 2.5:1. As at June 30, 2016, the fixed charge coverage ratio
was 4.05:1.
On February 17, 2011, we issued US$150 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at 6.75% payable semi-annually
with principal repayable on February 17, 2021. These notes as of February 17, 2016 are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at
specified redemption prices.
On July 19, 2012, we issued $300 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at 6.625% payable semi-annually with
principal repayable on July 19, 2022. These notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, commencing on July 19, 2017 at specified
redemption prices.
On June 6, 2014, we issued US$800 million of senior unsecured notes, comprised of US$400 million of 5.125% notes due June 1, 2021
(the "2021 Notes") and US$400 million of 5.625% notes due June 1, 2024 (the "2024 Notes"). The 2021 Notes and the 2024 Notes pay interest
semi-annually and are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, commencing on June 1, 2017 (in the case of the 2021 Notes) and June 1,
2019 (in the case of the 2024 Notes) at specified redemption prices.
Pursuant to the acquisition of Aurora Oil & Gas Limited ("Aurora"), on June 11, 2014, we assumed all of Aurora's existing senior unsecured
notes and then purchased and cancelled approximately 98% of the outstanding notes. On February 27, 2015, we redeemed one tranche of the
remaining Aurora notes at a price of US$8.3 million plus
Baytex Energy Corp.    Second Quarter Report 2016    27
accrued interest. The remaining Aurora notes (US$6.4 million principal amount) are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, as of April 1,
2016 at specified redemption prices.
Financial Instruments
As part of our normal operations, we are exposed to a number of financial risks, including liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk. Liquidity risk
is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. We manage liquidity risk through
cash and debt management. Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial asset will default, resulting in the Company incurring a loss.
Credit risk is managed by entering into sales contracts with creditworthy entities and reviewing our exposure to individual entities on a regular
basis. Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows will fluctuate due to movements in market prices, and is comprised of
foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk. Market risk is partially mitigated through a series of derivative contracts
intended to reduce some of the volatility of our funds from operations.
A summary of the risk management contracts in place as at June 30, 2016 and the accounting treatment thereof is disclosed in note 15 to the
consolidated financial statements.
Shareholders' Capital
We are authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares and 10,000,000 preferred shares. The rights and terms of preferred shares
are determined upon issuance. As at July 27, 2016, we had 211,541,490 common shares and no preferred shares issued and outstanding.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we issued 25,916 and 131,798 common shares, respectively, pursuant to our share-
based compensation program.
Contractual Obligations
We have a number of financial obligations that are incurred in the ordinary course of business. These obligations are of a recurring nature and
impact the Company's funds from operations in an ongoing manner. A significant portion of these obligations will be funded by funds from
operations. These obligations as of June 30, 2016 and the expected timing for funding these obligations are noted in the table below.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
In the interest of providing our shareholders and potential investors with information regarding Baytex, including management's assessment of
the Company's future plans and operations, certain statements in this document are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the
United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and "forward-looking information" within the meaning of applicable Canadian
securities legislation (collectively, "forward-looking statements"). In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology
such as "anticipate", "believe", "continue", "could", "estimate", "expect", "forecast", "intend", "may", "objective", "ongoing", "outlook",
"potential", "project", "plan", "should", "target", "would", "will" or similar words suggesting future outcomes, events or performance. The forward-
looking statements contained in this document speak only as of the date of this document and are expressly qualified by this cautionary
statement.
Specifically, this document contains forward-looking statements relating to but not limited to: our business strategies, plans and objectives;
crude oil and natural gas prices and the price differentials between light, medium and heavy oil prices; our expectation for Canadian operating
expenses for the remainder of 2016; our ability to reduce the volatility in our funds from operations by utilizing financial derivative contracts; the
reassessment of our tax filings by the Canada Revenue Agency; our intention to defend the reassessments; our view of our tax filing
Baytex Energy Corp.    Second Quarter Report 2016    29
position; the length of time it would take to resolve the reassessments; that we would owe cash taxes and late payment interest if the
reassessment is successful; the cost to drill, complete and equip a well in the Eagle Ford; the sufficiency of our capital resources to meet our
on-going short, medium and long-term commitments; the financial capacity of counterparties to honor outstanding obligations to us in the
normal course of business; our belief that the amended credit facilities provide increased financial flexibility; and the existence, operation and
strategy of our risk management program. In addition, information and statements relating to reserves are deemed to be forward-looking
statements, as they involve implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves described exist in quantities
predicted or estimated, and that the reserves can be profitably produced in the future.
These forward-looking statements are based on certain key assumptions regarding, among other things: petroleum and natural gas prices and
differentials between light, medium and heavy oil prices; well production rates and reserve volumes; our ability to add production and reserves
through our exploration and development activities; capital expenditure levels; our ability to borrow under our credit agreements; the receipt, in a
timely manner, of regulatory and other required approvals for our operating activities; the availability and cost of labour and other industry
services; interest and foreign exchange rates; the continuance of existing and, in certain circumstances, proposed tax and royalty regimes; our
ability to develop our crude oil and natural gas properties in the manner currently contemplated; and current industry conditions, laws and
regulations continuing in effect (or, where changes are proposed, such changes being adopted as anticipated). Readers are cautioned that such
assumptions, although considered reasonable by Baytex at the time of preparation, may prove to be incorrect.
Actual results achieved will vary from the information provided herein as a result of numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties and
other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the volatility of oil and natural gas prices; further declines or an extended period of
the currently low oil and natural gas prices; failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements; that our credit facilities may not
provide sufficient liquidity or may not be renewed; uncertainties in the capital markets that may restrict or increase our cost of capital or
borrowing; risks associated with a third-party operating our Eagle Ford properties; changes in government regulations that affect the oil and gas
industry; changes in environmental, health and safety regulations; restrictions or costs imposed by climate change initiatives; variations in
interest rates and foreign exchange rates; risks associated with our hedging activities; the cost of developing and operating our assets; risks
related to the accessibility, availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, processing and pipeline systems; depletion of our reserves; risks
associated with the exploitation of our properties and our ability to acquire reserves; changes in income tax or other laws or government
incentive programs; uncertainties associated with estimating petroleum and natural gas reserves; our inability to fully insure against all risks;
risks of counterparty default; risks associated with acquiring, developing and exploring for oil and natural gas and other aspects of our
operations; risks associated with large projects; risks related to our thermal heavy oil projects; risks associated with the ownership of our
securities, including changes in market-based factors and the discretionary nature of dividend payments; risks for United States and other non-
resident shareholders, including the ability to enforce civil remedies, differing practices for reporting reserves and production, additional taxation
applicable to non-residents and foreign exchange risk; and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These and additional risk
factors are discussed in our Annual Information Form, Annual Report on Form 40-F and Management's Discussion and Analysis for the year
ended December 31, 2015, as filed with Canadian securities regulatory authorities and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The above summary of assumptions and risks related to forward-looking statements has been provided in order to provide shareholders and
potential investors with a more complete perspective on Baytex's current and future operations and such information may not be appropriate for
other purposes.
There is no representation by Baytex that actual results achieved will be the same in whole or in part as those referenced in the forward-looking
statements and Baytex does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by applicable securities law.

On March 31, 2016, Baytex amended the credit facilities with its banking syndicate to grant the banking syndicate first priority security over its
assets. The amended revolving extendible secured credit facilities are comprised of a US$25 million operating loan and a US$350 million
syndicated loan for Baytex and a US$200 million syndicated loan for Baytex's wholly-owned subsidiary, Baytex Energy USA, Inc. (collectively,
the "Revolving Facilities").
38    Baytex Energy Corp.    Second Quarter Report 2016
The Revolving Facilities are not borrowing base facilities and do not require annual or semi-annual reviews. The facilities contain standard
commercial covenants and do not require any mandatory principal payments prior to maturity on June 4, 2019. Baytex may request an
extension under the Revolving Facilities which could extend the revolving period for up to four years (subject to a maximum four-year period at
any time). Advances (including letters of credit) under the Revolving Facilities can be drawn in either Canadian or U.S. funds and bear interest
at the bank's prime lending rate, bankers' acceptance discount rates or London Interbank Offered Rates, plus applicable margins. In the event
that Baytex exceeds any of the covenants under the Revolving Facilities, Baytex may be required to repay, refinance or renegotiate the loan
terms and may be restricted from paying dividends to shareholders or taking on further debt.
At June 30, 2016, Baytex was in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the Revolving Facilities. The following table summarizes the
financial covenants contained in the Revolving Facilities and our compliance therewith as at June 30, 2016.

"Senior Secured Debt" is defined as the principal amount of the bank loan and other secured obligations
identified in the credit agreement. As at June 30, 2016, our Senior Secured Debt totaled $359 million.
Bank EBITDA is calculated based on terms and definitions set out in the credit agreement which adjusts net
income (loss) for financing and interest expenses, income tax, certain specific unrealized and non-cash
transactions (including depletion, depreciation, exploration expenses, unrealized gains and losses on financial
derivatives and foreign exchange and stock based compensation) and is calculated based on a trailing twelve
month basis. Bank EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2016 was $417 million.
Interest coverage is computed as the ratio of Bank EBITDA to financing and interest expenses excluding non-
cash interest and accretion on asset retirement obligations, and is calculated on a trailing twelve month basis.
Financing and interest expenses for the twelve months ended June 30, 2016 were $103 million.

at any time exceed 3.8% of the then-issued and outstanding common shares.
Each restricted award entitles the holder to be issued the number of common shares designated in the restricted award (plus dividend
equivalents). Each performance award entitles the holder to be issued the number of common shares designated in the performance award
(plus dividend equivalents) multiplied by a payout multiplier. Both awards are expensed over the vesting period.
The Company recorded compensation expense related to the share awards of $3.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016
($8.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015) and $8.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 ($16.2 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2015).

Expected income tax rate increased due to an increase in the corporate income tax rate in Alberta (from 10% to
12%), offset by a decrease in the Texas franchise tax rate (from 1.00% to 0.75%).
A deferred income tax asset has not been recognized for allowable capital losses of $109 million related to the
unrealized foreign exchange losses arising from the translation of U.S. dollar denominated long-term notes
($149 million as at December 31, 2015).
In June 2016, certain indirect subsidiary entities received reassessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (the "CRA") that deny non-capital
loss deductions relevant to the calculation of income taxes for the years 2011 through 2015. These reassessments follow the previously
disclosed letter from the CRA received by Baytex in November 2014 proposing to issue such reassessments.
Baytex remains confident that the tax filings of the affected entities are correct and will file a notice of objection for each notice of
reassessment received. These notices of objection will be reviewed by the Appeals Division of CRA; a process that Baytex estimates could
take up to two years. If the Appeals Division upholds the notices of reassessment Baytex has the right to appeal to the Tax Court of Canada; a
process that Baytex estimates could take a further two years. Should Baytex be unsuccessful at the Tax Court of Canada, additional appeals
are available; a process that Baytex estimates could take another two years and potentially longer. The reassessments do not require Baytex
to pay any amounts in order to participate in the appeals process.
By way of background, Baytex acquired all of the interests in several privately held commercial trusts in 2010 with accumulated non-capital
losses of $591 million (the "Losses"). The Losses were subsequently used to reduce the taxable income of those trusts. The reassessments
disallow the deduction of the Losses under the general anti-avoidance rule of the Income Tax Act (Canada). If, after exhausting available
appeals, the deduction of Losses continues to be disallowed, Baytex would owe cash taxes for the years 2012 through 2015 and an additional
amount for late payment interest. The amount of cash taxes owing and the late payment interest are dependent upon the amount of unused tax
shelter available to offset the reassessed income, including tax shelter from future years available for "carry back" to the years 2012
through 2015.
