<p>1. The Government of Brunei Darussalam has carefully examined the 189 
</p>
<p>recommendations that it received during the nineteenth session of the Working Group of 
</p>
<p>the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council.  Brunei Darussalam accepts 
</p>
<p>97 recommendations, including those that have already been put into practice or are being 
</p>
<p>implemented. 
</p>
<p>2. The partial support to 14 recommendations means that Brunei Darussalam agrees on 
</p>
<p>a part of the recommendation and takes note of the other part, because they may be contrary 
</p>
<p>to the Constitution of Brunei Darussalam; the official religion of Brunei Darussalam; its 
</p>
<p>national legislation; and without prejudice to the generality of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>3. Brunei Darussalam does not accept 78 recommendations because they may be 
</p>
<p>contrary to the Constitution of Brunei Darussalam; the official religion of Brunei 
</p>
<p>Darussalam; its national legislation; and without prejudice to the generality of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations.  The specific replies are as follows: 
</p>
<p><i>Recommendation Position 
</i></p>
<p>113.1. <b>Partially Accepted 
</b></p>
<p>Brunei Darussalam remains committed to its international obligations.  Brunei 
</p>
<p>Darussalam is already party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women (CEDAW); and the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>the Child (CRC); and is looking to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
</p>
<p>with Disabilities (CRPD); and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child on the involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OP-CRC-
</p>

</p>
<p>Brunei Darussalam wishes to retain its reservations, as well as any other aspects of 
</p>
<p>CEDAW and CRC.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>On CRC, Brunei Darussalam maintains its reservation to Article 14, paragraph 3 of 
</p>
<p>Article 20; and paragraph (b)-(e) of Article 21. 
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, Brunei Darussalam withdrew its reservations on paragraphs 
</p>
<p>1 and 2 of Article 20 relating to the protection of a child without a family, as well 
</p>
<p>as paragraph (a) of Article 21 of the Convention pertaining to the law on adoption. 
</p>
<p>On CEDAW, Brunei Darussalam maintains its reservation on Article 9 (2) of the 
</p>
<p>Convention. 
</p>
<p>Procedures are available for children of women citizens married to foreign 
</p>
<p>nationals to be accorded Brunei citizenship through an application process, 
</p>
<p>pursuant to Section 6 of the Brunei Nationality Act.  In view that Brunei 
</p>
<p>Darussalam has a policy of single nationality, children of women citizens may 
</p>
<p>either be registered as Brunei nationals or the nationals as that of the father.

<p>Despite not being a party to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of

<p>Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, Brunei

<p>Darussalam supports the fundamental nature of the role of the United Nations High

<p>Commissioner for Refugees and its Office to provide international<b> </b>protection 
</p>
<p>including refugees and displaced persons, and the need for the Government to

<p>Brunei Darussalam has ratified two of the eight fundamental International Labour

</p>
<p>international commitments, current and future, are or will be consistent with 
</p>
<p>national laws, regulations and policies. Current labour legislation as well as 
</p>

</p>
<p>Darussalam are protected, provided adequate housing, are employed in conditions 
</p>
<p>that are not harmful to their individual safety as well as have access to dispute </p>

<p>In practice, all educational institutions are not allowed to carry out any corporal 
</p>
<p>punishment. Furthermore, directives have been reviewed to prohibit such actions in 
</p>
<p>schools. 
</p>
<p>The Action Team on Child Protection (ATOCP) established under the Children 
</p>
<p>and Young Person&#8217;s Act oversees cases of child abuse which includes corporal 
</p>
<p>punishment. The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on child abuse (which 
</p>
<p>includes corporal punishment) involves many agencies including law enforcement 
</p>
<p>agencies, medical officers and social workers. 
</p>
<p>Awareness campaigns and Parenting Skills programmes are constantly conducted

<p>to educate the public and parents on alternative forms of discipline.

<p>Subject to the provisions of relevant laws including the Sedition Act (Cap 24), 
</p>
<p>Undesirable Publications Act (Cap 25) and the Newspaper Act (Cap 105), an 
</p>
<p>individual may peacefully exercise his/her right to freedom of expression. There is 
</p>
<p>a need to balance freedom of expression with the need to protect people from being 
</p>
<p>defamed. The current provisions of the legislation are sufficient to protect such 
</p>
<p>freedom and maintain public order.

<p>Brunei Darussalam highly regards the importance of freedom of religion of its 
</p>
<p>population including those others residing in the country. In accordance with the 
</p>
<p>Constitution, Islam is the official religion and other religious faiths are also 
</p>
<p>practised in peace and harmony. 
</p>
<p>The Syariah Penal Code Order 2013 is necessary to strengthen the current criminal 
</p>
<p>law and the current provisions of the domestic legislation are sufficient to protect 
</p>
<p>such freedom and maintain public order.

<p>Current legislation addresses and governs the right to form trade unions i.e. Trade 
</p>
<p>Union Act (Cap 128). Furthermore, Brunei Darussalam does not restrict the 
</p>
<p>formation of workers&#8217; associations whose principal purposes of which are under its 
</p>
<p>constitution the regulation of the relations between workers and employers, or 
</p>
<p>between workers and workers, or between employers and employers within Brunei 
</p>
<p>Darussalam. 
</p>
<p>The rights to assembly are governed by the Public Order Act (Cap 148). The Act 
</p>
<p>requires any person who wishes to organise a meeting in a public place to obtain 
</p>
<p>permission from the Commissioner of the Royal Brunei Police Force before such 
</p>
<p>meeting can be held. Such requirement is required so as to ensure that the assembly 
</p>
<p>would not prejudice public peace and order. 
</p>
<p>The rights to association are governed by the Societies Act (Cap 203). The Act 
</p>
<p>regulates associations in Brunei Darussalam and acts as a mechanism necessary to 
</p>
<p>safeguard the peace and harmony of the country.
