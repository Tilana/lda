<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to its decision 25/117, the Human Rights Council held a panel discussion 
</p>
<p>on the right to privacy in the digital age on 12 September 2014. The discussion took 
</p>
<p>account of the issues raised in the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights submitted to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh session 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/27/37). 
</p>
<p>2. Based on the request of the Human Rights Council, the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>the right to privacy in the digital age in the context of domestic and extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>surveillance, the interception of digital communications and the collection of personal data, 
</p>
<p>including on a mass scale, also with a view to identifying challenges and best practices, 
</p>
<p>taking into account the report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, were examined 
</p>
<p>in the course of the panel discussion. 
</p>
<p>3. The panel discussion was chaired by the President of the Human Rights Council,  
</p>
<p>and moderated by Marko Milanovic, Associate Professor at Nottingham University. The 
</p>
<p>United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights gave an opening address. 
</p>
<p>The panellists were Catalina Botero, Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, Inter-
</p>
<p>American Commission on Human Rights, Sarah Cleveland, Louis Henkin Professor of 
</p>
<p>Human and Constitutional Rights, Columbia Law School, Yves Nissim, Deputy Chief 
</p>
<p>Corporate Social Responsibility Officer, Orange, former Chair of the Telecommunications 
</p>
<p>Industry Dialogue, and Carly Nyst, Legal Director, Privacy International. 
</p>
<p>4. In its decision 25/117, the Council requested the Office of the High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>to present a summary report of the panel discussion at its twenty-eighth session. The 
</p>
<p>present report is submitted pursuant to that request. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Opening statement by the United Nations Deputy High 
Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Deputy High Commissioner noted that, in a very short space of time, digital 
</p>
<p>communications technologies had revolutionized the way human beings interact and that 
</p>
<p>for millions of people, the digital age was one of emancipation &#8211; perhaps the greatest 
</p>
<p>liberation movement the world had ever known. She noted as an example that over one 
</p>
<p>million people had participated electronically in the open dialogue and consultation that 
</p>
<p>was conducted to develop a framework for the post-2015 sustainable development goals, 
</p>
<p>which called for the full inclusion of human rights. She emphasized that human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, activists, democratic voices, minorities and others could now communicate via 
</p>
<p>digital platforms and participate in the global debate in ways that were previously 
</p>
<p>inconceivable. 
</p>
<p>6. The Deputy High Commissioner also noted that those digital platforms were 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to surveillance, interception and data collection. Deep concerns had been 
</p>
<p>expressed, as policies and practices that exploited that vulnerability had been exposed 
</p>
<p>across the globe. She added that surveillance practices could have a very real impact on 
</p>
<p>peoples&#8217; human rights, including their rights to privacy to freedom of expression and 
</p>
<p>opinion, to freedom of assembly, to family life and to health. In particular, information 
</p>
<p>collected through digital surveillance had been used to target dissidents and there were 
</p>
<p>credible reports suggesting that digital technologies had been used to gather information 
</p>
<p>that led to torture and other forms of ill-treatment.  </p>


<p>7. The Deputy High Commissioner recalled that in resolution 68/167, the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly had requested the High Commissioner to submit a report on &#8220;the protection and 
</p>
<p>promotion of the right to privacy in the context of domestic and extraterritorial surveillance 
</p>
<p>and/or the interception of digital communications and the collection of personal data, 
</p>
<p>including on a mass scale&#8221;, which was presented to the Human Rights Council at its 
</p>
<p>twenty-seventh session. The report built on expert consultations and in-depth research 
</p>
<p>regarding existing national and international legislation and jurisprudence, and information 
</p>
<p>from a broad range of sources, including replies to a questionnaire sent out to stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>8. As the report made clear, international human rights law provided a robust and 
</p>
<p>universal framework for the promotion and protection of the right to privacy, including in 
</p>
<p>the context of domestic and extraterritorial surveillance; the interception of digital 
</p>
<p>communications; and the collection of personal data. However, practices in many States 
</p>
<p>revealed a lack of adequate national legislation and enforcement, weak procedural 
</p>
<p>safeguards and ineffective oversight, which contributed to widespread impunity for 
</p>
<p>arbitrary or unlawful interference with the right to privacy. 
</p>
<p>9. The Deputy High Commissioner recalled that the High Commissioner&#8217;s report 
</p>
<p>examined the protection afforded by international human rights law regarding privacy, 
</p>
<p>including the meaning of &#8220;interference with privacy&#8221; in online communications; the 
</p>
<p>definition of &#8220;arbitrary and unlawful&#8221; interference in that context; and the question of 
</p>
<p>whose rights were protected, and where. For instance, on the question of what constituted 
</p>
<p>privacy interference, it was clear that the aggregation of communications data might give a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive insight into an individual&#8217;s behaviour, social relationships, private 
</p>
<p>preferences and identity, extending even beyond the information obtained by reading 
</p>
<p>someone&#8217;s mail. The collection and retention of communications data might therefore 
</p>
<p>constitute an interference with privacy, whether or not those data were subsequently 
</p>
<p>consulted or used. The very existence of a mass surveillance programme regarding email 
</p>
<p>communication and other forms of digital expression created an interference with privacy, 
</p>
<p>and the onus was on the State to demonstrate that such interference was neither unlawful 
</p>
<p>nor arbitrary.  
</p>
<p>10. Turning to &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; or &#8220;unlawful&#8221; interference with privacy, the report noted that 
</p>
<p>State surveillance of electronic communications data might be a legitimate law enforcement 
</p>
<p>measure, if it was conducted in compliance with the law. But States must demonstrate that 
</p>
<p>the surveillance was both necessary and proportionate to the specific risk being addressed. 
</p>
<p>Mandatory third-party data retention &#8211; whereby telephone companies and Internet service 
</p>
<p>providers were required to store metadata about communications by their customers, for 
</p>
<p>subsequent access by law enforcement and intelligence agencies &#8211; appeared neither 
</p>
<p>necessary nor proportionate. 
</p>
<p>11. As stressed in the report, the Deputy High Commissioner recalled that States had an 
</p>
<p>obligation to ensure that the privacy of individuals was protected by law against unlawful 
</p>
<p>or arbitrary interference. All forms of communications surveillance must be conducted on 
</p>
<p>the basis of publicly accessible law; and that law must in turn comply with the 
</p>
<p>constitutional regime of the State concerned and international human rights law. Secret 
</p>
<p>rules and secret interpretations of the law &#8211; even if issued by judges &#8211; were not compatible 
</p>
<p>with the principle that laws should be clear and accessible. Neither were laws or rules that 
</p>
<p>gave excessive discretion to executive authorities, such as the security and intelligence 
</p>
<p>services. 
</p>
<p>12. The Deputy High Commissioner also mentioned the concerns raised in the report 
</p>
<p>regarding extraterritorial surveillance and the interception of digital communications. 
</p>
<p>Drawing on the work of the Human Rights Committee and the International Court of 
</p>
<p>Justice regarding the determination of when a State exercises jurisdiction, the report noted 
</p>
<p>that the human rights obligations of a State were engaged whenever it exercised power or </p>


<p>effective control. If surveillance involved the exercise of power or effective control by a 
</p>
<p>State in relation to digital communications infrastructure, then wherever it might be taking 
</p>
<p>place, that surveillance might engage the human rights obligations of the State. That would 
</p>
<p>include, for example, direct tapping or penetration of a communications infrastructure and 
</p>
<p>exercise by the State of regulatory jurisdiction over a third party which physically 
</p>
<p>controlled the data.  
</p>
<p>13. The report recalled that international human rights law was also explicit on the 
</p>
<p>principle of non-discrimination and that States must take measures to ensure that any 
</p>
<p>interference with the right to privacy complied with the principles of legality, 
</p>
<p>proportionality and necessity, regardless of the ethnicity, nationality, location or other 
</p>
<p>status of the people whose communications it was monitoring. 
</p>
<p>14. The report also referred to the essential nature of procedural safeguards and effective 
</p>
<p>oversight to safeguard the right to privacy in law and in practice. A lack of effective 
</p>
<p>oversight had contributed to impunity for arbitrary or unlawful intrusions on the right to 
</p>
<p>privacy in the digital environment. Internal safeguards devoid of independent oversight had 
</p>
<p>been demonstrably ineffective against unlawful or arbitrary surveillance methods. 
</p>
<p>Appropriate safeguards must include independent civilian oversight and participation from 
</p>
<p>all branches of Government, in order to ensure the effective protection of the law. States 
</p>
<p>also had a legal obligation to provide effective remedies for violations of privacy through 
</p>
<p>digital surveillance, in judicial, legislative or administrative forms, with procedures that 
</p>
<p>were known and accessible.  
</p>
<p>15. Finally, the Deputy High Commissioner referred to the role of the private sector, an 
</p>
<p>issue also addressed in the report of the High Commissioner. Governments increasingly 
</p>
<p>relied on corporations to conduct and facilitate digital surveillance. In some cases there 
</p>
<p>might be legitimate reasons for a company to provide user data. But when the request was 
</p>
<p>in violation of human rights law, or where the information was used in violation of human 
</p>
<p>rights law, that company risked being complicit in human rights abuses. The Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles on Business and Human Rights, endorsed by the Human Rights Council in 
</p>
<p>resolution 17/4 of 16 June 2011, provided a global standard for preventing and addressing 
</p>
<p>adverse the human rights effects of business activity. They made clear that the 
</p>
<p>responsibility to protect human rights applied throughout a company&#8217;s global operations, 
</p>
<p>regardless of where its users were located, and independently of whether a State met its 
</p>
<p>own human rights obligations. Many corporations appeared to be insufficiently aware of 
</p>
<p>those issues. 
</p>
<p>16. The Deputy High Commissioner concluded by noting that the lack of government 
</p>
<p>transparency regarding the measures that they had adopted that might impact on the right to 
</p>
<p>privacy, often rendered attempts to address the gaps and exercise accountability extremely 
</p>
<p>arduous. She concluded that there was a clear need for further discussion and in-depth 
</p>
<p>analysis as information regarding those measures became public. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Contributions of panellists 
</b></p>
<p>17. In response to questions from the moderator, the initial remarks of the panellists 
</p>
<p>focused on issues linked to the international human rights law framework with respect to 
</p>
<p>the right to privacy, including procedural safeguards, effective oversight and right to a 
</p>
<p>remedy, as well as the role of the business sector.  
</p>
<p>18. The Legal Director at Privacy International highlighted the importance of privacy in 
any democratic society and stressed the links between privacy and the concept of human 
</p>
<p>dignity. She noted that the right to privacy was a fundamental precondition to, and 
</p>
<p>guarantor of, other rights, as it enabled individuals to independently develop thoughts and </p>


<p>ideas that could be freely expressed, to choose which religion in which to worship and 
</p>
<p>which political party to support. Ms. Nyst explained that the right to privacy was first 
</p>
<p>articulated in international law in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, when the 
</p>
<p>drafters were clear not only about the necessity of the inclusion of the right to privacy, but 
</p>
<p>also about the importance of the right to privacy of communications, as shown by the 
</p>
<p><i>travaux preparatoires</i> to the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>19. Ms. Nyst noted that many common actions done on a daily basis included a 
</p>
<p>&#8220;communication&#8221;, such as sending an e-mail or a text message, accessing a bank account, 
</p>
<p>searching for information on the Internet, or accessing government services. Any digital 
</p>
<p>communication involved private data travelling around the world, and through the cables of 
</p>
<p>many private companies, before it reached its destination. The challenge that technology 
</p>
<p>posed to privacy was to ensure that the obligations of the State to respect, fulfil and protect 
</p>
<p>the right to privacy and the responsibilities of the private sector were meaningful in the 
</p>
<p>digital era. She noted that the legal framework already existed, as the right to privacy was 
</p>
<p>enshrined in most international and regional human rights treaties and in many national 
</p>
<p>constitutions, and that a new understanding of how those texts applied was needed. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression of the Inter-American 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights referred to the opportunities for the free expression, 
</p>
<p>communication and exchange of information created by the Internet. She noted that, at the 
</p>
<p>same time, the capture, storage, and administration of enormous quantities of data had also 
</p>
<p>been facilitated. That information, whether content data or metadata, could be highly 
</p>
<p>revealing of even the most intimate aspects of the private lives of individuals or 
</p>
<p>communities. She noted that legal frameworks had not followed the pace of technological 
</p>
<p>developments in the digital era, and stressed the need for regulation of both the collection 
</p>
<p>and analysis of information, taking into account freedom of expression, the right to privacy 
</p>
<p>and other relevant human rights. 
</p>
<p>21. Ms. Botero further noted that surveillance policies could have an impact on a broad 
</p>
<p>spectrum of human rights. She referred to the impact of surveillance on the right to freedom 
</p>
<p>of expression, either directly when the right could not be exercised anonymously as a 
</p>
<p>consequence of surveillance, or indirectly, because the mere existence of surveillance could 
</p>
<p>have a chilling effect, instil fear and inhibition and make individuals cautious about what 
</p>
<p>they said and did. She explained that, because the right to freedom of expression was a 
</p>
<p>platform right, its violation could also lead to the violation of other rights, including 
</p>
<p>freedom of association, freedom of assembly, religious freedoms and the right to health. 
</p>
<p>Because of the potential impact of surveillance activities on the entire human rights 
</p>
<p>architecture, there was a need for States to revise their laws to establish limits on 
</p>
<p>surveillance programmes, which should include respect for the principles of necessity and 
</p>
<p>proportionality, and appropriate monitoring mechanisms. Ms. Botero explained that 
</p>
<p>because the Internet was a special and unique communications medium that enabled the 
</p>
<p>free, plural, and democratic exercise of the right to freedom of expression, its governance 
</p>
<p>was a particularly relevant matter. She noted that in order to make sure that all relevant 
</p>
<p>points of view could be properly considered, States must ensure the equal participation of 
</p>
<p>all actors relevant to the governance of the Internet and foster strengthened cooperation 
</p>
<p>between the authorities, academia, civil society, the scientific and technical communities 
</p>
<p>and the private sector, both nationally and internationally. 
</p>
<p>22. The Louis Henkin Professor of Human and Constitutional Rights at Columbia Law 
</p>
<p>School stated that all persons, regardless of location or nationality, were protected by 
</p>
<p>human rights that were universal and inherent to human dignity. She noted that State 
</p>
<p>surveillance practices sometimes distinguished between citizens and non-citizens. In that 
</p>
<p>regard, Ms. Cleveland stressed that, as recognized by the Human Rights Committee, the 
</p>
<p>principle of non-discrimination in article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and </p>


<p>Political Rights protected citizens and non-citizens alike.1 Consequently, neither citizens 
</p>
<p>nor non-citizens might be subjected to unlawful or arbitrary interference with their privacy. 
</p>
<p>She also noted that surveillance was often undertaken by States on their own territory, to 
</p>
<p>suppress freedom of expression and association, or to punish journalists, dissidents and 
</p>
<p>other government critics. According to article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, States had the obligation to respect and ensure the privacy rights of all 
</p>
<p>persons within their territory and subject to their jurisdiction.  
</p>
<p>23. Ms. Cleveland emphasized that the protections in the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights applied to persons otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of a State, 
</p>
<p>as recognized by the International Court of Justice2 and the Human Rights Committee.3 
</p>
<p>That was also the reading that best reconciled the text of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights with its content, object and purpose. The Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee had long recognized that a State could not avoid its international human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations by taking action outside its territory that it would be prohibited from taking at 
</p>
<p>home. Ms. Cleveland explained that cyber activity transcended territory, that digital 
</p>
<p>surveillance could involve the minimal exercise of physical control by the State over a 
</p>
<p>person or territory and could involve action in one location that had an impact upon a 
</p>
<p>person in another. She stressed that such conduct could engage the human rights obligations 
</p>
<p>of a State. Lastly, she noted that the fact that privacy rights applied to non-citizens or 
</p>
<p>nationals abroad did not mean that surveillance activities were per se always unlawful. Any 
</p>
<p>restriction to the right to privacy to accommodate legitimate national security or law 
</p>
<p>enforcement interests must be adopted while taking full account of the requirements, as 
</p>
<p>provided in international human rights law; in particular they must not be arbitrary or 
</p>
<p>unlawful. 
</p>
<p>24. Turning to the role of the private sector, the moderator, Mr. Milanovic, noted that 
</p>
<p>private companies aggregated data for their own purposes, and might also be co-opted into 
</p>
<p>governmental schemes. Focussing on the relationship between Governments and private 
</p>
<p>telecommunication companies, he asked how private companies should react to government 
</p>
<p>requests. The Deputy Chief Corporate Social Responsibility Officer at Orange noted that 
</p>
<p>issues relating to various requests that a telecommunication company might receive to 
</p>
<p>collect or keep data regarding their customers or to make their networks &#8220;wiretap-ready&#8221; 
</p>
<p>became more vivid during the Arab Spring. Telecommunication companies had received 
</p>
<p>requests from Governments &#8211; in some cases at gunpoint &#8211; that might have had an impact on 
</p>
<p>the the rights to freedom of expression and  privacy of their customers. That had led those 
</p>
<p>companies to create the Telecommunications Industry Dialogue on Freedom of Expression 
</p>
<p>and Privacy, to jointly address issues related to freedom of expression and the right to 
</p>
<p>privacy in the telecommunications sector.4 The Dialogue had published a set of 10 guiding 
</p>
<p>principles on 12 March 2013, which were influenced by the Guiding Principles on Business 
</p>
<p>and Human Rights: implementing the United Nations &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Framework. The principles published by the Dialogue addressed privacy and freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression as they related to the telecommunications sector, specifically exploring the 
</p>

<p>interaction and boundaries between the duty of a Government to protect human rights and 
</p>
<p>the responsibility of telecommunications companies to respect human rights.  
</p>
<p>25. In terms of challenges, Mr. Nissim emphasized that telecommunications companies 
</p>
<p>had many personnel on the ground in various countries and that their safety and security 
</p>
<p>was an absolute priority, as recognized in the fifth guiding principle.5 He also noted that, 
</p>
<p>while the companies engaged in the Telecommunications Industry Dialogue wanted to 
</p>
<p>uphold human rights, in particular freedom of expression and the right to privacy, it was 
</p>
<p>important to recall that they had licence agreements with Governments and were subject to 
</p>
<p>national laws and regulations. Because of the need to protect their staff who were present 
</p>
<p>in-country, companies needed to be able to engage in a dialogue with host Governments 
</p>
<p>whenever necessary. He noted that there were three pressing issues that needed to be 
</p>
<p>resolved. First, Governments should not request or be granted direct access to the 
</p>
<p>telecommunications network. Second, the process through which Governments could make 
</p>
<p>requests to telecommunications companies must be clear and transparent. Third, while 
</p>
<p>telecommunications companies were willing to be transparent about the requests they 
</p>
<p>received, transparency was the responsibility first and foremost of Governments.  
</p>
<p>26. Turning to the conditions for the lawful restriction of the right to privacy and 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression, Ms. Botero explained that any limitation must be established 
</p>
<p>beforehand by legislation. Such laws must precisely define the causes and conditions that 
</p>
<p>would enable the State to intercept the communications of individuals, collect 
</p>
<p>communications data or subject them to surveillance or monitoring that had an impact on 
</p>
<p>the right to privacy. The law must not be vague or ambiguous, or grant broad discretionary 
</p>
<p>powers to the executive power in its interpretation. It must also provide safeguards 
</p>
<p>pertaining to the nature, scope and duration of surveillance measures. Limitations to the 
</p>
<p>right to privacy must also pursue a legitimate aim. In the case of surveillance, the grounds 
</p>
<p>most likely to be relied upon by the State were national security and the fight against crime. 
</p>
<p>Any limitation must be proportionate and strictly necessary. That means that a true and 
</p>
<p>compelling need to impose the limitation must be clearly established and the objective 
</p>
<p>could not be accomplished by any other less restrictive measure. In any event, the rights 
</p>
<p>should be limited only when the risk to the protected interest, narrowly defined, was greater 
</p>
<p>than the general interest in maintaining the right to privacy and freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Botero also noted that the test must be stronger when the rights protected dealt with the 
</p>
<p>most intimate aspects of a person&#8217;s private life. In order to ensure the protection of the 
</p>
<p>principles of legality, proportionality and necessity, decisions to undertake surveillance 
</p>
<p>activities that limited the right to privacy and other rights should be authorized by 
</p>
<p>independent judicial authorities.  
</p>
<p>27. With regard to proportionality, Ms. Cleveland noted that a measure should be 
</p>
<p>proportionate to the significance of the interests at stake: the interest of the State in 
</p>
<p>pursuing the measure and the privacy interest of the individual. She explained that the more 
</p>
<p>acute the privacy interest of the individual, the more narrowly tailored the measure must be. 
</p>
<p>She referred to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, which provided a 
</p>
<p>reasonable margin of appreciation to States, especially in the national security area, to 
</p>
<p>determine on a case-by-case basis what measures were necessary and proportionate to the 
</p>
<p>achievement of a particular State interest. Ms. Cleveland also noted the importance of the 
</p>
<p>procedural safeguards put in place by the State to ensure that the surveillance regime was 
</p>
<p>being applied properly. She noted that there needed to be legal safeguards to define the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 Principle 5 states &#8220;Always seek to ensure the safety and liberty of company personnel who may be 
</p>
<p>placed at risk&#8221;. </p>


<p>regime, as well as oversight and remedies ex post facto to make sure that the regime was 
</p>
<p>not abused. 
</p>
<p>28. Mr. Milanovic noted that States often made a distinction between the collection of 
</p>
<p>the content of a communication, on the one hand, and data about the communication, or 
</p>
<p>metadata, on the other, with the former subject to stronger safeguards than the latter. He 
</p>
<p>asked whether such distinctions were relevant regarding digital communications. Ms. Nyst 
</p>
<p>noted that such distinctions must be unequivocally abandoned, as they reflected an outdated 
</p>
<p>understanding of the nature of today&#8217;s communications and a failure to update laws 
</p>
<p>accordingly. She noted that such distinctions dated back to an era where there was indeed a 
</p>
<p>difference between the envelope and the content of the envelope, whereas when looking at 
</p>
<p>digital communications, the so-called envelope, or metadata, contained very sensitive, 
</p>
<p>valuable and extensive information. For instance, that information could be derived from 
</p>
<p>the metadata and analysed to obtain information about an individual&#8217;s political or religious 
</p>
<p>beliefs. She referred to a study by Stanford University, which showed that medical, 
</p>
<p>financial and legal information could be obtained from metadata. She stressed the serious 
</p>
<p>need, therefore, to re-evaluate that distinction, as noted in the report of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner. Ms. Nyst noted progress in several countries, which had recognized the 
</p>
<p>need for increased protection of metadata. She also noted that the European Court of Justice 
</p>
<p>had recently invalidated the blanket data retention law6 and concluded that there was a trend 
</p>
<p>towards increased protection of metadata. However, Ms. Nyst stressed that further guidance 
</p>
<p>on how domestic laws should follow suit was needed. 
</p>
<p>29. From an operator&#8217;s perspective, Mr. Nissim said that data such as tracking calls was 
</p>
<p>often retained by telecommunications companies for technical reasons, to ensure the quality 
</p>
<p>of services and networks. He noted, however, that when Governments asked 
</p>
<p>telecommunications companies to retain the information collected for longer periods of 
</p>
<p>time, or to provide access, the information could be misused. He added that any access by 
</p>
<p>Governments should require legislation. Mr. Nissim also noted that where the level of &#8220;big 
</p>
<p>data&#8221; was reached, and if the information was anonymized, it could be used in a very 
</p>
<p>positive way, e.g. for urban planning, transportation and communications.

<p><b> A. General remarks on the right to privacy in the digital age 
</b></p>
<p>32. Many delegations highlighted the quality of the report submitted by the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner on the right to privacy in the digital age and the fact that it was an important 
</p>
<p>milestone in the context of the ongoing discussion. Many delegations also noted their 
</p>
<p>appreciation for the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights (OHCHR) and others in ensuring that the right to privacy was safeguarded 
</p>
<p>in law and in practice.  
</p>
<p>33. Many delegations welcomed the panel discussion, as the topic was timely and the 
</p>
<p>discussion necessary, bearing in mind that technological advances ran ahead of an 
</p>
<p>understanding of their human rights implications. The importance of discussions held on 
</p>
<p>the issue by the Human Rights Council, as well as in other forums, such as the Internet 
</p>
<p>Governance Forum, was also noted. 
</p>
<p>34. One delegation noted that there were close to 3 billion Internet users around the 
</p>
<p>world and that a free and secure Internet had become a priority for people everywhere. As 
</p>
<p>foreseen in the post-2015 sustainable development goals and the Programme of Action for 
</p>
<p>the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011&#8211;2020 (A/CONF.219/3/Rev.1), 
</p>
<p>everyone should have access to the Internet by 2020.  
</p>
<p>35. Most interventions indicated, as already highlighted in the report of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner, that innovations in technology had had a positive impact on 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression, had facilitated global debate and had fostered democratic 
</p>
<p>participation. It was noted that digital communications could be tools for facilitating the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights, had contributed to the advancement of human civilization, and 
</p>
<p>had brought new opportunities for communication, knowledge and business. Privacy was 
</p>
<p>integral to a free, fair and open society in which views could be freely expressed without 
</p>
<p>any fear of repression or detention.  
</p>
<p>36. Most delegations noted, however, that the same technological platforms had also 
</p>
<p>enhanced the capacities of State and non-State actors to conduct surveillance, interception 
</p>
<p>and mass data collection. Some delegations stated that those platforms were not only 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to mass surveillance, but actually facilitated it. One NGO noted that when 
</p>
<p>privacy online was threatened, trust in the Internet disappeared, depriving everyone, 
</p>
<p>including journalists, bloggers and human rights defenders, of the liberty to communicate 
</p>
<p>securely, anonymously and in confidence, with a chilling effect on freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>Another NGO emphasized that for everyone, especially those living under repressive 
</p>
<p>regimes, the integrity of communications was critical to preserving individual liberty and 
</p>
<p>security of the person, as well as political rights.  
</p>
<p>37. The exponential growth of State power in some countries due to their information 
</p>
<p>technology infrastructure was noted. Some delegations focused on the fact that much of the 
</p>
<p>world&#8217;s electronic communications passed through a limited number of countries. In turn, 
</p>
<p>that provided an opportunity for intercepting private communications. Some countries had 
</p>
<p>developed technologies that allowed access to much of the world&#8217;s global Internet traffic, 
</p>
<p>call records, individuals&#8217; electronic address books and huge volumes of other digital 
</p>
<p>communications content. Reports of certain Governments monitoring communications at 
</p>
<p>global events were also referred to. A number of speakers recalled that the sovereignty of 
</p>
<p>States should always be respected with regard to surveillance, interception and the 
</p>
<p>collection of personal data. 
</p>
<p>38. Other delegations noted that there was a growing trend by some Governments to use 
</p>
<p>cybertechnologies to control their own citizens, in violation of their right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression and the right of access to information. It was noted that political activists and 
</p>
<p>members of religious minorities were targeted, detained and sometimes killed. An NGO </p>


<p>noted that the effects of online surveillance were often felt offline and were part of a global 
</p>
<p>trend to restrict civic space. Lawful protest movements were monitored by the State and 
</p>
<p>private actors to undermine peaceful actions and related rights, in particular the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression and assembly.  
</p>
<p>39. Most delegations reaffirmed that rights held by people offline must also be protected 
</p>
<p>online, as set out in General Assembly resolution 68/167 and Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 20/8 and 26/13.  
</p>
<p>40. Most delegations considered the right to privacy a precondition to being able to 
</p>
<p>freely express oneself and one of the founding rights of a democratic society. Many 
</p>
<p>delegations noted that surveillance had an impact on rights other than the right to privacy, 
</p>
<p>in particular freedom of expression and of opinion and freedom of assembly and 
</p>
<p>association. It was further noted that privacy and freedom of expression were &#8220;interlinked 
</p>
<p>and mutually dependent&#8221; (see A/HRC/23/40, para. 79) and that they enabled and facilitated 
</p>
<p>the development of other fundamental rights and sustainable development. To illustrate 
</p>
<p>this, two NGOs noted the concrete harm that large-scale electronic surveillance could have 
</p>
<p>on the work of journalists and lawyers, undermining freedom of expression and association 
</p>
<p>and the right to counsel.7 One delegation referred to attempts to silence the media. Another 
</p>
<p>NGO referred to bloggers facing charges of terrorism, partly because they had encrypted 
</p>
<p>their communications and engaged in digital security training to ensure their privacy. 
</p>
<p>41. One delegation noted that individuals were often not aware of the extent to which 
</p>
<p>data could be used or shared, even when collected with their consent. Some delegations 
</p>
<p>referred to the right to data protection and to the Council of Europe Convention for the 
</p>
<p>Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data and its 
</p>
<p>additional Protocol as the first binding international instrument in the data protection field 
</p>
<p>and an important contribution to the right to privacy. One delegation referred to a so-called 
</p>
<p>&#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221;, where the legitimate wish not to be associated with only a particular 
</p>
<p>aspect of one&#8217;s life or past might clash with the right to be informed and might also lead to 
</p>
<p>a distortion in collective memory.  
</p>
<p>42. Many delegations highlighted the measures taken at national level to ensure 
</p>
<p>protection of the right to privacy in the digital age. UNESCO referred to its work in relation 
</p>
<p>to privacy and freedom of expression in the digital age, to a publication on internet privacy 
</p>
<p>and freedom and expression and to a comprehensive study on Internet issues, including a 
</p>
<p>focus on freedom of expression, privacy, access to knowledge and information and the 
</p>
<p>ethics of the information society. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal protection of the right to privacy 
</b></p>
<p>43. Most delegations emphasized that international law provided a clear framework for 
</p>
<p>the right to privacy, enshrined in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Many observed, 
</p>
<p>however, that the implementation of the right to privacy was lacking and that there was a 
</p>
<p>need for concrete measures to safeguard that right. Some noted that unilateral and 
</p>
<p>unauthorized access to private data and extensive surveillance needed to be addressed 
</p>
<p>comprehensively and calls were made for urgent measures to be taken to stop current 
</p>
<p>surveillance practices and protect individuals from violations of their right to privacy.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 Human Rights Watch and American Civil Liberties Union, &#8220;With liberty to monitor all: how large-
</p>
<p>scale US surveillance is harming journalism, law and American democracy&#8221; (July 2014). </p>


<p>44. Many delegations recalled that any limitation to the right to privacy must be based 
</p>
<p>on accessible, transparent, clear, comprehensive and non-discriminatory laws and be 
</p>
<p>limited to what was necessary to safeguard the public interest in a democratic society. Any 
</p>
<p>state surveillance of individuals must be proportionate and fair, in compliance with 
</p>
<p>international norms and standards, governed by the rule of law and subject to oversight. 
</p>
<p>There must be adequate and effective guarantees against abuses. It was noted that defining 
</p>
<p>the line between arbitrary or unlawful interference in the right to privacy properly would be 
</p>
<p>one of the challenges of the next few years. It was also stressed that blanket surveillance 
</p>
<p>could amount to an unjustified infringement. One delegation noted that article 17 of the 
</p>
<p>Covenant must be the basis for discussion of the limiting principles &#8211; legality and 
</p>
<p>arbitrariness &#8211; expressly stated therein.  
</p>
<p>45. Several delegations noted that States had legitimate security concerns, including the 
</p>
<p>threat of terrorism and cybercrime. One delegation noted that the use of the Internet for 
</p>
<p>criminal and antisocial activities was on the rise. Another delegation noted that security 
</p>
<p>required intelligence, including with regard to digital communications to counter terrorism, 
</p>
<p>while another stated that Governments had the responsibility to protect individuals, and that 
</p>
<p>data surveillance could be an effective and legitimate measure for law enforcement 
</p>
<p>purposes. There was broad agreement, however, that legitimate security concerns needed to 
</p>
<p>be addressed within the framework of international human rights law, including the right to 
</p>
<p>privacy.  
</p>
<p>46. In response to a question about data-sharing between government agencies, 
</p>
<p>Ms. Nyst stated that the same oversight and procedural guarantees should apply to 
</p>
<p>information collected directly and obtained through the sharing of information. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Cleveland noted that the Human Rights Committee had expressed concern in that 
</p>
<p>regard.8 Data sharing between various State agencies within a given country could be 
</p>
<p>legitimate, provided the purpose of the collection and use of that data was the same for each 
</p>
<p>of those agencies, so as to ensure compliance with the principles of necessity and 
</p>
<p>proportionality and therefore no breach of the right to privacy.  
</p>
<p>47. Some delegations noted that the Internet transcended traditionally existing 
</p>
<p>geographical boundaries. Several delegations recalled that, as stated in the report of the 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner, human rights law applied when a State exercised power outside its 
</p>
<p>own territory, so that it could not avoid its international human rights obligations and 
</p>
<p>bypass its own national laws by taking action outside its territory, which it would be 
</p>
<p>prohibited from taking at home. Several delegations recalled that article 17 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must be read in conjunction with 
</p>
<p>article 2 of the Covenant, which states that the obligations of States apply to all individuals 
</p>
<p>within their territory and subject to their jurisdiction. Several delegations noted that any 
</p>
<p>interference with the right to privacy should comply with the principles of legality, 
</p>
<p>proportionality and necessity, regardless of the nationality or location of individuals whose 
</p>
<p>communications are under direct surveillance. While many delegations stressed that the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of the State to protect the right to privacy did not end at its borders, some 
</p>
<p>delegations expressed concerns about expansive views on the extraterritorial application of 
</p>
<p>the Covenant and called for an in-depth discussion on the issue of extraterritoriality with 
</p>
<p>regard to article 17. 
</p>
<p>48. Ms. Nyst recalled that most surveillance took place within a State. On the question 
</p>
<p>of citizenship-based distinctions for the purpose of surveillance, she noted that not only 
</p>
<p>were those distinctions in violation of the principle of non-discrimination, but it was also a 
</p>
<p>very outdated and impractical approach, because it was difficult &#8211; if not impossible &#8211; to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8 See Human Rights Committee general comment No. 16 (1988) on the right to privacy, para. 10.  </p>


<p>know the nationality of the sender of a digital communication. On the question of whether 
</p>
<p>control over telecommunications infrastructure could qualify as State jurisdiction for the 
</p>
<p>purposes of article 2 of the Covenant, Ms. Cleveland stated that because digital 
</p>
<p>communication transcended geography, some conception of the extraterritorial application 
</p>
<p>of human rights was necessary to ensure that human rights could be protected online as well 
</p>
<p>as offline. She noted that there were various approaches to extraterritoriality, most of which 
</p>
<p>focused on the concept of jurisdiction outside the territory as involving some form of 
</p>
<p>effective control over a person or a territory, and that under that approach, it was possible to 
</p>
<p>view the exercise of control over Internet infrastructure as the exercise of control over a 
</p>
<p>territory that had effects on the rights of individuals, wherever they might be located.  
</p>
<p>49. It was noted that the responsibility to respect the right to privacy lay with a number 
</p>
<p>of different actors. Some delegations underscored the lack of effective oversight as having 
</p>
<p>contributed to a lack of accountability for unlawful intrusions on the right to privacy, as 
</p>
<p>well as the shortcomings of relying on internal safeguards without independent external 
</p>
<p>monitoring. The need to protect the rights of victims was underlined. One delegation noted 
</p>
<p>that it was up to each State to develop independent and effective national oversight 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, to ensure the proper application of the rules that govern electronic 
</p>
<p>surveillance. One non-governmental organisation stated that there had been cases of mass 
</p>
<p>surveillance for the purpose of arresting human rights defenders or identifying participants 
</p>
<p>at peaceful assemblies, where &#8220;rubber stamping&#8221; by the courts had been instrumental, or 
</p>
<p>where personal data collected by telecommunication companies through real-name 
</p>
<p>verification systems had been provided to intelligence and investigative agencies in the 
</p>
<p>absence of any court examination. The need for effective oversight regimes, with attention 
</p>
<p>paid to the rights of victims to an effective remedy, was stressed, including the involvement 
</p>
<p>of an independent and impartial judiciary as a key safeguard.  
</p>
<p>50. In response to questions about procedural safeguards and oversight mechanisms to 
</p>
<p>ensure that the law was effective and applied in practice, Ms. Nyst explained that an 
</p>
<p>essential precondition to greater and more effective oversight was the end to pervasive 
</p>
<p>secrecy. Governments needed to be more transparent about the activities they needed to 
</p>
<p>engage in to provide security and they must not compromise the infrastructure in a way that 
</p>
<p>was beyond control of the public. She also noted that all individuals, particularly judges and 
</p>
<p>lawyers, should gain a better understanding of how Internet technology worked, which 
</p>
<p>would help them to better understand how surveillance worked. She underscored the 
</p>
<p>importance of ensuring that any surveillance was authorized by an independent and 
</p>
<p>competent judicial authority. She added that it was essential that individuals be notified of 
</p>
<p>the fact that they had been subject to surveillance, in order to be in a position to obtain 
</p>
<p>redress. She also noted the need for more rigorous independent oversight mechanisms, with 
</p>
<p>technical understanding of how surveillance worked, to enable an examination to be made 
</p>
<p>of the human rights implications of surveillance by the security services. Finally, she noted 
</p>
<p>that a special procedures mandate holder with technical expertise could provide guidance 
</p>
<p>about good practices and about what the human rights framework required to ensure the 
</p>
<p>protection of the right to privacy. Ms. Botero added that there was no uniformity in the 
</p>
<p>domestic standards that regulated surveillance and said that a good practice at national level 
</p>
<p>was to have an expert body that would focus specifically on technology and human rights in 
</p>
<p>the context of surveillance. She noted that oversight could be institutional, judicial, inter-
</p>
<p>organic and through an ombudsperson, that procedural guarantees should include prior 
</p>
<p>judicial authorization of surveillance measures and that the legal basis and criteria for the 
</p>
<p>decision should be public. 
</p>
<p>51. Turning to a question on the obligation of States to provide an effective remedy for 
</p>
<p>violations of the right to privacy, Ms. Cleveland noted that while article 2 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provided an obligation for States to 
</p>
<p>grant an effective remedy, this was a very difficult question, owing to the secrecy of </p>


<p>surveillance practices. Individuals often did not know that they had been subject to 
</p>
<p>surveillance and therefore might lack standing because they could not show sufficient 
</p>
<p>injury. She noted that Governments needed to be more transparent about the surveillance 
</p>
<p>programmes that they were pursuing, to allow for public scrutiny. She also noted that it was 
</p>
<p>important that individuals received specific notice that they had been subject to surveillance 
</p>
<p>after the surveillance had ceased. She further noted that standing rules must be generous 
</p>
<p>enough to allow for meaningful challenge of surveillance programmes. In that respect, she 
</p>
<p>emphasized that the European Court of Human Rights required a sufficient likelihood &#8211; not 
</p>
<p>a demonstration &#8211; of actual injury. She noted that classified judicial proceedings were 
</p>
<p>problematic, but that some kind of judicial test was nonetheless important. The key 
</p>
<p>challenge was to make those proceedings as transparent and effective as possible.  
</p>
<p>52. On the question of whether there should be dedicated courts to examine surveillance 
</p>
<p>measures, Ms. Cleveland noted that States needed to find a way to satisfy transparency 
</p>
<p>requirements and democratic oversight, while at the same time allowing for some level of 
</p>
<p>confidentiality. A good option was to have special procedures to deal with classified 
</p>
<p>information, but in regular courts. On that point, Ms. Nyst added that while there was some 
</p>
<p>value in having specialized judges with technical knowledge, it was essential that courts 
</p>
<p>allowed parties to be on an equal footing when challenging surveillance. It was crucial, 
</p>
<p>therefore, that there be no secret courts and no procedure that would allow for secret 
</p>
<p>interpretations of laws. Any court that did not allow for the utmost transparency and 
</p>
<p>scrutiny did not allow the power asymmetry between the individual and the State to be 
</p>
<p>corrected and might in fact serve to legitimize unlawful surveillance measures. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Specific issues regarding business entities 
</b></p>
<p>53. The role of private companies was also raised by several delegations. Some 
</p>
<p>delegations noted that companies had been put under pressure by Governments, or had been 
</p>
<p>compelled to hand over data. Others noted that international Internet and 
</p>
<p>telecommunication technology companies had been developing and executing their own 
</p>
<p>surveillance capabilities or assisting States in their surveillance of individuals. Mr. Nissim 
</p>
<p>noted that the technology used by telecommunications companies was very complicated, 
</p>
<p>but could be accessed by Governments. He referred for example to &#8220;deep packet 
</p>
<p>inspection&#8221;, which enabled the content of communications to be examined as it was 
</p>
<p>transmitted and thereby allowed Internet service providers to monitor and analyse the 
</p>
<p>Internet communications of users in real time. Mr. Nissim noted that this equipment was 
</p>
<p>used by telecommunication companies to improve the service that they provided to 
</p>
<p>customers, but that it could also be used by Governments for surveillance purposes, without 
</p>
<p>the telecommunication company even being aware of what was happening, as had 
</p>
<p>happened to Orange in the course of its operations.9 
</p>
<p>54. Many delegations asked that businesses and third parties be more transparent and 
</p>
<p>accountable in their conduct. Some delegations emphasized that a deeper understanding of 
</p>
<p>how intermediaries and other business entities could meet their responsibilities to respect 
</p>
<p>human rights, as well as the identification of the regulatory powers which ought to rest with 
</p>
<p>the public and the private sector, was necessary. Mr. Nissim confirmed that transparency 
</p>
<p>was a key issue for telecommunication companies that were under severe pressure to be 
</p>
<p>more transparent. In that regard, he noted that his chief executive of his company had 
</p>
<p>signed a data protection charter, which committed the company to protecting the security of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 See Human Rights Watch, &#8220;They know everything we do: telecom and Internet surveillance in 
</p>
<p>Ethiopia&#8221; (March 2014). </p>


<p>its customers&#8217; personal data; providing control for customers over their own personal data 
</p>
<p>and how it was used; being transparent in terms of the handling of data for its customers 
</p>
<p>and users at all stages; and providing support for all its customers and users to help them 
</p>
<p>protect their privacy and manage their personal data. He noted however, that his company 
</p>
<p>had suffered two breaches of privacy since the charter was signed, emphasizing that 
</p>
<p>protecting data from government interference was always a challenge. He stated again that 
</p>
<p>it was important to recall that, while a number of telecommunication companies were 
</p>
<p>committed to being transparent, transparency must come, first and foremost, from the State. 
</p>
<p>He also recalled that telecommunication companies were bound by local laws and therefore 
</p>
<p>that the legal framework within which they operated varied from country to country. He 
</p>
<p>noted an ongoing trend for companies to map the legal framework in all the countries in 
</p>
<p>which they operated. He noted that in some countries, the legislation allowed for 
</p>
<p>transparency ex-post facto, either by allowing the companies to provide information on the 
</p>
<p>requests made to them by Governments, or the data transmitted to them, or by permitting 
</p>
<p>the State to do so. In other States, neither the company nor the State could be transparent 
</p>
<p>about the measures the company had had to share. He noted that telecommunications 
</p>
<p>companies tried with the means at their disposal to protect international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>For example, he noted that during the Arab Spring, a Government had requested his 
</p>
<p>company to send text messages to all their base customers. Following an initial refusal from 
</p>
<p>the company, members of the armed forces were sent to reiterate the demands of the 
</p>
<p>Government. His company sent the message as requested, together with the signature of 
</p>
<p>one of the members of the armed forces present. This was a small, yet important, piece of 
</p>
<p>information, which allowed civil society to understand the situation.  
</p>
<p>55. Mr. Nissim highlighted the importance of multi-stakeholder engagement. In order to 
</p>
<p>illustrate that point, he referred to another situation which his own company had faced, 
</p>
<p>where the Government in question had backed down on the requests it had made to 
</p>
<p>telecommunication companies, owing to several factors, one of them being the fact that 
</p>
<p>civil society had publicized those requests. He noted that he would support the elaboration 
</p>
<p>of a legal instrument at the international level that would deal with the obligations of 
</p>
<p>private entities regarding protection of the right to privacy from surveillance measures, and 
</p>
<p>that model laws and best practices would also greatly assist Governments. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Way forward 
</b></p>
<p>56. Many delegations stressed the need for continued multi-stakeholder engagement. 
</p>
<p>They said that State engagement was not enough, but that private entities, civil society, 
</p>
<p>scientific and technical communities, the business sector, academics and human rights 
</p>
<p>experts needed to take part in the discussions. The need for further engagement of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council was also highlighted.  
</p>
<p>57. Several delegations requested that States review their procedures, practices and 
</p>
<p>legislation related to communications surveillance, interception and collection of personal 
</p>
<p>data, in order to adapt them to the needs of the twenty-first century and to ensure that they 
</p>
<p>were in full conformity with international human rights law. Others called for a transparent 
</p>
<p>international system with an adequate international framework of Internet governance, 
</p>
<p>including appropriate safeguards to protect personal data. One delegation called for the 
</p>
<p>development of a code of conduct on those issues. Several delegations and NGOs called 
</p>
<p>upon the Council to establish a mandate for a special rapporteur on the right to privacy, as it 
</p>
<p>was essential to bring focused and sustained attention to those issues. </p>


<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>Panellists concluded that technological change might pose new challenges to 
</b></p>
<p><b>existing legislation. In such cases, established legal frameworks, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights law, would continue to apply, even if the implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the law must be adapted to address the new reality. Regarding the promotion and 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of the right to privacy, including in the context of domestic and 
</b></p>
<p><b>extraterritorial surveillance, the international human rights framework was clear. 
</b></p>
<p><b>There was a need, however, for better implementation at the national level of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international norms related to the right to privacy, through adequate national 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation and stronger safeguards and oversight.  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>Panellists noted that the development of legal safeguards against violations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective oversight involving all stakeholders was essential. Independent, impartial 
</b></p>
<p><b>and competent courts must be more involved and better equipped to deal with those 
</b></p>
<p><b>complex issues. Furthermore, they noted the need for increased transparency, 
</b></p>
<p><b>regarding both surveillance policies and legislation and legal interpretations and court 
</b></p>
<p><b>rulings, where they existed. The laws and regulations and the way they were 
</b></p>
<p><b>interpreted and applied should be made publicly available. The powers of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Governments to access communication-related data should be based on a clear and 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparent legal framework that accommodated advances in technology and was in 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordance with the rule of law and international human rights norms and standards.  
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>Supporting the views of States, regional organizations and NGOs, the panellists 
</b></p>
<p><b>stressed that the protection and promotion of, and respect for, the right to privacy 
</b></p>
<p><b>required the sustained engagement of all stakeholders, including Governments, 
</b></p>
<p><b>industry, civil society and international organizations. They highlighted the unique 
</b></p>
<p><b>ability of the United Nations to convene all stakeholders and to explore the most 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective means of protecting the right to privacy and emphasized that the Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Council should continue to address the issue, including through the universal 
</b></p>
<p><b>periodic review, with the increased engagement of civil society. OHCHR and the High 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commissioner should also continue to work on the issue and special procedures must 
</b></p>
<p><b>engage within their own mandates as appropriate, Consideration should also be given 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the need to establish a new special procedures mandate on the right to privacy, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>examine existing challenges and how the right should be conceptualized more broadly. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>Finally, the panellists highlighted the vital role played by the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other international organizations in promoting the international legal standards 
</b></p>
<p><b>that guide the actions of private companies, as they seek to respect the human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>of their customers and other users. Businesses look to the United Nations for support 
</b></p>
<p><b>in promoting the adoption of those standards in the domestic law of Member States. 
</b></p>
<p><b>By furthering the international framework, international organizations were also 
</b></p>
<p><b>supporting businesses in meeting their responsibility to respect and protect the 
</b></p>
<p><b>privacy of users, as technological advances continued. The question of whether a 
</b></p>
<p><b>model law or a code of conduct could be drafted should be considered. 
</b></p>
