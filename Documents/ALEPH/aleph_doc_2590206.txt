MARATHON OIL CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
1.    Basis of Presentation
These consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management,
these statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the
periods reported.  All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed
otherwise.  These consolidated financial statements, including notes, have been prepared in
accordance with the applicable rules of the SEC and do not include all of the information and
disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.
A reclassification between operating cash flow categories was made to the prior year's financial
information to present it on a basis comparable with the current year's presentation with no
impact on net cash provided by operating activities.
These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The results of
operations for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the full year.
2.   Accounting Standards
Not Yet Adopted
In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standards update that changes the impairment
model for trade receivables, net investments in leases, debt securities, loans and certain other
instruments. The standard requires the use of a forward-looking "expected loss" model as
opposed to the current "incurred loss" model. This standard is effective for us in the first quarter of
2020 and will be adopted on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect
adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the adoption period. Early adoption is
permitted starting January 2019. We are evaluating the provisions of this accounting standards
update and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on our consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.
In March 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standards update that changes several
aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including a requirement to
recognize all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the
income statement, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the
statement of cash flows. This standard is effective for us in the first quarter of 2017 and varying
transition methods (modified retrospective, retrospective or prospective) should be applied to
different provisions of the standard. Early adoption is permitted. We continue to evaluate the
provisions of this accounting standards update but do not believe it will have a material effect on
our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In February 2016, the FASB issued a new lease accounting standard, which requires lessees to
recognize most leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet as a right of use asset
and lease liability. Short-term leases can continue being accounted for off balance sheet based
on a policy election. This standard is effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 and should be
applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest period presented
in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the provisions of this
accounting standards update and assessing the impact it will have on our consolidated results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.
In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that addresses certain
aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This
standard is effective for us in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is allowed for certain
provisions. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In July 2015, the FASB issued an update that requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower
of cost and net realizable value. This excludes inventory measured using LIFO or the retail
inventory method. This standard is effective for us in the first quarter of 2017 and will be applied
prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have
a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In August 2014, the FASB issued an update that requires management to assess an entity’s
ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles
that are currently in U.S. auditing standards.  This standard is effective for us for the annual
period ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant
impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

MARATHON OIL CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
In May 2014, the FASB issued an update that supersedes the existing revenue recognition
requirements. This standard includes a five-step revenue recognition model to depict the transfer
of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Among other things, the
standard requires enhanced disclosures about revenue, provides guidance for transactions that
were not previously addressed comprehensively and improves guidance for multiple-element
arrangements. This standard is effective for us in the first quarter of 2018 and should be applied
retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or with the cumulative effect of initially
applying the update recognized at the date of initial application. While early adoption is
permitted, we plan to adopt in the first quarter of 2018. We continue to evaluate certain provisions
of this accounting standards update and are assessing the impact it will have on our
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Recently Adopted
In May 2015, the FASB issued an update that removes the requirement to categorize within the
fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per
share practical expedient. The amendment also removes certain disclosure requirements
regarding all investments that are eligible to be measured using the net asset value per share
practical expedient and only requires certain disclosures on those investments for which an entity
elects to use the net asset value per share expedient. This standard is effective for us in the first
quarter of 2016 and was applied on a retrospective basis. This standard only modifies disclosure
requirements; as such, there was no impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial
position or cash flows.
In February 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to the guidance for determining whether an
entity is a variable interest entity ("VIE"). The standard does not add or remove any of the five
characteristics that determine whether an entity is a VIE. However, it does change the manner in
which a reporting entity assesses one of the characteristics. In particular, when decision-making
over the entity’s most significant activities has been outsourced, the standard changes how a
reporting entity assesses if the equity holders at risk lack decision making rights. This standard is
effective for us in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant
impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
3.   Variable Interest Entity
The owners of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project, in which we hold a 20% undivided interest,
contracted with a wholly owned subsidiary of a publicly traded Canadian limited partnership
(“Corridor Pipeline”) to provide materials transportation capabilities among the Muskeg River and
Jackpine mines, the Scotford upgrader and markets in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.  Costs under
this contract are accrued and recorded on a monthly basis, with current liabilities of $2 million
recorded at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  This contract qualifies as a variable interest
contractual arrangement, and the Corridor Pipeline qualifies as a VIE.  We hold a variable
interest but are not the primary beneficiary because our shipments are only 20% of the total;
therefore, the Corridor Pipeline is not consolidated by us.  Our maximum exposure to loss as a
result of our involvement with this VIE is the amount we expect to pay over the contract term,
which was $468 million as of June 30, 2016.  The liability on our books related to this contract at
any given time will reflect amounts due for the immediately previous month’s activity, which is
substantially less than the maximum exposure over the contract term.

4.Income (Loss) per Common Share
Basic income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding.  Diluted income per share assumes exercise of stock options, provided the effect is
not antidilutive. The per share calculations below exclude 14 million stock options for the three
and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 13 million stock options for the three and six
month periods ended June 30, 2015 that were antidilutive.

5. Acquisitions
In June 2016, we executed a purchase agreement to acquire PayRock Energy Holdings, LLC
("PayRock"), a portfolio company of EnCap Investments, which closed on August 1, 2016 for
$888 million, subject to closing adjustments. PayRock has approximately 61,000 net surface
acres and current production of approximately 9,000 net barrels of oil equivalent in the oil
window of the Anadarko Basin STACK play in Oklahoma. In the second quarter of 2016 an $89
million deposit was paid into escrow related to the acquisition. The purchase price was paid with
cash on hand. We accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition, with the majority of the
purchase price allocated to property, plant and equipment.
  
6.Dispositions
2016 - North America E&P Segment
During the quarter, we announced the sale of our Wyoming upstream and midstream assets for
proceeds of $870 million, before closing adjustments, of which approximately $690 million was
received in the second quarter.  A pre-tax gain of $266 million was recognized in the second
quarter 2016.  The remaining asset sales are subject to the receipt of certain tribal consents and
are expected to close before year end. These assets are classified as held for sale in the
consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016 with total assets of $104 million and total
liabilities of $4 million. The proceeds for the remaining asset sales were deposited into an
escrow account by the buyer.
In March and April 2016, we entered into separate agreements to sell our 10% working interest in
the outside-operated Shenandoah discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, operated natural gas assets in
the Piceance basin in Colorado and certain undeveloped acreage in West Texas for a combined
total of approximately $80 million in proceeds, before closing adjustments. We closed on certain
of the asset sales and recognized a net pre-tax net loss on sale of $48 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016. The remaining asset sales are expected to close by year-end.
2015 - North America E&P Segment
In the third quarter of 2015, we closed on the sale of our East Texas/North Louisiana and
Wilburton, Oklahoma natural gas assets for proceeds of approximately $100 million and recorded
a pretax loss of $1 million. During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a non-cash
impairment charge of $44 million related to these assets as a result of the anticipated sale (see
Note 13).

7.    Segment Information
  We have three reportable operating segments. Each of these segments is organized and
managed based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it
offers.
N.A. E&P – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural
gas in North America;
Int'l E&P – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas
outside of North America and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas,
such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.; and
Oil Sands Mining (“OSM”) – mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in
Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and
vacuum gas oil.
Information regarding assets by segment is not presented because it is not reviewed by the chief
operating decision maker (“CODM”).  Segment income represents income which excludes
certain items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes, attributable to the operating
segments. A portion of our corporate and operations support general and administrative costs are
not allocated to the operating segments. These unallocated costs primarily consist of
employment costs (including pension effects), professional services, facilities and other costs
associated with corporate and operations support activities. Additionally, items which affect
comparability such as: gains or losses on dispositions, certain impairments, change in tax
expense associated with a tax rate change, unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivative
instruments, pension settlement losses or other items (as determined by the CODM) are not
allocated to operating segments.

Settlements are recognized as they occur, once it is probable that lump sum payments from a
plan for a given year will exceed the plan's total service and interest cost for that year.
Related to workforce reductions, which reduced the future expected years of service for
employees participating in the plans.
(b) 
During the first six months of 2016, we recorded the effects of settlements of our U.S. pension
plans. As required, we remeasured the plans' assets and liabilities as of the applicable balance
sheet dates. The cumulative effects of these events are included in the remeasurement and
reflected in both the pension liability and net periodic benefit cost.
During the first six months of 2016, we made contributions of $30 million to our funded pension
plans.  We expect to make additional contributions up to an estimated $34 million to our funded
pension plans over the remainder of 2016.  During the first six months of 2016, we made
payments of $37 million and $10 million related to unfunded pension plans and other
postretirement benefit plans, respectively.
9.    Income Taxes
Effective Tax Rate
The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic and
functional sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The
difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments is
reported in the “Not Allocated to Segments” column of the tables in Note 7.
Our effective income tax rates for the first six months of 2016 and 2015 were 37% and 18%.  In
Libya, considerable uncertainty remains around the timing of future production and sales levels.
Reliable estimates of 2016 and 2015 Libyan annual ordinary income from our operations could
not be made, and the range of possible scenarios in the worldwide annual effective tax rate
calculation demonstrates significant variability. Thus, the tax benefit applicable to Libyan
ordinary loss was
12
MARATHON OIL CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
recorded as a discrete item in the first six months of 2016 and 2015.  For the first six months of
2016 and 2015, estimated annual effective tax rates were calculated excluding Libya and applied
to consolidated ordinary income (loss). Excluding Libya, the effective tax rates would be 36% and
15% for the first six months of 2016 and 2015. The change was driven by a shift in jurisdictional
income and tax legislation enacted by the Alberta government on June 29, 2015 to increase the
provincial corporate tax rate from 10% to 12%.  As a result of this legislation, we recorded
additional non-cash deferred tax expense of $135 million in the second quarter of 2015.  
Deferred Tax Assets
In connection with our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be
realized.  In the event it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred taxes will
not be realized, such assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. Future increases to our
valuation allowance are possible if our estimates and assumptions (particularly as they relate to
our long-term commodity price forecast) are revised such that they reduce estimates of future
taxable income during the carryforward period.
10.    Short-term Investments
As of June 30, 2015, we held short-term investments comprised of bank time deposits with
original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than twelve
months. These short-term investments, which were classified as held-to-maturity investments and
recorded at amortized cost, matured in the third quarter of 2015.
11.   Inventories
 Liquid hydrocarbons, natural gas and bitumen are recorded at weighted average cost and
carried at the lower of cost or market value. Supplies and other items consist principally of tubular
goods and equipment which are valued at weighted average cost and reviewed periodically for
obsolescence or impairment when market conditions indicate.

Our Libya operations continue to be impacted by civil unrest. Operations were interrupted in mid-
2013 as a result of the shutdown of the Es-Sider crude oil terminal, and although temporarily re-
opened during the second half of 2014, production remains shut-in. Earlier this year, an
Internationally-backed Unity Government was established in Tripoli. During the second quarter,
the two National Oil Companies agreed to unify and reportedly have begun preliminary
discussions on re-opening the Es-Sider and other crude oil terminals which, if successful, will
allow resumption of production operations at our Waha concessions. However, considerable
uncertainty remains around the timing of future production and sales levels.
As of June 30, 2016, our net property, plant and equipment investment in Libya is $775 million,

and total proved reserves (unaudited) in Libya as of December 31, 2015 are 235 million barrels
of oil equivalent ("mmboe"). We and our partners in the Waha concessions continue to assess
the situation and the condition of our assets in Libya. Our periodic assessment of the carrying
value of our net property, plant and equipment in Libya specifically considers the net investment
in the assets, the duration of our concessions and the reserves anticipated to be recoverable in
future periods. The undiscounted cash flows related to our Libya assets continue to exceed the
carrying value of $775 million by a material amount. However, changes in

management's forecast assumptions may cause us to reassess our assets in Libya for
impairment, and could result in non-cash impairment charges in the future.
Exploratory well costs capitalized greater than one year after completion of drilling were $118
million and $85 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The $33 million increase
primarily relates to the Alba Block Sub Area B offshore Equatorial Guinea where the Rodo well
reached total depth in the first quarter of 2015. We have since completed a seismic feasibility
study and continue to finalize next steps in the Alba Block Sub Area B exploration program.

Commodity derivatives include three-way collars, two-way collars, call options and swaptions.
These instruments are measured at fair value using either the Black-Scholes Model or the Black
Model. Inputs to both models include commodity prices, interest rates, and implied volatility. The
inputs to these models are categorized as Level 2 because predominantly all assumptions and
inputs are observable in active markets throughout the term of the instruments.
Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value with a market approach using actionable broker
quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 14 for additional discussion of the types of derivative
instruments we use.
Fair Values – Goodwill
Unlike long-lived assets, goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually, or between
annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce
the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at
the reporting unit level. We estimate the fair value of our International E&P reporting unit using a
combination of market and income approaches. The market approach referenced observable
inputs specific to us and our industry, such as the price of our common equity, our enterprise
value, and valuation multiples of us and our peers from the investor analyst community. The
income approach utilized discounted cash flows, which were based on forecasted assumptions.
Key assumptions to the income approach include future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas
pricing, estimated quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas proved and probable
reserves, estimated timing of production, discount rates, future capital requirements and
operating expenses and tax rates. The assumptions used in the income approach
14
MARATHON OIL CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
are consistent with those that management uses to make business decisions. These valuations
methodologies represent Level 3 fair value measurements. We performed our annual impairment
test in April 2016 and concluded no impairment was required. While the fair value of our
International E&P reporting unit exceeded the book value, subsequent commodity price and/or
common stock declines may cause us to reassess our goodwill for impairment, and could result
in non-cash impairment charges in the future.

levels, prices and discount rate, all of which are Level 3 inputs. Inputs to the fair value
measurement include reserve and production estimates made by our reservoir engineers,
estimated future commodity prices adjusted for quality and location differentials and forecasted
operating expenses for the remaining estimated life of the reservoir.
During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $44 million
related to East Texas, North Louisiana and Wilburton, Oklahoma natural gas assets as a result of
the anticipated sale (See Note 6). The fair values were measured using a probability weighted
income approach based on both the anticipated sales price and a held-for-use model.
Fair Values – Financial Instruments
Our current assets and liabilities include financial instruments, the most significant of which are
receivables, long-term debt and payables. We believe the carrying values of our receivables and
payables approximate fair value. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of
considerations, including (1) the short-term duration of the instruments, (2) our credit rating, and
(3) our historical incurrence of and expected future insignificant bad debt expense, which
includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk.
The following table summarizes financial instruments, excluding receivables, payables and
derivative financial instruments, and their reported fair values by individual balance sheet line

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
Fair values of our financial assets included in other noncurrent assets, and of our financial
liabilities included in other current liabilities and deferred credits and other liabilities, are
measured using an income approach and most inputs are internally generated, which results in a
Level 3 classification. Estimated future cash flows are discounted using a rate deemed
appropriate to obtain the fair value.
Most of our long-term debt instruments are publicly-traded. A market approach, based upon
quotes from major financial institutions, which are Level 2 inputs, is used to measure the fair
value of such debt. The fair value of our debt that is not publicly-traded is measured using an
income approach. The future debt service payments are discounted using the rate at which we
currently expect to borrow. All inputs to this calculation are Level 3.
14. Derivatives
For further information regarding the fair value measurement of derivative instruments, see Note
13. All of our interest rate and commodity derivatives are subject to enforceable master netting
arrangements or similar agreements under which we may report net amounts. The following
tables present the gross fair values of derivative instruments and the reported net amounts where
they appear on the consolidated balance sheets.

 Derivatives not Designated as Hedges
We have entered into multiple crude oil and natural gas derivatives indexed to NYMEX WTI and
Henry Hub related to a portion of our forecasted North America E&P sales through December
2017. These commodity derivatives consist of three-way collars, two-way collars, call options
and swaptions. Three-way collars consist of a sold call (ceiling), a purchased put (floor) and a
sold put. The ceiling price is the maximum we will receive for the contract volumes, the floor is
the minimum price we will receive, unless the market price falls below the sold put strike price. In
this case, we receive the NYMEX WTI/Henry Hub price plus the difference between the floor and
the sold put price. These commodity derivatives were not designated as hedges. The following
table sets forth outstanding derivative contracts as of June 30, 2016 and the weighted average
prices for those contracts:

On our 2016 collars, the counterparty has the option to execute fixed-price swaps (swaptions)
at a weighted average price of $2.93 per MMBtu indexed to NYMEX Henry Hub, which is
exercisable on December 22, 2016. If counterparty exercises, the term of the fixed-price swaps
would be for the calendar year 2017 and, if all such options are exercised, 20,000 MMBtu per
day.
The mark-to-market impact of these commodity derivative instruments appears in sales and other
operating revenues in our consolidated statements of income for the three and six month periods
ended June 30, 2016 was a net loss of $88 million and $90 million compared to a net loss of $43
million and $17 million for the same respective periods in 2015. Net cash received from
settlements of commodity derivative instruments for the three and six month periods ended June
30, 2016 was $14 million and $46 million compared to $4 million for both of the respective
periods in 2015.

Revolving Credit Facility
As of June 30, 2016, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility (the "Credit
Facility"), as described below.
In March 2016, we increased our $3.0 billion unsecured Credit Facility by $300 million to a total
of $3.3 billion.
The Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring that our ratio of total debt to total capitalization
not exceed 65% as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. If an event of default occurs, the lenders
holding more than half of the commitments may terminate the commitments under the Credit
Facility and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings and the cash
collateralization of all outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2016,
we were in compliance with this covenant with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 28%.

20.   Commitments and Contingencies
  We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary
course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and
environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with
certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect
on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation
expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations.  If these expenditures, as with all
costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results
will be adversely affected.  We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with
similar environmental laws and regulations.  However, the specific impact on each competitor
may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating
facilities, marketing areas and production processes.
21.   Subsequent Event
During the third quarter 2016, we executed an agreement to terminate our Gulf of Mexico
deepwater drilling rig contract. As a result, we expect to recognize a termination payment of $113
million in other operating expense in that quarter.

Operations 
Executive Overview
Outlook
Operations
Market Conditions
Results of Operations
Critical Accounting Estimates
Cash Flows and Liquidity
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should
be read in conjunction with the preceding consolidated financial statements and notes in Item 1.
Executive Overview
We are an independent global exploration and production company based in Houston, Texas
with operations in North America, Europe and Africa and a focus on U.S. unconventional
resource plays. Total proved reserves were 2.2 billion boe at December 31, 2015 and total
assets were $33 billion at June 30, 2016.
Our significant strategic actions and financial results include the following:
•Strengthened balance sheet
◦At the end of the second quarter of 2016, we had $5.9 billion of liquidity, comprised of $2.6
billion in cash and an undrawn $3.3 billion revolving credit facility
◦
◦Cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of 20% at June 30, 2016, as compared with 25% at
December 31, 2015
•Focused on cost reductions
Production expenses per boe in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to the same period
last year improved in the North America E&P segment by 13% to $6.28 per boe and in the
International E&P segment by 22% to $5.09 per boe
◦2016 Capital Program reduced by $100 million to $1.3 billion
◦Eagle Ford completed well costs down 30% to $4.2 million versus the same quarter last year
•Simplifying and concentrating portfolio
◦Closed on the PayRock acquisition of STACK assets in Oklahoma for $888 million, funded with
cash on hand
◦Entered into agreements for over $1 billion of transaction value related to non-core asset sales;
already received over $800 million in proceeds through August 1, 2016
•Major Project updates
Alba B3 compression project in E.G., designed to maintain the production plateau two additional
years and extend field life up to eight years, was completed within budget and on schedule with
first gas in July
◦Outside-operated Gunflint development project in the Gulf of Mexico achieved first oil in July
•Financial results
◦Cash provided by operating activities of $252 million for the first six months of 2016, despite
average crude oil and condensate price realizations of $35.27 per bbl.
◦Net loss per share of $0.20 in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to net loss per share of
$0.57 in the same period last year. Included in the second quarter 2016 net loss are:
▪Unrealized losses from our commodity derivative instruments totaling $91 million, pre-tax
▪Net gains on disposal of non-core assets totaling $294 million, pre-tax
▪Non-cash impairments totaling $141 million, pre-tax, as a result of our decision not to drill any of
our remaining Gulf of Mexico leases
◦
Outlook
Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating
cash flows and the amount of capital available to reinvest into our business. Our focus continues
on the strengthening of the balance sheet, the simplification and concentration of our portfolio
and cost reductions which during the second quarter of 2016 included a reduction to our Capital
Program of $100 million to $1.3 billion for the year.
20
Exploration Update
In September 2015, we announced our intention to scale back our conventional exploration
program, with future exploration investment focused on fulfilling our existing commitments in the
Gulf of Mexico and Gabon.  In second quarter of 2016, we made the decision to not drill our
remaining Gulf of Mexico undeveloped leases. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment
of $141 million in the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, during the third quarter 2016, we
executed an agreement to terminate our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling rig contract. As a
result, we expect to recognize a termination payment of $113 million in other operating expense
in that quarter.

Net sales volumes in the segment were lower in the second quarter and first six months of 2016
primarily as a result of decreased drilling and completion activity resulting in fewer wells brought
to sales as well as 17 mboed relating to dispositions of certain non-core assets (Gulf of Mexico
and East Texas, North Louisiana and Wilburton, Oklahoma) during the second half of 2015. The

Eagle Ford – Of the 30 gross operated wells brought to sales during the second quarter of 2016,
19 were Lower Eagle Ford, 3 were Upper Eagle Ford and 8 were Austin Chalk. Production
decreases were due to lower completion activity with fewer gross operated wells brought to
sales and reduced contribution from 2015 high-density pads drilled at tighter well spacing. Our
average time to drill an Eagle Ford well in the second quarter 2016, spud-to-total depth, was 8
days, a decrease from 11 days in the same quarter last year as efficiency gains in drilling
continued. Wells were drilled at an average rate of 2,400 feet per day.
Oklahoma Resource Basins – Of the 5 gross operated wells brought to sales in the second
quarter of 2016, 3 were in the SCOOP Woodford; 2 were in the STACK Meramec and all were
extended laterals. We also participated in 16 outside-operated wells during the second quarter
of 2016, 10 of which were in the SCOOP and 6 were in the STACK.
We closed on the Payrock acquisition in the STACK play in Oklahoma on August 1, 2016 and
continue to operate one drilling rig on the acreage with plans to add another rig late in the third
quarter. This will bring the total rig count in Oklahoma to 4.
Bakken – Of the 4 gross operated wells brought to sales in the second quarter of 2016, 2 were in
the Middle Bakken formation and 2 in the Three Forks formation, all with higher intensity
completions. We do not currently have an active drilling rig in the Bakken.
Other North America – Net sales volumes declined in the second quarter of 2016 primarily due
to the 2015 sales of the non-core assets in the Gulf of Mexico, East Texas, North Louisiana and
Wilburton, Oklahoma. On June 30, we closed the sale of certain of our Wyoming upstream and
midstream assets. Net sales volumes for all of our Wyoming assets were approximately 16
mboed for the second quarter and first half of 2016.
The Gunflint field, located in Mississippi Canyon block 948 in the Gulf of Mexico, achieved first
production in July 2016. Full production is expected to reach at least 20 mboed gross with oil
representing approximately 75% of the volumes produced. We hold an 18% non-operated
working interest in the Gunflint field.

Equatorial Guinea – Second quarter 2016 net sales were higher compared to the same quarter
of 2015 due to lower planned turnaround and maintenance activities at the Alba field and E.G.
LNG facilities. The Alba field compression project achieved first gas in July, which is expected
to maintain the production plateau for an additional two years and extend field life up to eight
years.
United Kingdom – Net sales volumes in the first six months of 2016 were lower due to repair
activities at the Brae Alpha facility following a process pipe failure in late 2015.  Production was
restored at the facility in late April.  Higher overall production efficiency at the remaining Brae
facilities and improved reliability from the outside-operated Foinaven field partially offset the
Brae Alpha shut-in.
Libya – Due to continued civil unrest, there were no liftings during the quarter, or any period
presented. Earlier this year, an Internationally-backed Unity Government was established in
Tripoli. During the second quarter, the two National Oil Companies agreed to unify and
reportedly have begun preliminary discussions on re-opening the Es-Sider and other crude oil
terminals which, if successful, will allow resumption of production operations at our Waha
concessions. However, considerable uncertainty remains around the timing of future production
and sales levels.
Oil Sands Mining
 Our net synthetic crude oil sales volumes were 49 mbbld and 54 mbbld in the second quarter
and first six months of 2016 compared to 29 mbbld and 44 mbbld in the same periods of 2015.
Sales volumes increased in comparison to second quarter and first six months of 2015 which
were adversely affected due to planned turnarounds at the base upgrader and Muskeg River
Mine and unplanned downtime at the expansion upgrader. These sales volume increases were
partially offset by a brief suspension of operations at both the Muskeg River and Jackpine mines
in May 2016 in order to support emergency response efforts related to the Fort McMurray area
wildfires in addition to the completion of planned maintenance activities at the Jackpine Mine and
expansion upgrader that began in the first quarter 2016. Neither of the mines sustained any
damage as a result of the wildfires. We hold a 20% non-operated working interest in the
Athabasca Oil Sands Project.

Market Conditions
Prevailing prices for the crude oil, NGLs and natural gas that we produce significantly impact our
revenues and cash flows. The benchmark prices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas were lower
in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015; as a
result, we experienced declines in our price realizations associated with those benchmarks.
Additional detail on market conditions, including our average price realizations and benchmarks
for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas relative to our operating segments, follows.

Our NGL and natural gas sales in the International E&P segment originate primarily from our E.G.
operations and are sold to our equity method investees under fixed-price, term contracts;
therefore, our reported average realized prices for NGLs and natural gas will not fully track
market price movements. The equity affiliates then utilize, process and sell the NGLs at market
prices and natural gas at fixed prices under long-term contracts, with our share of their
income/loss reflected in the income from equity method investments line on the consolidated
statements of income.
Oil Sands Mining
The Oil Sands Mining segment produces and sells various qualities of synthetic crude oil. Output
mix can be impacted by operational reliability or planned unit outages at the mines or upgrader.
Sales prices for roughly two-thirds of the normal output mix have historically tracked movements
in WTI and one-third have historically tracked movements in the Canadian heavy crude oil
marker, primarily WCS.

Marketing revenues decreased $94 million in the second quarter of 2016 from the comparable
prior-year period. Marketing activities include the purchase of commodities from third parties for
resale and serve to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments as well as
to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Since the volume of marketing
activity is based on market dynamics, it can fluctuate from period to period. The decreases are
related primarily to lower marketed volumes in North America E&P and OSM, which were further
compounded by a lower commodity price environment.
Income from equity method investments increased $11 million in the second quarter of 2016 from
the comparable 2015 period. The increase is primarily due to an increase in net sales volumes
as 2015 volumes were lower because of planned turnaround and maintenance activities at the
Alba field and E.G. LNG facilities.
Net gain on disposal of assets in the second quarter of 2016 was primarily related to the sale of
our Wyoming upstream and midstream assets and West Texas acreage. See Note 6 to the
consolidated financial statements for information about dispositions.
Production expenses decreased $100 million. North America E&P declined $50 million primarily
due to lower operational, maintenance and labor costs, coupled with the disposition of our
producing assets in the Gulf of Mexico and East Texas, North Louisiana and Wilburton,
Oklahoma gas assets. International E&P declined $8 million primarily as a result of lower project
and labor costs in the U.K. and 2015 also includes costs arising from planned flowline
maintenance at the outside operated Foinaven field; these declines were partially offset by
increased costs resulting from higher net sales volumes. OSM

decreased $42 million primarily due to lower turnaround costs and continued cost management,
specifically staffing and contract labor.
The second quarter of 2016 production expense rate (expense per boe) for North America E&P
declined as cost reductions occurred at a rate faster than our production decline. The expense
rate for International E&P declined due to an increase in volumes, combined with reduced
maintenance and project costs in the U.K. The OSM expense rate decreased as a result of higher
sales volumes and lower production expenses, as discussed above.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $190 million primarily as a result of
production volume decreases, a higher proved reserve base in Eagle Ford in the second half of
2015 and as a result of the non-core asset dispositions in 2015. Our segments apply the units-of-
production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs;
therefore, proved reserve and production volumes have an impact on DD&A expense.
The DD&A rate (expense per boe), which is impacted by changes in reserves, capitalized costs,
and sales volume mix by field, can also cause changes to our DD&A. The following table
provides DD&A rates for each segment. The DD&A rate for North America E&P decreased
primarily as a result of a higher proved reserve base in Eagle Ford in the second half of 2015.
The DD&A rate for International E&P declined due to lower asset retirement costs, with cost
estimates refined in the fourth quarter of 2015. The DD&A rate for OSM declined as a result of a
higher proved reserve base in the fourth quarter of 2015.

expenses.
International E&P segment income increased $14 million after-tax primarily due to decreased

(a)      Six months ended June 30, 2016 includes a net sales volume reduction of 17 mboed
related to dispositions in the Gulf of Mexico and other conventional onshore U.S. production.
Marketing revenues for the first six months of 2016 decreased by $240 million. Marketing
activities include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale and serve to aggregate
volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments as well as to achieve flexibility within
product types and delivery points. Because the volume of marketing activity is based on market
dynamics, it can fluctuate from period to period. The decrease is related primarily to lower
marketed volumes in North America, which were further compounded by a lower commodity
price environment.
Income from equity method investments decreased $11 million. The decrease is primarily due to
lower net sales volumes as a result of planned downtime at E.G. as a result of the Alba field
compression project which impacted our equity method plants, which was partially offset by
planned turnaround and maintenance activities at the Alba field and E.G. LNG facilities in 2015.
Also impacting the first six months of 2016 were lower price realizations for LPG at our Alba
plant.

period, consistent with the marketing revenues changes discussed above.
 Exploration expenses were $12 million higher in the first six months of 2016 than in the
comparable 2015 period primarily due to higher unproved property impairments, which were
partially offset by lower dry well costs. Unproved property impairments were higher in 2016
primarily as a result of Gulf of Mexico leases that we decided not to drill. Dry well costs for the first
six months of 2015 primarily consist of costs associated with the Sodalita West #1 well in E.G.,
the Key Largo well in the Gulf of Mexico, and suspended well costs related to Birchwood in-situ.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
There have been no material changes or developments in the evaluation of the accounting
estimates and the underlying assumptions or methodologies pertaining to our Critical Accounting
Estimates disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, except as
discussed below.
Fair Value Estimates - Goodwill
Goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually, or between annual tests if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit
level. We performed our annual impairment test in April 2016 and concluded no impairment was
required. While the fair value of our International E&P reporting unit exceeded book value,
subsequent commodity price and/or common stock declines may cause us to reassess our
goodwill for impairment, and could result in non-cash impairment charges in the future.
Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves
Our December 31, 2015 proved reserves were calculated using the unweighted average of
closing benchmark prices nearest to the first day of each month within the 12-month period
("SEC pricing"). The table below provides the 2015 SEC pricing for certain benchmark prices as
well as the unweighted average for the first eight months of 2016:
 
WTI Crude oil
Henry Hub natural gas2.24
41.08
Brent crude oil
Natural gas liquids
14.92
Any significant future price change could have a material effect on the quantity and present value
of our proved reserves. To the extent that commodity prices decrease during the remainder of
2016, a portion of our proved reserves could be deemed uneconomic and no longer classified as
proved. This could impact both proved developed producing reserves as well as proved
undeveloped reserves. Assuming lower commodity pricing in the remaining 4-months of 2016, a
material volume of our proved reserves could become uneconomic and would have to be
reclassified to non-proved reserve or resource category. In this scenario, our OSM proved
reserves represent the largest risk to be reclassified to non-proved reserve or resource category.
However, any impact of lower SEC pricing will likely be partially offset by continued cost
reduction efforts. Also, any volumes reclassified to non-proved reserves could return to proved
reserves as commodity prices improve. In the event the OSM proved reserves are reclassified to
non-proved reserves or resource, their classification will have no impact on future plans for
production.

Cash flows generated from operating activities in the first six months of 2016 were lower as the
downturn in the commodity cycle continued. This continued downward pressure on price
realizations, coupled with the lower net sales volumes, continues to negatively impact our cash
flows from operating activities. In the first six months of 2016, consolidated average oil and NGL
price realizations were down by approximately 27% and consolidated net sales volumes
declined by 9% as compared to the prior year.
Proceeds from disposals of assets are primarily from the sale of our Wyoming upstream and
midstream assets; see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information
concerning dispositions. Common stock issuance reflects net proceeds received in March 2016
from our public sale of common stock. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional
information.
Additions to property, plant and equipment are our most significant use of cash and cash
equivalents and were lower in the first half of 2016 consistent with a reduced Capital Program as
compared to the prior year. The following table shows capital expenditures by segment and
reconciles to additions to property, plant and equipment as presented in the consolidated

Liquidity and Capital Resources
In March 2016, we issued 166,750,000 shares of our common stock, par value $1 per share, at a
price of $7.65 per share, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, for net proceeds of
$1,236 million. The proceeds were used to strengthen our balance sheet and for general
corporate purposes, including funding a portion of our Capital Program.
Also in March 2016, we increased our $3 billion unsecured Credit Facility by $300 million to a
total of $3.3 billion. Fees on the unused commitment of each lender, as well as the borrowing
options under the Credit Facility, remain unaffected by the increase.
Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, sales of non-core assets, internally
generated cash flow from operations, capital market transactions, and our $3.3 billion Credit
Facility. Our working capital requirements are supported by these sources and we may draw on
our $3.3 billion Credit Facility to meet short-term cash requirements, or issue debt or equity
securities through the shelf registration statement discussed below as part of our longer-term
liquidity and capital management. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed
above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our
current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our
capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of
debt maturities, and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.
Due to decreases in crude oil and U.S. natural gas prices, credit rating agencies reviewed
companies in the industry earlier this year, including us. During the first quarter of 2016, our
corporate credit rating was downgraded by: Standard & Poor's Ratings Services to BBB- (stable)
from BBB (stable); by Fitch Ratings to BBB (negative) from BBB+ (stable); and by Moody's
Investor Services, Inc. to Ba1 (negative) from Baa1 (stable). Any further rating downgrades could
increase our future cost of financing or limit our ability to access capital, and result in additional
collateral requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015 for a discussion of how a further downgrade in our credit ratings
could affect us.
The June 23, 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (“Brexit”) provided
uncertainty and potential volatility around European currencies, and resulted in a decline in the
value of the British pound, as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. Volatility in
exchange rates may continue in the short term as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the European
Union. A weaker British pound compared to the U.S. dollar during a reporting period causes local
currency results of our U.K. operations to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars. For our U.K.
operations a majority of our revenues are tied to global crude oil prices which are denominated in
U.S. dollars while a significant portion of our operating and capital costs are denominated in
British pounds. In addition, our U.K. operations have an asset retirement obligation, which
represents a future cash commitment. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our U.K.
operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations.
Capital Resources
Credit Arrangements and Borrowings
At June 30, 2016, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility.
At June 30, 2016, we had $7.3 billion in long-term debt outstanding, with our next debt maturity in
the amount of $682 million due in the fourth quarter of 2017.
We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in
the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings.
Shelf Registration
We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a "well-
known seasoned issuer" for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an
indeterminate amount of various types of equity and debt securities. 
Asset Disposals
During the quarter, we announced the sale of our Wyoming upstream and midstream assets for
proceeds of $870 million, before closing adjustments, of which approximately $690 million was
received in the second quarter.  The remaining asset sales are subject to the receipt of certain
tribal consents and are expected to close before year end. The proceeds for the remaining asset
sales were deposited into an escrow account by the buyer.
In March and April 2016, we entered into separate agreements to sell our 10% working interest in
the outside-operated Shenandoah discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, operated natural gas assets in
the Piceance basin in Colorado and certain undeveloped acreage in West Texas for a combined
total of approximately $80 million in proceeds, before closing adjustments. We closed on certain
of the asset sales during the six months ended June 30, 2016. The remaining asset sales are
expected to close by year-end.

Capital Requirements
We closed on our purchase agreement of PayRock for $888 million, as discussed in Note 5 to
the consolidated financial statements. We expect our Capital Program for full-year 2016 to be
$1.3 billion, or $100 million lower than the original budget, which includes the increased activity
from the PayRock acquisition.
On July 27, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.05 per share for the second
quarter of 2016 payable September 12, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business
on August 17, 2016.
As of June 30, 2016, we plan to make contributions of up to $34 million to our funded pension
plans during the remainder of 2016.
Contractual Cash Obligations
As of June 30, 2016, there are no material changes to our consolidated cash obligations to make
future payments under existing contracts, as disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K,
except for the agreement we entered into to acquire PayRock as described above, which was
paid with cash on hand.
During the third quarter we executed an agreement to terminate our Gulf of Mexico deepwater
drilling rig contract, as a result we expect to make a termination payment of $113 million during
the third quarter of 2016.
          
Environmental Matters and Other Contingencies
In July 2015, we received a request for information from the EPA under Section 114 of the Clean
Air Act regarding several tank batteries used in our Bakken operations.  Beginning in the second
quarter of 2016, we have been in settlement discussions with the State of North Dakota’s
Department of Health regarding potential noncompliance with the Clean Air Act, North Dakota
Century Code Air Pollution Control provisions, and implementing regulations. To date, no federal
or state enforcement action has been commenced in connection with this matter.  We anticipate
that resolution of this matter will result in civil or administrative penalties of an undetermined
amount and require us to undertake corrective actions which may increase our development
and/or operating costs.  We do not believe that any penalties or corrective action expenditures
that may result from this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operation or cash flows.

On our 2016 collars, the counterparty has the option to execute fixed-price swaps (swaptions)
at a weighted average price of $2.93 per MMBtu indexed to NYMEX Henry Hub, which is
exercisable on December 22, 2016. If counterparty exercises, the term of the fixed-price swaps
would be for the calendar year 2017 and, if all such options are exercised, 20,000 MMBtu per
day.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) was carried
out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  As of the end of the period covered by this Report
based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
June 30, 2016.  
During the second quarter of 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Part II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal and Administrative Proceedings
We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary
course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and
environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with
certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect
on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
In July 2015, we received a request for information from the EPA under Section 114 of the Clean
Air Act regarding several tank batteries used in our Bakken operations.  Beginning in the second
quarter of 2016, we have been in settlement discussions with the State of North Dakota’s
Department of Health regarding potential noncompliance with the Clean Air Act, North Dakota
Century Code Air Pollution Control provisions, and implementing regulations. To date, no federal
or state enforcement action has been commenced in connection with this matter.  We anticipate
that resolution of this matter will result in civil or administrative penalties of an undetermined
amount and require us to undertake corrective actions which may increase our development
and/or operating costs.  We do not believe that any penalties or corrective action expenditures
that may result from this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operation or cash flows.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business.  There have been
no material changes to the risk factors under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2015 Annual Report on
Form 10-K.
