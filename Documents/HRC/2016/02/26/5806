<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>     Tenth Session 
</b></p>
<p><b> Resolution 10/18. Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,  
     including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and affirming the 
inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that all States have an obligation to promote and protect human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, as stated in the Charter and as elaborated in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other applicable instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, the Council, the 
Security Council and the General Assembly, reaffirming, inter alia, the illegality of the Israeli 
settlements in the occupied territories, 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful </i>that Israel is a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of 
Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, which is applicable de jure to Palestinian 
and all Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem, and the 
Syrian Golan, and recalling the declaration adopted by the Conference of High Contracting 
Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, held in Geneva on 5 December 2001, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering </i>that the transfer by the occupying Power of parts of its own civilian 
population into the territory it occupies constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
and relevant provisions of customary law, including those codified in Additional Protocol I to the 
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of 
Justice on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory</i>, and its conclusion that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem, were established in breach of international law, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>General Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>that the Israeli settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
constitute very serious violations of international humanitarian law and of the human rights of 
the Palestinian people therein and undermine international efforts, including the Annapolis Peace 
Conference of 27 November 2007 and the Paris International Donors&#8217; Conference for the 
Palestinian State of 17 December 2007, aimed at invigorating the peace process and establishing 
a viable, contiguous, sovereign and independent Palestinian State by the end of 2008, </p>

<p> </p>
<p> 2 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its attachment to the implementation by both parties of their obligations under 
the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
(S/2003/529, annex), and noting specifically its call for a freeze on all settlement activity, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its grave concern </i>about the continuation by Israel, the occupying Power, of 
settlements building and expansion in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in violation of 
international humanitarian law and relevant United Nations resolutions, including plans to 
expand and connect Israeli settlements around occupied East Jerusalem, thus threatening the 
creation of a contiguous Palestinian State, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern </i>that continuing Israeli settlement activity undermines the realization 
of a two-State solution, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing grave concern </i>at the continuing construction, contrary to international law, 
by Israel of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around 
East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the wall in departure 
from the Armistice Line of 1949, which could prejudge future negotiations and make the 
two-State solution physically impossible to implement and which is causing the Palestinian 
people further humanitarian hardship, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>that the route of the wall has been traced in such a way as to include the 
great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern </i>at the failure of the Government of Israel to cooperate fully with the 
relevant United Nations mechanisms, in particular the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the 
Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 (A/HRC/10/20), and calls upon the Government of 
Israel to cooperate with all relevant special rapporteurs in accordance with Council 
resolution S-9/1 to allow them to discharge their mandates fully; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Deplores </i>the recent Israeli announcements of the construction of new housing units 
for Israeli settlers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in and around occupied 
East Jerusalem, as they undermine the peace process and the creation of a contiguous, sovereign 
and independent Palestinian State and are in violation of international law and Israeli pledges at 
the Annapolis Peace Conference; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses its grave concern </i>at: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The continuing Israeli settlement and related activities, in violation of international 
law, including the expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, the demolition of houses, 
the confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion of Palestinians and the construction of 
bypass roads, which change the physical character and demographic composition of the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and constitute a 
violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time 
of War, of 12 August 1949, and in particular article 49 of that Convention, and recalls that 
settlements are a major obstacle to the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace and to 
the creation of an independent, viable, sovereign and democratic Palestinian State; </p>

<p> 3
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The Israeli planned settlement construction in the vicinity of the Adam settlements in 
the occupied West Bank, which constitutes a new settlement block; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The increasing number of newly built structures, in 2008 amounting to 1,257, 
including 748 permanent buildings and 509 mobile structures, which obstruct the efforts of the 
international community to advance the Middle East peace process; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The implications for the final status negotiations of the announcement by Israel that 
it will retain the major settlement blocks in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
settlements located in the Jordan Valley; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) The expansion of Israeli settlements and the construction of new ones in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory rendered inaccessible behind the wall, which create a fait 
accompli on the ground that could well be permanent and would be tantamount to de facto 
annexation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) The continued closures of and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and the 
restriction of the freedom of movement of people and goods, including the repeated closures of 
the crossing points of the Occupied Gaza Strip, which have created an extremely precarious 
humanitarian situation for the civilian population as well as impaired the economic and social 
rights of the Palestinian people; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) The continued construction, contrary to international law, of the wall inside the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) The latest Israeli plan to demolish more than 88 houses in the Al-Bustan 
neighbourhood of Silwan, which will result in the displacement of more than 1,500 Palestinian 
residents of East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges </i>Israel, the occupying Power: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To reverse the settlement policy in the occupied territories, including in 
East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan and, as a first step towards their dismantlement, to stop 
immediately the expansion of the existing settlements, including &#8220;natural growth&#8221; and related 
activities; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To prevent any new installation of settlers in the occupied territories; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges</i> the full implementation of the Agreement on Movement and Access of 
15 November 2005, particularly the urgent reopening of the Rafah and Karni crossings, which 
are crucial to the passage of foodstuffs and essential supplies, as well as the access of 
United Nations agencies to and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory; 
</p>
<p><i> 6. Calls upon </i>Israel to take and implement serious measures, including confiscation of 
arms and enforcement of criminal sanctions, with the aim of preventing acts of violence by 
Israeli settlers, and other measures to guarantee the safety and protection of the Palestinian 
civilians and Palestinian properties in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Also calls upon </i>Israel to implement the recommendations regarding the settlements 
made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in her report to the </p>

<p> </p>
<p> 4 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights on her visit to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Israel, Egypt 
and Jordan (E/CN.4/2001/114); 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Demands </i>that Israel, the occupying Power, comply fully with its legal obligations, as 
mentioned in the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of Justice; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Urges </i>the parties to give renewed impetus to the peace process in line with the 
Annapolis Peace Conference and the Paris International Donors&#8217; Conference for the Palestinian 
State and to implement fully the road map endorsed by the Security Council in its 
resolution 1515 (2003) of 19 November 2003, with the aim of reaching a comprehensive 
political settlement in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council, including 
resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), and other relevant United Nations resolutions, the 
principles of the Peace Conference on the Middle East, held in Madrid on 30 October 1991, the 
Oslo accords and subsequent agreements, which will allow two States, Israel and Palestine, to 
live in peace and security; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Decides </i>to continue the consideration of this question at its thirteenth session in 
March 2010. 
</p>
