PENGROWTH Second Quarter 2015 Summary of Financial &
Operating Results
1
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") of financial results should be
read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2015 of Pengrowth Energy Corporation ("Pengrowth" or the
"Corporation"). This MD&A is based on information available to August 6, 2015.
Pengrowth’s second quarter and year to date results for 2015 are contained within this MD&A.
BUSINESS OF THE CORPORATION
Pengrowth is a Canadian resource company that is engaged in the production, development,
exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas assets. The financial and operating results from
property dispositions are included in Pengrowth’s results up to the time of closing for each
disposition.
FREQUENTLY RECURRING TERMS
Pengrowth uses the following frequently recurring industry terms in this MD&A: "bbls" refers to
barrels, "bbl/d" refers to barrels per day, "Mbbls" refers to thousands of barrels, "boe" refers to
barrels of oil equivalent, "boe/d" refers to barrels of oil equivalent per day, "Mboe" refers to
thousand boe, "MMboe" refers to million boe, "Mcf" refers to thousand cubic feet, "Mcf/d" refers to
thousand cubic feet per day, "MMcf" refers to million cubic feet, "Bcf" refers to billion cubic feet,
"MMBtu" refers to million British thermal units, "MMBtu/d" refers to million British thermal units per
day, "MW" refers to megawatt, "MWh" refers to megawatt hour, "WTI" refers to West Texas
Intermediate crude oil price, "WCS" refers to Western Canadian Select crude oil price, "AECO"
refers to Alberta natural gas price point, "NYMEX" refers to New York Mercantile Exchange, "NGI
Chicago" refers to Chicago natural gas price point and "AESO" refers to Alberta power price
point. Bitumen is reported as heavy oil throughout this document. Disclosure provided herein in
respect of a boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six
Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil equivalent is based on an energy equivalency
conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value
equivalency at the wellhead.
ADVISORY REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This MD&A contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of securities laws, including
the "safe harbour" provisions of Canadian securities legislation and the United States Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking information is often, but not always,
identified by the use of words such as "anticipate", "believe", "expect", "plan", "intend", "forecast",
"target", "project", "guidance", "may", "will", "should", "could", "estimate", "predict" or similar
words suggesting future outcomes or language suggesting an outlook. Forward-looking
statements in this MD&A include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: reserves,
production, the proportion of production of each product type, production additions from
Pengrowth's development program, royalty expenses, operating expenses, tax horizon, deferred
income taxes, goodwill, Asset Retirement Obligations ("ARO"), remediation, reclamation and
abandonment expenses, clean-up and remediation costs, capital expenditures, development
activities, General and Administrative Expenses ("G&A") and proceeds from the disposal of
properties. Statements relating to "reserves" are forward-looking statements, as they involve the
implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions that the reserves described
exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and can profitably be produced in the future.
Forward-looking statements and information are based on Pengrowth's current beliefs as well as
assumptions made by, and information currently available to, Pengrowth concerning general
economic and financial market conditions, anticipated financial performance, business
prospects, strategies, regulatory developments, including in respect of taxation, royalty rates and
environmental protection, future capital expenditures and the timing thereof, future oil and natural
gas commodity prices and differentials between light, medium and heavy oil prices, future oil and
natural gas production levels, future exchange rates and interest rates, the amount of future cash
dividends paid by Pengrowth, the cost of expanding our property holdings, our ability to obtain
labour and equipment in a timely manner to carry out development activities, our ability to market
our oil and natural gas successfully to current and new customers including transportation
availability, the impact of increasing competition, our ability to obtain financing on acceptable
terms and meet financial covenants and our ability to add production and reserves through our
development, exploitation and exploration activities. Although management considers these
assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to it, they may prove to be
incorrect.
PENGROWTH Second Quarter 2015 Management's Discussion
and Analysis
2
By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both
general and specific, and risks that predictions, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking
statements will not be achieved. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on these
statements as a number of important factors could cause the actual results to differ materially
from the beliefs, plans, objectives, expectations and anticipations, estimates and intentions
expressed in such forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: the
volatility of oil and gas prices; Canadian light and heavy oil differentials; production and
development costs and capital expenditures; the imprecision of reserve estimates and estimates
of recoverable quantities of oil, natural gas and liquids; Pengrowth's ability to replace and
expand oil and gas reserves, ability to produce those reserves; production may be impacted by
unforeseen events such as equipment and transportation failures and weather related issues;
environmental claims and liabilities; incorrect assessments of value when making acquisitions;
increases in debt service charges; the loss of key personnel; the marketability of production;
defaults by third party operators; unforeseen title defects; fluctuations in foreign currency and
exchange rates; inadequate insurance coverage; counterparty risk; compliance with
environmental laws and regulations; changes in tax and royalty laws; Pengrowth's ability to
access external sources of debt and equity capital; new International Financial Reporting
Standards ("IFRS"); and the implementation of greenhouse gas emissions legislation. Further
information regarding these factors may be found under the heading "Business Risks" herein and
under "Risk Factors" in Pengrowth's most recent Annual Information Form ("AIF"), and in
Pengrowth’s most recent audited annual Consolidated Financial Statements, management
information circular, quarterly reports, material change reports and news releases. Copies of
Pengrowth’s public filings are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and EDGAR at
www.sec.gov.
Pengrowth cautions that the foregoing list of factors that may affect future results is not
exhaustive. When relying on our forward-looking statements to make decisions with respect to
Pengrowth, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other
uncertainties and potential events. Furthermore, the forward-looking statements contained in this
MD&A are made as of the date of this MD&A and Pengrowth does not undertake any obligation
to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward-looking statements, except as required
by law. The forward-looking statements in this document are provided for the limited purpose of
enabling current and potential investors to evaluate an investment in Pengrowth. Readers are
cautioned that such statements may not be appropriate, and should not be used for other
purposes.
The forward-looking statements contained in this MD&A are expressly qualified by this
cautionary statement.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS. The
preparation of unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingencies at the date of the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimated.
Pengrowth’s ARO risk free discount rate changed from 2.3 percent at December 31, 2014 to 2.0
percent at March 31, 2015 and back to 2.3 percent at June 30, 2015 due to fluctuations in the 30
year Canadian Government long term bond rate which drives Pengrowth’s estimate of the ARO
discount rate. There were no significant changes to Pengrowth's critical accounting estimates in
the six months ended June 30, 2015. For more information about Pengrowth's critical accounting
estimates refer to the December 31, 2014 annual report.
COMPARATIVE FIGURES
Certain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current period presentation.
ADDITIONAL GAAP MEASURE
Funds Flow from Operations
Pengrowth uses funds flow from operations, a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
("GAAP") measure that is not defined under IFRS. Management believes that in addition to cash
provided by operations, funds flow from operations, as reported as a subtotal in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flow is a useful supplemental measure as it provides an indication of the
funds generated by Pengrowth’s principal business activities prior to consideration of changes in
working capital and remediation expenditures. Pengrowth considers this to be a key measure of
performance as it demonstrates its ability to generate cash flow necessary to fund dividends and
capital investments.
PENGROWTH Second Quarter 2015 Management's Discussion
and Analysis
3
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
This MD&A refers to certain financial measures that are not determined in accordance with IFRS.
These measures do not have standardized meanings and may not be comparable to similar
measures presented by other oil and gas companies.
Operating netbacks do not have standardized meanings prescribed by GAAP. Pengrowth’s
operating netbacks have been calculated by taking oil and gas sales, royalties, operating and
transportation expenses as well as realized commodity risk management balances, as
applicable, directly from the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and dividing by
production. See the section of this MD&A entitled Operating Netbacks for a discussion of the
calculation.
Management monitors Pengrowth’s capital structure using non-GAAP financial metrics. The two
metrics are total debt to the trailing twelve months Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depletion,
Depreciation, Amortization, Accretion, and other non-cash items ("Adjusted EBITDA") and total
debt to total capitalization. Total debt is the sum of working capital and long term debt including
convertible debentures as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and total capitalization is
the sum of total debt and shareholders’ equity.
Management believes that, in addition to net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) is a useful
supplemental measure as it reflects the underlying performance of Pengrowth’s business
activities by excluding the after tax effect of non-cash commodity, power and interest mark to
market gains and losses, non-cash mark to market gains and losses on investments and
unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses, as applicable, that may significantly impact net
income (loss) from period to period.
Payout ratio and net payout ratio are terms used to evaluate financial flexibility and the capacity
to fund dividends. Payout ratio is defined on a percentage basis as dividends declared divided
by funds flow from operations. Net payout ratio is calculated as dividends declared net of
proceeds from the Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("DRIP") divided by funds flow from operations.
Management believes that segregating G&A expenses into cash and non-cash expenses is
useful to the reader, as non-cash expenses only affect net income (loss) but not funds flow from
operations.
OPERATIONAL MEASURES
The reserves and production in this MD&A refer to company-interest reserves or production that
is Pengrowth’s working interest share of production or reserves prior to the deduction of Crown
and other royalties plus any Pengrowth-owned royalty interest in production or reserves at the
wellhead, in accordance with Canadian industry practice. Company-interest is more fully
described in the AIF.
When converting natural gas to equivalent barrels of oil within this MD&A, Pengrowth uses the
industry standard of six Mcf to one boe. Barrels of oil equivalent may be misleading, particularly if
used in isolation; a conversion ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one boe is based on an energy
equivalency conversion and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.
CURRENCY
All amounts are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise specified.

TREATMENT OF LINDBERGH RESULTS
Prior to April 1, 2015, only the Lindbergh pilot project production and related revenue and
expenses were included in the reported financial and operating information and all expenses, net
of revenue, from the first commercial phase of the Lindbergh thermal project ("Lindbergh Phase
1") were capitalized. Upon declaration of commerciality effective April 1, 2015, all Lindbergh
related revenues and expenses are included in the second quarter and year to date 2015
financial and operating results. The combined results are referred to as Lindbergh throughout this
document.

(2) Previous 2015 Guidance was $220 - $240 million.
Year to date 2015 production of 71,737 boe/d was on the higher end of full year 2015 Guidance.
In light of the continued weakness in commodity prices and uncertainty associated with future
Alberta royalty rates, Pengrowth has reduced its 2015 capital expenditures Guidance by 10 - 15
percent to a range of $190 - $210 million for the full year.
Year to date 2015 capital expenditures amounted to $149.2 million, representing approximately
75 percent of Pengrowth's 2015 revised Guidance. The year to date 2015 capital expenditures
incorporate construction of the Lindbergh sales pipeline connection to Husky Energy Inc.
(”Husky”), Lindbergh Phase 1 construction completion and the completion of drilling in early 2015
that commenced in late 2014 related to Pengrowth's conventional properties.
Year to date 2015 royalty expenses as a percentage of sales, operating expenses per boe and
cash G&A expenses per boe are all in line with full year 2015 Guidance.

Funds flow from operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 excludes $9.8
million and $93.9 million, respectively, related to the settlement of foreign exchange swap
contracts.
Pengrowth's second quarter of 2015 funds flow from operations decreased 1 percent compared
to the first quarter of 2015 as the effect of the 7 percent increase in sales volumes, mainly from
Lindbergh Phase 1, and higher commodity prices after realized risk management mostly offset
higher operating, interest and transportation expenses.
Second quarter of 2015 funds flow from operations decreased 8 percent compared to the same
period last year as the significantly lower commodity prices were partially offset by realized
commodity risk management gains and lower royalties.
Pengrowth's year to date 2015 funds flow from operations decreased 14 percent compared to the
same period in 2014 as significantly lower commodity prices and lower volumes were partly
offset by realized commodity risk management gains, along with lower royalties and operating
expenses.
Net Loss
Pengrowth recorded a net loss of $134.4 million in the second quarter of 2015 primarily due to an
unrealized commodity risk management loss of $139.6 million. This loss resulted from a
reduction in the fair value of risk management contracts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
June 30, 2015 due to an increase in the Cdn$ WTI forward curve at June 30, 2015 relative to
March 31, 2015, in addition to settling of risk management contracts during the quarter.
The net loss was $26.1 million lower in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter
of 2015 mainly due to the absence of the first quarter unrealized foreign exchange losses partly
offset by the absence of the first quarter U.S./Canadian dollar swap contracts monetization of
$84.1 million ($73.4 million after-tax) and higher unrealized commodity risk management losses.
The net loss was $125.6 million higher in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the same
period last year primarily due to higher unrealized commodity risk management losses.
The year to date 2015 net loss was $169.9 million higher compared to 2014 due to higher
unrealized foreign exchange losses, driven by the weakening of the Canadian dollar, and higher
unrealized commodity risk management losses partly offset by the settlement of the
U.S./Canadian dollar swap contracts in 2015 resulting in $93.9 million ($81.9 million after-tax) of
realized foreign exchange gains.

Pengrowth posted an adjusted net loss of $38.9 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared
to adjusted net income of $64.8 million in the first quarter of 2015, primarily driven by the absence
of the $84.1 million ($73.4 million after-tax) realized foreign exchange gain from monetizing a
series of U.S. dollar swap contracts in the first quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2015
loss on property dispositions.
The second quarter of 2015 adjusted net loss increased $14.1 million compared to the same
period last year primarily due to the second quarter of 2015 loss on property dispositions. The
year to date 2015 adjusted net income of $25.9 million represents a $53.5 million improvement
compared to the adjusted net loss in the same period last year due to the realized foreign
exchange gain from settling a series of U.S. dollar swap contracts in 2015 partly offset by lower
funds flow from operations.

Pengrowth continued with its strategy of deferring significant development capital expenditures
until a sustained recovery in commodity prices coupled with a more economic cost structure is
present, limiting second quarter of 2015 capital expenditures to $50.8 million. In the second
quarter of 2015, 56 percent of the capital was spent at Lindbergh, 34 percent was spent on
turnaround, maintenance and enhancement activities at Pengrowth's conventional properties
and the remainder was spent on minor partner operated development.
Year to date 2015 capital spending amounted to $149.2 million, of which 52 percent was
invested at Lindbergh and 28 percent on drilling, completions and facilities at Pengrowth's
conventional properties with the remaining 20 percent invested in maintenance, land, seismic
and other capital.
Focus Areas
Lindbergh
Pengrowth’s 100 percent owned and operated Lindbergh thermal project is located in the Cold
Lake area of Alberta and encompasses 42.5 sections of land. Cost advantages of the Lindbergh
resource include enhanced bitumen quality and flow characteristics resulting in an efficient
steam oil ratio which translates into a lower operating cost structure and higher netbacks
compared to many thermal projects. The first commercial phase of Lindbergh was sanctioned by
Pengrowth’s Board of Directors in January 2013, first steam was announced in December 2014,
commerciality was declared as of April 1, 2015, and the pilot well pairs were redirected to the
commercial facility on April 11, 2015. The Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") application
for the Lindbergh expansion to 30,000 bbl/d was submitted to the regulators in December 2013.
During the second quarter of 2015, $28.4 million was invested at Lindbergh on the completion of
the sales pipeline connection to Husky, the installation of 15 downhole pumps, central
processing facility optimization and engineering for the planned second phase expansion of
Lindbergh to 30,000 bbl/d.
Production operations progressed as planned in the quarter, with all three well pads having been
converted from circulation to SAGD by June 1, 2015. Phase 1 commercial well pairs continue to
demonstrate similar production profiles as the two pilot well pairs. The June 2015 monthly
production ramped up to 13,808 bbl/d with an Instantaneous Steam Oil Ratio ("ISOR") of 2.0. The
second quarter of 2015 production averaged 10,930 bbl/d with an ISOR of 2.5. These volumes
include production from the former two well pair pilot project of approximately 1,500 bbl/d.

Despite the current low commodity price environment, Lindbergh generated a strong netback in
the second quarter of 2015. The netback below excludes realized commodity risk management
gains. Lindbergh operating expenses are expected to be higher in the second half of 2015 due to
a scheduled turnaround as required by ABSA regulations.

Lindbergh heavy oil operating netback
Pengrowth has entered into a transportation agreement with Husky for delivery of production from
Lindbergh to Hardisty, Alberta, with options to nominate additional future volumes as Lindbergh
expands. Pengrowth retains maximum flexibility in regards to transportation options at Lindbergh
and will be able to utilize both rail and pipeline to move production to markets and maximize
netbacks. Construction and commissioning of the pipeline was completed in late June 2015 and
the pipeline was in full operation by quarter end allowing Pengrowth to replace Lindbergh
trucking costs with lower pipeline tolls as of July 2015.
Lindbergh provides Pengrowth with the potential to ultimately develop annual bitumen
production of 40,000 to 50,000 bbl/d. This is expected to be low cost production with low
sustaining capital requirements and long reserve life. Total capital invested in Lindbergh Phase 1
was approximately $690 million since the project was sanctioned in January 2013.
Conventional Oil and Gas
Pengrowth’s significant conventional oil and gas portfolio includes a large, contiguous land base
in the Greater Olds/Garrington area, encompassing over 500 gross (250 net) sections of land,
with opportunities in the Cardium, Viking and Mannville sands as well as in the Mississippian
carbonate section. The existing, extensive gathering and processing infrastructure provides an
efficient platform for continued development in this area. Pengrowth also controls large light oil
accumulations in the Swan Hills area of northern Alberta with low production decline rates and
strong cash flow, as well as Montney natural gas opportunities with significant liquid yields in
north east British Columbia.
Conventional development was curtailed in 2015, with the second quarter of 2015 capital
spending of $20.9 million focused on maintenance and enhancement and minor partner operated
development.

Second quarter of 2015 average daily production increased 7 percent compared to the first
quarter of 2015 as Lindbergh Phase 1 production more than offset natural declines, planned
turnaround activity in both operated and third party facilities, 2015 property dispositions and shut-
in of uneconomic production. Second quarter of 2015 average daily production increased slightly
compared to the same period last year as the ramp up of Lindbergh Phase 1 production mitigated
production declines related to 2015 capital development curtailments, 2014 and 2015 property
dispositions, planned turnaround activities and shut-in of uneconomic natural gas production.
Year to date 2015 average daily production decreased 4 percent compared to the same period
last year due to production declines, 2014 and 2015 property dispositions, planned turnaround
activities and shut-in of uneconomic natural gas production. These decreases were partly offset
by Lindbergh Phase 1 production and incremental production from the late 2014 and the
curtailed 2015 development programs.
PENGROWTH Second Quarter 2015 Management's Discussion
and Analysis
10
Light Oil
Second quarter of 2015 light oil production decreased 11 percent compared to the first quarter of
2015 mainly due to turnaround activity at Judy Creek combined with reduced development
activity in the Cardium.
Second quarter and year to date 2015 light oil production decreased 23 percent and 20 percent
compared to the same periods last year, respectively, due to minor 2014 property dispositions
combined with the Judy Creek turnaround and reduced capital development activity in 2015.
Heavy Oil
Second quarter of 2015 heavy oil production more than doubled compared to both the first
quarter of 2015 and second quarter of 2014 resulting from the ramp up of the Lindbergh Phase 1
production in the second quarter of 2015. The June 2015 monthly Lindbergh production ramped
up to 13,808 bbl/d with an ISOR of 2.0. The second quarter of 2015 Lindbergh production
averaged 10,930 bbl/d with an ISOR of 2.5. These volumes include production from the former
two well pair pilot project of approximately 1,500 bbl/d.
Year to date 2015 heavy oil production increased 52 percent compared to 2014 also due to
inclusion of the Lindbergh Phase 1 production partly offset by reduced production from Jenner
due to reduced development activity in 2015.
NGLs
Second quarter of 2015 NGL production remained unchanged compared to the first quarter of
2015 as the impact of the Judy Creek turnaround and reduced development activity in the second
quarter of 2015 was offset by a Sable Offshore Energy Project ("SOEP") condensate shipment
which occurred in May of 2015.
Second quarter and year to date 2015 NGL production decreased 18 percent compared to the
same periods last year also resulting from the Judy Creek turnaround activity and reduced
development activity.
Natural Gas
Second quarter of 2015 natural gas production decreased 6 percent compared to the first quarter
of 2015 as a result of reduced capital spending combined with third party turnaround activity,
2015 dispositions and the full quarter impact of shut-in uneconomic natural gas production.
Second quarter and year to date 2015 natural gas production decreased 4 percent and 2 percent
compared to the same periods last year, respectively. This was also due to reduced capital
development, third party turnaround activity and shut-in of uneconomic natural gas production
partly offset by additions from the 2014 Groundbirch development program.

the year over year decrease in crude oil prices was the decline in the value of the Canadian
dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. As Pengrowth reports its revenues in Canadian dollars, the
weaker Canadian dollar partially offset the declines in the U.S. dollar based WTI price.
Edmonton par light oil price averaged Cdn$67.73/bbl in the second quarter of 2015, an increase
of 31 percent compared to the first quarter of 2015 but a decrease of 36 percent compared to the
second quarter of 2014. Year to date 2015 Edmonton par light oil price averaged Cdn$59.84/bbl,
a decrease of 42 percent compared to the same period in 2014. Lower WTI prices were the main
driver behind the decrease year over year, slightly offset by the narrowing of the light oil
differential in 2015.
WCS heavy oil price averaged Cdn$57.00/bbl in the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 36
percent compared to the first quarter of 2015 but a decrease of 37 percent compared to the
second quarter of 2014. Year to date 2015 WCS heavy oil price averaged Cdn$49.54/bbl, a
decrease of 43 percent compared to the same period in 2014. Lower WTI prices partially offset by
a narrowing of the heavy oil differential in 2015 contributed to the lower prices year over year.
Location and quality differentials, growing U.S. crude oil production as well as transportation
bottlenecks influence Canadian crude oil price differentials relative to WTI. When differentials
widen significantly, Pengrowth takes proactive steps to improve realizations, including
transporting some crude oil by rail.
Pengrowth's second quarter of 2015 average realized oil sales prices, excluding realized
commodity risk management, moved in conjunction with the above described benchmark prices
and differentials, as per the table above.
Pengrowth’s average realized natural gas liquids sales price, excluding realized commodity risk
management, was Cdn$31.33/bbl during the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 27 percent
compared to the first quarter of 2015. A condensate shipment from SOEP during the quarter was
the primary driver behind the increase in realized pricing. Lower averaged realized NGL prices
year over year were driven by lower benchmark prices for all products, with the greatest impact
on propane prices due to a large increase in supply.

second quarter of 2014, respectively. Year to date 2015 NYMEX natural gas price averaged
Cdn$3.43/MMBtu, a decrease of 33 percent compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease
in prices resulted from weaker demand across North America coupled with continued growth in

Pengrowth’s second quarter of 2015 average realized sales price, before the effects of
commodity risk management activities, was Cdn$36.58/boe and represented an increase of 17
percent compared to the first quarter of 2015 and a decrease of 39 percent compared to the
second quarter of 2014. Year to date 2015 average realized sales price of Cdn$34.09/boe
declined 45 percent compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease in prices year over year
was due to declines in crude oil and natural gas benchmark prices. After taking into account the
impacts of commodity risk management activities and other income, Pengrowth’s second quarter
of 2015 average realized price was Cdn$45.82/boe, remaining essentially unchanged from the
first quarter of 2015, but declining 15 percent from the second quarter of 2014. Year to date 2015,
Pengrowth’s average realized price was Cdn$45.79/boe, a decrease of 17 percent compared to
the same period in 2014. The decline in realized prices year over year was due to the decrease
in benchmark prices mentioned above, offset by the strength of Pengrowth's active risk
management program.

Pengrowth has an active commodity risk management program which primarily uses forward
price swaps and puts to manage the exposure to commodity price fluctuations and provide a
measure of stability and predictability to cash flows. Changes in the business environment are
regularly monitored by management and the Board of Directors to ensure that Pengrowth's active
risk management program is adequate and aligned with the long term strategic goals of the
Corporation. In addition to forward price swaps and puts, Pengrowth also manages oil price
differentials using a combination of financial swaps and physical contracts.
Realized commodity risk management gains and losses vary from period to period and are a
function of the volumes under risk management contracts, the fixed prices of those risk
management contracts and the benchmark pricing for the commodities under risk management
contracts. Realized losses result when the average fixed risk management contracted price is
lower than the benchmark prices, while realized gains are recorded when the average fixed risk
management contracted price is higher than the benchmark prices at settlement. Realized gains
and losses directly impact cash flow for the period.

PENGROWTH Second Quarter 2015 Management's Discussion

A realized commodity risk management gain of $59.1 million or $8.77/boe was recorded in the
second quarter of 2015 compared to an $85.7 million or $13.74/boe gain in the first quarter of
2015 as the second quarter of 2015 increase in the oil benchmark prices translated into lower
realized commodity risk management gains.
Second quarter and year to date 2015 realized commodity risk management gains of $59.1
million or $8.77/boe and $144.8 million or $11.15/boe compared to losses in the same periods
last year, as per the table above, resulted primarily from a decline in the oil benchmark prices
starting in the second half of 2014.
Unrealized gains and losses vary period to period and are a function of the volumes under risk
management contracts, the fixed prices of those risk management contracts and the forward
curve pricing for the commodities under risk management contracts at the end of the period.
Unrealized losses result when the forward price curve moves higher than the fixed price, with the
magnitude of the loss being proportional to the movement in the forward price curve while
unrealized gains result when the forward price curve moves lower than the fixed price, with the
magnitude of the gain being proportional to the movement in the forward price curve. Unrealized
gains and losses are also affected by the change in volumes under risk management in the
period. Unrealized commodity risk management gains and losses do not impact cash flow for the
period.
Pengrowth recorded an unrealized commodity risk management loss of $139.6 million in the
second quarter of 2015 compared to an unrealized loss of $66.8 million in the first quarter of
2015. These losses are the result of unrealized commodity risk management assets decreasing

Second quarter and year to date 2015 unrealized commodity risk management losses increased
relative to the same periods last year, as per the table above, also due to settlements of contracts
and movements in the forward curve pricing.

(1) Includes a Cdn$1 change in financial differential risk management contracts.
The changes in fair value of the forward risk management contracts directly affect reported net
income (loss) through the unrealized amounts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of
Income (Loss) during the period. The effect on cash flow will be recognized separately only upon
settlement of the risk management contracts, which could vary significantly from the unrealized
amount recorded due to timing and prices when each contract is settled.
If each commodity risk management contract were to have settled at June 30, 2015, revenue and
cash flow would have been $214.7 million higher than if the risk management contracts were not
in place based on the estimated fair value of the risk management contracts at period end. The
$214.7 million is composed of net assets of $161.0 million relating to risk management contracts
expiring within one year and assets of $53.7 million relating to risk management contracts
expiring beyond one year.
Pengrowth has not designated any outstanding commodity risk management contracts as
hedges for accounting purposes and therefore records these risk management contracts on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value and recognizes changes in fair value on the
Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as unrealized commodity risk management gains
(losses). The volatility in net income (loss) will continue to the extent that the fair value of the
commodity risk management contracts fluctuates. However, these non-cash amounts do not
affect Pengrowth’s cash flow until realized.
Realized commodity risk management gains (losses) on crude oil and natural gas contracts are
recorded separately on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and impact cash flow at
that time. Realized risk management gains (losses) on power contracts are recorded in operating
expenses and the unrealized amounts are recorded in other (income) expense.
In accordance with policies approved by its Board of Directors, Pengrowth may sell forward its
production and purchase risk management contracts by product volume or power purchases as
follows:

1 - 24 Months Up to 65%
25 - 48 Months Up to 50%

Following the significant asset divestments in 2013, the 2015 oil risk management contracts

Light oil sales increased 16 percent in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of
2015 resulting from a 31 percent increase in the Edmonton par light oil benchmark price. This
was partly offset by the effect of lower light oil volumes impacted by the second quarter
turnaround activity and production declines. Second quarter of 2015 heavy oil sales increased
182 percent due to inclusion of the Lindbergh Phase 1 production volumes in addition to a 36
percent increase in the WCS heavy oil benchmark price. NGL sales increased 29 percent in the
second quarter of 2015 as a result of additional condensate sales from the May 2015 SOEP
condensate shipment. Natural gas sales decreased 27 percent primarily in response to weaker
natural gas prices relative to the first quarter of 2015.

Year to date 2015 light oil sales decreased 55 percent compared to the same period in 2014 due
to a 42 percent decrease in the Edmonton par light oil benchmark price combined with lower light
oil sales volumes due to minor property dispositions, turnaround activity and production declines.
Heavy oil sales decreased 13 percent as the effect of the 43 percent decrease in the WCS heavy
oil benchmark price exceeded the inclusion of the Lindbergh Phase 1 production volumes. NGL
sales decreased 60 percent driven by the impact of lower commodity prices and lower volumes
due to turnaround activity and production declines year over year. Natural gas sales decreased

Royalties include Crown, freehold, overriding royalties and mineral taxes. Lindbergh Phase 1
royalties are also incorporated as of the second quarter of 2015 following the April 1, 2015
declaration of commerciality.
The applicable Lindbergh Phase 1 royalty rates are price sensitive and change depending on
whether the project is pre-payout or post-payout. The project will reach payout when its
cumulative revenues exceed its cumulative eligible costs. The royalty rate applicable to the pre-
payout Lindbergh Phase 1 project varies from 1 percent when the monthly $Cdn equivalent WTI
price is less than or equal to $55/bbl to 9 percent when the $Cdn equivalent WTI price is in
excess of $120/bbl. The Lindbergh Phase 1 project is currently in pre-payout.
Second quarter of 2015 royalties as a percentage of sales decreased to 10.6 percent from 12.4
percent in the first quarter of 2015 and 19.2 percent in the second quarter of 2014 primarily driven
by the favourable effect of lower commodity prices on royalties in 2015 as well as inclusion of the
Lindbergh Phase 1 royalties which are currently subject to pre-payout royalty rates.
Year to date 2015 royalties as a percentage of sales decreased to 11.4 percent from 18.2 percent
in 2014 also impacted by lower 2015 commodity prices and inclusion of the Lindbergh Phase 1
royalties as of April 1, 2015.

Second quarter of 2015 operating expenses increased $13.9 million or 15 percent compared to
the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to inclusion of the Lindbergh Phase 1 operating expenses
and second quarter 2015 scheduled turnaround costs. This was partly offset by the absence of
expenses related to shut-in uneconomic gas volumes and property dispositions in 2015. On a per
boe basis, second quarter of 2015 operating expenses increased $0.94/boe primarily due to
turnaround costs in the quarter. Lindbergh operating expenses were $12.6 million or $12.66/boe
in the second quarter of 2015.
Second quarter and year to date 2015 operating expenses decreased $7.7 million or 7 percent
and $18.8 million or 9 percent compared to the same periods in 2014, respectively, as a result of
ongoing cost control efforts, lower turnaround activity and the absence of expenses related to
uneconomic shut-in gas volumes and property dispositions. This was partly offset by inclusion of
the Lindbergh Phase 1 operating expenses in the second quarter of 2015 results. On a per boe
basis, second quarter and year to date 2015 operating expenses decreased $1.22/boe and
$0.83/boe compared to the same periods last year, respectively, due to the impact of lower costs
noted above.

Transportation expenses
$/boe
Second quarter of 2015 transportation expenses increased $4.4 million or 46 percent compared
to the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to the additional sales product trucking costs related to
the Lindbergh Phase 1 production. In future periods, these trucking costs will be replaced by
lower pipeline tolls with the completion of the Husky sales pipeline. On a per boe basis, second
quarter of 2015 transportation expenses increased $0.54/boe compared to the first quarter of
2015 driven by the increased trucking costs.
Second quarter and year to date 2015 transportation expenses increased $6.8 million or 94
percent and $8.0 million or 51 percent compared to the same periods in 2014, respectively,
resulting from higher pipeline tariffs and moving natural gas directly into the Chicago market in
2015 in addition to the Lindbergh Phase 1 production trucking costs. Pengrowth commenced
directly marketing and delivering natural gas to the Chicago sales point in November of 2014
using Pengrowth's existing Alliance pipeline capacity with the intent to increase the overall
netback. Previously, Pengrowth's Alliance pipeline capacity was managed by a third party and
with the direct assumption of the pipeline capacity this has increased reported transportation
expenses. On a per boe basis, second quarter and year to date 2015 transportation expenses
increased $1.01/boe and $0.66/boe compared to the same periods last year, respectively, due to
the increase in transportation expenses.
Pengrowth incurs transportation expenses for its natural gas production once the product enters
a pipeline at a title transfer point. Pengrowth has the option to sell some of its natural gas directly
to markets outside of Alberta by incurring additional transportation costs. Pengrowth also incurs
transportation expenses on its oil and NGL production including sales product trucking costs and
pipeline costs up to the custody transfer point. Pengrowth has elected to sell approximately 72
percent of its crude oil at market points beyond the wellhead, incurring transportation costs prior
to custody transfer points. The transportation expenses are dependent upon third party rates and
the distance the product travels prior to changing ownership or custody.

PENGROWTH Second Quarter 2015 Management's Discussion
and Analysis
19
Pengrowth realized a weighted average operating netback of $23.98/boe in the second quarter of
2015 representing a 5 percent decrease compared to the first quarter of 2015 mostly driven by
higher operating expenses which incorporated the second quarter turnaround costs.
The second quarter of 2015 operating netback remained relatively unchanged compared to the
same period last year as realized commodity risk management gains, lower royalties and
operating expenses mitigated the impact of steep declines in commodity prices.
The year to date 2015 operating netback only decreased 8 percent compared to the same period
last year as the significant decline in commodity prices in the first six months of 2015 was largely
mitigated by the realized commodity risk management gains, lower royalties and operating
expenses.
Pengrowth's second quarter of 2015 heavy oil netback increased 130 percent compared to the
first quarter of 2015 due to the increase in the heavy oil sales price and inclusion of the
Lindbergh Phase 1 which has lower royalties and operating expenses. Lindbergh operating
netback was $31.17/bbl for the second quarter of 2015.

Phantom Deferred Share Units ("Phantom DSUs") annual grant to Directors, partly offset by
severance costs incurred. Second quarter of 2015 cash G&A expenses increased $2.7 million or
$0.39/boe compared to the same period last year mainly due to second quarter of 2015
severance costs and lower recoveries.
Year to date 2015 cash G&A expenses were $4.5 million or $0.47/boe higher compared to the
same period last year due to lower recoveries and higher professional and severance costs.
The non-cash component of G&A represents the compensation expenses associated with
Pengrowth’s Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP"). See Note 8 to the unaudited Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information. The compensation costs associated with this
plan are expensed over the applicable vesting periods.
Year to date and second quarter 2015 non-cash G&A expenses remained relatively unchanged
compared to the applicable comparative periods.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, $5.9 million (June 30, 2014 - $8.0 million) of directly
attributable G&A costs were capitalized to Property, Plant and Equipment ("PP&E").

Second quarter and year to date 2015 DD&A expense decreased $14.0 million or $2.16/boe and
$31.2 million or $1.67/boe compared to the same periods last year, respectively, due to lower net
book values resulting from the fourth quarter of 2014 PP&E impairment charges, combined with
the absence of depletion related to several minor 2014 and 2015 property dispositions.
Second quarter of 2015 ARO accretion expense remained relatively unchanged compared to the
first quarter of 2015. Second quarter and year to date 2015 accretion expense decreased $0.6
million and $1.1 million compared to the same periods last year, respectively, resulting primarily
from lower discount rates.

Total interest and financing
charges
At June 30, 2015, Pengrowth had approximately $2.0 billion in total debt before working capital
composed of $1.6 billion of fixed rate debt, $0.3 billion of credit facilities borrowings and $0.1
billion in convertible debentures. Total fixed rate debt consists primarily of U.S. dollar
denominated fixed rate notes at a weighted average interest rate of 5.8 percent. The credit
facilities had an average 3.4 percent interest rate and the convertible debentures have a 6.25
percent coupon.
Second quarter of 2015 interest and financing charges, before capitalized interest, decreased
$1.7 million compared to the first quarter of 2015 as the first quarter of 2015 interest expense
included certain term credit facility renewal charges. Also contributing to the decrease was lower
interest expense on U.S. term debt resulting from a repayment of a portion of the term debt which
matured at the beginning of May 2015.
Second quarter and year to date 2015 interest and financing charges, before capitalized interest,
increased $2.3 million and $6.5 million compared to the same periods in 2014, respectively. The
increase was due to the additional interest incurred from borrowings on the credit facilities in
2015 and higher interest expense on U.S. term debt resulting from the weakening of the
Canadian Dollar. This was partly offset by the absence of interest pertaining to a convertible
debenture repaid in December 2014.
Following commercial declaration of the project on April 1, 2015, Pengrowth ceased capitalizing
interest on the Lindbergh Phase 1 project. In accordance with IFRS, interest is capitalized for
qualifying assets in the construction phase based on costs incurred on the project and the
average cost of borrowing. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, $11.0 million (June 30,
2014 - $12.3 million) of interest was capitalized on the Lindbergh project to PP&E using a
capitalization rate of 5.4 percent (June 30, 2014 - 5.7 percent).
TAXES
Deferred income tax is a non-cash item relating to temporary differences between the accounting
and tax basis of Pengrowth’s assets and liabilities and has no immediate impact on Pengrowth’s
cash flows. Pengrowth recorded a deferred tax recovery of $30.9 million in the second quarter of
2015 compared to deferred tax recoveries of $4.9 million and $4.8 million in the first quarter of
2015 and second quarter of 2014, respectively. Year to date 2015 deferred tax recovery
amounted to $35.8 million compared to $38.6 million in 2014.
No current income taxes were paid by Pengrowth in 2015 or 2014. See Note 6 to the unaudited
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Approximately 70 percent of Pengrowth’s total debt before working capital is denominated in
U.S. dollars causing reported debt balances to fluctuate with changes in the value of the
Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. The majority of Pengrowth’s unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses are attributable to the translation of this debt and the related foreign
exchange swap contracts Pengrowth employs to manage this risk.
The gains or losses on principal restatement are calculated by comparing the translated
Canadian dollar balance of foreign currency denominated long term debt from one period to
another. The magnitude of the gains and losses is proportionate to the magnitude of the
exchange rate fluctuation between the opening and closing rates for the respective periods and
the amount of debt denominated in a foreign currency.
Pengrowth holds a series of swap contracts which were transacted in order to fix the foreign
exchange rate on a portion of Pengrowth’s U.S. dollar denominated term debt. The swaps
partially offset foreign exchange gains/losses on U.S. dollar denominated debt. Each swap
requires Pengrowth to buy U.S. dollars at a predetermined rate and time, based upon maturity
dates of the U.S. dollar term debt.
During the first quarter of 2015, Pengrowth monetized all of its U.S. swap contracts that fixed the
foreign exchange rate on Pengrowth’s U.S. dollar denominated term debt, except for contracts
related to the May 2015 term debt settlement. This resulted in a Cdn$84.1 million realized foreign
exchange gain in the first quarter of 2015 and the cash proceeds were used to pay down a
portion of the credit facilities. Subsequent to the monetization, U.S.$400 million of new foreign
exchange swap contracts were entered into. The foreign exchange swap contracts associated
with the May 2015 term debt series settled in tandem with its maturity, resulting in a Cdn$9.8
million realized foreign exchange gain in the second quarter of 2015. Together, these
transactions brought year to date 2015 realized foreign exchange gains from settlement of swap
contracts to Cdn$93.9 million.
At June 30, 2015, Pengrowth held a total of U.S.$420 million in foreign exchange swap contracts
compared to U.S.$460 million at December 31, 2014.

foreign exchange (gain) loss.
Approximately 6 percent of Pengrowth’s total debt before working capital is denominated in U.K.
pound sterling causing reported debt balances to fluctuate with changes in the value of the
Canadian dollar relative to the U.K. pound sterling. To mitigate these fluctuations, Pengrowth
entered into foreign exchange risk management contracts when it issued the U.K. pound sterling
term notes. These contracts fix the Canadian dollar to the U.K. pound sterling exchange rate on
the interest and principal of the U.K. pound sterling denominated debt as follows:

At June 30, 2015, the fair value of these foreign exchange derivative contracts was a net asset of

value of these contracts between Balance Sheet dates are reported on the Consolidated
Statements of Income (Loss) as an unrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss.
At June 30, 2015, each Cdn$0.01 exchange rate change would result in approximately a $4.2
million pre-tax change in the fair value of the U.S. risk management contracts and a $0.7 million
pre-tax change in the fair value of the U.K. risk management contracts.
ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS - NET PRESENT VALUE
At June 30, 2015, Pengrowth's ARO liability decreased $6.8 million compared to December 31,
2014. This was primarily due to minor property dispositions in 2015. Pengrowth has estimated
the net present value of its total ARO to be $774.0 million as at June 30, 2015 (December 31,
2014 – $780.8 million), based on a total escalated future liability of $2.0 billion (December 31,
2014 – $2.0 billion). The majority of the costs are expected to be incurred between 2038 and
2079. A risk free discount rate of 2.3 percent per annum and an ARO specific inflation rate of 1.5
percent were used to calculate the net present value of the ARO at June 30, 2015.

WORKING CAPITAL
Working capital (surplus) deficiency is calculated as current liabilities less current assets per the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, excluding bank indebtedness and the current portions of long
term debt and convertible debentures, as applicable.
At June 30, 2015, Pengrowth had a working capital surplus of $36.0 million compared to a
working capital surplus of $33.4 million at December 31, 2014.
The June 30, 2015 working capital surplus of $36.0 million compares to a deficiency of $194.6
million at June 30, 2014 mainly driven by an increase in the fair value of risk management
contracts current asset at June 30, 2015.

FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
At June 30, 2015, approximately 70 percent of Pengrowth’s total debt before working capital is

During the first six months of 2015, Pengrowth realized $93.9 million of foreign exchange gains.
These gains resulted from monetizing swap contracts that fixed the foreign exchange rate on a
portion of its U.S. dollar senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of 2015, and gains from the
expiration of swaps relating to the May 2015 term debt maturity.
The May 2015 senior unsecured notes maturity of U.S.$71.5 million (Cdn$86.6 million) was
financed through the credit facilities, representing the majority of the increased drawings on the
credit facilities. The cash proceeds from the realized foreign exchange gains were used to pay
down the credit facilities; however, this was offset by the decrease in accounts payable since
December 31, 2014. In addition to the increased drawings on the credit facilities the depreciation
of the Canadian dollar has caused the June 30, 2015 total reported debt balance to grow by
Cdn$129.6 million from December 31, 2014 and Cdn$114.7 million from June 30, 2014.
PENGROWTH Second Quarter 2015 Management's Discussion
and Analysis
24
The trailing twelve months total debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 3.0 times at June 30,
2015, compared to 3.2 times at December 31, 2014 mostly due to higher Adjusted EBITDA,
favourably impacted by $93.9 million of realized foreign exchange gains, partly offset by the
increase in total debt. The trailing twelve months total debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio remained
unchanged at 3.0 times at June 30, 2015 compared to June 30, 2014 as the $93.9 million of
realized foreign exchange gains mitigated the increase in debt.
Credit Facilities
Pengrowth maintains a $1 billion extendible revolving term credit facility which had an
outstanding balance of $280.0 million at June 30, 2015 (December 31, 2014 - $191.0 million)
and $21.8 million (December 31, 2014 - $25.0 million) in outstanding letters of credit. The credit
facility includes an expansion feature of $250 million providing Pengrowth with up to $1.25 billion
of notional credit capacity from a syndicate of seven Canadian and four foreign banks, and can
be extended at Pengrowth’s discretion any time prior to maturity, subject to syndicate approval.
The facility was renewed on March 30, 2015 and has a maturity date of March 30, 2019 with
covenants substantially matching those set out in the senior unsecured notes.
Pengrowth also maintains a $50 million demand operating facility with one Canadian bank. At
June 30, 2015, this facility had a balance of $25.0 million (December 31, 2014 - $9.0 million) and
$1.0 million (December 31, 2014 - $0.9 million) of outstanding letters of credit. When utilized
together with any overdraft amounts, this facility appears on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
a current liability in bank indebtedness, as applicable.
Together, these two facilities provided Pengrowth with approximately $720 million of combined
notional credit capacity at June 30, 2015, with the ability to expand the facilities by an additional
$250 million. Use of the remaining credit capacity is still subject to compliance with all financial
covenants and could require increased cash flow to support any increase in debt.
Financial Covenants
Pengrowth’s senior unsecured notes and credit facilities are subject to a number of covenants, all
of which were met at all times during the preceding twelve months, and at June 30, 2015.
As mentioned above, Pengrowth amended its term credit facility on March 30, 2015 to include a
maximum permitted senior debt before working capital to EBITDA (as calculated in accordance
with the debt agreements) ratio of 3.5 times, now substantially matching that set out in its senior
unsecured notes, and the total debt before working capital to EBITDA ratio of 4.0 times. As at
June 30, 2015, Pengrowth's actual ratios pursuant to these two covenants were at 2.9 times and
3.2 times, respectively.
All loan agreements can be found on SEDAR at www.sedar.com filed under "Other" or "Material
Document" and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov.
The calculation for each financial covenant is based on specific definitions, is not in accordance
with IFRS, is similar to Adjusted EBITDA, and cannot be readily replicated by referring to
Pengrowth’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
The key financial covenants as at June 30, 2015 are summarized below:
1.Total senior debt before working capital must not exceed 3.5 times EBITDA for the last four
fiscal quarters;
2.Total debt before working capital must not exceed 4.0 times EBITDA for the last four fiscal
quarters;
3.Total senior debt before working capital must be less than 50 percent of total book
capitalization; and
4.EBITDA must not be less than four times interest expense for the last four fiscal quarters.
Failing a financial covenant may result in one or more of Pengrowth’s loans being in default. In
certain circumstances, being in default of one loan will, absent a cure, result in other loans also
being in default. In the event that non-compliance continued, Pengrowth would have to repay,
refinance or re-negotiate the terms and conditions of the debt and may have to suspend
dividends to shareholders.
If certain financial ratios reach or exceed certain levels, management may consider steps to
improve these ratios. These steps may include, but are not limited to property dispositions,
reducing capital expenditures or dividends as well as issuing equity.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan
Pengrowth's DRIP allows shareholders to reinvest cash dividends in additional shares of the
Corporation. Under the DRIP, the shares are issued from treasury at a 5 percent discount to the
weighted average closing price of Pengrowth’s common shares as determined by the plan.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, 4.1 million shares were issued under the DRIP
program for cash proceeds of $14.6 million compared to 3.8 million shares issued for total
proceeds of $26.4 million for the same period in 2014.
Off-Balance Sheet Financing
Pengrowth does not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Pengrowth uses financial instruments to manage its exposure to commodity and power price
fluctuations and foreign currency exposure. Pengrowth’s policy is not to utilize financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. See Note 2 to the December 31, 2014 audited
Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the accounting policies for financial
instruments and Note 11 to the June 30, 2015 unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding the fair value of Pengrowth’s financial instruments.

As a result of the depleting nature of Pengrowth's oil and gas assets, capital expenditures are
required to offset production declines while other capital is required to maintain facilities, acquire
prospective lands and prepare future projects. Capital spending and acquisitions may be funded
by the excess of funds flow from operations less dividends declared, through the sale of existing
properties, additional debt or the issuance of equity. Pengrowth does not deduct capital
expenditures when calculating funds flow from operations.

Funds flow from operations is derived from producing and selling oil, natural gas and related
products and is therefore highly dependent on commodity prices. Pengrowth enters into forward
commodity risk management contracts to mitigate price volatility and to provide a measure of
stability to monthly cash flow. Details of commodity risk management contracts are contained in
Note 11 to the June 30, 2015 unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.

DIVIDENDS
Pengrowth’s Board of Directors and management regularly review the level of dividends.
Pengrowth’s Board considers a number of factors, including expectations of future commodity
prices, capital expenditure requirements and the availability of debt and equity capital. Dividends
can and may fluctuate in the future as a result of the volatility in commodity prices, changes in
production levels and capital expenditure requirements. Pengrowth has no restrictions on the
payment of its dividends other than maintaining its financial covenants in its borrowings and
restrictions in the Business Corporations Act (Alberta).
Dividends are generally paid to shareholders on the fifteenth day or next business day of the
month. Pengrowth paid $0.04 per share in January and February of 2015 and $0.02 per share in
March through June 2015 for an aggregate cash dividend of $0.16 per share for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. For the same period in 2014, Pengrowth paid $0.04 per share in each of
the months January through June for an aggregate cash dividend of $0.24 per share.

Second quarter of 2015 average sales price increased compared to the first quarter of 2015, but
remained lower than preceding quarters in 2014 and 2013, as per the table above, mostly driven
by a steep decline in the oil benchmark prices in 2015. In contrast, the first and second quarters
of 2014 average sales prices were the highest posted average prices since the fourth quarter of
2008 driven by an increase in the benchmark prices at that time.
First and second quarters of 2015 funds flow from operations exclude $84.1 million and $9.8
million, respectively, related to the settlement of foreign exchange swap contracts.
PENGROWTH Second Quarter 2015 Management's Discussion
and Analysis
28
Although 2015 average sales prices have declined significantly driven by a steep decline in the
oil benchmark prices, operating netbacks and funds flow from operations in the first and second
quarters of 2015 remained strong primarily due to realized commodity risk management gains in
2015.
Second quarter of 2015 production was the highest quarterly production since the first quarter of
2014 resulting from inclusion of the Lindbergh Phase 1 production. First quarter of 2015
production was lower compared to the preceding quarters of 2014 and 2013 primarily due to
property dispositions, lower natural gas production resulting from natural declines and capital
spending curtailments in the current low commodity price environment.
Quarterly net income (loss) has also been affected by non-cash charges, in particular depletion,
depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, unrealized gain (loss) on investments,
accretion of ARO, unrealized risk management gains (losses), unrealized foreign exchange
gains (losses), gains (losses) on property divestments, and deferred taxes. Funds flow from
operations was also impacted by changes in royalty expense, operating and G&A costs.
As a result of the $84.1 million realized foreign exchange gain from monetizing several
U.S./Canadian dollar swap contracts, the first quarter of 2015 contained Pengrowth's highest
adjusted net income since the first quarter of 2011.
BUSINESS RISKS
Pengrowth is exposed to normal market risks inherent in the oil and natural gas business, the
details of which are set out in the AIF of the Corporation dated February 26, 2015 available on
SEDAR at www.sedar.com and EDGAR at www.sec.gov.
DISCLOSURE AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
As a Canadian reporting issuer with securities listed on both the TSX and the NYSE, Pengrowth
is required to comply with Multilateral Instrument 52-109 - Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’
Annual and Interim Filings, as well as the Sarbanes Oxley Act ("SOX") enacted in the United
States.
At the end of the interim period ended June 30, 2015, Pengrowth did not have any material
weakness relating to design of its internal control over financial reporting. Pengrowth has not
limited the scope of its design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting to exclude controls, policies and procedures of (i) a proportionately
consolidated entity in which Pengrowth has an interest; (ii) a variable interest entity in which
Pengrowth has an interest; or (iii) a business that Pengrowth acquired not more than 365 days
before June 30, 2015 and summary financial information about these items has been
proportionately consolidated or consolidated in Pengrowth's Consolidated Financial Statements.
During the interim period ended June 30, 2015, no change occurred to Pengrowth's internal
control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, Pengrowth's internal control over financial reporting.
It should be noted that while Pengrowth’s Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial
Officer ("CFO") believe that Pengrowth’s disclosure controls and procedures provide a
reasonable level of assurance that they are effective, they do not expect that Pengrowth’s
disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all
errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Pengrowth’s unsecured covenant based term credit facility includes a committed value of $1
billion and a $250 million expansion feature, providing $1.25 billion of notional credit capacity
from a syndicate of seven Canadian and four foreign banks. The facility can be extended at
Pengrowth’s discretion any time prior to maturity, subject to syndicate approval. In the event that
the lenders do not agree to a renewal, the outstanding balance is due upon maturity. The facility
was renewed on March 30, 2015 and has a maturity date of March 30, 2019.
This facility carries floating interest rates that are expected to range between 1.6 percent and
3.25 percent over bankers’ acceptance rates, depending on Pengrowth’s ratio of senior debt to
earnings before interest, taxes and non-cash items. At June 30, 2015, the available facility was
reduced by drawings of $280.0 million (December 31, 2014 – $191.0 million) and letters of credit
in the amount of $21.8 million (December 31, 2014 – $25.0 million) were outstanding.
BANK INDEBTEDNESS
Pengrowth also maintains a $50 million demand operating facility with one Canadian bank. At
June 30, 2015, this facility was reduced by drawings of $25.0 million (December 31, 2014 – $9.0
million) and reduced by $1.0 million of outstanding letters of credit (December 31, 2014 – $0.9
million). When utilized together with any overdraft amounts, this facility appears on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as a current liability in bank indebtedness, as applicable.
FINANCIAL COVENANTS
Pengrowth’s senior unsecured notes and credit facilities are subject to a number of covenants, all
of which were met at all times during the preceding twelve months, and at June 30, 2015. The
covenants are substantially similar between the credit facilities and the senior unsecured notes.

(December 31, 2014 - 133,621 units) with a corresponding liability of $1.2 million (December 31,
2014 - $0.5 million). For the six months ended June 30, 2015, Pengrowth recorded a $0.7 million
compensation expense related to the Phantom DSUs (June 30, 2014 - $0.9 million). Each
Phantom DSU entitles the holder to a cash payment equivalent to the value of a number of
Common Shares (including deemed dividends) to be paid upon the individual ceasing to be a
Director for any reason.

During the first quarter of 2015, Pengrowth monetized all of its U.S. swap contracts that fixed the
foreign exchange rate on Pengrowth’s U.S. dollar denominated term debt, except for contracts
related to the May 2015 term debt settlement. This resulted in a Cdn$84.1 million realized foreign
exchange gain in the first quarter of 2015 and the cash proceeds were used to pay down a
portion of the credit facilities. Subsequent to the monetization, U.S.$400 million of new foreign
exchange swap contracts were entered into. The foreign exchange swap contracts associated
with the May 2015 term debt series settled in tandem with its maturity, resulting in a Cdn$9.8
million realized foreign exchange gain in the second quarter of 2015. Together, these
transactions brought year to date 2015 realized foreign exchange gains from settlement of swap
contracts to Cdn$93.9 million. At June 30, 2015, Pengrowth held a total of U.S.$420 million in
foreign exchange swap contracts compared to U.S.$460 million at December 31, 2014.

As at June 30, 2015, Pengrowth had approximately $1.8 billion of current and non-current long
term debt outstanding (December 31, 2014 - $1.7 billion) of which $280.0 million was based on
floating interest rates (December 31, 2014 - $191.0 million). A 1 percent increase in interest rates
would increase pre-tax interest expense by approximately $1.4 million for the six months ended

FAIR VALUE
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, bank
indebtedness and dividends payable approximate their carrying amount due to the short-term
nature of those instruments. The fair value of the Canadian dollar term credit facility is equal to its
carrying amount as the facility bears interest at floating rates and credit spreads within the facility
are indicative of market rates. The fair value of the remediation trust funds are equal to their
carrying amount as these assets are carried at their estimated fair value. The following tables
provide fair value measurement information for financial assets and liabilities.
